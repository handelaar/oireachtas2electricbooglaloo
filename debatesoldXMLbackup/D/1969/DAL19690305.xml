      <P>Particulars of the education received by unemployed persons are not available from the current Live Register statistics.  Information on this subject is, however, available from the 1966 Census of Population when all persons who had ceased their full-time education were asked to indicate each type of school, college, et cetera, attended full-time. I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the numbers of males and females who were described as unemployed at the time of the Census, classified by highest type of educational establishment attended and also the figures expressed as percentages of the total numbers gainfully occupied in the same categories.  It should be particularly noted that the figures relate to type of educational establishment attended regardless of whether or not the persons concerned completed their courses or obtained qualifications.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>PERSONS stated to be out of work at the 1966 Census <i>(a)</i> classified by highest type of educational establishment attended full-time and <i>(b)</i> expressed as percentages of the total numbers gainfully occupied.</P>

The total inflow, which covers income of all Irish residents&mdash;both persons and companies&mdash;from investments abroad and extern profits&mdash;including the foreign investment income of the Central Bank and certain other banking transactions &mdash;was £44.2 million in 1965, £44.9 million in 1966, and £45.1 million in 1967.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave, Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Ryan</b> asked the Minister for External Affairs if the Government have considered further whether any action can be taken by this country towards achieving a ceasefire in Nigeria and Biafra; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated on many previous occasions in the Dáil, it is the <Col N="2209" /> policy of the Government to do everything within the capacity of a small country to promote a stable peace settlement in the Nigerian conflict.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware the Organisation of African Unity is actively engaged in mediation and has succeeded on a few occasions in bringing the Federal Government and the secessionist authorities to the conference table but so far without success.</P>
      <P>The most effective action we can take is to size every opportunity open to us to urge negotiations for a stable peace and speedy end to the disastrous conflict and the sufferings and death which it entails particularly for the children and the aged in the war zone. And this we will continue to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating what has been done I should like to ask if the Minister or the Government have considered at all separate approaches to the United States Government or the British Government in order to seek their co-operation in arranging a ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We know already from published statements by both the American and British Governments that they are doing what they can to promote peace.  It is not necessary for us to ask them to embark upon it because they are already engaged on it and have been for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister further considered any question of a direct approach on our behalf to the Nigerian Federal Government and the Biafran authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen representatives of both and, as I have said in answer to the question, I have urged them as strongly as I could to engage upon negotiation for a stable peace in the interest of all the people of Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is no doubt aware, there have been Canadian, United States and British Parliamentary delegations in Nigeria and Biafra endeavouring to achieve peace.  Does he still rule out the idea of an Irish Parliamentary delegation making an attempt at doing <Col N="2210" /> what other countries have failed to do, in the light of the fact that Irish nationals, missionaries and others have been closely associated with conditions in Nigeria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Canadian nor the American Parliamentary Mission, unfortunately, were able to make peace, and I do not think a Parliamentary delegation from here would succeed either.  It is not want of peace-makers that exists; it is want of a will to make an agreed arrangement for a stable peace and immediately an arrangement whereby the maximum amount of food can be got in to the children and aged people in the war zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we would be likely to have more influence in that country than any other nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he proposes to publish an annual list of names of persons and the amounts paid to each in respect of those who applied for and received grants from Bord Fáilte for hotel building, improvement and reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The giving of financial assistance for the development of hotel accommodation is one of the statutory functions of Bord Fáilte Éireann and the schemes of grants are financed by the Board from moneys voted annually by the Dáil in the form of a grant-in-aid in my Department's Vote.  The main conditions governing the grant schemes, including the maxima applicable to the various forms of development, are subject to my approval and the approval of the Minister for Finance but the implementation of the schemes has been entrusted to Bord Fáilte whose administration of it is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is the Board's responsibility to determine in the light of the approved conditions the amount of grant payable in the case of each development.  In dealing with applications each individual case is treated on its merits; the Board take account of the type and price level of the accommodation proposed, the amount of accommodation already available, the market needs, the location of the development, the amount of off-season business available and other relevant factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial proportion of Irish hotels are small in size and are owned by individuals, families or small <Col N="2212" /> private companies and these people expect that their dealings with Bord Fáilte, particularly about their financial affairs, will receive confidential treatment. Bord Fáilte consider that publication of details of individual grants would tend to inhibit investment in hotel development.  In view of the importance of maintaining the rate of investment in hotels to cater for the expected growth of tourist traffic, I feel that the adoption of the Deputy's suggestion would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious in denying the right of the duly elected Members of this House to the information sought in this question? Does he agree that particulars of the disbursement of £900,000 under this heading in the current year should be kept from Members of this House and does he assert that we must give a blank cheque as we have done in the current year for £900,000 and have no details available to Members of the House?  Is that the evidence we have from the Minister of his democracy in dealing with the affairs of his Department? I should like to know that first and I have a number of other questions when the Minister has answered that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Members of the House have before them the leaflet describing in full the variation in the grants and the general principles upon which Bord Fáilte base their grants. I myself have had very few complaints from any hotelier or any guesthouse keeper in the country that he was wrongly deprived of any particular grant.  The grants are given on a most complicated basis and if this information was made available in connection with the very numerous guesthouses and hotels receiving grants all over the country there would be claims and counter-claims and questions as to why a particular hotel did not get a larger grant and why a hotel got such a larger grant.  This is a system of delegated authority under which Bord Fáilte has acted for a number of years and, from what I recollect of all the debates in this House on the Estimate for my Department, although many matters have been raised and complaints made in regard to various services performed <Col N="2213" /> by various State bodies from time to time, I do not recall that there has been any sense of disquiet on the part of Members of the House at the manner in which these grants are given.</P>

      <P>I am not taking from them.  If you wish I shall wait for the Adjournment.  Will the Minister differentiate between the procedure applied as regards grants made available by the Industrial Development Authority and the former Foras Tionscal where the information is made available annually to the general public and what is made available by Bord Fáilte?  As a duly elected Member of the House, I disagree with the Minister's assertion that I and my colleagues are not entitled to details of the expenditure of this £900,000.  Is something shady happening?  Must some applicants, as has been alleged to me by people who are dissatisfied, join this organisation?  Must you pay £100 to Taca in order to qualify?  Will the Minister not agree that the only proper way is to let everybody see that justice is done by publishing the figures?  If we give £50,000, £70,000 or £80,000 to Mr. A down the country to develop his hotel from public funds taken from the taxpayers through the medium of taxation, in my opinion the taxpayer should know where the money is going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The scheduling of services and sales promotion policy are matters for the commercial discretion of the Board of Aer Lingus Teoranta.  I am satisfied that the company's services and sales policy are geared to the promotion of the maximum traffic on the company's services between Britain and Ireland including tourist traffic to Ireland.  The effect of the company's promotion is reflected in the growth of air tourist traffic.  In the five years ended 1967, the latest year for which figures are available, the Bord Fáilte estimates of tourists travelling from Great Britain to this country by air show an increase of 40 per cent, that is from 335,000 in 1963 to 469,000 in 1967.  These figures include tourists travelling by all cross-channel air services.</P>
      <P>I am assured by Aer Lingus that the recent international Air Tourist Association decision at Geneva on inclusive tour fares should not affect adversely the growth rate of their tourist traffic to this country.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the consideration at present being given at official level in Great Britain to the minimum cost of inclusive tours to which the Deputy refers.  When the outcome in this matter is known the implications for Irish tourism will be assessed.</P>

      <P>I have seen press reports of the statement to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The plans of the B &amp; I Company for the carriage of livestock over the next number of years were announced in November last as part of the company's comprehensive freight plan.  In accordance with these plans the company are prepared to provide a guaranteed weekly capacity of 6,000 head of cattle on the Dublin-Birkenhead route. This provision which is well in excess of current demand indicates the willingness of the company to facilitate the livestock trade.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the arrangements for the cross-channel transport of cattle are under continuous review by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the various interests concerned including the B &amp; I.</P>

They have made no decision and they have told me that they will not make a decision to deprive the people of Cork of the lairage until a final decision is made in regard to the whole of that development and the future of the cattle trade.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if CIE have any plans for introducing new rail links in and around Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have not at present any plans for introducing new rail links in and around Dublin.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to previous questions on 24th October, 1968, and 13th November, 1968, CIE are concerned to ensure that the suburban rail services are utilised as effectively as possible with a view to making the maximum contribution to the relief of road congestion in Dublin city.  The need for additional passenger rail facilities in the Dublin area is reviewed periodically by CIE and additional services are provided as necessary to meet demand.  Since last September seven new trains have been introduced on the Dublin suburban services, including trains linking the northern and south-eastern lines, and improved train connections between the north and south of the city will be ready by next summer.  A new station will be opened on the northern line at Kilbarrack later this year.</P>
      <P>CIE have recently commissioned a survey by an independent market research company to determine the feasibility of extending commuter services to the Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Cabra, Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas, which could be served from the existing railway network.  A survey is also being carried out of the potential for computer services on the main railway line between Dublin and Naas, Newbridge and Kildare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  In any plan of this kind CIE will have to have reports from Dublin Corporation as to how this development will fit in with the general growth of housing in the area.  For example, in the Malahide/ Coolock area there is a plan for the development of housing and that <Col N="2218" /> development might, under certain circumstances, lead to the opening of stations, or it might not, according to the development of the plan and, therefore, the CIE plan has to work in with that of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Electrical appliances are designed to operate at a particular voltage or over a stated range of voltage normally indicated on the appliance.  The voltage for electricity supply for domestic purposes in this country is 220 volts and domestic electrical appliances on sale here are normally designed to operate at 220 volts with in some cases a stated range of voltage going above or below 220.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate in general terms the extent of the voltage drop which will cause appliances to operate inefficiently; the tolerable voltage drop will vary for different appliances, some being more susceptible than others to voltage fluctuation.</P>

    <P>The ESB aim to maintain the voltage at 220 plus or minus six per cent.  I am, however, aware that in several parts of suburban Dublin, the ESB are at present finding it difficult to prevent voltage from falling, at times, below the lower limit due to abnormal growth in demand.

The work of issuing the licences is performed by my Department on an agency basis.  Cases which do not comply with the conditions are sent to the Department of Social Welfare and applicants are advised of their right of appeal to that Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 55 together, as they raise the same point.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increase of 7s 6d per week is being paid in full, without deduction of any kind, to the social welfare recipient.  The tax allowance of £60 granted to a taxpayer in respect of a dependent relative who is a social welfare recipient is an entirely separate question.</P>
      <P>The position prior to 1963 was that, if a dependent relative had an income not exceeding £120, the taxpayer maintaining him was granted a tax allowance of £60.  But if the dependent relative's income was even £1 above the £120 limit, the taxpayer lost the entire £60 tax allowance.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1963, relieved this position by providing that, if the dependent relative's income was more than £120 the tax allowance of £60 would be reduced by £1 for every £1 by which the dependent relative's income exceeded £120.  Thus, if the dependent relative's income were, say, £150, the tax allowance would be £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1967, raised the limit of the dependent relative's income from £120 to £140.  At present, <Col N="2240" /> therefore, if the income is, say, £180, a tax allowance of £20 is granted.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that, whereas the dependent relative's social welfare allowance is being increased by 7s 6d a week&mdash;or £19 10s 0d in a full year&mdash;there would not be a corresponding loss of £19 10s 0d to the taxpayer.  At most he would lose seven shillings in the £ on that amount, that is, £6 16s 6d a year or 2s 7d a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the latter part of the reply mean that the allowance is not in fact reduced by the amount of the excess&mdash;that is the excess above £140 income&mdash;for the dependent relative?  Is it not reduced only by 7s 6d in the £ of the excess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance is reduced pound for pound but that is only a loss of 7s in the £ to the taxpayer. The £60 is reduced pound for pound as the dependent relative's income exceeds the £140.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, in practice, where the £60 allowance was charged to the relative, in that category of case what has happened is that the social welfare increase is in fact being financed entirely by the relative who was formerly getting the £60 dependent relative allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not follow. Even if the £19 10s a year, equivalent to 7/6d a week were deductible from the taxpayer's £60 allowance he still only suffers loss at the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction only affects the taxpayer as to 7/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to take the two things together.  The social <Col N="2241" /> welfare recipient is entitled to an increase of 7/6d and he gets it.  A totally different set of circumstances relates to the taxpayer who maintains a dependent relative.  If the dependent relative has no income, the allowance is £60, and if he had an income of up to £140 the taxpayer still gets the full £60 allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding it for the moment on the basis of family income, if A is a taxpayer and B is an old age pensioner&mdash;a social welfare recipient who has got the increase&mdash;is it not a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate people involved.  In respect of one the State is prepared to undertake certain obligations, rightly, we would all agree.  In that case we are giving the 7/6d increase.  The other is a case of a person who is contributing to the Exchequer.  His position is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputies have in mind the rediscount rate of the Central Bank, I can give no advance information about any change.  The rate is normally fixed at monthly intervals by reference to the arrangements relating to public issues of Exchequer Bills.  The rediscount rate is continually under review by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>As regards the lending rates of the commercial banks, the position is that, since there is free movement of funds between Ireland and Britain and also a close link between the banking systems of the two countries, the levels of the lending rates of the Irish banks are related to the British levels.  Following the recent rise in the British bank rate, the rates of interest charged on advances by the Irish banks will be reviewed by the Irish Banks' Standing Committee which will take into account the views of the Central Bank.</P>

Sometimes when they have gone up we have gone up but not quite so much and following that very often when they come down we do not come down quite so much, but it is always decided in relation to our own best interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night I had been dealing with some of the points raised in interventions by Deputy Tully.  I should like now to give some comments on the speech of Deputy O'Leary, and I quote from column 1352, Volume 238 of the Official Report of 27th February, 1969:</P>
      <P>The most marvellously organised industrial relations system that the mind of man can devise, which may never yet have been seen in any country on the fact of the earth, if brought into legislation by this Government of reality in this year of 1969, could do nothing to banish industrial discord while 38 per cent of all industrial workers have a wage of less than £11 a week and 52 per cent of all industrial workers earn less than £13 per week ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> The point Deputy O'Leary was making was that basically speaking it is the low wages of the lowest paid workers which are at the root of industrial discord in this country, and I am afraid I rather upset the Deputies on the Labour benches when I pointed out to them that this was a matter which was already very much in the minds of the Government.  It had been the subject of a direct approach by the Minister to Congress with a proposal that the Government would be prepared to consider raising the rate of wages of the lowest paid workers on the undertaking by Congress that those who were next above that lowest rate would not seek for maintenance of the differential, so that this increase would not start a new wage round.  So far this matter is under consideration by Congress, but it was obvious last night that Deputy Tully, in particular, was insisting on the maintenance of the differential and on the maintenance of a proper differential for the workers in the craft unions.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to one of the basic flaws in Labour Party policy, in that the Labour Party and, in many cases, the trade unions, too, are maintaining a rigid class system which they do not wish to revise in any way.  At the same time, spokesmen such as Deputy O'Leary are shedding crocodile tears about those who are drawing very low wages but, quite clearly, he is not prepared to approve any system whereby the lot of the lowest paid can be improved unless everybody else goes up as well.  The view is that those who are lowest paid will damn well have to stay in that condition for all time.</P>
    <P>It is no use anybody increasing the wages of the £11 a week man to £13 if, as Deputy Briscoe has pointed out in his contribution to this debate, the £13 a week man insists on getting £15 5s. If that happens, the man who is getting £15 will look for £18 10s. and so the general chain reaction is set off and as a result the man who was badly off at £11 remains just as badly off at £13. No improvement is recorded and great damage is done to the economy by a general inflation which has benefited no one.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are every bit as much concerned about the <Col N="2251" /> lowest paid workers.  The only difference between us and the Labour Party is that we are prepared to do something about it; they are prepared only to pay lip service to the idea of helping out the lowest paid workers. We are prepared to try to level out this rigid class structure and bring up those who are in poor circumstances at the moment.  However, here we are dealing with one of the weaknesses of human nature, that at all levels a class system is being maintained and defended which goes right down to the itinerants. There are rigid class distinctions among itinerants and anyone who breaches these class barriers gets very short shrift.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am not the slightest bit impressed by Deputy O'Leary's suggestion that industrial unrest is due primarily to the wages of the lowest paid workers.  If he is in earnest about that he will do his best to influence Congress and his fellow trade unionists to agree to the Minister's proposal that those who are lowest paid may be brought higher up but those immediately above them will stay where they are.  At column 1354 of the same volume Deputy O'Leary stated:</P>
    <P>We have not brought out laws for any regulation of employers.  Nobody says how the members of the FUE are to vote, whether it will be by show of hands, whether they must all be in benefit and so on.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Leary there&mdash; not fully, but I do agree that there should be greater attention paid by the Minister to a greater disciplining not of FUE but of the mass of employers' organisations generally.  The matter of voting does not cause any trouble because usually they are individuals or people representing individual companies. The numbers are not so disproportionate and there should not be any great difficulty; in fact I think there never has been any difficulty between employer organisations on the question of voting procedures.  At the same time I hope the Minister will keep the question of employer organisations under review and ensure that steps are taken to encourage a greater sense of discipline and responsibility among <Col N="2252" /> them.  At column 1355 Deputy O'Leary says:</P>
    <P>In the context of an economy where so much economic power lies with a small group of people to so order economic justice as to give those who merely work for a living some justice, we do not have any better suggestion than that of unions negotiating with employers as at present.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputy O'Leary got that far and did not go on because he very nearly struck at the root, or one of the roots, of the problem which is now before us.  He referred briefly to unions negotiating with employers as at present.  The main weakness at present is that union executives, union negotiating teams are negotiating with employers but are not authorised to reach agreement.  It is quite impossible to have proper negotiations otherwise than between two plenipotentiaries. Much lip service is paid to the essentially democratic structure of the trade union movement.  To my mind this is not democracy at all; it is sheer anarchy.  This is what it has proved to be over the past few weeks.  Democracy exists where a number of people who are gathered together in a society, in a group, in a nation or whatever it may be, realise that they cannot, as individuals, or as a group, control their own affairs and so they come together, have an election and appoint an executive of some sort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to act for them in the matter and to report back at the end of the term of office and be judged on results.  Any negotiating team which, having reached agreement, must say: &ldquo;Now we shall go and ask somebody else&rdquo; has in fact been sabotaged from the very start.  It is impossible for those who have not been through the agony of negotiating, such as has been the case in the last few weeks, to have any conception at all of the real issues involved, and for them to take a spot vote as to whether they will accept or reject is completely irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What people must do, whether employers or employees, is to authorise <Col N="2253" /> a small group to negotiate a settlement: give them full power, or limited power, saying: &ldquo;Within those terms of reference we want you to negotiate a settlement and if you can reach agreement with the other side, draw up an agreement and we will stand over it&rdquo;.  That is the only way it can be done.  The present system of negotiation is not, as Deputy O'Leary suggests, unions negotiating with employers: it is <i>ad hoc</i> committees of unions with no responsibility and no authority carrying out negotiations which they cannot bring to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>What I suggest is no breach of democracy.  This is a fallacy which is being spread abroad and all over the western world at the moment that at all stages you must refer back.  Let us bring it down to the very simplest level. If you get a number of people forming a football club, all the members of the club do not run it.  They first appoint a committee, probably an administrative committee, to look after the collection of subscriptions, disbursement of funds, acquisition of grounds and equipment and so on.  Almost inevitably they will have a small selection committee to decide who will play on the first team and on the second team and so on.  Nobody in a football club will suggest that the selection of the first team should be subject to a general vote by all members because such a vote would produce chaos.  That is why they have a selection committee.  If it turns out at the end of the season that it has been a catastrophe and everybody feels that there was enough talent in the club to do better, they do not have that selection committee again.  It is as easy as that.  We must order all our affairs along the same lines.  It is fully democratic in that the ultimate control always reverts to the members when the annual meeting comes round and the officers are elected.</P>
    <P>I feel that the whole union structure needs amending because the security of tenure of trade union officials is hopeless.  You cannot expect a trade union official to be as ruthless as he will feel he should be when he knows that if he annoys sufficient people he will lose his job.  He is bound to be <Col N="2254" /> playing for votes to a very great extent. Several of them have confessed this to me saying: &ldquo;I know this is right but I cannot carry the members with me. Therefore, I must go with them, even though I am a trade union leader, and advise them to come out on strike.  I know that is what they want me to say and that is what I must say.&rdquo;  Leadership such as that is absolutely disastrous.  It is time the trade unions put their own house in order and gave the conditions of employment to their own officials which they expect other employers to give their employees.  The rates of wages paid to trade union officials are shameful.  The hours of work of these men are really a disgrace. They are dedicated men who work at a very low rate of remuneration all hours of the day and night with no security of office whatever.</P>
    <P>Trade unionists, and the members of the Labour Party in particular, are very quick to criticise employers on the question of conditions of employment. It is time they made sure that the conditions of employment of their own staff were given a very careful review. When they do get their own house in order it is up to them to come to the employers, in the case of a dispute or possible misunderstanding of some sort, or to send delegates to the employers and say: &ldquo;We are the delegates of our trade union.  We are authorised to reach agreement with you if we can do so. Our agreement will be signed and will be binding on the unions and on our members.&rdquo;  If we can do that we shall be taking another good long step forward. Quite clearly, this is something that cannot be achieved by legislation. This is up to the unions themselves.</P>
    <P>At column 1356 of the Official Report Deputy O'Leary referred very briefly to another matter which deserves very much more consideration.  He said:</P>
    <P>Added to this incomes bitterness there is the insecurity which many work people feel throughout the country at present.</P>
    <P>I agree with him completely.  This should be a top priority for consideration by employers and trade unions.  I feel that anyone who is in employment, <Col N="2255" /> after he has served a short but satisfactory period to show his suitability for the job, should be entitled to a formal contract of employment.  Without that there is always a feeling in the mind of any man or woman that he is looking over his shoulder and wondering if next Friday will be the last, will he get his cards or get a week's notice and know that he has only another week to work.  That is a situation that we cannot accept.  I should like to see some proposals from the employers and the trade unions on a standard form of employment contract so that every man, when taken on the staff of a company, whether large or small, would have something in writing setting out his rate of wages, his chances of wage increases, procedure for obtaining wage increases, his conditions of employment and, above all, the notice which will have to be given to him of termination of his employment.  The period at the moment is quite insufficient.  There should be some provision whereby full wages would be paid for at least a week, preferably a fortnight, after termination of employment to carry the employee over the period in which he is looking for work, because a man cannot go looking for a job during working hours and it is very hard to find a job after working hours.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the contract of employment providing for an increased period of notice after so many years service so that the period of notice each employer would have to give would increase every year the man continued in his employment until, after a reasonably long period, the employee would get up to six months notice.  It is only in this way that we can give a man any feeling of security.  I was disappointed that Deputy O'Leary just touched on this, and then ran away from it, because I am absolutely convinced, and considerable research into industrial relations has confirmed, that the main concern of employees is, in fact, security; wages are a comparatively minor matter.  I know wages cannot be overlooked, but the thing which worries people most is, &ldquo;Is my job safe?&rdquo;.  This is something with which I hope we will deal in another context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne does not appear to be <Col N="2256" /> in the same political Party as Deputy O'Leary.  Their views differ radically and it is very difficult, therefore, to get any idea as to what Labour Party policy really is.  Deputy Kyne is a very much older man than Deputy O'Leary. He is very much more experienced and, I think, very much more mature in his judgment.  Yet, he is a man who is in much closer touch with the world of today while Deputy O'Leary is still living in some Cloud-Cuckoo-Land of his own and prefers to dash off the old Labour <i>clichés</i> which went out of fashion in the early years of this century. I do not want to damn the Labour Party policy altogether.  Indeed, it is rather difficult to do that because it is very hard to know what they are up to. I do not want to stress the Cuban interlude.</P>

      <P>Not nearly so much trouble and worry as the Labour Party is suffering.  These things happen, but I am sure it is a grave source of embarrassment to the Labour Party that the new recruit should be so rapturously received.  Despite listening to the Labour Party one does not yet know what exactly the policy will be.  Deputy O'Leary pleaded here for increased State intervention in industry.  Deputy Kyne last night strongly supported the speech made by Deputy James Dillon. Deputy Dillon referred in particular to the fact that&mdash;he was speaking from his own experience&mdash;the risk of industrial unrest was very slight in family concerns and it was only in the larger and more impersonal concerns that communications broke down between employers and employees.  These sentiments, with which I agree, were echoed by Deputy Kyne, who said he was thoroughly behind them.  We have, then the free enterprise, small industry, conception of Deputy Dillon echoed by Deputy Kyne.  But in the Labour Party Outline Policy document we find at page 134 and the following pages continuous references to increased State intervention in industrial planning:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan will be implemented by a National Planning Authority invested <Col N="2257" /> with the full power of the State in the planned development and utilisation of the State.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of the page we find:</P>
    <P>A State Development Corporation will be set up with the direct responsibility for establishing and extending industries and for generally developing areas judged to have growth potential.  The Corporation will engage in expansion programmes through State-owned companies.</P>
    <P>Again, at page 139, subparagraph 4.2.7:</P>
    <P>The plan will express the strategy by setting down the type of industries to be established and the areas in which they will be located.  It will determine priorities.  In general the strategy will be to create complexes of large scale advanced technology projects based on the exploitation of native resources.</P>
    <P>In the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>The State will establish these industries of its own accord or cooperate with home or foreign firms....</P>
    <P>I wonder can we take that as Labour Party policy?  We just do not know.  It may be thrown into the ash can.  But, here we have what appears to be a philosophy by the Labour Party which would seem to suggest that they want more State enterprises.  At page 142, they suggest that further State industries should be set up and there should be further State participation in existing industries: &ldquo;This will relate to existing industry and can be achieved by buying in as a shareholder and exercising control and receiving profits.&rdquo;  I wonder is this the policy of the Labour Party?  Is that what they really want?  In this House they are continuously saying that the people who are worst off from the point of view of industrial relations are those horrors known as the ESB, CIE, the B &amp; I and so on.  These are the concerns who are always criticised for bad personnel management.  They cannot have it both ways.  One moment they say State control is the only solution to all our problems and the next moment they say State control has set up industries <Col N="2258" /> which are the very nadir so far as industrial relations are concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope that one of these days the Labour Party will make up their minds, nail their colours to the mast, and say: &ldquo;We are in favour of a complete policy of nationalisation.&rdquo;  They like flying kites.  They introduce Dr. Noel Browne on television and he drops a couple of clangers and they have to disown him. It is announced that he has accepted the title of Vice-President of the Labour Party but, when he starts wanting to nationalise Deputy Corish's pet firm of Pierce in Wexford, it is suddenly discovered that he is no longer Vice-President and is speaking on his own behalf only and did not mean it at all. Where are we going?</P>
    <P>There is a wing of the Labour Party which want nationalisation, State control, State planning and the State all the time and, yet, some of those people who are its keenest advocates, are the most bitter critics of the State industries already set up&mdash;even of the ESB for which Fine Gael take so much credit. I should like to see a little more clear thinking on this.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of the timing of the Bills.  We were asked: &ldquo;Why bring them in now?&rdquo; Even Deputy Corish suggested this was not the time, and that we should bring them in when peace and harmony were reigning.  The Minister had to ask when was that happy time, and would it ever happen.  Is it not obvious that the Trade Union Bill and the Industrial Relations Bill, both dated 1966, have been on the mat for a long time?  The Minister has not been dragging his feet.  He has been trying to negotiate and get the goodwill and co-operation of employers and trade unions.  Ultimately he has to admit that he has to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  In fact, I think he has &ldquo;gone it alone&rdquo; remarkably successfully.</P>
    <P>This is not the final answer.  This is a time when the Government are getting increasing criticism for not taking more resolute action.  I still cannot find anyone to tell me what action the Government could take.  It was said that we were wrong when we passed the ESB (Special Provisions) Bill, that that was a wicked and sinful thing to <Col N="2259" /> do.  What can we do about this crazy picketing of unions by unions?  Another one came on today.  A radio firm was picketed by one of the striking unions. Therefore, the radio men could not pass the picket, so what have they done?  They have put a picket on another company which is associated indirectly with the radio company and put 600 car assemblers out of a job.  I am glad to say I have nothing to do with that one.  How crazy can we get? Who is picketing whom and why?  In half the cases no one knows what the row is about.  Someone puts a picket on someone else and they put a picket on another company.  They seem to say: &ldquo;Who will we picket?&rdquo; and some luckless soul is picketed.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate against that.  We can only rely on there being a sudden realisation of the facts of life by the members of the trade unions&mdash;I do not say the trade unions themselves because I still believe very strongly that the trade union executive knows the weakness of the trade union structure, and knows the way out, but has not yet been able to swing its members in behind it.  That is why we have to approach the general members of the public and get it into their heads that this sort of crazy system is out entirely from now on, and that when industrial disputes do arise they have to be settled according to the rule of law and justice, and not the law of the jungle.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Donegan blamed the Government for introducing higher salaries for Dáil Deputies and Members of the Oireachtas generally. So far as I know Deputy Donegan has not refused the increase which was granted.  He had the opportunity of voting against it if he did not approve of it, but he failed to do so.  To blame the Government for this is the most damnable hypocrisy.  I was in on this from the start as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is holding a meeting at the moment at which I shall be present.  I want to make it quite clear and put it on record that it was the Labour Party delegates to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who first raised very strongly the necessity of having increased <Col N="2260" /> allowances for Deputies.  They made the point that it was the members of their Party who were particularly penalised by the existing rates of remuneration because, they said, their members had no alternative sources of income and were not able to do their job properly with the funds made available to them.</P>
    <P>No Government can take the initiative in this matter.  The Labour Party proposal was strongly supported by the Fine Gael Deputies representing their Party on that Committee.  A long discussion took place.  Representations had to be made to the Minister for Finance to try to convince him on this matter and they took a long period also.  The entire initiative came from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, which is right, because this is a matter which should be initiated by the Opposition rather than the Government. It is grossly unfair and very hypocritical of Deputy Donegan to suggest that this was a Government proposal which was forced through the House, more or less against his better judgement.  He knows perfectly well that it was accepted unanimously.  I make no apology for it.</P>
    <P>I believe in all cases that anyone in employment, whether as a Deputy or in any other employment, should be paid the rate for the job.  Most of our work is overtime.  In other employment there is danger money, wet money and dirty money.  We are paid inclusively of wet time, dirty time, overtime, lack of security, the lot.  I make no apology to anyone for supporting that measure.  I will not be hypocritical enough, having accepted it, to say I do not want it.  If Deputy Donegan would like to do as Mr. McBride did and refuse to accept it for a limited period I might be a little bit more impressed as to his sincerity. Even Mr. McBride changed his mind in the end and collected his arrears so far as I remember.  I do not think Deputy Donegan will refuse the increased allowance.</P>
    <P>I do not think for one moment that those increased allowances were in any sense an inflammatory feature of the present industrial situation as some newspaper correspondents tried to <Col N="2261" /> make them out to be.  In this upward adjustment of salaries we were dealing with the situation where amongst other things, we had the Taoiseach being paid £50 more than one of the senior officials of this House.  That situation was clearly in need of revision. A senior official of this House had only £50 less than the Taoiseach, and he had guaranteed service up to retiring age and a guaranteed pension on a very adequate scale.  None of that is open to any Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for the timing of these Bills.  I do not see any reason to do so.  I think public opinion generally is prepared to accept this as a first step along the road to a more stable structure of industrial relations.  Most of our troubles cannot be solved by legislation, but we have got to legislate against excesses and abuses which can take place and which, unfortunately, have taken place very recently. We must get away from anarchy and chaos and back to a system of law and order, back to a system where the trade union members will appoint fully authorised delegates to negotiate on their behalf and, when the negotiations are completed and finalised, the trade union members being loyal enough to their delegates to stand over that decision.</P>
    <P>This business of referring everything back is absolutely useless.  I look forward to the Committee Stage when we can probably tidy up a number of drafting matters.  Above all, let it be clearly understood that this is not repressive legislation in any way.  It is permissive legislation.  It is legislation to permit the ordinary working man to make his wished known in a more democratic and effective way.  It is protective legislation.  It is an effort to protect men from being put out of jobs by disputes in which they are not concerned. It is protective also of the wives and families of wage earners who at present are so severely being penalised by reason of this internecine struggle within various trade unions&mdash;this struggle of the maintenance of a rigid class system.</P>
    <P>If we really believe in social justice, let us get down to those sectors which need our attention most.  I agree we <Col N="2262" /> want to raise the income level of the lowest paid worker.  Let us get the consent of the other wage earners so that they will not mind the £11 a week man getting nearer their wage.  The £13 a week man will not be any the poorer as a result.  Let us get it clearly established that when there is a reference to the Labour Court, every effort must be made to persuade the parties to declare, in advance, that they will accept the recommendation of the Labour Court. In that way, we can get settlement of disputes which will be far less costly to the individuals than the present system. Consider the horrible cost to trade union funds and to the pockets of individual strikers and of those who have been disemployed: this is the craziest waste of money.  None of that money and none of that production need have been lost.  Agreement had very nearly been reached&mdash;in fact, agreement at negotiation level had been reached&mdash; but a few people have thrown everything to the wind for the sake of another few bob.  If they could do that and penalise and prejudice not only themselves, that is bad enough, but when they penalise their fellow workers that is a situation we cannot tolerate.</P>
    <P>With full co-operation of both sides of industry, with a stronger trade union movement, more united under Congress, and with a stronger employers' organisation, more united under FUE or a centralised comprehensive employers' organisation, we can get advanced economic planning, co-operation and participation by both sides in government and make progress.  Without it, the prospect is bleak.</P>
    <P>I welcome these two Bills.  I do not think they are the final answer but they are a very positive step in the right direction.  I hope they will be passed with real enthusiasm.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the meanderings of Deputy Booth, it is very easy to understand why he spoke at length in a an attack on the Labour Party and why he made a personal attack on some of our members. He speaks from one side of the fence and looks from the same side of the fence: that is only to be expected.  We on the Labour Party benches are glad that this attack from a certain section <Col N="2263" /> which Deputy Booth represents has been forthcoming.  Nevertheless, it does not deter us nor our objectives, which are very simple.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth said that union offioials were often compelled to advise against their own opinions because of the loss of their jobs.  That is the most farcical suggestion ever made.  These union officials are permanent and pensionable. We agree with Deputy Booth that they are dedicated hard-working men, night and day, for seven days of the week and that they do more work at night and on Sundays than in the course of an ordinary day because of their dedication to their work and their anxiety to look after the worker who has been trampelled upon by the speculative director of companies.</P>
      <P>I want to dwell on the subject of the speculative director, the man who can put enough money into any business to keep that business alive without having an idea or a splink of knowledge of what it is all about or of how the workers are engaged or of what production means.  Deputy Booth should apply himself to some of these things.  If he had done so, he would have made a more comprehensive contribution to this debate rather than to talk about Deputy Michael O'Leary and Deputy Kyne.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak here today in no critical manner.  I come here to advise the Minister as a result of the experience I have gained in my long life both in public life and in industrial relations in the city of Limerick.  First, I would advise the Minister to accept the advice of Congress <Col N="2264" /> on this matter and defer this Bill until further negotiation has taken place with Congress.  While some sections may appear all right to us who are discussing the Bill here, nevertheless, we could find ourselves judged through the courts &mdash; certain actions could be taken through the courts which would nullify whatever is intended to be done by this Bill.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to have another chat with Congress on the matter. For the past couple of months they have been very much engaged in negotiations of one kind or another. I am sure they had not the time to devote to the details involved in this Bill when it is enacted.  I want to make my own personal views on this Bill available to the Minister.  I ask him to consider three or four points which I think should be included.  My first plea concerns recognition by any industrialist of trade union principles. They should clearly be explained and detailed to him or to them before they start any industry in this country.  The Minister is well aware of that.  Geographically, he is much closer to it but otherwise he is not.  I have in mind certain industrialists in the Shannon Industrial Area who have refused to negotiate with union officials, who have refused to allow employees to become members of a trade union and who have caused endless unrest with regard to security of employment in certain industries in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one industry or another, there is no recognition, good, bad or indifferent, of the Apprenticeship Board.  They take in junior operatives, give them a one, two or three-year course, be it in electrical work, engineering, welding or moulding, and they call them operatives. But any of those men engaged in those industries have to face the situation that their craft is not recognised by the Apprenticeship Board.  Therefore, those people cannot be employed in any other industry outside that to which they are attached.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  We have another industry there whose opening the Minister attended&mdash;I did not&mdash; where crash courses are given to people. This was a good thing in its way but <Col N="2265" /> when those people seek employment elsewhere later they will not be given par wages with their fellow workers in the same industry.  Only last week five of those boys left that industry and went to the Engineering Works in Dundalk.  They found that the rate of pay they were offered was so insignificant that they had to pack their bags and come home again.</P>
    <P>Where is the recognition there?  What is the Minister doing to rectify the situation?  They are the things which cause industrial unrest throughout the country.  I do not want to be critical. No one wants industrial unrest bar a few hotheads and it is easy to get rid of them.  I suggest there should be more house agreements and what I mean by a house agreement is an arrangement that will make workers happy in their job.  The FUE would have us try to legislate industrially for the whole country.  It is an impossibility.  If house agreements are made through which worker and management will come together&mdash;let it be once a week or once a fortnight&mdash;and where a programme is planned on what has been achieved in the past and what we hope to achieve in the future, on a productivity basis to keep ourselves viable, nobody will be found to give more co-operation than the worker.</P>
    <P>That is my experience in the city from which I come and I have been tied up with more disputes in that city during the past 20 or 15 years than anyone else and thanks be to God we settled all of them except one, which I shall come to later.  However, there are speculative directors who will not tolerate skilled, unskilled or clerical workers on the factory floor going to the manager's office or to the director's room to discuss problem.</P>
    <P>Every day we get out of bed we are faced with new problems, particularly in the changing world in which we live. Everything takes on a new look each day and we must be up with it or, perhaps, ahead of it.  For that reason, the Minister should insist on more co-operation between management and worker so that the workers will be allowed to have a say in the running of the business in which he is employed. This would give him a stake in <Col N="2266" /> the land and security in employment, which Deputy Booth was so anxious about some time ago.  I am wondering does Deputy Booth consult with his workers.  I am bloody well sure he does not.</P>

      <P>Let it be clearly understood that when you have workers happy in a job and when you have harmonious relations as between a union and management, you will get productivity, you will get rest and industrial peace.  As I have said, I have seen it operate in my city.  I have seen companies who have put workers on a productive basis, I have seen arrangements and agreements come to between workers and management, and let me put it on record, particularly for the FUE, that in respect of this industrial dispute we have a record in the city of Limerick in the matter of hours lost, less than any other city in the country. I advise the Minister to come to us and take a lesson from what is happening there.  He passes through three or four times a week and if he calls we will show him how things work there and treat him with our usual hospitality.</P>

      <P>On the question of State intervention, there are times when the State must intervene and take over.  However, nobody in his sane senses, nobody thinking realistically, would advocate general nationalisation. There are, though, times when nationalisation is imperative.  We have this very day, for instance, a concern which has monopoly control of a certain industry.  Management there have refused to meet the workers, despite the intervention of people in high places.  What is one's responsibility in this matter?  Surely to God no man in this land, without rhyme or reason, should be allowed to turn the key in his industry and lock the gate and throw 500 or 600 men out of employment? That is the situation and Cement Limited have done it.  I would advise the Minister to intervene.  I have <Col N="2267" /> discussed it in many places and with many people.  I know how it affects the workers of Limerick.  I know how it will affect industry generally within the next week or fortnight.  Let us lock the stable now before the horse is gone.  I appeal to the Minister at this stage to introduce legislation with the greatest alacrity and speed, he and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and see that the arrogance of this particular firm will be crushed out of Irish life and that no tolerance, good, bad or indifferent will be given to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth mentioned our criticism of semi-State bodies&mdash;the ESB, Bord na Móna and bodies like that.  He said we did not know what we wanted. We have been critical of these because of the fact that we think they are not doing their job fast enough for us, not because they are semi-State bodies. They are not giving the people the amenities which they are justly entitled to.  I speak particularly about rural electrification.  These are our criticisms &mdash;not because it is the ESB, not because it is semi-State, but because we feel they are not going fast enough. That is what we are justly entitled to do and not to let anybody, I do not care who he is, be allowed to sit on his backside and not do a thing from one end of the day to the other.  It is our business to see that they are doing their job and the day we do not do that will be a sad day for the people we represent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the location of industries, I am glad that we have now reached the stage when Limerick will be included in the industrial estate. However there is no use in having industries unless we have happy workers.  That brings me back to what I want to impress on the Minister in this Bill concerned with trade unionism generally and industrial relations.  The industrialist is most welcome, with open arms we will bring him in, but let us for God's sake not leave him under any misapprehension with regard to employment conditions.  We will make progress then and we will not have any industrial disputes or unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to conclude by appealing to the Minister, if he wants to put this Bill <Col N="2268" /> through with harmony from all sides&mdash; and I am sure that is what he wants because he is not a pugnacious or a brutal kind of individual in his approach, he wants peace as much as any of us&mdash;to take the advice of Congress at this late stage.  Renew again the discussions and the negotiations that went on.  There are certain things in this Bill and if they ever reach the courts we will find ourselves in trouble. That is what we want to avoid.  I know this and I am sure Congress knows it and for that reason they are asking for a postponement of the Bill.  We want to see peace everywhere but there will be no peace without security.  The only way you can have security in any employment is by having open-mindedness between management and worker, full co-operation and plans and programmes arranged for future developments and for past achievements and then with that kind of relationship which will exist when the cake is baked and properly iced, let us divide it between management and worker.  Then there will be peace in industry in the land and not alone will there be peace but there will be security for the worker and prosperity for everybody.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a short helpful contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the subjects that have come up for discussion in this House not alone this year because the discussions have been very limited this year but since the establishment of our native Government this is, in my opinion, the most important and the most serious topic with the most far reaching effects.  It is a very serious matter dealing with the whole trade union administration, the activities of trade unions, industrial relations, the necessity for greater co-operation between worker and management, in other words it is the drafting of suitable commandments which the worker and the employer will be expected to keep. I wonder is it possible for this or any Government to draft out a code of rules or regulations which could be and would be both workable and acceptable at the same time to employer and employee?  No matter how limited rules and regulations may be, it is extremely <Col N="2269" /> difficult to keep all of them very rigidly. In so far as Christianity itself is concerned we have the Ten Commandments as the code under which we live. How extremely difficult it is for us all to endeavour to any degree to keep the Ten Commandments.  How very difficult it would be for workers and for employers to keep rigidly to whatever code of rules or regulations may be laid down for the common good by legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is one of the most recently appointed Ministers. His Ministry is a newly set-up Department. It is my honest opinion that it is the most useless Department of State that has to date been set up because we have seen such little evidence of any practical workings from that Department.  It may be that the main activities of the Department of Labour are behind closed doors and that the general public do not realise the high pressure under which the Minister may be working.  That does not appear to be evident to the general public because whether there is activity or inactivity in certain other Departments of State, be it in Agriculture, Justice or Education, there appears to be some degree of activity, but the opinion of the general public is that the Department of Labour is the most inactive Department.  While the head of that Department is a Minister noted for his kindness, courtesy and his ability to meet people with the highest degree of friendship, there still appears to be a great lack of work in his Department.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for this House to debate the problem before us in a cool and calm atmosphere because of the present situation.  In recent years we have been jumping from crisis to crisis, from strike to strike, from lock-out to lock-out and from unreasonable demand to unreasonable demand. This is a state of affairs which cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.  It has caused great anxiety among workers and employers, to the Government and Opposition.  This is something which is not a plaything of any political Party; it is a serious national problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Government <Col N="2270" /> have chosen this time for a debate of this character; it would have been more useful this time 12 months.  Could it be possible that the Government, on the verge of a general election, are trying to convey to the public that they are taking some practical steps to deal with the whole question of industrial relations and towards solving the problem of our many trade unions?  If there are political motives behind the introduction of these Bills at this time that would not be in the best interests of the workers, employers or of the country. It might serve temporarily the political Party so responsible but in the long run this is a motive which will be overtaken in no uncertain way.</P>
    <P>The whole question is one for very serious thought and care in the calm atmosphere of Parliament.  Do we ever ask ourselves, has the Minister ever asked himself, what is the necessity for a trade union at all?  I cannot help thinking that we are now in a period in this country when we have reached full circle.  We can remember the conditions under which the masses and the workers lived in the opening years of the twentieth century.  No words of mine could describe these conditions. The workers of this country, skilled and unskilled, owe a great deal to their trade unions.  Not alone that, but they also owe a great deal to the memory of James Larkin, senior, and men like him who endeavoured at no small sacrifice to lift the workers of this country from what could only be described as sheer slavery, to a level of independence, to a level at which they can now be treated as human beings.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that there were numerous employers in this country&mdash; they may have been a legacy from the British time&mdash;who were not enthusiastic about giving fair play or justice to their Irish employees.  They had a tradition of looking on the worker as an inferior individual.  There was always a great appearance of division, a great gap of snobbery so that the employer looked down upon the labourer whether he was skilled or unskilled.  In the latter part of the nineteenth century and in the period from 1900 to 1920 the worker was looked upon as the servant and the employer was looked upon as <Col N="2271" /> the master.  In that time the worker had to doff his cap, bend his knee or lose his job.  He had an extreme feeling of insecurity.  That did not end at the 1920 period because I can remember that this state of affairs still existed when I started in public life.  I saw with my own eyes many injustices and a high degree of discourtesy meted out to the workers for no other reason than that they were workers and that anything was good enough for them.</P>
    <P>It was only through the trade union movement that these people banded themselves together in the hope of obtaining some security so that they could bring up their families in Christian decency.  I have seen employers in this country who singled out shop stewards, the spokesmen for the trade unions, to be the first to be dismissed whether it was on a building scheme or in some other concern employing labour.  If these employers did not dismiss the shop steward they had him transferred into some other employment under conditions which compelled him to leave himself.</P>
    <P>Then there were on the other side the injustices perpetrated by the worker against the employer, which in many instances were revolting: workers deliberately slowing down production, workers not doing a fair day's work for their employer.  It is clear that there was injustice on both sides, but the greatest degree of injustice, to my knowledge, was inflicted by ruthless employers against defenceless workers. That is why I often thank God we have seen the day in which there is a strong trade union movement.  However, there is a vast difference between a strong trade union movement and a responsible trade union movement.  The great fear I have is that its strength and growth will be eroded by irresponsibility. When one is dealing with the livelihoods of the organised masses there is a grave responsibility to ensure that action taken on their behalf is the result of calm and careful consideration and the exercise of the highest degree of responsibility.</P>
    <P>When I refer to employers who have displayed snobbishness towards workers, who have not treated their <Col N="2272" /> workers as they might, I refer to the days of what was commonly known on building sites as the &ldquo;billy can&rdquo;, where there was no shelter for workers to have a meal; they were working at the whim of a foreman.  If he liked the look of them he kept them on and if he did not he let them go, and there was nothing they could do about it.  All these workers were human beings with families and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The injustices that were inflicted on working-class people helped considerably to build up the trade union movement in this country.  The more unreasonable employers were the greater strength it gave the trade union movement, and that is as it should be.  When I speak of employers I do not mean individual employers of 40, 50 or 60 workers; I speak mostly of the State as an employer, the local authorities, the semi-State bodies who are far from having clean hands in the matter of dealing fairly with their employees. They are not behindhand in treating their employees in a high-handed and very coarse manner.  The State as an employer has the same responsibility to its workers as an individual employer.</P>
    <P>In many instances the worker feels that because his employer is the State he can justly do the State.  It has been said in the course of this debate that the trade unions are spending substantial sums of money on education, on lectures and bringing home to their members their responsibilities.  These people do not need a lecture from me on that.  Far from it, but any money the trade unions would spend in that direction would be money well spent. The workers have responsibilities to their employers but, above all, the employers have a responsibility to their workers.  I do not know of any State organisation&mdash;certainly any State organisation operating in my constituency &mdash;that exercises justice towards its workers.  In many cases where the local branch of the trade union would address inquiries to the management these inquiries would not be taken seriously.  When reasonable demands were made for improvements in working conditions in either a State or a semi-State organisation these requests were not met.  In these circumstances <Col N="2273" /> the workers were forced to go on strike. It was due to a lack of co-operation, to a display of snobbery.  The management did not want to talk to workers. The worker had no right to offer an opinion or advice.  A man in overalls and wellingtons should not have the impertinence to walk on to the office floor and tell the management what improvements there should be or should not be.  The sooner employers, whether they are State or semi-State or individual employers, realise that the day when man was slave of man is long past.  The animals in the jungle may turn treacherously on us, but there is no animal can be as tough on man as man himself.</P>
    <P>I have seen that on building sites in Birmingham, Coventry and outside London, which I have visited, and which I shall visit again next month, to see emigrants from my constituency. When you visit a group of workers and have a confidential chat with them they will tell you the toughest foreman they ever worked for was the Irishman who was put over them.  He would stand over them and make them do the work. Man has so little regard for his fellowman that he becomes over-influenced by the power that is vested in him when he is appointed as a manager, a foreman or a ganger, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>As a result of man's treatment of man we have been given a lot of food for thought.  The present Government or any incoming Government must realise that in 1969 we are dealing with a different element, one that has never before appeared.  We are dealing with masses of workers who will not allow snobbery to stand between them and their rights.  The worker is regarded as being as good as his master, and rightly so.  If the master is not prepared to sit down and talk with his employees it causes industrial strife and chaos.  Many strikes, past and present, could have been avoided if the snobbery were eliminated and nobody knows that better than the Minister for Labour. Naturally, the employer has a high opinion of his own importance and is only concerned with himself.  He wants nobody else's views and feels that nobody else has any right to discuss his <Col N="2274" /> business with him and that he should have the final say in it.</P>
    <P>Times are changing and employers whether State, local authority or individuals, if they want to get work done and cannot do it themselves and must employ somebody to do it, must talk to the heads commanding the hands of those who do the work.  May the day never return when workers will be treated as slaves.  I do not want to single out employers&mdash;far from it&mdash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not permit me to do it in any case&mdash;but in recent years we have had the experience of the bank officials' strike and we saw that the bankers were made to listen and see reason and the employer today, whether a bank or local authority or the Government or a private company, that is not prepared to sit down and talk with the employees will be taught a serious lesson.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see a strike that has done any good.  Certainly, every strike I have seen in the past quarter of a century left a bad taste or bad mark. Whatever were the results, whether satisfactory to the worker, or a giveand-take between workers and employers, the wives and families of the workers had to suffer.  Strike action should be the final resort and should be taken only when every other course has failed, including intervention by Ministers or by the Prime Minister, should it be necessary.  At all costs, the strike weapon should be left on the shelf. There has been some degree of understanding reached between workers and certain employers in recent years.  No matter what appeal the Minister or the Government may make in this regard this debate should serve as notice to every employer in the country to change his attitude and be prepared to sit down with the employees and a similar message should be taken from it by the organised workers as regards their responsibility to their employer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour may shrug his shoulders but he cannot shirk his responsibility in this regard because at present we find workers are suffering from a sense of grievance against the powers that be such as they have not experienced for a long time.  They work <Col N="2275" /> hard and find that the cost of living is allowed to soar, that each increase is no sooner granted than it is cancelled out by some action of the Government. The Government have taken no serious action to control living costs.  That is one of the main reasons why workers are so perturbed, so disillusioned and disappointed.  Perhaps, it is one reason why organised trade unions are availing of every opportunity to use as a lever the Government's inactivity in regard to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The whole problem has very grave economic consequences.  The management of every concern should be prepared to sit down with the workers and plan ahead.  Might I ask the Minister what encouragement there is for workers to work harder, to respond to the plea of the employer to work overtime so as to step up exports, for example, when for every hour of overtime worked the cold hand of the inspector of taxes falls upon the pay packet?  That is why some thousands of workers who could work overtime on certain occasions will not do it. They will not deprive themselves of an evening off for the amount that is left of their overtime pay when the Revenue Commissioners have taken what they must get out of it.  That has aroused the anger of some thousands of organised workers and that anger has not helped.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Labour Court furnishes an annual report of its activities.  The court has been the subject of great criticism from time to time. I believe the court has done that which the law enabled it to do and the officers of the court have done an excellent job of work under trying and difficult circumstances.  The fact that decisions of the Labour Court can be ignored would suggest that the hearing of evidence and the promulgation of findings on the part of the court constitutes so much useless activity and I have often wondered why, when the court was being established, its decisions were not made binding.</P>
    <P>There is nothing easier than to say that employer/employee problems can be and should be settled by agreement. There is nothing more difficult than <Col N="2276" /> finding agreement.  It has been pointed out that no amount of legislation passed here will make a man work if he does not want to work.  That is very true.  That is why I believe the time has now come for the introduction of a greater degree of responsibility and sanity into labour relations.  At the moment it almost looks as if labour relations have broken down completely. There is what appears to be the unreasonable attitude of small minorities within the trade union movement.  That is not the kind of trade union activity that the late Jim Larkin and his father before him did so much to encourage. Both these men were hard bargainers but they always exercised a great measure of responsibility.</P>
    <P>What we must endeavour to ensure in this legislation is that there will be no opportunity for worker to inflict hardship on fellow worker.  It is difficult, of course, to blame the workers because they are disturbed and discontended element.  The cause of that discontent is the dictatorial attitude of employers and the State itself cannot disclaim responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to observe the outcome of this legislation.  Will it improve the relationship between worker and employer?  It may or it may not. No amount of law will make a man work if he does not want to work and all the law on the Statute Book will not make an unreasonable employer reasonable.  We have seen from time to time efforts made to kill the trade union movement.  The best efforts employers could make have not succeeded in doing that but what I really fear is that efforts will be made to kill the trade union movement within the trade union movement itself.  That would be an unknown and an indescribable loss to the working class people.  That is something that should and must be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take 13 minutes.  Last night I was dealing with the failure of the Government to introduce, either in this House or in the country, a long-term forestry programme, a programme in which we could see the means of providing a large number of additional jobs in rural Ireland with the opening up of new forestry centres.  There are extensive areas of land in this country not suitable for agricultural purposes, mainly mountain slopes and cut-away bogs, which, if suitably drained, could be planted.  The Forestry Division appear to be leaving it to someone else to do the planting but it will never be done by private planting.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that for the size of our country we have a vast amount of waste and unproductive land which represents a loss to the economy.  If the soil is not sufficiently fertile to produce a crop, I suggest that there is no soil so bad that it cannot produce a tree of some type.  No courageous effort has been made by the Forestry Division to present us with a progressive forestry programme under which every single acre of waste land could be used for the profitable production of timber.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party are perturbed at the failure of the Government's forestry programme both as a means of providing employment in rural Ireland and as a means of employing the thousands of acres of otherwise unproductive land that could very usefully be planted.  On behalf of the Deputies whose names are appended thereto, I ask the House to accept the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be <Col N="2278" /> associated with this motion.  I joined with Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Higgins in tabling the motion: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the cutting down of the forestry planting target of 25,000 acres annually to 20,000 acres&rdquo;, and we gave as our reasons, &ldquo;the hardships and consequential unemployment that will result to forestry workers and their families, instead of increasing the target for productive investment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the first inter-party Government came into office in 1948, we found that the Forestry Division of the Minister's Department was then planting 4,000 acres per year.  We came to the conclusion that 4,000 acres per year was uneconomic, that it was not realistic, and we set a target, which we hoped would be reached in a minimum of ten or 12 years, of 25,000 acres per year.  Once we got the nurseries going, we were able to step up the annual acreage from 4,000 in 1948 until it was in the region of 14,000 acres in or about 1956-57.</P>
      <P>We must congratulate the Government who succeeded us in that they continued to try to hit our target of 25,000 acres.  In or about 1960 I understand that the target of 25,000 acres per year was reached.  Unfortunately, we have now fallen below that target and are back to planting a mere 20,000 acres per year.  That is deplorable for many reasons.  The acres which are being planted are acres of marginal land which is practically useless for any development other than afforestation, which is mostly situate in the congested and Irish-speaking districts of the depopulated west.  Here we have the means of retaining and giving permanent employment to at least some of those who are left on the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>Afforestation uses up marginal land which cannot be used for anything else, which cannot be brought into economic agricultural production, which cannot be used for hill grazing, which cannot be used for turbary and, for that matter, land which cannot be used for any purpose other than afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that when previous Ministers introduced their Estimates they boasted of how the acquisition of <Col N="2279" /> land for afforestation purposes had been stepped up year by year.  By afforestation not only do we do good to the lands actually planted, but we also drain those lands and the land surrounding the forests; we bring into production land which has been lying useless for years.</P>
    <P>It has always been and will continue to be Fine Gael policy that in the land of Ireland lies the wealth of Ireland.  We tried to improve it.  We tried first of all to improve agricultural land by means of the Land Reclamation Scheme.  Unfortunately, the present Government dropped Section B of that scheme, and land which could have been, and should have been developed, and would have been developed had the inter-Party Government remained in power, is now mere marginal land and is no longer being used for any purpose.</P>
    <P>We believe that marginal land should be planted and we continue to show that belief by setting a target of 25,000 acres for plantation each year. During the period of planting a considerable amount of employment is given in the locality in which the forests are situate.  As the forests grow and thinning takes place, permanent employment is given.  As the forests mature and trees are cut down this employment continues.</P>
    <P>I often think that Bord na Móna could do much more than they are doing with their cutaway bogland.  In Germany, turbary has reached a very high stage of development.  Immediately the turf banks are cut out, forests are planted on the cutaway bog.  That should be done in this country.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting for the bogs to be cut away, there are many thousands of acres of marginal land that could be planted.  I live in a county the greater portion of which is an undeveloped area and portion of which is in the Gaeltacht.  There is a dearth of employment in the locality.  We are depending on the Minister, on his Department and on Roinn na Gaeltachta to provide employment there.  Here is a source of employment which has never really been exploited.</P>
    <P>In my own area, which is known as <Col N="2280" /> the Rosses, not one tree has been planted by the Minister's Department despite the fact that it is an area in which there is absolutely no employment whatsoever.  Some years ago, Deputy Cormac Breslin, myself and the late parish priest, Canon Molloy, invited inspectors from the Minister's Department to the Rosses area.  We pointed out to them where they could acquire at least 2,000 acres of land suitable for the planting of trees. Deputy Breslin and myself and the parish priest were satisfied that shelterbelts could be planted in this locality&mdash; Cloughwally, Doochery and Meenaweel districts.  Despite the fact that the area was examined, not one tree has been planted there by the Department.</P>
    <P>I have asked questions of the Minister and of his predecessor in office as to why the Rosses district has not been cultivated with trees and I have always been told in reply that the Department have lands for afforestation purposes and, when I asked where they were, I was told Meenaweel which is not in the Rosses district.  Not one tree has been planted around Croveigh, Loughanuire and other areas which, in my opinion, are suitable for planting.  No reasonable excuse has been given for their non-planting.  Had these lands to which I have referred been acquired for afforestation purposes, permanent employment would have been available to people there who have to depend on public works in Scotland or on the tunnels of Wales or England for employment.  They would have been able to remain in their locality and bring up their children in a Gaeltacht environment.</P>
    <P>I can never understand the mentality of Departmental inspectors who refuse to see this point of view.  The present Minister is responsible not only for Lands and Afforestation but also for the Gaeltacht and I make a special appeal to him to see that some lands in those Gaeltacht areas are immediately acquired for afforestation and consequent employment.</P>
    <P>Grants are made available in these localities for many projects&mdash;projects which are uneconomic.  Here is an economic project which could be of some considerable advantage to the <Col N="2281" /> locality.  I remember that when the former Deputy Joseph Blowick was Minister for Lands he visited the Norse countries and came back here and told us what could be done with the end product of our forestry.  I remember him telling us how pulp factories could be set up, how the paper industry could absorb the pulp and how many other end products of afforestation could satisfactorily be utilised.  Nothing has come of that.  We have heard nothing since the former Deputy Joseph Blowick left the Department&mdash;and the acreage is dropping to what it was prior to his becoming the political head of that Department.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that we appear to look upon afforestation as a lost cause. Those of us who go to the pictures cannot but note from time to time the amount of employment that is given in Canada and in the Norse countries through afforestation and the advantages of this very fine industry which we, also, could benefit from through prudent use of our marginal land.</P>
    <P>Again, these forests could be used for game protection.  Year after year, the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands advertise not only to locals but to foreigners the letting of shooting rights in our forests.  The forests are fairly valuable as a game preserve.  A lot more could be done about game in our forests.  I have been the lessee of a forest for the past 20 years.  I pay a rental for the shooting rights there&mdash;not that I get any birds of any description there because I simply have not the time to develop it.  The Department could do a lot of good from the point of view of developing game in their forests and protecting the game there.  Employment could be given by seeing that vermin is curtailed and possibly wiped out.</P>
    <P>Most of our marginal land is in the lake districts.  In my own locality, the local anglers' association are now planting the marginal land around lakes for the purposes of improving fishing.  Forests are the source and the breeding ground of flies which eventually find themselves on our lakes and improve fishing.  It has often been said that the most successful fishing in the <Col N="2282" /> west is the fishing adjacent to forests. I often wonder why the Department did not try to correlate in some way or other the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture with the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands so that they would work in unison to improve not only our fisheries but also the scenic appearance of the barren surroundings of some lakes.</P>
    <P>When one motors, say, from Donegal down to Pettigo, one sees thousands of acres of barren land which is completely unplanted.  I know that that land is equally as good as the land around Lough Derg for afforestation but no effort is made to acquire those acres.  Surely we have sufficient nurseries in the country to raise the seedlings for planting &mdash; nurseries which should be and could be and I hope will be enlarged in the very near future.  I know the labour potential of afforestation.  I have a very good idea of the economic value of afforestation. I have a very good idea of the amount for which lands can be acquired for afforestation.  For all of these reasons, I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion to try to step up the annual acreage for afforestation to the figure we in the first inter-Party Government set, of 25,000 acres per annum.  The Minister should try not only to maintain that target but, if possible, to increase it.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the moment about 4,800 people are permanently employed in our forests.  There is no reason why this figure should not be doubled.  These people are living in areas where there are few other forms of employment and they appreciate their work in our forests.  It is for that reason that I second this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter.  It is easy to advocate an increased programme of this kind, as Deputy O'Donnell did, but we must ensure that the investment is viable. Investment in afforestation is long term, and at the same time, at the other end, we must consider the method of dealing with mature forests when they arrive. We cannot have a stock book programme in this matter and say that we shall increase our acreage to 30,000 <Col N="2283" /> or 40,000 a year.  This may look well as of now, but surely we must keep an eye on the whole forestry programme and remember the situation in 20 or 30 years when the trees are mature.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it would not be economic to have trees maturing unless we have the capacity to deal with the acreage we plant when they come to maturity. In others words it would be uneconomic to have 50,000 acres coming to maturity in one year when all we can handle is 20,000.  It is not as simple as Deputy O'Donnell makes it out to be.  Though we get interim dividends from afforestation, one of the most important dividends comes after the appropriate number of years, depending on the variety of trees we plant.  I feel sure there is a very good reason for arriving at the figure of 20,000 or 25,000 acres but I am equally sure that this was the optimum acreage that could be utilised fully in the year of their maturity, with the handling facilities we can provide.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give realistic reasons for the figure of 20,000 or 25,000 acres.  If these figures are restated, and if progressive policy is based on a certain figure, whatever it may be, rather than using this matter as a political football&mdash;one Party bidding for 20,000, another for 30,000 and so on&mdash;we will be realistic and will reap profits accordingly.</P>
      <P>One thing I urge on the Minister is that he be more selective in his planting programme.  We must remember that afforestation serves a number of purposes, one main purpose being that it helps to relieve flooding and erosion. Some years ago I read an excellent book, <i>The Rape of Ireland,</i> by John Mackey.  It is one of the best books on the subject one can hope to get because the author goes into much detail on the questions of flooding and land erosion and on the effects on them of afforestation. We all know of our priority drainage schemes and we know in advance the arterial drainage schemes for major catchment areas and for intermediate rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that planting in these areas should go hand in hand with drainage. The importance of that is very well explained in the book to which I have <Col N="2284" /> referred in relation to afforestation here and in other countries where it is utilised.  A greater time lag occurs between the time rain hits a mountainside and reaches the river or the sea where there has been afforestation: the forest helps to slow down the speed at which the rainwater eventually reaches the sea.  As a result of the slowing down and dispersion of the flow of water, less erosion occurs and valuable soil is saved in the lower areas.  Therefore, there should be collaboration between the Forestry Division and the arterial drainage section of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Afforestation also affects temperature and this is one of the interim benefits we look for from it.  Of course, employment is of very great consideration, as is the utilisation of otherwise unproductive land which is probably one of the greatest benefits derivable from afforestation.  We know that the Department of Agriculture have given very substantial grants for hill fencing to farmers and that they are now about to use barren land, which heretofore could not be used, for sheep grazing. The old system of a man and his dog roaming the mountains where there was no fencing is not an economic method of sheep raising.  The introduction of grants for hill fencing, subsidies for hill lambs and in some areas grants for broadcast re-seeding of mountain land is making it profitable for farmers to use land which up to now was no good for anything except forestry although there is a stage where the profitability of keeping sheep on moorland would have to be weighed against the profitability of afforestation.  There is already a decision that land which is potentially suitable for agriculture will not in any circumstance be taken over for afforestation.  A similar decision may also have to be taken in the case of certain lands which carry x number of sheep.  If they carry less than x number of sheep then they can be taken over.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned and as far as the area which I represent, that is, the Inishowen peninsula, is concerned, I have nothing but the highest praise for the speed with which the Forestry Division are undertaking the job there. <Col N="2285" /> Admittedly it is not very many years since the forestry people first entered the peninsula, but I can say that in this area since then great strides have been made.  I understand that land acquisition and proposals for land acquisition are proceeding satisfactorily.  I hope this will continue.</P>
    <P>Of course the provision of money is necessary but I think we should, once and for all, estimate in the long term the optimum acreage to plant per annum.  Afforestation improves the appearance of the countryside but this is not everything and eventually we will look for a return from the expenditure. Certainly in some of our forests more could be done to ensure that they are looked after although I would say that in the last ten years a great improvement has taken place in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the Six Counties some&mdash;not all&mdash; of the forestry areas on the mountains and beside lakes, are cleared for picnic parties and for tourist development. Going through Northern Ireland one sees direction signs pointing to forests recommended as beauty spots.  Some of this should be done here because there are many forests which have reached a stage where they are attractive places to go.  Indeed, in other countries tours are organised through forests.</P>
    <P>The letting of rights in the vicinity of forests leaves much to be desired.  The last speaker said he had a lease of a forest but unfortunately had not the time to deal with vermin control <i>et cetera</i>.  It should be a condition of any letting that certain things would be required of the lessee.  I know this is not happening, that groups are taking lettings of forests and doing nothing in return.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be anxious to continue the progress which has been undoubtedly made but I should like to know if it is physically possible to deal with larger areas of planting if in the years ahead forests mature at the rate of 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 acres.</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in assuring the House of the whole-hearted support of Deputies on these benches for the motion at present before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the very moderate target of 25,000 acres of afforestation <Col N="2286" /> per year has had to be cut back is an extraordinary indictment of the policies of the Government.  I cannot think of anything that it would be so easy to plan for as afforestation.  The last speaker tried to make a case for the cut back of this programme from 25,000 to 20,000 acres.  The case he made did not in any way coincide with the case the Minister made when he was opening the debate on his Estimate last October.  The reasons the Minister gave were that our plantable reserves were not sufficient to continue at the rate we were going, that we had not acquired enough land in recent years.</P>
    <P>Surely these two reasons could easily have been foreseen and steps to overcome them could have been taken in time?  It is admitted now that the reason the land for forestry could not be readily acquired was that inadequate prices had been offered for it, that they persisted for far too long with an unrealistic ceiling of £10 per acre.  My indictment of the Government is that this was something they could easily have foreseen.  Instead of that we have had to cut back our very moderate programme.  Now we are told that only £123,261 was spent and only 14,713 acres were acquired for afforestation in the year 1967/68 and that in April of 1968 we had a balance of £204,000. This year the sum available to us is £354,000 because of that balance left over but the question we now ask is, will that £354,000 be capable of being spent because of the short-term policies the Government have operated with regard to afforestation down through the years.  The ceiling of £10 per acre was an unrealistic one and it should have been realised much sooner that £10 per acre was a figure which could not be applied generally if the right type of land was to be acquired.  The result of this ceiling was that only the very worst land was being offered for afforestation and very often land was acquired which was not suitable for afforestation.</P>
    <P>A condition of planting for afforestation was that this planting should be capable of supplying a reasonable yield of timber.  All this should have been taken into account before we decided to cut back the modest target for this country of 25,000 acres.  I hope <Col N="2287" /> the farmers will not take as long to react to the Minister's new approach to this question as the Minister took to realise that there was need for that new approach.  It is extraordinary that this should have happened in this country when it is so clear that there is a demand for timber and timber products. It has happened in a climate which is particularly suitable for the growing of timber and which could place us in a position where we could compete with European countries.  It is extraordinary that we did not take advantage of this.  It happened too in a tourist country where widespread planting would have improved the scenery.  It is extraordinary that all these things were not foreseen by the Department and that we should now have to table a motion such as this.</P>
    <P>I am anxious also to support the motion from the point of view of the people who earn their livelihood in our forests.  These workers have our whole-hearted sympathy.  They are people who have been very unfairly treated, they are lowly paid, below the average run of workers in every aspect, and now they are faced with this danger of additional insecurity.  They have no pension scheme, no scheme of conciliation or negotiation, no PAYE. Last year when a scheme of service pay was introduced for other lowly-paid State servants and which operated from 1st April these people were paid that service pay only from 1st June.  They have no bargaining power and because of that they are being exploited by a State Department, which is a shame.  These people are lowly paid and the security of continual employment is most important to them.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to introduce as soon as he can a pension scheme for these workers.  To delay such a scheme any further is not fair and no case can be made for delaying it further.  They may be termed casual workers but many have given service of 30 and 40 years to the Department. Their records are there and can be traced and so there is no case to be made for denying them a pension any longer.  We must appeal to the Minister that he should take every step <Col N="2288" /> that can be taken to prevent this disgraceful thing happening again to the lowly-paid workers of this State Department.</P>
    <P>Forestry is a matter of great concern to all of us.  It is a long-term national asset and is something for which it should be easy to plan.  It is a matter for which we can plan at leisure but we have not succeeded in doing that and, as a result, we now have workers whose jobs are in jeopardy.  There are people who are very concerned about this trend in this employment.  This is not the first time that this has happened. Last year a number of forestry workers lost their jobs because the labour content of many schemes, such as the making of roads, was cut back. No steps have been taken to see that that trend does not continue.</P>
    <P>This trend has been evident in areas adjacent to my constituency, in Bandon Kinsale and Macroom.  In Macroom there is a development association keenly concerned with the setting up of a chipboard factory in the town. Members of that association came on a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about that project which is based on native raw material.  It is poor consolation to them and to other people like them concerned with the development of industry that forestry is being cut back and that the Government's policy in relation to forestry is only a short-term one.  I would appeal to the Minister to do all he can to remedy the defects of that short-term policy and to do everything he can to restore the target of 25,000 acres annually.  This is a much lower target than should be the aim in this country, which has an ideal climate and so much land not suitable for other purposes, in which there is so much need for employment in rural areas and in which there is so much need for native raw material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion.  I was appalled when I read that the target had been reduced from 25,000 to 20,000 acres per annum. Every Deputy in this House should realise the value of forestry to this country and also that any action taken by anybody to reduce the planting <Col N="2289" /> acreage is detrimental to the country, to the people and to the economy.  Here we have a raw material in timber and we have a market beside it, a valuable market where every type of native timber can be sold at a profit.  Any action that tends to reduce planting should be deplored by the House. There is an abundance of land for planting and, with modern techniques, it should be possible to grow trees on every acre of land with the exception of deep virgin bog or the rocks of the Burren country in County Clare.</P>
      <P>There is hardly any type of land, with the exception of the type I mentioned, where some kind of timber cannot be grown.  Everybody knows that with the techniques used on the sawn timber, with dry in kilns, <i>et cetera,</i> Irish timber today can be used in many ways in which it could not be heretofore and can take the place of this foreign timber we have to import every year at tremendous cost to the economy because it affects our balance of payments. We should utilise every single piece of timber we can produce whether in logs, in bulk or in any other form.  It would be a tremendous help to our balance of payments if everybody involved set about using it to the utmost advantage.</P>
      <P>Some years ago people used to think that Irish timber had not got the texture or density necessary for use in furniture, decoration and many other things.  That is completely changed today.  With the discovery of adhesives that can be used with pulp or veneers, practically any kind of grown timber can be used commercially.  It is, therefore, important that the Government and every Deputy would do everything possible to ensure that more and more land is acquired and more trees grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area I come from in the west of Ireland there is a tremendous amount of marginal land unsuitable for agricultural purposes and a lot of cut-away bog lying there useless with all the available turf taken off it.  There is no reason in the world why a scheme could not be devised to take over the cutaway bogs.  The argument that a forest has to be a large unit no longer holds good, because there are jeeps or landrovers to take the gangers from <Col N="2290" /> small forest to small forest.  There is no real problem involved in the transport of workers today, and it should be possible to take smaller areas into production in the western part of the country.  The lower slopes of the mountains of Mayo are certainly suitable for many kinds of timber, and if the Department and the Minister really mean business they must set about acquiring more land.</P>
    <P>It is all right to make the excuse that the reason the target had to be cut down was that the available planting area was not there.  That should not be an excuse.  The Minister has experts in his Department who are able to go out and look at the land and see what it is suitable for.  Today there are people in forestry who, almost instantaneously, can tell what type of tree will grow in a particular place.  Forestry, of course, is an art.  It is interesting work which takes training and a certain amount of dedication.  It is a field in which something new can be learned every week.  Today the job rightly demands teamwork.  The forester to be a really good forester must, in the main, be a local man.  He must know the local problems.  He must know about the wind and the weather, about fire dangers, about pests, about animal damage and all the other factors that enter into forestry.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the people in our Forestry Division be sent abroad to learn more and more about forestry techniques in other countries, from the point of view of growth, the control of pests in trees and also the utilisation of timber products.  We should keep abreast of modern techniques, because we cannot survive in any field today unless people are as near expert as possible in that field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond spoke about the employment content and I do not want to follow her along that line because she made a very good case with which I agree entirely.  Forestry workers are in a skilled occupation.  They must be highly trained and it is an indictment of the Department and its policy that these workers are getting a mere pittance, that their working and living conditions and cooking facilities leave so much to be desired, <Col N="2291" /> and also that they have no service pay and no superannuation.  I do not want to labour the point which Deputy Mrs. Desmond has put so well, but the employment content is considerable. In areas like the west of Ireland where there are few outlets for employment this could be a wonderful development.  The mountain slopes and the boglands of the West could be planted.  This would mean that hundreds of men and even boys could be employed.  This would be a great thing, as every shilling coming into the home is necessary in the small farm areas of the west of Ireland.  It could lead to stabilisation of our population which is a vital factor if the West is even to remain static whatever about further growth.</P>
    <P>No drive has ever been made to sell the idea of more trees; I mean a real drive.  The time has come when the mass media will have to be used to bring home to our people the commercial value of trees and the value of trees for scenic beauty.  Everybody knows we have the most beautiful wild scenery in the world in the west of Ireland.  If ever there has to be man-made scenery, as it is sometimes called, where the works of man contribute to the beauty of a countryside, nothing can be more effective than trees and shrubs, because they are the most beautiful things ever created by God.  Propaganda of every kind must be used to ensure that the general public learn the value of forestry, that the farmer and others who own land will co-operate with the Department thus ensuring that land is made available and that there will be more respect for our forests.  The most horrible thing a person can see, apart from the death of a human being, is to see a burned-out forest.  It is appalling to see a blackened area where thousands of young trees have been wiped out because of the carelessness of some individual, some criminal, I had rather say.  When one considers all the labour and knowledge put into a forestry project to provide a beautiful vista of trees, it is appalling to think that all this is destroyed because <Col N="2292" /> some criminal threw away a cigarette, lit a match or did not put out a fire. This is a shocking thing and whereever people are found responsible for lighting fires that cause damage to forests they should be brought to book and punished in no uncertain manner.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission in the division of land should ensure that shelter belts are planted prior to the handing over of land.  This should become Land Commission policy so as to encourage the growth of trees.  I am only speaking of Land Commission policy in order to emphasise the point.  They are using wire fences to divide fields in the lands they are now striping.  They look to me like rat cages; they give no shelter. Shelter belts should be provided, as I have said.  This is important in order to encourage forestry.  Using the propaganda of television and radio, the newspapers and the encouragement of every public man, local authority and Dáil Deputy, there should be no difficulty in the Department getting the amount of land needed in future.  I would ask the Minister, with all the urgency I can command, to seek more money if it is a question of money and seek more land if it is a question of land and do everything possible to have every acre that can be planted, planted.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Cunningham, I do not think the end product will pile up or that if you sold 40,000 acres in one year the time would come when you would not be able to deal with the end product which would mature.  That is not a valid argument and the Minister need have no fear.  If the Minister decides to do the thing he has been asked to do, he will have my blessing.</P>

      <P>What interested me most about this debate so far is that everybody who spoke on the motion appeared to take the motion at its face value.  Nobody appears to have been interested enough to discover the facts for himself.  The motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the cutting down of the forestry planting target of 25,000 acres annually to 20,000 acres ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> This is absolutely incorrect.  Because of the circumstances of the time, it is true that the planting in one particular year a few years ago was down to 20,000 acres but the target since then has been 25,000 acres and we have been building up gradually to this figure.  In fact, as we discuss this motion about cutting the target to 20,000 acres we have in this year planted almost 23,000 acres. Not only that but last year we planted about 22,500 acres.  I cannot understand why Deputies should talk about a cut in the target from 25,000 to 20,000 acres when, in fact, in the very year in which they are speaking, we have almost 23,000 acres planted.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that it is not lack of money that has caused the area planted to fall below 25,000 acres in recent years.  In fact, the amount available on the Estimate this year is sufficient to permit of the planting of 25,000 acres.  Our basic difficulty&mdash;and there is no use in oversimplifying it as has been done by some speakers opposite&mdash;is in procuring sufficient land for planting.  As I have said already in the Dáil, I should be grateful to Deputies if they would make known to me any land in their constituencies which could be used for forestry purposes. I am now making that appeal again.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made by my Department to correct the position by increasing the intake of land.  As I have already said, we have a new system of land valuation in use in the Forestry Department and this is a big breakthrough in our campaign to develop our forestry potential.  For the first time we have succeeded in establishing a cost-benefit type analysis of each new area of land being included in the forest estate as the basis for optimum management policies.  Each area being considered is now studied in relation to both its potential timber yield and the level of capital development cost likely to be involved, and a price is determined which recognises its fair value for forestry purposes.  Under the new system the range of prices which we are prepared to offer is much wider than under the old £10 ceiling price system.  Land of relatively low productive capacity will still command only a low price if it qualifies at all for purchase <Col N="2294" /> but, for good forest land, valuations now range frequently up to twice the old ceiling price and, in favourable circumstances where capital development costs are minimal, it can go substantially higher.</P>
    <P>Any man selling land now to the Forestry Division can expect a fair market price for any land which, in the national interest, would be better used for forestry purposes than for agricultural purposes.  To put it simply, price should no longer be an obstacle in land acquisition for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the streamlining of our acquisition procedures.  It is directed mainly towards providing a service whereby an owner who makes an offer to sell land for forestry can be assured that within a period of weeks he will have a visit from an acquisition inspector to value the land and that the same inspector will call back in a short time to make him an offer for the land.  This procedure, of course, makes extra demands on our field staff and to ensure prompt and adequate service I am arranging to strengthen the acquisition inspectorate by adding a total of nine additional posts.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the reduction in forestry employment has arisen from improved methods and techniques and the use of machinery, as well as from the reduced intake of land.  Deputies must realise that we can compete internationally and make forestry viable only if we pursue every means within reason to reduce the costs of the undertaking. I think it would be accepted that the more viable the undertaking becomes, the more it safeguards the employment of those working in our forests.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the forestry undertaking has expanded twofold by one quarter of a million acres to our present level of half a million acres. The annual planting programme is, therefore, a much less significant element in forestry employment than it was ten or 15 years ago.  I assure the House that my own efforts and those of my Department are aimed at stabilising employment as far as possible. With this end in view also, we have been examining the work progress to see to what extent it may be <Col N="2295" /> possible to bring productive work forward in order to avoid redundancy.</P>
    <P>As a further measure towards stabilising employment priority of attention is being directed by our acquisition officers towards those centres where there is a possibility of redundancy and where additional planting might enable employment to be maintained.  In addition, our local foresters who live and work in forest areas have been commissioned to search actively in their local communities for suitable offers of land.  This is a further improvement on the old system whereby we tended to wait until offers of land were made to us.  The distribution of the plantable reserve is another matter which is of critical importance. While a sudden boom in acquisition in one particular district may bring in substantial new areas for planting at a particular forest and can add substantially to the plantable reserve, this provides no solution to redundancy at other forests which have no reserve of land.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division does, of course, transfer staff between adjoining forests to try to maintain stability of employment, but it will be recognised, I think, that there is a limit to what can be done in that respect.  The total area of State forest has now exceeded 600,000 acres and the very extension of forests means in itself that the amount of land available for forestry is being gradually absorbed; this makes further acquisition difficult and tedious.  The days of the big acquisition intake appear to be gone and the time when you could pick up several hundred acres of plantable land in one tract is no longer with us.  Progress will now have to depend for the most part on a steady intake of small areas.</P>
    <P>An index of this trend can be seen in the fact that in 1952-53 the Forestry Division acquired 16,000 plantable acres in 208 separate transactions; that was an average of 81 acres per transaction. In 1967-68 the average plantable area acquired per transaction had fallen to 32 acres.  In fact, if one goes back beyond 1952-53, one finds that the average intake was even higher. Some time before that&mdash;I do not know <Col N="2296" /> the exact year&mdash;it was 130 acres per transaction.  As Deputies are aware, it is just as difficult to take over 32 acres as it is to take over 130 acres.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cunningham mentioned, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are now giving substantially increased grants under the Fencing Scheme and the Mountain Grazing (Supplementary Keep) Scheme.  I do not think anyone will argue that the increases given were not well founded, but Deputies will recognise that any increase in hill farming subsidy militates against our prospects of acquiring land for forestry.  In a further effort to maintain employment, we are examining the amenity potentialities of our forests.  I want again to stress that nobody is more concerned than the Government and I with regard to the problems arising from disemployment and the counter efforts we are making to obtain more land for planting underline this.  Indeed, while some instances of redundancy are inevitable in all forest work, it is fair to say that we have today much greater continuity of employment in our forests than ever before.  Let me repeat that the target remains at 25,000 acres per year.  There is sufficient money in the Estimate to allow us to plant 25,000 acres a year and, as I said, the number of acres planted this year is almost 23,000.</P>
    <P>We were forced by our problems in regard to land acquisition and the relative smallness of our plantable reserve to drop short of that figure for a year or two, but I can assure the House that we are taking all measures open to us to ensure the accomplishment of our target.  When we started out a dozen years, or so, ago on a phased programme of 25,000 acres per year our total planting target for the period was 285,000 acres.  We have, in fact, planted 278,000 acres, which is somewhat better than 97 per cent.  We have achieved that because in some years we planted more than our target.  I think 97 per cent of our target is very good.  It is a creditable achievement.  Promise and performance have been very closely linked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, as might have been expected, oversimplified the difficulties. He said he knew of thousands <Col N="2297" /> of acres of bog which we should be planting.  In the midlands cut-away bog is generally a good planting medium and many small areas in the midlands have been planted.  The bigger areas on which Bord na Móna are still operating are, of course, required for turf production and cannot be released to us until Bord na Móna operations cease.  Provided a sufficient overlay of peat is left, these bogs should provide suitable sites for forestry or for agricultural production.  Bord na Móna did make available to us one bog in Kerry, Lyrecrompane, which was handed over about two years ago.  Part of it has been planted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also asked when we hoped to have a woodpulp industry. I am rather surprised at this because everybody, of course, knows we have four major processing factories drawing their raw materials entirely from Irish-grown pulpwood.  These industries are producing groundwood pulp, fibre-board and particle board for the home market and, in addition, are very substantial exporters.  For the latter reason, as I said earlier, we have to be concerned with economic factors. These factories are using over five million Hoppus feet of pulpwood and employ 1,300 people.  These industries are geared to expansion, and we have every confidence that these and other new industries can be set up to utilise fully the increasing supplies of thinnings which will be coming from our forests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also referred to planting in Britain.  He spoke about &ldquo;the considerable step-up in forestry in Britain&rdquo;.  I am sorry to have to say this for Britain's sake but, in the interests of accuracy, I must contradict Deputy Flanagan's statement.  The fact is that the area planted by the British Forestry Commission has been falling steadily since 1961 and, in England alone, the annual planting by the Commission is now less than half what it was some ten years ago.  The Commission were forced to cut their planting targets in 1958 and, so far as we are able to gather, they have not been able to get sufficient land to service even their reduced programme. The figures I have here are that in 1961 Britain planted 63,700 acres and last year they planted 52,400.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2298" /> Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Flanagan spoke about the planting of trees in the Gaeltacht areas and on the exposed western coastline.  They said that not enough was being done in the planting of trees along the western coastline.  Deputy Flanagan pointed out that the European experience showed there was no real difficulty in establishing plantations along the shoreline.  Of course the facts are that conditions of exposure on our coasts are far worse than the conditions which obtain in most of Continental Europe and the climatological records are there to prove it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The records I have show that exposure conditions are more difficult along our western coasts than in any European country.  Even if we did not have the conditions of exposure with blasting from salt-laden winds, the soil conditions of a lot of our coastline, with its eroded peats and rock outcrops, would seriously limit the scope for forestry development.  However, that is not to say that we are not endeavouring to plant wherever possible in the West.  In fact, we have experiments and tests being carried out in Glenamoy and in Gaoth Saile to try to find suitable types of trees which will grow in those areas.  We are just as anxious as anyone else, if at all possible, to have trees growing in the western region.</P>
      <P>Once again I should like to emphasise that we are doing our utmost to get sufficient land for planting.  I have pointed out the difficulties we face. There is nothing at all to be gained by oversimplifying the position.  As I mentioned earlier, we have made a number of changes in the Forestry Division to help us get more land for forestry.  I am hopeful the efforts we are making will meet with success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to stress the fact that it is rather peculiar that this motion was taken on its face value.  I am not surprised that Fine Gael have done so, but I would have thought that they would have informed themselves as to the actual position before putting it <Col N="2299" /> down.  In fact, they put down a motion on the Agenda which is absolutely incorrect.  The motion deplores the cutting down of the forestry planting target of 25,000 acres to 20,000 acres. This year we will plant almost 23,000 acres.</P>

      <P>The motion refers to 20,000 acres and 25,000 acres.  Most of us who have any connection with the Department of Lands are aware that there has been some change.  The Minister's comments remind me of the man who had an accident in a mill and was asked did he lose his finger and said: &ldquo;No, I only lost half of my finger.&rdquo;  The questioner said: &ldquo;That is not too bad.&rdquo;  The fact that we are over 2,000 acres down on our target is not something that can be brushed off as if there were no problems.  I know that with the traditional methods of getting land it is not an easy problem to satisfy our need.  We used to be two years in advance.  The Minister's predecessor used to refer to 50,000 acres of plantable reserves.  The trouble is that we have tended to adopt the same line as we did 20 or 25 years ago to obtain land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to think he deserves a clap on the back for saying that the Forestry Division in their efforts to get land could go as high as £30 an acre.  He said it used to be £10 an acre, and that now £20 is normal but they can go as high as £30 for land.  I do not know if the Minister will agree that in most parts of the country <Col N="2300" /> you will not get much land for £30 an acre.  In the Minister's constituency and mine you would not get an acre of land to rent for a year for £30.  I do not think this will encourage people to give land which they had intended holding on to.</P>
    <P>I have a theory, and I know that people will raise their hands in horror when I mention it.  Despite that I propose to do so.  Every year the Land Commission take over vast estates.  In my own constituency they take over estates of 200, 300, 400 or 600 acres and, after keeping them for a couple of years, they divide some of them locally and they divide the remainder amongst migrants.  Usually there is a big house and they leave a sizeable piece of land with the house in order to sell it, perhaps 90 or 100 acres. Some of this land is good land and some of it is bad land.  Is there any reason why the Forestry Division should not say to their colleagues in the Land Commission: &ldquo;In future when you take over an estate we want 30 acres for forestry&rdquo;?  Without stretching the case too far, there is no reason in the world why they should not be able to get 25, 30, or 40 acres off every sizeable farm for forestry.  If it is scrub it can be cleared and re-sold and, if it is not, there is enough swampy bad land to make up the required amount.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was about to ask the Minister for Labour, having regard to its great bearing on this legislation, what attitude the Government would have to a proper prices and incomes policy.  The necessity for legislation such as that which we are now considering results from the inactivity of the Government.  It is well to note that, in the absence of any policy to control the cost of living, in the absence of a prices and incomes policy, in the <Col N="2301" /> absence of industrial relations&mdash;which are nil at the moment&mdash;we have a Labour Court with excellent officials who are functioning as if they were blindfolded and handcuffed and no matter what amount of time they devote to their work with energy, zeal, enthusiasm and seriousness their decisions are not binding.</P>
      <P>All of these factors lead us to the one conclusion, namely, that, in so far as the workers of this country are concerned and their relationship with their employers and in so far as the standard of living of these workers is concerned, we now have in this country the weakest Government since this State was founded with the weakest Taoiseach since this State was founded and with Ministers flying in panic in all directions and with the Minister for Labour, who is charged with this legislation, having to choose his words very carefully in the course of this debate lest he might let slip one word that would seriously aggravate the extraordinary and unprecedented position that prevails outside this House in this country today.</P>
      <P>The days are long gone in this country when employers were allowed to exploit or to take advantage of workers.  That day is over, gone forever and never to return.  We all rejoice that we have lived to see that day. We must ask ourselves this one further question: &ldquo;What of the employers who are showing increased dividends and who, at the same time, fail to meet in consultation with their workers through their trade union or their shop stewards or branch secretaries or whatever the negotiating machinery may be?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the most frequent consultation should take place between management and workers in order to foster a greater spirit of co-operation between all concerned.  We have already said that all the workers are not angels, either.  Because of poor industrial relations, because of a failure to sit down and hammer out a solution to a problem which must eventually be solved and which could be solved today or tonight as easily as it will be solved in a fortnight's time, more people must suffer.  The most serious sufferers in this conflict are the <Col N="2302" /> innocent children and wives of some hundreds of workers, in numbers now going into thousands on the basis of an average family of four persons.</P>
    <P>For the third or fourth week, now, not a penny piece has entered under the roof of many workers&mdash;neither in the nature of unemployment benefit, home assistance nor payment from a trade union.  This is a case in which we see that a display of strength by the trade union, or by a certain element of the trade unions, is having a serious and a very detrimental effect on their own workers.  I feel that this is something which not alone can be avoided but must be avoided.  I wonder if the Minister has asked himself on any occasion the question: &ldquo;What is the cause of all of this widespread discontent that prevails today in so far as industrial relations are concerned?&rdquo; Is it unreasonableness?  Is it that there is not a spirit of give-andtake or is it a case in which workers want to grab all or that the employers want to give nothing?  Surely, if we have the machinery to investigate who is to blame, the general public, and the masses, are most certainly entitled to know.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the trade union movement is the greatest movement that has been set up in this country. It is a movement that has gained the widespread respect of all sections of our people.  There is something very seriously wrong with the trade union movement, or small sections of the trade union movement, when the wise counsel of a man such as Mr. James Dunne, President of ICTU, is not given a hearing and is not given the attention which the expression of such wise opinion and wise counsel would deserve.</P>
    <P>In any demands that have been made, surely some consideration must be given to the capacity of the employer to pay?  I feel that, in so far as a demand by workers on an employer is concerned, the trade union representing the workers have a bounden duty to satisfy themselves that the employer is in a position to meet the demands.</P>
    <P>If, however, circumstances prevail in which the employer is not in a position <Col N="2303" /> to meet unreasonable demands, workers should be told about that situation and should moderate their demands until such time as the firm concerned are able to meet them without damaging the duration of the business or the security of employment in it.  Workers should be made aware by their unions of the circumstances prevailing in the business lest otherwise a picture might be painted which would give workers a wrong impression and injure the ability of the firm to continue in business.  Workers can damage an industry irreparably by unfair and unreasonable demands.</P>
    <P>I only wish there was a way in which we could lecture foreign industry here on this matter.  I remember recently talking to a German who set up business in the midlands.  He was not too long in the country and he has since left.  He said to me: &ldquo;I cannot understand why there is such a thing in Ireland as an hour for lunch.  In Germany, in my factory, all the time that is required for lunch is 15 minutes. In the remaining three-quarters of an hour, the workers put up blue bonus points.  What I want to teach the workers here is to finish their lunch in 15 minutes, put up blue bonus points and earn more money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I told this distinguished industrialist that he was now in Ireland, not in Germany.  He could not understand the trade union regulations which require that workers should start at 8 in the morning instead of 7 and why they should not work until 9 or 10 at night instead of 5.30 or 6 p.m.  He said: &ldquo;We are not asking them to do it.  All we want them to do is to put up their bonus points and at the end of a week they will be able to have all that overtime.&rdquo; During the short period in which he operated here he was, in my opinion, an industrial tyrant.  He seemed to be everywhere at once, standing over people while they worked.  Needless to say, he did not last too long in this country.</P>
    <P>It is a great thing that we have the trade union movement here because without it we would not alone have industrial tyrants from abroad but probably some of our own industrialists would be equally inclined to exploit <Col N="2304" /> the workers.  The movement is to be welcomed because it gives the workers not only security and guarantees but it also provides them with comradeship in the union.  Without the trade union movement, employers might get fatter and richer at the expense of the workers while they grew thinner and poorer.</P>
    <P>That is why I should hate to see the day when the unions would overstep themselves to such an extent that they might be curbed by legislation.  I hope the Minister will impose as little compulsion as possible.  There is the old saying that you can lead a horse to the well but you cannot make him drink and it is possibly our chief characteristic that no one can compel us to do anything which we do not wish to do. I hope that any legislation in the future will pave the way for more consultation and understanding and I beg of the Minister not ever to consider compulsion.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my views on this matter and before I sit down I wish to say that I rejoice we have such a strong trade union movement.  I should hate to see that strength eroded by actions of irresponsibility on the part of the unions.  That would be a tragedy because the movement was built up through hard work and sacrifice.  I come from a home in which the trade union movement was cherished and I am a firm believer that every worker should be a member of a union and that every employer should negotiate through the unions and consult frequently with them.  The movement has brought the workers the outstanding advantages which they enjoy today. I hope they do not enjoy these advantages too freely and too happily.  I hope they realise the great danger in which they stand, the great risk in which the whole principles of trade unionism stand if they act irresponsibly. When we compare today with years ago and see the methods of promotion, the security in employment, the wet time benefits and the many other benefits too numerous to mention that have been brought about mainly as a result not of pressure but of reasonable request to powers that be and to management, I hope the trade <Col N="2305" /> union movement will completely and entirely, not in part, return to normality and to sanity at a very early stage.  We have seen the distress, hardships and disasters that have taken place in many quarters.  At all costs this must be avoided.  Therefore, I can only express the hope that in future with a greater degree of co-operation and understanding and with the use of the conference table more often and with the presence of men of commonsense and intelligence at the conference table many of the industrial problems which appear to be so unreal as to be outside the bounds of possibility of settlement will be settled. The conference table is the spot where all these problems must be solved.  Any steps that can be taken by the Minister for Labour and any powers that will assist and encourage this must meet with the approval of all Members of goodwill of this House who are anxious to see that the worker will get a fair return for his work but that the employer will be given fair service and fair return in labour from the employee. If we had that state of affairs we would have a very happy relationship.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the silence of the Government in the past has not helped matters to any great degree.  It is extremely doubtful if the Government will be able to face up to the problems which have now proved to be of their own making.  I hope that they will and that they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the industrial state outside the House we all seem to agree that any legislation that would help to improve it now or in the future must be accepted and welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members of the House speaking here during the day all seemed to be agreed that no force should be used by the Government in settling this dispute or any dispute in the future.  All appeals are being made to reason, asking employers and employees to get together to try to understand each other and solve their own problems for themselves.  It is true to say that this has been the policy of the Minister for Labour and his Department since the Department was founded.  Nobody has <Col N="2306" /> found fault with it but on an occasion such as this there is a certain amount of hysteria and demands are made irrespective of the fact that when demands were made before and were interpreted and legislation was introduced to deal with an industrial situation and when this legislation was used, the very people who made the demands were the first to demand that the law should not be enforced.  This, unfortunately, seems to be a trait of the people and it is very difficult to get over it.</P>
    <P>As I see the legislation before the House, it is designed to achieve the harmony which is necessary among workers and employers.  The Industrial Relations Bill concentrates on the introduction of two officers, an industrial relations officer who will perform certain functions under the Labour Court and a rights commissioner who will perform functions outside of the Labour Court.  As far as I am aware the latter is a new appointment.  It is a very important appointment because any worker with a grievance will have the right to appeal to the rights commissioner and he will be in a position to look into the grievance, examine it and suggest a remedy for it.  If employees and employers are to get on they must have some outlet such as this when they cannot agree among themselves.  I hope that when the legislation is enacted it will be availed of on many occasions and that as a result conditions will become much better.</P>
    <P>In the Trade Union Bill the secret ballot seems to be the big change.  I was surprised to hear people say here that they were not altogether in agreement with the secret ballot.  I was more surprised still to hear it said that the Donovan Commission in England had some doubts about it too.  This is very hard to understand because it must be agreed that a secret ballot is the foundation stone of our democracy and if we are to have an industrial democracy this, too, must be based on the secret ballot.  From the limited experience I have had of industrial disputes I have no doubt whatever that all disputes should be settled by a secret ballot if there is to be a ballot at all.  I also think it should be said that it would be much better to <Col N="2307" /> settle a dispute without any ballot but there are occasions when this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Reading subsection (3) of section 4 of the Trade Union Bill two things struck me.  On the group side I just wonder who would take part in the secret ballot.  Would it be the representatives of the unions concerned in the group or would it be their members? I was also struck by the fact that there will be a secret ballot in deciding to go on strike.  I wonder why is it not necessary to have a secret ballot to decide on the acceptance of terms which may be offered.  Perhaps, that is in some earlier law but I am not aware of it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the House last week to the fact that the Labour document on worker democracy was examined by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is correct to say that it was examined by a committee of the Fianna Fáil Party of which I happened to be secretary. Some people were surprised by this but I do not think it should occasion any surprise because this is an exercise that must be performed by any Party, that is, to examine the policies of its opponents.  There is, perhaps, a greater duty on the Fianna Fáil Party to do this because they are the Government Party and they are likely to continue as the Government Party for a long time to come so that if, by any chance, the opposing parties have anything worthwhile to offer to any part of the community there must be an obligation on the Government to introduce that at some stage or other.</P>
    <P>Having examined this document, a few things struck me.  The most important statement in it appeared at the end of a paragraph.  It is to the effect that the facts of economic life should not be ignored and I think that this statement should be put at the end of all the paragraphs of the article.</P>
    <P>The article defines the workers' democracy as the full participation of the workers in all of the decisions involving the utilisation of the resources of an enterprise or an organisation.  Our attention must be drawn to the fact that the words &ldquo;full&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rdquo; are <Col N="2308" /> used in this definition.  They give very little room for manoeuvre or acceptance. Moving along through the document we see that the circumscriptions start in subsection (8) when it is pointed out that effective controls in the interest of the public must be kept on the organisation and that planning authority will be necessary and there is also mention of the question of public accountancy. This is not defined but I take it to mean that the accounts of all companies must be submitted to the State auditor some time or other.  Those three stays are binding on the decisions that may be taken on the floor of the organisation or enterprise.</P>
    <P>We are informed, in section 2 subsection (6), that this participation by the workers consists of election by the workers of people to management. Right away we are back to the democracy we know, democracy by election or by representation but this is the democracy which does not give us all full participation in all the decisions in which we are involved.  The document goes on to define the aims of the workers' democracy which will be to make the decision makers who control industry or organisation responsible to all those who work in that industry or organisation but, again, it is pointed out later on that the planning authority will still be there, deciding how the resources of the State are to be used. It is also pointed out that the objects of any such organisation must be completely in accord with the planning policy so that a number of the decisions are taken out of the hand of the people working in the organisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of management it is true to say that the workers would be directly concerned with the election of those over them.  Some members of the management would be elected by the workers but one wonders what this would be worth.  It is true to say that in the past workers who have elected trade union officials have repudiated these officials and it is more than likely that in regard to industry the workers would also repudiate the men they had elected to management.  There was also the question of intermediate management and it is pointed out that these are important people.  However, these are <Col N="2309" /> not going to be elected by the workers but are going to be appointed by top management in consultation with the workers, which is a different matter altogether.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned is that alienation of the workers is due to the fact that the worker has no control over his work, that the produce of his work is appropriated by somebody else.  In spite of this it is pointed out in relation to State companies that outside companies could take shares in State companies and also take profits from them.  Why should a worker not be alienated by virtue of the fact that the State takes his profits and be alienated by the fact that a private person takes his profits?</P>
    <P>An industry may be run for two reasons, social or economic.  You may have a number of industries of social value but the vast majority of industries must make a profit to pay for themselves and also pay for the social services necessary to the State.  There are other means by which profits can be taken from the worker under any economy and these are mainly through the old means of taxation.  The profits of an industry can be taxed and the worker himself can be taxed.  If the State becomes the employer as well as the collector of taxation has the worker then not got good reasons why he should be alienated by the State?</P>
    <P>The document also states that the people who drafted it do not want a bureaucracy or an autocracy, that they want freedom in a democratic organisation. I do not think you can ever have complete freedom in any organisation. There must always be restraint.  It also states that at the present time a worker cannot agitate the conditions under which he works.  This is not true.  This is what trade unions do.  Further on the document points out that under the workers' democracy there must be a meaningful discipline and I take it that means that there must be obedience to lawful direction.</P>
    <P>Mv general impression in going over this document is that it offers to workers something that they can never hope to achieve.  On the other hand, one would get the impression that it <Col N="2310" /> was restating once more the importance of the fact that workers and employers must listen to each other, that they must talk about the problems of their work and make suggestions to each and have consultations for the benefit of the operation in which they are engaged.  On that meaning no one could disagree with the document.  This is what the Minister is trying to achieve at the present time.  He is trying to do it slowly but the document states that this is planned for the long term and not for the short term.  There is not much difference between the document and the policy of the Department of Labour on that point.</P>
    <P>There is another good thing about the document which is worthy of attention.  It suggests we should work out our own workers' democracy.  There is no point in holding up to this House or to the Irish people the workers' democracies in other States, particularly the Socialist States.  After all, the majority of us in this House would agree that compulsion is not needed and will not be accepted.  As far as my knowledge goes there is a certain amount of compulsion in all Socialist States.  It would be a great pity if the worker at some stage could not tell his manager to go to so-and-so, himself and his industry and the Government, and not suffer any severe penalty for doing so.  This is the freedom he must have.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard to understand exactly what socialism means and what a workers' democracy means.  Everybody seems to have his own definition of them.  The other day Deputy Tully gave us this example of a workers' democracy, that if an architect is designing a kitchen he should consult with the housewife.  If this is part of the workers' democracy, then we should have more of it.  I have had the experience in my district of having two dispensaries built for me.  I was not consulted on the design of them.  Both of them could have been designed much better.  It would have been more beneficial to me and to the patients, in that we could have got through the work much more quickly, had the building been designed in a different way.  If a new system of relations between workers <Col N="2311" /> and employers brings about this kind of consultation, we must look forward to it and welcome it.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned in the document is the introduction of statutory rules and regulations to bring about these aims.  I think I am right in saying that this is contrary to the opinions expressed in the House.  It is felt that all these things must be developed by goodwill and good relations and if they are not developed thus they will not be acceptable.  The document concludes by saying something to the effect that this is a socialist document which will be implemented by means of a socialist policy and that a philosophical change is involved.  I cannot see a change being brought about to that extent.  I still think fear will continue to be the great emotion, as long as we are alive anyway, and greed will be the great vice.  No doubt charity and generosity will continue to be the main virtue, particularly if it is being exercised by the distribution of the other fellow's wealth.  I think it is true to say that Fianna Fáil was one of the first Parties in the State to make that a practical thing in so far as it was permitted by the financial state of the country.</P>
    <P>When this legislation we are dealing with is implemented I hope the workers concerned will make as much use as possible of what is referred to as the rights commissioner.  In a short time we should be able to go a long way towards solving a lot of these problems in industrial relations and I hope that when this period of industrial strife is over it will be the end of industrial strife for quite a while on the scale we have it just now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions in this House when Bills were under discussion members of the legal profession referred to them as Bills that were peculiar to their profession, and almost suggested that discussion on them should be confined to members of that profession.  On every such occasion I pointed out that while the legal men naturally knew a lot more about the fine points than anybody else in the House, the ordinary layman had a point of view which he was <Col N="2312" /> entitled to put and that the Bills could be improved by having the layman's point of view.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is sick and tired of listening to Deputies saying that these two Bills before the House are Bills for the trade unionists and particularly for the trade union officials. I have been a trade union official for 22 years, and on occasions during the debate here I have had extreme difficulty in restraining myself when I heard such well-known defenders of the working class as Deputy Ben Briscoe, Deputy Lionel Booth and Deputy David Andrews holding forth on what they thought was good for the workers; indeed I think Deputy Andrews said that when he consulted his cumann in Glasthule they told him what he should write in the <i>Sunday Press.</i></P>
      <P>All of these people are entitled to express their point of view in the House, but I do not think we should have people who know absolutely nothing about labour relations pontificating on the subject in this House. The last speaker, Deputy Dr. Gibbons, expressed many views with which I do not disagree at all, but it was the Labour document on industrial democracy he discussed and not the Bills before the House.</P>
      <P>Other speakers discussed, in the main, the present labour troubles in Dublin.  Let me say straight away that I do not think it is the job of the Minister for Labour to try to stop the row that is going on in the labour field.  Anybody who says he should be able to do it immediately just by waving a wand is either being very naive or, alternatively, is trying to put him on the spot.  Nor do I agree with the point of view expressed by Deputy Booth last night.  I could not follow him, I am sorry to say.  Maybe I am a little bit dense, but he seemed to think that the present system of bargaining between the trade unions and the employers is not the ideal one and he did not seem to agree that there should be compulsory arbitration.  The only other way I know is a wand.  Maybe Deputy Booth has a wand which he can wave and settle these things; if he has he has not used it in a few disputes I could name.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy want me to give way to him?  I do not mind, if he thinks he can improve on what I am saying; he is perfectly entitled to do so.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Booth last night that there was another way of settling disputes. I do not know what that other way is.  He suggested something like this: Was there any reason why, since anybody else who had a dispute would have to go to the civil court, employers and workers should not have to go into court to have a dispute settled? Perhaps he worked that out in his own mind.  I have not been able to do so and I have not been able to understand what exactly he meant.  The plain fact is that the system of collective bargaining is the way in which we settle disputes.  The Labour Court is available to hear disputes.  From time to time people have mediated and have succeeded in settling them.  I know of no other way.  If they cannot <Col N="2314" /> be settled in those ways we then have the usual trial of strength.  All of us, no matter on which side of the House, deplore the present position and are very perturbed that so many innocent people are being affected by the disputes but there is one party in the disputes who so far have succeeded in sitting very far back from the firing line and in giving the impression that no matter who is at fault they are not at fault.  That party is the employers.</P>
      <P>I wonder if it is generally known that this dispute occurred at the end of a two-year agreement, that there was a three-months negotiating period and that in the three months before D-day there was absolutely nothing done, apart from a few skirmishes?  Then, people wonder why workers&mdash;they are entitled to their own views&mdash;who have asked for wage increases are not going to rush back to work when somebody suggests they might do so.  Could the first offer made by the employers be considered realistic in view of the fact that it appears that five offers have since been made by them?  If the fifth was not acceptable, would it not suggest that the first was pretty bad?  And the second and the third?</P>
      <P>We have these people sitting back and saying: &ldquo;What can we do with these unreasonable workers?&rdquo; Quite a number of employers throughout the country have, in fact, made a settlement with the striking unions and have succeeded in getting their employees back to work.  Many of them are preparing to get back to work in the next few days. Something which has apparently been forgotten is that while quite a number of trade unionists who have no connection with the dispute, other than that some of the striking unions have a few members on the job, are badly affected and that thousands of workers are out of work as a result.  We must not forget that the workers took this decision themselves.  There is a tradition, and one which many people would like to see broken down, and it is that one does not pass a strike picket.  If a picket is outside a job the genuine trade unionist will not pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all deplore the fact that many of these people and their families are suffering and that they have no hope <Col N="2315" /> of gaining anything when the strike is settled but they have taken the decision; they are out on principle and we must respect them for it.  If we want to put the blame on anybody for the hardship which these people are suffering it should go on the Department of Social Welfare because of their outdated arrangements whereby somebody who is out of work because a strike closes the job, even though he is only vaguely connected with the strike and may not be involved in it at all except as a result of a picket being put on his job, will not receive social welfare benefit. Is this because the Department of Social Welfare want to force them back to work or because they want to save the few shillings involved?  One or the other must be the answer.</P>
    <P>If the Department and many other people, particularly Ministers, who have been talking pretty loudly over the past couple of days&mdash;because they feel the people are becoming annoyed because they must do without some of their groceries, some of the things they should be entitled to buy&mdash;about the hardship being suffered by those who are out of work though not directly affected by the strike, would suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that there should be a relaxation so that these people could get social welfare benefit, much of the hardship could be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I heard a number of Deputies talking about unreasonable demands and asking: &ldquo;What do the strikers want? Are they entitled to get the big money?&rdquo; Indeed, one or two Fianna Fáil Deputies last night spoke of the fact that some of these people were getting the magnificent sum of £15 per week and said that if they had taken what they were offered they would get £18 and that if they worked some overtime, they would get over £20. Anybody who knows anything of working conditions would know that overtime is something the ordinary worker does not want because if he works hard during the day, as most of them do, it is rest he wants in the evening, not punching in a few extra hours in order to get the few shillings extra which he needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2316" /> If we are satisfied that this question of wages should have been settled and that these people should not look for increased wages for the trades they have, we must look at the whole of our society because I believe that the tradesman who may not have been to a university but who has served his time for five, six and, in some cases, seven years is as much entitled to a decent wage at the end of his time as somebody who may or may not have got a university degree and may have been lucky enough, for some reason or other, to go into management and is able to get two or three times as much as the tradesman.</P>
    <P>This whole problem is being misunderstood, deliberately or otherwise, by many people.  Deputy O'Leary spoke the other day about the big number of people who have £11 or £12 a week and, right in the middle of the dispute, we had the Taoiseach making an announcement that if there was no attempt to increase what he called the wages of the higher-paid workers he was prepared to recommend that lowerpaid workers, State and semi-State, should receive a substantial increase. Was he saying to the people now on strike: &ldquo;If you drop your claim for £2 or £3 a week I will give an extra £1 or £2 to the forestry workers, or the Board of Works, or to men in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the State are serious about increases for low-paid workers and if all the keening we now hear about these workers at present means anything, then without any further delay, their wages should be brought up without relation to the wages being paid to anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked a question here yesterday for a certain reason which had nothing to do with the strike.  Who causes the trouble in this country?  Who encourages a certain type of trouble?  Look at the headline in one of the evening papers here.  It says: &ldquo;State Chief Gets £1,960 Rise&mdash; Strikers Lash The Super-salaries&rdquo;.  They quote an unnamed prominent trade union official who criticises the type of increases that certain people have got in State and semi-State bodies.  I suggest the person who wrote that article <Col N="2317" /> was more interested in making a few extra shillings for himself out of the headline than in settling the industrial unrest.  If we had less of this and more honest appreciation of what is happening at present we would get on a lot better and would not have a lot of this damn nonsense that is going on at present.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the statements made by some Deputies over there, one finds food for thought.  I shall deal with one of them: Deputy Briscoe who, two or three years ago, bragged that he was speaking here as a trade unionist apparently has now cast his trade union card to the winds and speaks now as a capitalist.  Deputy O'Leary said that he did not think that a man who was 20 or 30 years in a job should lose his job because of technological change.  At column 1845 of Volume 238 of the Official Report, Deputy Briscoe comments as follows on Deputy O'Leary's statement:</P>
    <P>&mdash;I want to point out to the Deputy how negative his speech was.  In Volume 238, No. 10, of the Dáil Debates he says, at column 1408:</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to come along to the man who has worked at a job for 20 or 30 years and say: &ldquo;Technological change deprives you of your job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider that to be an irresponsible statement because if we do not make technological changes in our factories we will not be employing anybody in our factories.  It is stupid and unthinkable statements like this which cause a lot of confusion in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>So little Deputy Briscoe, turned capitalist, now says it is a terrible thing for a man who has been 30 years in a job to show any resentment if his boss tells him: &ldquo;We have a new machine. Here are your cards&rdquo;.  All I say to Deputy Briscoe is that, if any of my members are in his employment and he does anything like that, Trade Union Bill or no Trade Union Bill, he will have a strike on his hands before he knows what hit him, and that is the <Col N="2318" /> only way to deal with that sort of stupid comment.  We have too many of these stupid people still knocking around who believe that workers are necessary, but an evil nevertheless, and the sooner they can get rid of them the better.</P>
    <P>The whole approach to industrial relations has gone a bit screwy.  I sympathise with the Minister for Labour who is expected to be able to do wonderful things at very short notice. The Labour Court has been doing a good job.  Those engaged in the conciliation end of it have been doing an excellent job.  The only drawback is that there are not enough of them and they do not get enough appreciation. Their position is worse than that of the Members of this House because they can be called on from six o'clock in the morning until two o'clock the next morning and no one will say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; at the end of that tour of duty irrespective of whether the job is well done or badly done.  The Labour Court itself has one fault.  Because of the small numbers involved it takes far too long to get a hearing and, when the hearing comes off, to get the result of that hearing.  There was an idea not so long ago that strikes were like boils&mdash; they had to be allowed to mature. Those were the Labour Court's own words: in other words, strikes had to be allowed to mature before they could be handled or before any attempt could be made to settle them.  This resulted in a number of very expensive strikes, expensive to the employer, to the worker and to the trade unions involved.  That idea of maturity seems to have died now and the general practice is that, if a dispute occurs, or is about to occur, every effort is made to bring the people together as early and as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Chief Conciliation Officer, Mr. MacDermott, has got a very difficult job.  It is a pity there are not two or three more of his calibre who could be used in trying to iron out the difficulties which occur.  It is not just enough for the Minister to say he will add another court; he should add at least two or, if the Exchequer will stand it, three courts because there is such pressure of business from time to <Col N="2319" /> time that things drag out for months before even the really serious cases are taken and, because there are so many cases, there really is not sufficient time to look properly into the rights and wrongs and give a decision until the matter has got completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>Lest I forget it, tributes, deserved tributes, were paid to Jimmy Dunne, President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Observing those who were paying tribute I decided I would have to reread his speeches because there must be something wrong with them.  Some of the people who would not give fresh air to a trade unionist were coming in here and literally putting a halo on Jimmy Dunne.  Now this is a field in which I think the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has fallen down.  I do not think Jimmy Dunne should have made these statements as personal statements; he should have been talking for the Irish Congress Executive.  The Executive should have met and given him instructions as to the statements to be made.  I am quite sure the statements would be exactly the statements he made, but it is wrong that someone who, as well as being President of the Irish Congress, is also General Secretary of the Union which is up to its neck in the dispute, though they will gain nothing out of it, because they will not pass a picket, should be put in the position of having to come out and make statements which will not make him the most popular man in the trade union world in this country.</P>
    <P>There is the other problem then as to who exactly is carrying out negotiations in regard to this dispute.  I was not listening to the Seven Days Programme last night but I understand there were some members of the strike committee on the programme and that it was fairly clear these gentlemen felt they were the people who made the final decision to recommend or not to recommend.  In my 22 years as a trade union official I have been involved in a great number of strikes and it was always the practice for trade unions at their annual or biannual conference to elect a committee and an officer board. <Col N="2320" /> It is that committee which negotiates. If a strike takes place a strike committee is set up to ensure there are pickets available and that the routine work is carried out.  I do not think it was ever the practice for a strike committee to decide whether or not an offer was acceptable.  If that is the case now, then why are not these people carrying on the negotiations?  I am not competent to judge whether or not this is right or wrong&mdash;I am expressing my own view&mdash;but I think that, if people make up their minds to strike and that strike is pursued to the bitter end, then the only people who are in a position to say when the end is reached are those who are carrying out the negotiations and they are the officials appointed by the general body of unions to run the union.</P>
    <P>I have heard a great deal of comment here and outside about Irish-based and British-based unions and the way decisions and votes are taken.  I was amazed at the people here particularly, who should know better, who seemed so very ignorant of what goes on.  When the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was officially set up after the dispute with the two Congresses the one point that held matters up month after month after month was the fact that the Congress of Irish Unions would not agree to come in until all the British-based unions had Irish autonomy.</P>
    <P>That was finally agreed on and anyone who talks of British-based unions as if someone in Whitehall was taking decisions for their members in Dublin does not know the facts.  They cannot be members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, they cannot even be accepted into affiliation until such time as they clear up that snag.  The position is that all the unions involved in this dispute and operating here are in fact Irish-based.  The one advantage they have over us is the fact that they can fall back on vast financial resources in Britain.  They can always ask for a few shillings if money is scarce, while we have to depend on what we have.  That is the only difference. Anyone who talks about English-based unions trying to disrupt the economy of this country by <Col N="2321" /> carrying on this strike is talking a lot of nonsense.</P>
    <P>One thing struck me yesterday evening when I was listening to Deputy Booth.  I do not know whether he meant it, but he let the cat out of the bag.  He pointed out the terrible suffering which must fall on a household where people are on strike for five or six weeks.  Those of us who have been involved in strikes have known this for a long time.  Deputy Andrews talked about worse cases.  Deputy Booth said that the people who really suffer are those who are on strike because, he said, in normal circumstances all the difference it makes to the employer in a big firm is that there may be a drop of one per cent in the dividend at the end of the year.  That is all the difference it makes.</P>
    <P>It is a sobering thought.  The FUE could quite easily have put an end to this dispute a month ago by saying: &ldquo;Instead of giving you another 6d next October, we will give you an extra 6d now&rdquo;.  Why did they not do that?  Because, Deputy Booth says, it does not matter a damn.  It only means a drop of one per cent in the dividend and apart from that it does not matter at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talking earlier referred to the fact that the family firm seldom has a big dispute.  I agree with him that is so, but I do not think it is so for exactly the reason Deputy Dillon thought it was.  He referred to the fact that they were closer to the workers and therefore there was more dialogue, to use the modern word. That may be partly the reason but, in addition, there is the fact that if a family firm has a strike then there is a loss to that firm.  When it is spread over a big number of shareholders the loss is not felt.  That is the whole kernel of the trouble.  That is what caused the present strike and previous strikes to drag out over a very long period.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, listening to people talking here I was reminded that some two or three years ago I was in Wiesbaden in Germany where there was an employer-worker conference which had to do with emigrant workers. <Col N="2322" /> I was amazed to hear a German employer there who was taking in most of his workers from Italy, and some of them from Spain, explaining that there was a 75 per cent loss in turnover in workers over each six weeks period.  I thought this was extraordinary and afterwards I asked him how he had worked it out, and was it not rather strange for him to be training workers if at the end of six weeks when they were properly trained they went along to another job.  He could not see anything wrong in that.  As a matter of fact, he said this was cheaper because there were always more workers coming and if he kept them he would have to pay them more.  So, by letting them move off he could get a new batch to do the work which was rather rough and that was all right.</P>
    <P>I am afraid Deputy Flanagan's comments about the German who was employed in this country and wanted &mdash;what did he call them&mdash;the blue bonus mark to be put up&mdash;I know where they should have been put&mdash;are applicable to the attitude of many Germans in their own country and, indeed, to certain Irish employers here who would do the very same thing but they would probably have some other name for it.  At present it is not unusual to find workers taking what the law allows, the minimum half hour for lunch.  They must take a half an hour because they have to have a rest after five hours.  That is what the law says. They are anxious to get the job done and finished as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as far as the workers here are concerned is that they only want a living wage. It appears as if there are people here who do not agree that a living wage is what these people are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a lot of talk about the system of balloting, whether or not a ballot should be taken, and the way in which it should be taken.  I may take a different view from some other people on this but, if I had my own way of doing things, I would suggest that if a strike is to take place there should be a secret ballot; that not only should there be a secret ballot but that a <Col N="2323" /> majority of those employed in the firm affected by the strike should vote in favour of strike action.  I would not like to see a situation in which, as we are told happened some years ago, about 15,000 people were employed in an industry, 15 turned up for a meeting, eight voted for a strike and seven against it, and it was six weeks before the strike was finished.</P>
    <P>Workers, I am afraid, have not yet realised that there are many things in their own hands which they can deal with.  The sooner the workers realise that if there is a dispute on the job it is not someone else's responsibility but their responsibility the better.  They should be there to ballot.  They should be there to have their say.  They should be there to vote.  The sooner this is done the better.  How do you take the vote? Ballot votes certainly, because when it is a show of hands you see one man looking at the man beside him to see how he is voting because it is safer to do that than to put up his hand in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>There is an objection to taking a ballot on the job.  Deputy Booth says the workers are tired after their day's work and should be allowed to wash up and go home, and then when they go home they will not come back.  I saw a postal ballot tried.  The Minister will hardly credit it but there were people who would not think it worth their while to make an X on a piece of paper and put it into a stamped addressed envelope even though their livelihood depended on it.  The trade unions must educate their members to a stage where they realise that the really important thing as far as decision-making is concerned is that it is their decision, and they must take it.  When we reach that stage I am quite sure labour relations will take an upward turn.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of balloting is concerned, or anything else which is contained in the Trade Union Bill, I feel that the Minister is entirely wrong in attempting to legislate to make people do things.  He says there is no compulsion intended.  This Bill means, &ldquo;You do&rdquo; and even though no penalties are mentioned what is the use?  We <Col N="2324" /> had the penalties in the ESB Bill and we saw what happened.  Fianna Fáil, with the assistance of Fine Gael, voted the Bill through.  We said it was wrong. We said it could not work.  We said you could not force a man to work.  They said they were passing it and Fine Gael voted for it.  Eventually when they tried to operate it they put people in jail and they had to send someone to pay the fines in the middle of the night. Could anything be more ridiculous than that?</P>
    <P>The other night here, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave who normally is a very mild man, got a little hot under the collar and said that he considered that the Bill was wrong, that it was unworkable but that if it came up again he would do the same again.  I cannot follow that line of argument. I believe the thing was wrong. Every one of us should admit that it was wrong and forget about it.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal in detail with the Bill which the Minister has now before the House I should just like to refer to the reply the Minister gave me to a question the other day.  I asked him if it was proposed to introduce a Bill to remedy the situation created by the Fitzpatrick judgement.  He said it was not.  I pointed out to him that his predecessor had promised that such a Bill would be introduced The Minister said: &ldquo;No, that is not correct.&rdquo;  I shall tell you what happened.  He agreed to set up a party which would investigate it and so on, and they would come to a decision and subsequently they had discussions with ICTU and the thing had blown up.  It was something like the Blaney-NFA row, apparently&mdash;the Minister and the trade unions stopped talking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me read to the Minister exactly what he said at the time&mdash;and Mr. McCarthy, I am sure, will remember word for word of it.  It is dated 1 Aibreán, 1966&mdash;a long <Col N="2325" /> time ago&mdash;and it starts with a good old Irish &ldquo;A Chairde&rdquo;, and continues as follows:</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to send you herewith particulars of proposals for the amendment of the law on industrial relations and for the amendment of trade union law.  The Minister intends to introduce the amending legislation without delay and he would be glad to receive any observations you may wish to offer on his proposals as soon as possible. Officers of the Department will be available for consultation on any aspects of the proposals which you consider require elucidation.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the amending legislation will be enacted in two separate measures, one for industrial relations and the other for trade union law.  In addition, separate legislation will be introduced at the same time to deal with a situation that arose following a Supreme Court decision in December, 1961, in the matter of peaceful picketing.</P>
      <P>A similar letter and particulars of the Minister's proposals have been sent to the FUE.  The Minister has not, as of this date, furnished particulars of his proposals to any other outside body.</P>
      <P>That is a definite undertaking which has not been kept by the Minister.  I see no reason why he should not, even at this late stage, put his hand on his heart and say &ldquo;I have given my word and I am now going to carry out what in fact I said I would carry out&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say it was intended to do it?  Do not read the whole letter again, just the relevant part.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Separate legislation will be introduced at the same time to deal with the situation that arose following a Supreme Court decision in December, 1961, in the matter of peaceful picketing&rdquo;&mdash;not &ldquo;is intended&rdquo; to be introduced.  We all know what that means.  I shall let the Minister have this letter lest his files have <Col N="2326" /> become mixed up.  He might like to have another look at it himself.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to the Bill itself, let me make a further comment on the question of industrial democracy. Deputy Dr. Hugh Gibbons was talking about the Labour Party document on industrial relations.  The one thing about his speech that struck me as rather peculiar was this?  Quite a number of his Party, including Deputy Flor Crowley and Deputy Joseph Dowling, in particular, have been howling since it came out and calling us &ldquo;Communists&rdquo; because of it.  Deputy Dr. Hugh Gibbons, who is secretary of the Fianna Fáil group set up to consider the document, says he agrees with most of it.  As a matter of fact, at one stage he said he agreed with all of it.  Either there is nothing wrong with the document or else Deputy Dr. Hugh Gibbons, like the rest of us, is a &ldquo;Red&rdquo;.  I shall leave him to puzzle that one out.  It certainly puts things in a peculiar light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Industrial Relations Bill, the Bill itself is very good and in many ways is very desirable.  Under section 2, the Minister may, if he so wishes, appoint six persons to be ordinary members of the Labour Court, in place of four persons as at present.  I suggest that he increase that number again as I do not think that six persons would be sufficient.</P>
      <P>Section 3 enables the Chairman of the Labour Court to divide the court into three divisions of equal status, if he thinks this is necessary for the speedy despatch of business.  At present, the Chairman can divide the court into two divisions of equal status. Section 4 obliges the Minister to appoint one deputy-Chairman of the Labour Court and enables him to appoint a second deputy-Chairman, if necessary.  This is a good idea&mdash;more than one deputy-Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of industrial relations, the effect of section 6 is to change the description of certain officers of the Labour Court from &ldquo;conciliation officers&rdquo; to &ldquo;industrial <Col N="2327" /> relations officers&rdquo;.  It does not matter. What is in a name?</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables the Labour Court to give an interpretation of an employment agreement if asked to do so by the parties.  They already do that, in the main.  I think that is a good idea, too.</P>
    <P>Section 8 establishes that Labour Court hearings will be in private, but if a party to the disputes asks for a public hearing the court will have discretionary power to hear the case in public.  Again, this is normal practice.  It further provides that if, in the course of a public hearing, a matter arises which, in the interest of a party to the dispute, should be treated as confidential, the court can conduct that part of the hearing in private.  Again, it is true that very often documents, particularly documents which might injure an employer if they were disclosed, are treated with confidence even if they are shown to the trade union side of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that specified Public Sector arbitration boards shall include a workers' member and an employers' member of the Labour Court. Why did the Minister not include the Agricultural Wages Board there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is separate legislation. It is a statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has set down this for the purpose of trying to keep in line with wage agreements from one board to the other.  Is it the thinking that the Agricultural Wages Board are dealing with people who are so badly paid and just in case somebody would find out and say: &ldquo;These fellows have to come up&rdquo;?  If not, would the Minister add the Agricultural Wages Board to section 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put down an amendment to that effect.  Section 10 enables an employer or a trade union of employers affected by an employment agreement registered with the Labour Court to complain to the court that an employer, affected by the agreement, has failed or neglected to <Col N="2328" /> comply with the agreement.  This section also gives general legal status to registered employment agreements, with penalties for failure or neglect to comply with the agreements.  Again, the Minister appears completely to have overlooked the question of the State or semi-State ones, even though, at a later stage, the Minister has a section not exactly bringing in those workers but giving himself authority to bring them in.  Why does the Minister not say now: &ldquo;They are in&rdquo;?  I shall come to that in a minute.</P>
      <P>Section 11 empowers the Labour Court, in consultation with representative organisations of workers and employers, to draw up rules of fair employment in various industries.  The rules would have legal status with penalties for contraventions.  Again, there are certain sections left out and I should be glad if the Minister would have another look at this.</P>
      <P>Section 13 enables the Minister to appoint rights commissioners.  Again, what is in a name?  A commissioner will investigate, privately, a trade dispute which exists or is apprehended, at the request of a party to the dispute, unless the other party objects.  How many of those people does the Minister consider should be appointed?  Is it only one, a kind of ombudsman, or are there to be a number of them to work in the same way as existing conciliation officers?  There does not seem to be any point in it because a lot of the work which the Minister proposes to have done in the Bill has been done, and quite well, by conciliation officers. Perhaps, they did not have authority to do it.  Changing their name in the Bill does not make any difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 refers to Part VI of the Principal Act and says that the Minister for Finance may from time to time designate for the purposes of subsection (1) of the section to do certain things.  Why does the Minister not say that these workers come directly under the Labour Court?  Here he is giving authority to the Minister for Finance to make an order if, at a later stage, he can persuade him to do so.  Why is it worded in that way? Would not the Minister say directly <Col N="2329" />&ldquo;therein&rdquo; or &ldquo;thereout&rdquo;?  One of the last things Deputy Lemass did before leaving office was to give a guarantee that these workers would be brought under some kind of conciliation and arbitration.  If Deputy Lemass saw fit to do so and if Deputy Lynch said that the Labour Court was the proper place, why is the Minister for Labour so coy by saying that he will give a right to the other Minister?</P>

      <P>It is provided in that section that the Government may by order amend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in Part VI of the Principal Act.  There is an extraordinary thing in this.  Somebody spoke about the Donovan Report in Britain.  It appears that the Donovan Report makes the point that a worker is an unskilled manual worker or a tradesman, but it does not include either a clerical officer or a person who is not normally either of the first categories.  It is something the Minister might have a look at. Perhaps, his Department know about it already.  I have got a few more of these which I think the Minister had up his sleeve in the hope that nobody would refer to them, that we would blunder along until somebody stepped over the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this wise?  There is a change being made and I wonder if this is being done deliberately to get at a certain person who made recommendations which saved us a lot of trouble, but <Col N="2330" /> whose last recommendation did not agree with the official side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is now being enacted.  I ask the Minister to be very careful before he does this.  As far as the Trade Union Bill is concerned, it is doubtful if certain provisions in it are proper for dealing with trade disputes. The Minister did not explain how successful his Department were with the ICTU in getting agreement in connection with group negotiating licences.  There are groups already carrying on under a system like that which the Minister proposes here.  I do not know whether this matter is modelled on the system which operates in Bord na Móna who, under their terms of reference, have been doing this for a number of years.  There was one major dispute there last year and there is a report on which I do not know if it is the Minister or somebody else who is sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The report could be produced and I am sure it would make interesting reading at the present time.  There is provision in Part III of this Bill amending section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  Section 10 implies&mdash;it is interesting&mdash;a provision that sections 4 and 5 of the 1906 Act shall apply only in relation to an authorised trade union which is the holder of a negotiating licence but if we go back to section 9 we find that the protection extends to unofficial pickets.  The Government should clarify their attitude to unofficial picketing&mdash; whether they should have the same protection as those holding a trade union licence.  It does not look to me to be very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 proposes to extend the provision of the 1906 Act by a deletion from the definition of &ldquo;workmen&rdquo; in subsection (3).  Afterwards we come across the situation that no matter what the Minister is proposing here, there is no protection being given to either State employees or local authority employees as far as a trade dispute is concerned.  Up to now there have <Col N="2331" /> been disputes but the fact that the workers in these categories have been breaking the law usually has been ignored.  In section 11, the Minister proposes to extend the 1906 Act to local authority and State employees and I am saying that what we are proposing does not give that protection at all.  Therefore, I should be glad if the Minister would have another look at it. I will put in an amendment because, perhaps, this either did not come to the Minister's notice or it was done deliberately.</P>

      <P>O.K.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Criminal Justice Bill there is a section to permit picketing of Leinster <Col N="2332" /> House by persons directly employed in Leinster House.  I think this should be included in the Trade Union Bill so that we will be able to keep it all together.  The Minister should also explain that section 11 has the effect of nullifying the effect of the section of the Offences Against the State Act which deals with picketing of Leinster House.  If the Bill is passed it will be necessary to consult a number of Acts to assemble a full definition of &ldquo;trade union&rdquo;.  I think there should be a full definition of &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; in the Bill.  I wrote to the Minister about that and I have some information on it.  I am not altogether happy that the position is as stated in the reply which I got.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 14 and the requirement of having a ballot before serving strike notice, the section, as drafted, says a majority of the members of the union shall approve of such service.  I think this is a drafting error. It must be.  The Irish Transport and General Workers Union have 150,000 members and if a dispute arose concerning 20 members according to the Bill it could be interpreted that the whole 150,000 would have to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there would be.  The trouble is that what the Minister would like to do and what a <Col N="2333" /> court would decide was, in fact, the law might be two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be fixed up, then.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides for grants towards expenses of amalgamation of trade unions.  At first I thought this was rather generous but I found that section 12 of the Trade Union Act of 1876 lays down exactly what the Minister proposes now.  I am sure he knew this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost exactly word for word.  It might not be a bad idea if the Minister added some section to consolidate the existing law. There are two Bills already dealing with this and, perhaps, if the Minister could consolidate the law it might be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think what is there is enough because as well as financial assistance we would have to give any assistance the House could give in the way of legislative changes. I think we would need to make provision for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Trade Dispute Act of 1906 is also involved.  It is difficult to understand why the entire Act is not inserted in Part III to go with the appropriate paragraph of the 1876 Act.  It would be as well if the Minister had put the whole lot in even as a Schedule to the Bill.  It would mean that we could then relate one to the other.  The biggest trouble in this House as far as I am concerned is that occasionally one gets a whole list of Acts which are referred to as being amended or being completely wiped out and it would take days to try to pick them out and find out what exactly they say.  In some cases they say something which is entirely different from the impression one gets on reading the amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;industry&rdquo; in section 2 of the Redundancy Payments Act, <Col N="2334" /> 1967 with a view to an amendment to this Bill on similar lines.  I feel the Minister should use this definition because it is as recent as 1967 and it does clear up the situation with regard to what a business is and what an industry is.  That is in section 2 of the Redundancy Payments Act.  It is his own Department and he should use it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the group negotiation licence it would appear that sections of this part are not operative until Congress applies for a licence.  There seems to be nothing in sections 4 and 5 which has not already been in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison was pointing out something here last night and as far as he went I considered he was pretty good on it.  He did miss out one point. He made the point that if a ballot was taken and it was decided to take strike action and subsequently it turned out that there were negotiations which might possibly settle it if strike notice could be withdrawn that the members might be reluctant to withdraw strike notice because if they did they would have to go through the same rigmarole again.  I do not agree.  I think it would be possible to withdraw strike notice altogether.  I imagine he was right in that because it would mean that you withdrew it and you must go through the same procedure again.  With regard to the ballot before a strike, it seems the strike could not be ended officially without a ballot.  This could prolong a strike.  Very often you have disputes, strike notice is served, the employer meets the trade union, discusses the matter, makes an offer which appears to be reasonable and instructions can be given to the employees that the strike is off.  Strike notice could be withdrawn straight off the reel.  According to the Bill you would have to have a ballot to end a strike as well as to start it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the executive that is given the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing.  At the present time the situation is that somebody takes a decision to have a strike and it goes before a union executive.  They may decide that the employer is unable to pay or that <Col N="2335" /> it is unrealistic to go on strike.  They can decide that the strike should not take place.  They do that now.  It is a different thing if the strike notice has been served or a strike is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not have to have a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A settlement is made.  The workers are told the strike is over.  As I read this, it could be held that it would be necessary to have a ballot to end the strike.  The Minister shakes his head.  I hope he is right, but that is my reading of it anyway.</P>
      <P>Why must notice of strike be deposited with the Labour Court instead of Congress?  At the present time notice is given to Congress and I believe it would be better if that were done.</P>
      <P>Finally, on the Trade Union Bill I personally believe that the Minister should not introduce legislation of this kind.  I think the onus is on Congress. I seriously believe that this is not a matter for this House.  I believe that and I have no hesitation in saying it. I am sure I will get criticism for it.  I believe that Congress have been weak in this particular instance.  I believe that Congress should be directing.  I know they are only consultative and have been accepted as being consultative for a long time but I believe that in a serious crisis&mdash;this is my personal view&mdash;they are the top body to which we are all affiliated.  We pay substantial dues to them.  They supply a certain service.  It should not be confined to just advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congress should lay down rules as to how to run a strike, as to how to start one and how to end it, of how negotiations should go and there should be no question whatever of any Government coming in and saying that they will do this, that or the other thing.  You cannot legislate workers into going to work if they do not wish to do so.  Deputy Dillon says you can, that Hitler did it, that he hanged them and sent them to jail.  Perhaps, the first lot will go back to work but it will only be a very short time until somebody will decide that they will not stand for this kind of treatment and that is the end of it.  As far as <Col N="2336" /> the Trade Union Bill is concerned we should say to Congress: &ldquo;This is your job.  You do it&rdquo;.  If some rules and regulations have to be laid down let Congress decide on them, let Congress put their own house in order and let the trade unions put their own house in order and when that is done there will be no need for repressive legislation in this House.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the Minister likes to put it that way, if the Trade Union Bill passes through this House in its present form or in any other form and becomes law, it will be considered repressive legislation.  It will be objected to and then there will be trouble, the same trouble as we have now.  I would urgently appeal to the Minister, and I know he will understand that I am most earnest in this appeal, that even though it is nearly three years since the Bill was introduced in this House, he should now withdraw it.  I believe that something happened about this Bill.  It was introduced here almost three years ago, the Congress and FUE discussed the matter, the Minister had discussions with Congress and then, at a particular stage, something happened and the Minister came along and announced that Congress had walked out.  Was that all that happened?</P>
    <P>When the NFA had trouble with the Department of Agriculture they kicked up such a row that the whole country knew that something was wrong.  Are we to take it that Congress just walked out and then sat tight and made no representations whatever to the Minister and allowed things to drag until a stage was reached when the Minister introduced his Bill in the House?  Are we to understand that Congress, having got a copy of the Bill, then just issued a statement saying that they did not agree with it?  I think that is not the normal approach of the Minister to these things.  I believe he is as anxious as I am to see industrial relations in this country placed on a proper basis and I do not think he is going to do that by saying to Congress and the unions: &ldquo;This is the Bill.  You can take it or leave it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that even at this late stage he should say to Congress that they should handle the <Col N="2337" /> whole problem themselves, that he should withdraw the Bill.  If that is done it will be very much in the interest of establishing proper industrial relations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other Bill, sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are noncontentious. Legislation giving effect to these proposals should have been promoted in 1956 or the years immediately following. It became abundantly clear then that the Labour Court was undermanned and that the absence of one member through illness reduced the effectiveness of the court by 50 per cent.  This was not as it should be.  On that point I would ask the Minister if he has arranged any form of promotion within the court itself.  I believe the line of promotion was from outside the court into the court and then, when an officer of the court had learned his job, back he went into the Civil Service.  We could not object to this because we knew that promotion lay outside the court but we do know that some of the best conciliation officers we ever had disappeared overnight.  In that connection also I am glad that provision has been made for pensions for some of the older members of the court.  We all greeted that announcement with jubilation, we are glad to see it happen.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a modification of section 19 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 and there is nothing at all wrong with this.  As I have already said the Agricultural Wages Board should be included in section 9 and the Minister should have provided for a joint labour committee for agricultural workers under section 4 of the Act of 1946.  I do not know if the Minister knows that the Agricultural Wages Board is the most outmoded piece of machinery it would be possible to find and the opportunity should now be taken to do something about it.  The Minister may say that he has nothing to do with this as these are not industrial workers but surely he must know that agriculture is the primary industry of the State.  We hear of the thousands of Agricultural workers who leave the land but the miracle is that any stay at all.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that it is only those at the bottom for whom the Agricultural Wages Board fixes the <Col N="2338" /> rate and that rate does not apply to the higher-paid workers.  It it only when one finds a group of agricultural workers getting £15 or £16 a week and individual workers working on farms at £10 2s per week that one knows something is wrong.  When one asks the employing farmer why this is so he will say that he is paying the fixed rate.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that there is no doubt that section 11 will not extend ordinary trade union protection to local authority and State employees. There is nothing in the Act of 1906 to bind the Crown.  Again, the Donovan Report makes it clear that this is the case.  It is possible that section 4 is intended to rectify the court decision in the Carlingford Lough dispute.  In his speech introducing the Bill the Minister stated that the terms of the Bill made it clear that protection exists for members of trade unions holding negotiating licences but section 11 of the Bill does not give effect to that statement of the Minister. I propose to put down amendments on that point but if the Minister has amendments on it I will withdraw mine because the Minister's amendments will go through while mine will get the knock.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Labour Court I would suggest that the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the court should not appoint an officer to the court if objection is made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  While we have had very fair treatment from time to time, occasionally we have got the feeling a case being heard was not getting as favourable a hearing as it might. Indeed, I heard some of my colleagues talking about the Joint Labour Committee. I had an unfortunate experience in connection with one of them, where a chairman of the Joint Labour Committee came into a side conference, advised on the amendment of a proposal which was before the committee, and when we went back in and put his amended proposal before him he voted against it and ruled it out.  This is the sort of thing that makes trade union officials a little bit mad.  I got out of it by resigning from the Joint Labour Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2339" /> There are many things we could deal with but I know the Minister is sick and tired of the whole discussion, and I would not blame him.  However, when the Bills are so important it would be a pity if they went through the House without getting the very fullest investigation.</P>
    <P>While many people feel the Minister should have Deputy Booth's wand which would enable him to go out and settle industrial disputes at the drop of a hat, I do not agree with this.  He can offer intervention as an individual the same as anybody else. Ministers of State have done it before successfully.  I remember the late Deputy Norton on one occasion sitting up all night to settle a dispute with CIE.  However, it is unfair to say to the Minister: &ldquo;It is your job.  You are responsible if it is not settled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also unfair to say the whole trouble is caused by a group of trade unionists who are greedy and looking for too much.  They are looking for fair recompense for the trade, for the essential work these employees carry out.  The fact that some employers have found it possible to pay them the rate proves that it is not unreasonable. As far as the employers generally are concerned, they have done very little in regard to meeting the demands. They are sitting in the background waiting for everybody to criticise the trade unions and say they are irresponsible. We all regret the involvement of so many people outside who have nothing to gain by the dispute.  The trade unions who are supporting these people who are out, though they may be finding it pretty hard to do it, have been paying out vast sums of money. The amount to the individual trade unionist is possibly small, but the total amount is considerable.</P>
    <P>I agree there does appear to be an air of unreality about the whole thing. I discovered from long experience that no matter how bitter a dispute may have been and no matter what may have caused it, eventually it is settled by sensible men sitting around a table and hammering it out.  It is very easy to say that the country cannot afford it. It is very easy to say that the reason the demands are not being conceded <Col N="2340" /> is that they are too big.  However, Deputy Booth took the lid off that last night when he said that the only difference it would make to most of the firms was a drop of one per cent in their dividends.  If that is correct, then the dispute should not be running as long as it is.  It should have been settled long ago.</P>
    <P>My only wish is that those who have been meddling in this dispute in an effort to make political capital out of it; those who have been meddling in the dispute and trying to give the impression either that the men are greedy or trying to set one trade union against another; those who are meddling in the dispute and who do not give two hoots as long as they themselves come out scot free; my wish is that they would all keep out of this and allow the situation to reach normality, because in four or five weeks time if you mention the maintenance strike lots of people will not know what you are talking about.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience over the years that no matter how bitter a dispute is, while it may be remembered by those who have not had a wage packet for many weeks, even they do not want to talk about it.  That is the normality of things and every dispute can be settled by good sense, not by slagging people on the radio, on television or in the newspapers or by scare headlines in the evening papers such as I referred to a few minutes ago. That is not helping the situation at all.  We should let these people go about their business; let the people who have been appointed to represent the workers represent them, and let the employers meet them and make a fair offer.  If that is done the dispute could be over in five minutes, and the sooner it is over the better we shall all be pleased.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully commenced his speech by saying that mainly legal men talk on legal Bills, and he felt that this being a Trade Union Bill it was one on which members and officials of trade unions were well qualified to speak.  I could not agree more with him, and I am sure his long and enlightening address has been a useful contribution to the <Col N="2341" /> debate.  However, he also agreed that the ordinary Deputy who was not so qualified was also entitled to speak. This is one of the blessings or one of the defects of democracy.  I belong to the category that would not be qualified as Deputy Tully is as a trade union official; neither am I a legal man.</P>
      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan said this evening that the people were very critical of the Department of Labour, that because they cannot see any work being done by the Department of Labour, as they can see in the case of the Department of Agriculture, Finance or Industry and Commerce, the people are inclined to think that that Department are not working. Even if the Department were to be still slower, if they are laying the ground work firmly as I believe they are, and if in the end, to use Deputy Flanagan's words, they can produce a &ldquo;Ten Commandments&rdquo; for better industrial relations, no matter how long it takes, it will have been well worth-while.</P>
      <P>The present industrial unrest is a national problem.  Some people may say that perhaps the Department of Labour or the Government as a whole are being easy, that they are playing for time and not in any great hurry to settle this unrest, in the hope that prior to a general election, which we all know must come soon, they can step in and settle this dispute, and then, as an election gimmick, tell the electorate that Fianna Fáil is the only Party that can create calm out of this chaos and this unrest and that no other Party is capable of doing it.  I do not think this line will prove successful, because the electorate are now well enough educated not to be deceived by such propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade unions have a useful purpose in society.  In the early years of the State workers had to endure great hardship and it was only due to the efforts of people like the late Jim Larkin, senior, and others that they were given some rights and some place in society.  For many years the gap between workers and bosses had been too pronounced.  The bosses were inclined at times to look at the worker as being in a different and lower class <Col N="2342" /> and the worker, in turn, distrusted the bosses.  You also had this situation between skilled workers and tradesmen and the ordinary labourer.  Not so long ago it was quite common here in Dublin, particularly in the plumbing trade, to see the helper walking four or five paces behind the tradesman. Because he was not a tradesman it was not considered proper that he should walk beside one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also spoke of experiences on building sites and much of what he said is quite true.  In many cases workers were sacked because the foreman or boss did not like their looks. It was also commonplace here at times, particularly on Dublin building sites, for the worker to leave a matchbox for the foreman to ensure that on Saturday night, if some people were being laid off, he could hope not to be among them.  This also happened in rural Ireland on road works.  Road workers at one stage were only paid fortnightly and one man would be detailed to collect the cheques for the others in the local towns.  If he did not entertain the ganger or foreman he was in danger of losing his job.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that no sensible person, whether boss or worker, wants a strike.  A strike of any duration upsets the smooth running of a business and cannot be of any benefit. Surely the worker does not want it?  Anybody who has seen some of those on strike in Dublin for a few weeks and the privations of their families knows only too well that workers do not want a strike.  They do not lightly take a decision to strike. There may be the exception of a few hot-heads but they are in a minority and the ordinary worker does not lightly decide to strike.</P>
    <P>Relations between management and workers require improvement and if we had this improvement and had better relations it would go a long way towards eliminating strikes.  I believe that at all times in industrial relations the emphasis should be on the prevention of strikes.  If you have good industrial relations it will have a very desirable result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said yesterday, or the day before, that some, or even many, strikes are due to misfits being <Col N="2343" /> placed in key positions because of family connections.  I do not doubt that this may happen but surely there is nothing wrong in the case of anybody who has built up a business putting his own relations into positions in it, if he so desires?  It is a right and nobody can prevent him exercising it. If, as a result of putting misfits into key positions the business fails, who loses but the firm?  Granted, some workers may suffer also but, surely, if somebody loses his own business as a result of bringing misfits into it, that cannot in any way be compared to the position where misfits were put into State and semi-State bodies?  Some misfits were put into such bodies, perhaps, not into top positions but into key positions and, as a result, who suffered?  Was it not the taxpayers?  It is one thing to suffer as a result of your own neglect, but it is a very different thing when people brought in because of their political affiliations are misfits, with the result that the Exchequer has to subsidise these concerns which should be making a profit and the ordinary taxpayer has to shell out.  That is much worse than the case where a relative of the owner of a firm, by being a misfit, causes his firm to lose money.</P>
    <P>No matter what legislation we enact legislation never was and never will be the ideal solution to relations between worker and management.  Unless there is proper cohesion and understanding between management and workers legislation is only a poor substitute. I cannot see how any Government can ask workers to be calm and not seek increases when they put no stop to the spiralling increases in the cost of living. Answering a question last September the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that up to then in that year he had allowed 300 increases.  In most cases people must apply before they can get an increase.  Again, in the month of January this year the Minister sanctioned 25 more increases.  In view of this constant increase of the cost of living there is not much sense in the Government appealing to the workers for restraint and asking them not to seek increases.  If the Government would put their pride in their pocket <Col N="2344" /> and forget that it was Fine Gael who enunciated a proper prices and incomes policy and if they would adopt that Fine Gael prices and incomes policy, while it might not be the ideal solution, it would go a long way towards remedying a great deal of this industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>One speaker mentioned the Labour Court and wondered why the findings of that court were not made binding. I do not profess to have the perfect answer, but I do not think that would work out.  No power can make a worker work if he does not want to work. There is the old adage that you can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink: you may pass rules, regulations and laws to make workers work and you may try to encourage or coerce them but, if a worker does not want to work, then he just will not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the difference in the attitude of the Labour Party to these two Bills prior to their publication and since publication.  For two or three years we heard them described as repressive legislation, although the Labour Party were unaware of the contents of them. It must be disappointing to the Labour Party to find that there is not one repressive provision in either Bill.  On the contrary, they are an effort by the Minister to try and clear up some of the many difficulties afflicting trade unionism by giving the trade unions an opportunity voluntarily to put their own house in order rather than by forcing them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth while, I think, to make a comparison between these two Bills and the White Paper which Mrs. Barbara Castle introduced in Britain last week.  That White Paper, which Mrs. Castle so optimistically entitled &ldquo;In Place of Strife&rdquo;, is introduced by a Labour Government which prides itself on its socialism and it goes very, very far, indeed, beyond what the Minister proposes here.  It is apparently accepted by the British Labour Party as being in accordance with their traditions and as not being offensive to trade unions.  Because of that I find it very hard to understand how the Labour Party here can legitimately <Col N="2345" /> object to the proposals in these Bills, unless, of course, the Labour Party here is very much more to the left than Mr. Wilson's Government are.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, a great many people here believe that much of the trouble in this present unfortunate dispute is due to the fact that we have quite a number of British unions here. Their membership is small; it is only a couple of hundred or so but, in the earlier stages of the dispute, these seem to cause a great deal of trouble.  As the House is aware, there are various restrictions on non-nationals who carry on business here, but there appears to be no restriction whatever on foreign trade unions carrying on business here. Neither do I see anything in this Bill in that connection.  In fact, one section seems to have in mind more foreign trade unions being established here.  It refers specifically to the fact that they must comply with the new regulations proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he might consider something on the lines of the Insurance Act of 1936 whereby only foreign insurance companies which were trading here at the time could get licences to continue to trade. That would not do any injustice to existing trade unions and it might well do something to discourage this large number of very small unions.  One of the difficulties is that these unions have very few members here and a great many members in Britain and the great many members there are able, without any hardship whatever, to subsidise the very few members here in the case of a prolonged dispute.  It may well be that that subsidisation is making this very much more difficult for the members of Irish unions which are not in a position to finance their members over a long period of dispute. The present dispute has developed to such an extent that one could not now just put one's fingure on what precisely is wrong but it did appear at an earlier stage that a very small number of members of foreign unions were tending to keep a great many general workers who belonged to Irish unions out of employment at a time when the Irish unions were very anxious to settle matters.  If possible we <Col N="2346" /> should do everything we can to avoid a repetition of that situation in the future.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of trade unionism to which I should like to refer briefly.  The Minister might, if he finds it feasible, introduce legislation to deal with the problem.  In craft unions which cater for tradesmen there appears to be a closed shop inasmuch as only certain people will be considered for membership.  My experience is that these are the sons of existing members.  I know two young tradesmen, very highly skilled and qualified.  They acquired their skill by serving their time in England.  Having become efficient and fully qualified they decided they would like to come home.  They did so and found it impossible, or practically impossible, to obtain employment because of the fact that they could not get a union card.</P>
    <P>I can well see the point of view of the existing members of those unions and the point of view of the officials. At the same time, a closed shop is basically a wrong concept in any sphere of life.  One does not get that in the more progressive countries and that is probably why so many people emigrate.  There are opportunities abroad, or so they feel.  This is one instance, at least, where that fact is borne out because you do not tend to get closed shops in other countries.  I do not know whether this is a matter about which one could successfully legislate but it is, perhaps, something to which the Minister might give some thought.  It is a discouragement to people who might otherwise qualify to enter certain trades, and it is an encouragement to those who are qualified in certain trades to emigrate. That is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>I want briefly again to commend the Minister on the restrained nature of the proposals which he has put before the House.  In the circumstances in which they have been brought in, and at the time at which they have been brought in, there are many people who would feel that the Minister was more than justified if he took a much stronger line in these two Bills.  I am <Col N="2347" /> glad he has not done so.  It is recognised on all sides of the House that one cannot legislate to the extent of forcing people to work.  The Minister has done and done very well what was open to him&mdash;in other words, he has given the trade unions an opportunity to put their own house in order.  This I sincerely trust they will do.  At the same time, it is only right to point out that the trade union house is not the only house that has to be put in order.</P>
    <P>I had a very unfortunate example in my own constituency in the past couple of weeks in connection with the present dispute.  A certain large and important firm gave what I can only describe as provocative notice to a number of men which, in my view and I think in the view of nearly everyone who has looked into the circumstances, was totally unnecessary.  It has resulted, unfortunately, in a large and substantial factory in Limerick city being closed down, and the whole building industry in the southern part of the country being seriously disrupted.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is open to the Minister for Labour or any other Minister to legislate in connection with the activities of some employers or employers' organisations, but if it is open to this Minister and if he feels it is feasible to do so and that it might achieve any results, I think legislation on those lines would not be out of place.  Apparently there are quite a number of small employers' organisations and, so far as I can see, many of them have the same sort of problems that arise from fragmentation of the trade unions, and they cause the same difficulty on the other side of the fence and make the question of negotiations and settlements of disputes very difficult on the other side also.</P>

      <P>My experience does not give me any reason whatever to hope that Congress will even start to put things right.  My experience and my study of the trade union situation, and the industrial relations situation, have convinced me long ago that legislation is not the answer.  I stated this at the very beginning on the setting up of the Department of Labour, and even before that.  I am quite satisfied that, as someone said, you cannot legislate men into work.  I stated publicly that I believe legislation is not the answer.</P>
      <P>I suppose one could accent that by asserting now that any legislation which was wanted would be &ldquo;on&rdquo; at the moment in this House.  If you could think of any legislation that would cure the ills of our industrial relations, no matter how harsh it would appear to be, I think it would pass through this House in the present set-up.  I am not attempting to pass any harsh legislation because I know that, even if it passed through this House, it would not work.  It would not solve the problem.  I know that Deputies like Deputy T.F. O'Higgins who last night described this legislation as a mouse would describe it as a monster when the present strike is over, and at the next strike it would be a mouse again.</P>
      <P>This is the same mouse, no bigger no smaller, no more teeth no less, than the mouse with which they tried to frighten the wits out of the people of the country during the referendum campaign.  I like to give credit where credit is due.  When the Labour Party read my description of the proposals I had for legislation, that put an end to their assertion that there was repressive legislation coming.  On television the night before the people voted on the referendum, Fine Gael tried to frighten the wits out of the workers by saying that this arrogant Government were bringing in repressive trade union legislation.  Now it is a mouse because the wind is blowing the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is not for the present situation.  This legislation is not a cure for our ills, nor is it an attempt to remove the responsibility from management and trade unions to do their proper job in the field of industrial relations.  This legislation is the first <Col N="2349" /> step towards what could be a cooperative effort between the State, representing the community, and the trade unions who can and should put things right in their field and management in their industries, in their factories and in their plant getting down to their responsibility to get proper relations and agreements going. They should not pretend that human relations at industry level are something that they should not bother about, something less than other aspects of their management job.  This is all I have presented this legislation as being.</P>
    <P>At this hour of the night, perhaps, I should deal with some of the points which were raised.  The first point raised was the Irish Congress of Trade Unions reaction to the circulation of these Bills.  The reaction was: &ldquo;Withdraw the Bills.  We should not have them.&rdquo;  As I said before, they might have done so in a different way if they had wanted to communicate with me, but I have not had any request, since the circulation of the Bills, from Congress for consultation.  I have invited the officials of Congress to meet my officers next week so that they will be given a chance to explain in detail what they find amiss with this Trade Union Bill.</P>
    <P>If I find, as I have been led to believe, that the wording in the Bill is defective or does not express my intentions properly&mdash;my intentions in the Bill are the result of a long period of consultation and a good deal of examination&mdash;I shall move to amend the sections on Committee Stage.  If the Congress of Trade Unions have new ideas to propose to me or to the House by way of amendment to the Bill, I should be glad to consider them and, if they are good ideas, I am sure the House would be glad to adopt them.  All too frequently, I am criticised for ideas I put forward as possible beginnings to solutions in this field. I have been left wondering always by the critics whether they have any worthwhile ideas of their own or whether they are willing to express any idea at all.</P>
    <P>I approach this problem as a longterm problem and I would give time, before Committee Stage and during Committee Stage in the Dáil, to see if <Col N="2350" /> this House has any part which it can play to help the two parties in industrial relations to solve their problems.  I am sure some people must sometimes say that, perhaps, we are relieving them of responsibility by having a Labour Court or even a Ministry for Labour and so easing them of pressure that should be on them to find modern solutions in a complex society which they want to solve by free negotiation. But they must solve the problems created by free negotiation by those who abused the freedoms given to them on both sides, too.  Some of the points would, perhaps, best be answered, first.</P>
    <P>At the beginning, Deputy P. Belton suggested that the public sector should have accepted the Labour Court as the arbitration part of their conciliation and arbitration schemes.  I thought so, too, and I proposed this for discussion with people involved in the various schemes.  They rejected it.  They felt strongly about it.  What I have now proposed in the Bill is to have two members&mdash;a worker-member and an employer-member of the Labour Court sit in on these arbitration schemes.  I hope that, before the Bill is through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the people involved in conciliation and arbitration schemes will come around to my way of thinking because I think it is the proper approach.  We cannot forever go on leapfrogging and grabbing at the money in this country.  There must be some agreement on the rules of the game and some relationship between the awards made.  I had hoped that these people would come around to my way of thinking on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary suggested that the secret ballot proposal is aimed at having fewer strikes.  The aim of a secret ballot is to protect individual workers when it comes to expressing their opinion so that they can record their honest views, one way or another, in favour of or against a strike.  The arguments for it are as strong as the arguments in favour of a secret ballot for Dáil elections.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary's idea of financial help for unions proposing to amalgamate, rather than unions after amalgamation, would be something which I would consider.  Anything we can do to help amalgamation of trade unions, I think this House should be willing to do it.</P>

      <P>On the question of the recruitment of the conciliation officer service, it was suggested that people with qualifications in sociology and psychology would be recruited.  It is not a new idea.  However, those with practical experience will be aware that this is a personality job.  Some people do it well and other people, no matter what their academic qualifications would be quite incapable of bringing aid to people at the conference table. You cannot judge beforehand, by any test that I know of, how an officer would work out.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of having civil servants in these posts is that if they do not work out, they can be transferred.  More than one person mentioned here that people have been promoted, that good conciliation officers have been promoted out of that service, resulting in a loss to the service.  In the past couple of years, we have tried to arrange matters so that we did not lose good conciliation officers.  In the event of recruiting somebody who was not a civil servant and who did not work out as a good conciliation officer&mdash;regardless of any academic qualifications&mdash;it would not be possible to transfer him to any other part of the service and one would be left with a conciliation officer who was not effective.  That was the only reason I continued to think that recruitment from the Civil Service is an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that, in addition to having a personnel officer or manager, there should be a director on the board of the company, <Col N="2352" /> concerned with personnel matters and that such matters should be the first item on the agenda of board meetings. I would agree wholeheartedly with that.  It is not a matter for legislation. We cannot legislate that people will pay attention to their business.</P>

      <P>Or on agendas.  Two years ago, we set up the Department of Labour.  I tried to present it as a symbolic act of the Government to set aside a whole Department, with the Minister being at the Cabinet table&mdash;symbolic for industry&mdash;so that they, too, would give equal attention to the people they employ, to the pay they receive, to their conditions of work, to the making of agreements.</P>
      <P>The Irish Management Institute did a study of the personnel officers employed in Irish industry.  It is dismaying to think how neglected the personnel function is in our Irish firms. Naturally enough, some small firms cannot afford it.  However, in the medium-sized firms and in the big firms, not enough attention is given to consider the personnel function.  We have this extraordinary attitude that the important things in business are the getting of markets and the getting of machines; that the people working in the industry should be all right and, if they are not, they should be looked after by the FUE or by the Government.</P>

      <P>I said recently that employers were greatly at fault: I said it in the middle of the present dispute and it was not well received but it is not my desire to be popular but rather to get a long job started&mdash; and that will never properly be done until we can coax, drive, shame or otherwise make management share in this function.  I think most people in <Col N="2353" /> this country have the same attitude, namely, that it is a pity we have a strike as we were going along so well. They adopt the attitude that people should work away.  The speed of progress in any plant, in any industry, and the speed of progress in the country as a whole, will be determined by the speed at which this personal function is developed. This must be the basic fact with which we must begin.</P>
      <P>Workers are not something to be taken for granted, or to be left to some outside body or the Government to control.  We shall proceed at the speed at which the personal function is developed.</P>
      <P>During the debate, some speakers seemed to think that the revised conditions for negotiating licences which are mentioned in the Trade Union Bill applied to existing unions and that they would militate against small unions now in existence.  These revised conditions will apply only to future applications for negotiating licences and it is an attempt to prevent the big number of unions we have becoming greater by splintering, breakaway and other formations and groups not satisfied with their own executives.</P>
      <P>Why people have to take such extraordinary action when they are not satisfied with their executives makes me wonder whether the processes of democracy are working smoothly in the various unions.  Why the selected negotiators are not the people who can say what will decide an issue I do not understand.  Perhaps we are all too complacent about the organisations to which we belong, so that these breakaways and new groups working behind the scenes preach the failure of democratic process.  This goes back to something I pointed out here a couple of years ago&mdash;that the membership of trade unions are not participating in the activities of the unions.  I read in one trade union journal that at the annual meeting only three per cent of the membership were present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could imagine the influence of this House if only three per cent of the electorate participated in electing us.  The absence of the ordinary honest member who thinks these things do <Col N="2354" /> not concern him must be the basic cause of a great deal of the trouble in the trade unions&mdash;of the splinters, of the strike following lack of accepttance of negotiators when they go back to the union.  You cannot legislate for this.  You can only try to encourage people and when people are inclined to find people of various colours operating in the trade union movement, and subversive elements&mdash; if I were asked to name names, I should name the ordinary, honest, decent people who do not attend the meetings of the unions.</P>

      <P>The Minister is talking more sense than any of the people behind him have done in the last few weeks.  They have been speaking nonsense but the Minister seems to have a much greater appreciation of the position than some people.</P>

      <P>Sense is not always spoken from the strongest position.  In recent years in Ireland sensible people have been booted out of the way.</P>

      <P>I do not know was it ever a good thing to be sensible.  When I was away from this field, I discovered a quotation from Cardinal Newman, 100 years ago, when he spoke about how to manage people generally.  He stated:</P>

    <P>Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a <Col N="2355" /> thread of silk; then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and the pride of man.</P>
    <P>In the trade union movement one believes in ordinary progress, in creating new wealth, new employment for school-leavers.  Those who believe in such things will some day have to get down to the difficult and slow task of shaping the trade union movement into a structure that can co-operate with the rest of society so that this nation can go ahead to create the new wealth and higher standards of living.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have a Bill before us does not mean there are not other aspects that have to be changed but it is no use for the Labour Party and the trade unions to say: &ldquo;Come back after you have got industrial democracy in the FUE and in other branches of society.&rdquo;  Members of the unions must put their own house in order and when that has been tested and has been found to have failed, we must try the other ways.</P>
    <P>One of the theories in this debate has been the idea of an incomes policy. Earlier on there was a prices and incomes <Col N="2356" /> policy.  Deputy O'Higgins has a soft spot in his heart for profits because during the debate he did not want them restricted.  There is this about a prices and incomes policy: if it is to be effective&mdash;in Ireland the priority is in settling strikes at all costs&mdash;it will have to be imposed.  Either everybody will agree that some body&mdash;not some person but a body of people&mdash;will be entitled to fix our incomes, our wages, salaries, prices, dividends, professional fees and so on and everyone will have a judgment handed down and must accept it.  If he does not accept it, if he withdraws his labour and has a strike&mdash;he has the right to strike&mdash; everybody else will go on strike because that is the way to gain.  Even with an incomes policy, you could have all the disputes you have now because people will not be satisfied with their share.</P>
