      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10, resuming the adjournment debate of yesterday, and it has been agreed that the adjournment debate will end at 2 o'clock this afternoon, that the last Labour Party speaker will be called upon at 12.15, that the last Fine Gael speaker will be called upon at 1 p.m. and that I will be called on to conclude at 1.30 p.m.  It is proposed then at 2 o'clock to take Questions.  It is proposed also to finish Questions and for that purpose it will be necessary to move to sit later than 5 o'clock.  Seven o'clock has been suggested but it is possible that that would not give enough time.  I suggest that we sit not later than 8 o'clock but the likelihood is that we will finish before 7 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned last night I was speaking of some of the changes which I thought we ought to consider in this part of the country in order to remove the impression fostered in Northern Ireland by certain people that conditions in the Republic are not such as would be attractive or acceptable to the majority in Northern Ireland.  I mentioned several constitutional and legal reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two others that deserve mention and in fact were mentioned by a Unionist speaker in this city last night, taunting us on the more democratic situation that will emerge from <Col N="1529" /> these reforms in Northern Ireland compared with this part of the country. These are the existence there of an ombudsman to guard against maladministration, something which certainly is much more greatly needed in Northern Ireland than here but which I think we too should have.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us when he is concluding whether he is prepared to consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>The other point is giving votes at 18 for which with one exception the Northern Ireland Parliament voted unanimously two days ago, something proposed by the two parties on this side of the House but which the Government do not seem willing to accept.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate to leave Unionist spokesmen like John Taylor in a position to taunt us for being behind Northern Ireland in the franchise, in not having an ombudsman and the other points which he raised.</P>
    <P>I was speaking last night about changes in attitudes which those of us who are Roman Catholics should consider, quite apart from legal or constitutional changes.  This is something that we need to consider.  We must recognise the fact that in the north the events of 1951 are still used for their purposes, are still a live issue, and that the fact that in this part of the country the events of that year could not happen again, that the ecclesiastical authorities would not interfere or, if they did, could not succeed, is not understood in Northern Ireland.  I feel it is important that the ecclesiastical authorities here should do all in their power by, for example, making changes such as removing the ban on Trinity College, to remove the impression of ecclesiastical intervention of a kind which gives rise to these misconceptions and gives material for propaganda to the Unionist bosses in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which has been raised by Deputy Harte if not by others and that is the position of the Irish language in relation to the public service and indeed examinations.  The fact is that to a Northern Unionist participation in a United Ireland which would have practices such as we have in this respect must obviously be unacceptable. <Col N="1530" /> How can we possibly expect, not Paisleyites but even the most moderate of Unionists, to accept participation in a State in which they would have no right to enter the public service and in fact in which their children could not get a school leaving certificate?  The Taoiseach may say that under the federal system all that would be changed but we need to make this very clear indeed.  I do not think we appreciate the divisive effect of these things.  I remember some years ago&mdash; and I think it was an unusual experience for a member of my party&mdash; addressing a Fianna Fáil meeting.  I was not then in politics.  I was invited to put forward my views on the Irish language to a Fianna Fáil seminar in Dún Laoghaire.  I found it an enlightening experience.  I trust the Fianna Fáil Party did so also.  That is not so certain. The discussion there was on the issue of the divisive role of the Irish language.  I put forward my views.  I was carefully flanked by Seán Ó Tuama and Donal Ó Moráin before and after me in case I should do any harm.  I was sandwiched between them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they supposed to be Fianna Fáil people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they were the other speakers at this Fianna Fáil meeting.  I meant that in case my views on the Irish language might in any way corrupt Fianna Fáil, the party was protected by having two advocates of a different viewpoint.  What was interesting was that when the study groups reported back it was quite clear that about one-third of those present shared my views and this created horror and dismay among others.  I was interested to see that when two of the chairmen reported back on the issue I put before them, the divisive effect of the language as an obstacle to the ending of Partition, their reaction was to call me an Orangeman.  I think this must be the first time when expressing anti-Partitionist views invoked this particular epithet here.  It suggests, and suggested to me, that a long process of education is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that this is confined to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think all of us must reconsider this, not just this <Col N="1531" /> issue, but our whole attitude to the North.  I did have the pleasure of ending my remarks on that occasion by saying that I had not been so optimistic as to hope to convert Fianna Fáil to be an anti-Partitionist party in less than 20 years but I believed that over a 20 year period they could perhaps be brought to the point of gaining an understanding of Northern Ireland and of the divisive effects of policies of this kind enforced down here and that they would eventually, perhaps, come to accept the concept of a pluralist society in a genuine Irish community which I was attempting to put before them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech, showed a recognition of the need for us in this part of the country to move towards much greater social justice if we are to be in a position to encourage people from Northern Ireland to join us here.  His remarks on this point, brief though they were, are to be welcomed as indeed was so much of his speech.  I would hope that the recognition which he showed of the extent to which we are behind in this respect and how unattractive to Northern Ireland is participation in a Republic whose social policies are so conservative and whose social benefits are so inadequate, would be translated into practice in the years ahead and with the extra motivating force of this feeling in regard to social justice and Partition, that we shall make more progress than we have done in the past ten years or so on the whole matter of social justice.</P>
    <P>For all that needs to be done we undoubtedly need an all-party committee of the House.  I cannot agree with what Deputy Andrews said on this, that an all-party committee is all right for little things like reforming the Constitution &mdash; I am not purporting to quote him but I am distorting what he said in order to make my point; the Taoiseach is very sensitive to misquotation and rightly so &mdash; but that when it comes to an issue like a united policy on Northern Ireland which now exists between the three parties, with some possible exceptions on the other side, for this purpose an all-party committee <Col N="1532" /> is inappropriate.  I cannot accept this.  I think it is very important that we should have such an all-party committee.</P>
    <P>The Government have been blessed in the past few months with a responsible Opposition which has avoided all the opportunities it could have taken in that period of playing politics with the issue, but I think it is unfair to an Opposition to expect it to continue acting responsibly indefinitely when members of the Taoiseach's Government will not do so and when we are excluded from participation and consultation in the formulation of policies on this national issue which is clearly not a party issue.  It is a national issue on which all three Parties have now taken a common stance.  We must be prepared to sit down together in this House on this issue.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, even if he cannot do so just at this point without further thought, to think over this matter in the time ahead and consider whether it would not be in the general interest that such a committee should be established.</P>
    <P>In what I have said in this House I have concentrated, because it is in this House in this part of Ireland that I am talking, on our share of the blame and I have concentrated also on the Government's mistakes.  I want to emphasise two things at this point, that in referring to the Government's mistakes as I see them I do not wish to suggest that all the blame is on that side of the House.  I did say at the outset that in the particular circumstances of the time it was inevitable that mistakes should be made.  I should like to add that I am sure the mistakes are not confined to the Government in the things that were said and done over the past few months.  I do not wish to be unduly critical but I think it is right that we should consider at this point the mistakes that were made so as to ensure that they are not repeated in future.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way condemning the Government which did what it thought was right at the time but we should alert it and the country to errors and misjudgments that may have been made so as to ensure they will not be made again.  We do not <Col N="1533" /> want to use, and in fact we have not used this occasion, as we could have done, to launch an all-out attack on the Government for its handling of the situation over this period.</P>
    <P>I also want to say that in concentrating in what I say on the share of the blame attaching to us in this part of the country I am not suggesting that we here bear more than a fraction of the blame.  Because I have devoted so much time to it, I do not want to give the impression that I think it is we who are primarily responsible.  The responsibility lies with Britain which conquered and administered this country for a long time; with Britain which pandered to a group of extremist Tories in Northern Ireland and to their interests in partitioning the country originally; with Britain who has neglected this problem for 50 years.</P>
    <P>The blame attaches above all to that group of unscrupulous people who have used the poor ordinary working people of Northern Ireland for their purposes so skilfully and successfully for 50 years.  Our blame in this matter is a contingent blame, a peripheral blame and I concentrated on it here because it is the one thing we can do something about.  There is a limit to what we can do as regards the British Government although we can and should influence them more than we have done, if we adopt the right tactics. There is a limit to what we can do about influencing things in Northern Ireland for the better; there is no limit to the extent to which we can influence them for the worse.  We can do something about our own deficiencies and mistakes.  That is why I concentrated on these.  Clearly, our blame is small and it is right that this House should make clear what it thinks of the neglect of the British Government over this period and its failure to deal with this problem and what it thinks of those people who have been running Northern Ireland for 50 years and some of whom in high places today, although putting through these reforms, show no sign of recognition of the blame or the responsibility that should attach to them.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to control myself <Col N="1534" /> when seeing spokesmen for the Northern Government batting away&mdash; they find it politically necessary to do so, I suppose &mdash; pretending that nothing has ever been wrong but that there were just some little, silly complaints and that in order to satisfy the people, they are making some changes. A Government that has been responsible for what it has been responsible for should be brave enough to admit that it has been wrong even if there are some political consequences.  I find it difficult to keep patience when I see people like the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland batting away on this matter on television and radio and showing no sign of any recognition of their responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is certainly difficult to accept that the affairs of Northern Ireland should remain in the hands of people who seem so unconscious of their responsibility in the matter.  That is why I would hope that we would see in Northern Ireland, and would do our best to achieve there, a Government of moderates of all Parties that would replace in time the present administration which is one doing a necessary interim job under great pressure from Britain but not one in which we could expect the minority in Northern Ireland to have any serious confidence in view of the conditions in which they have been forced to accept these changes and their obvious reluctance even now to face up to the blame attached to them.</P>
    <P>If we in this part of the country can learn the lessons, as I think we are doing, and modify our attitudes and policies then, out of the evil of the last few months, good will have come.  A fresh start will have been made after 50 years, 50 lost years that have gone so far to consolidate Partition.  I am old enough to be able to remember what people's attitudes were in the 1930s.  I am old enough to be able to remember the attitudes of people in Northern Ireland because of my own extraction in part from that part of the country.  I know from my own relatives there, Unionists and Protestants, that in the 1930s they had no conviction or expectation that Partition would last. As far as they were concerned they had got a breathing space for a few years <Col N="1535" /> and all of them, from Carson and Craigavon down to the ordinary people, expected that after a few years the situation would change.  Unfortunately, war broke out and the policy of neutrality which we adopted &mdash; I am not suggesting it was wrong or going into that now &mdash; had the consequence of widening this gap.  Unfortunately, policies and attitudes adopted down here consolidated that and so I have seen growing among my own relatives there during my own lifetime the dawn of a realisation that Partition might, perhaps, be permanent, that it was not going to be a matter of a few years but certainly of many decades.  It is we who have contributed to that.  The fault lies primarily on our side.  We did not create Partition, but we maintained Partition I have seen the growth of a conviction and hope among Unionists in Northern Ireland that it can last for a long time. They can see us, as we have done over 50 years, making every mistake in the book.  Now we can make a fresh start. We can produce results in, perhaps, half or less than half of the period we have wasted since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Above all, however, it is our job to try to understand &mdash; to understand the fears of the Protestants as we can so easily understand the fears of the Catholics.  We are beginning, perhaps, to understand this.  For example, the shock effect of the welcoming of British troops by Catholics in the Bogside and the Falls Road has forced people to realise that they have not understood the position in Northern Ireland, and has forced us to try to understand both the Catholics, whose views seem so different from what our stereotype of them has led us to believe, and the Protestants.  If we do that, and if we are prepared to work genuinely towards a pluralist society in which all groups in the community genuinely have equality, then we can hope for the ending of Partition in our lifetime.</P>
    <P>We can hope, in the meantime, for peace in Northern Ireland which is of much more practical importance to the people of Northern Ireland than the issue of Partition and the division of <Col N="1536" /> this country at this time.  This means a genuine change in attitude.  It means that when we think of a thing like an Irish language test, or a law about contraception, or a constitutional provision about divorce, we think about them in the context of the whole of Ireland and not in the context only of the 26-County area.  This requires an effort of imagination.  It requires for example &mdash; and I had an amendment down to the Broadcasting Authority Bill in the Seanad several years ago on this very point &mdash; that if we believe this is one country and that the Unionists in Northern Ireland are a million of our fellow countrymen, then they must have their share of time on television and radio with other political Parties.</P>
    <P>Either the north is part of our national territory, either these people are Irish, in which case, much as we may dislike their views, they are entitled to their share of time, or if we think they are not so entitled, and if we think that they should be excluded we are, in fact, saying we want to remain partitioned.  It requires an effort of imagination which we have not yet made.  I hope that out of this debate that effort of imagination will come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is not to indicate what any of us or any party in this House has done over the past 40 years.  Much less is it to exculpate ourselves for what we have not done.  It gives us all an adequate opportunity of at least asserting what we are prepared to do and, more than anything else, of bringing on stage our views, letting our views be known, examined and considered in the same way as the views of the representatives of Northern Ireland and, indeed, of Westminster have been, particularly in the past few months.  This could be the most important consequence of this debate &mdash; that the representatives in this House be given an opportunity to express to the people in the North of Ireland, the people in Great Britain and, indeed, the people of the world, the views which we hold and the hopes which we have for the future of this country.  The purpose of the debate is much less, indeed, to comment on the terrible events of recent months, than to <Col N="1537" /> indicate the extent of our goodwill to all who would endeavour to solve and heal the bitterness that has arisen and has boiled to the surface in the recent past.</P>
      <P>Let us tell them first of all of the strife that existed in this nation, in this part of the nation, of the bitterness that existed between those of us on all sides of the House some 40 or 50 years ago.  Let us tell them of the progress we have made since that time.  Let us tell them these things in hope &mdash; in the hope that if it can be achieved here that the bitterness of the past can be solved, and that at least we can reach a reasonable stage of progressive political activity, there is every reason to believe that the same thing can be achieved in a united or a federal Ireland.</P>
      <P>Let us point to the tolerance &mdash; not by way of praising or shouting our virtues &mdash;that does, indeed, exist certainly in this part of the country, a tolerance that is enshrined in the Constitution of this State &mdash; the public office held by men of minority religions, the responsibility held by people irrespective of what their views may be.  One of the happy aspects of life in Ireland nowadays &mdash; there may be something we still have to remove from the Irish scene so far as tolerance is concerned &mdash; is that no enlightened person in public life, or on the fringe of public life, stops to think of the religious persuasion of anybody with whom he may be associated.  When one considers the history of this country, a history which was based in many ways on, and closely associated with religious oppression, with the fight for religious freedom, one sees that in such a short time we have got to the stage of political maturity that we can, in fact, afford to forget the differences which might have existed some 40, 50 or 100 years ago and build on the unity that exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us tell them, too, that we acknowledge in this part of the country that there are ills in our society.  We acknowledge that there is, for instance, still much need for improvement in housing, much need for improvement in our employment situation but, while acknowledging all of those things, let <Col N="1538" /> us point out that we have come a long way, in a very short time and, that for a nation which had so little of its own resources such a short time ago, we have now achieved what in many ways is the envy of so many countries.  This should be the basis of our approach, of our views and, indeed, one would hope that it would arouse a reaction from those in this island of ours who feel that our destiny is quite exclusive from theirs and that our pasts can never be combined.</P>
    <P>Let us tell them that this island of ours does not need any subvention from any British Exchequer to maintain its existence.  One of the weaknesses I found in the television address of Captain O'Neill was the fact that the great persuasion which he offered to the people of the North of Ireland at that time was that should this terrible event happen, this UDI of Ulster, as he referred to it, they were going to deprive themselves of that subvention from Britain.  This appeared to be the major plank which he was offering to the people of that part of the country.  Surely any self-respecting Irishman, north or south, does not want to live constantly on the charity, subvention or otherwise, of any other country.</P>
    <P>Let us tell them that instead of that subvention, which we could still be drawing if we had not changed our economy to modern times, we have geared ourselves to being an independent separate entity rather than a State which is dependent on what was a major world power.  Let us tell them that in the modern society, in the Ireland which we all hope for, yes, maybe they will not have the social welfare benefits immediately which they have in England and, yes, maybe they will not have the immediate benefits of the Health Act which they have in England, but they will have much more instead.  They will have the opportunity to work on an equal basis with the rest of us in this country. They will have the opportunity to earn rather than be supported by the efforts of others.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe that this island as a unit is not economically a viable unit, that this island does not contain <Col N="1539" /> within itself the fundamental wealth and, much more important, the fundamental determination of its people to make it a viable economic unit.  I cannot for a moment imagine that any Irishman, north or south, is prepared to accept that he needs a constant subvention from another nation to maintain him in this country which is, after all, basically a wealthy if an undeveloped country.  If that is the loss with which the people in the North of Ireland are concerned &mdash; the loss of the social welfare and unemployment benefits &mdash; we can tell them that to compensate for that loss the gain of independence and self-pride and the gain, indeed, we hope of full economic development is something we can give them instead.  This means, of course, then, that we must continue even at present, as in recent years, to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the people and the Government of the North of Ireland in the promotion of industry in both parts of the island.  We must continue as has been done &mdash; I do not know if it has been referred to in this House &mdash; in the private commercial sector, to extend co-operation between both parts of the island.  We have been encouraged to hear, for instance, that the commercial banks have from time to time directed would-be industrial promoters from other countries either to the Six Counties or from the Six Counties to this part of Ireland when the environment or the opportunities in one particular area did not suit.</P>
    <P>Let us continue this, knowing that, if we cannot help the part of the country within the jurisdiction of this Parliament, by far the best thing we can do afterwards is to help the part we hope will be within the jurisdiction of a united Ireland in the not too distant future.  I would not go quite as far as Deputy Andrews when he suggests we might give tax-free concessions to industry established in that part of the country, but I would go as far as to say that whenever we are not in a position to promote certain industrial activities we should at least ensure that such projects will be given every opportunity of being established in the North of Ireland.  To this extent I should like to <Col N="1540" /> encourage and commend the commercial banks, insurance companies and other such institutions who I know at present are engaged in this activity.</P>
    <P>I was not one of those who were in Bogside, in the Falls Road, in the Shankill Road or any other of those troubled areas in the last few months.  I was instead further from Ireland than normally when these events occurred, in France, and the sad impression that was conveyed to all the people in that country, both in the local and national papers &mdash; and I do not know how representative that view may be for other Continental or world newspapers &mdash; was that this was a war of religion, that here you had ranged on either side Catholics and Protestants, and people asked, is it possible in this century to have a war of religion.  It was said that this was exclusively a war of religion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While this may have been a major consideration in it, it certainly was not the only one.  In any event, one of the sad ironies of the situation is that, at a time when so many of the churches are endeavouring to come together, the creeds which people profess should be used as a wedge to drive between people who have very much in common.  It is sad, indeed, that the only source of division between equally deprived areas and equally deprived people in the Falls Road, Shankill Road and other areas of Northern Ireland should be the division of the creeds which they profess. It is sad when an opportunity is found to prey on those fears, fears of what one creed represents and what the other creed does not represent.  Can we again tell those people that while religion did have this connotation here for us at one time, it no longer has?  Can we express the hope that they, too, will be given the opportunity of taking religion from the forum of political discussion and that when the question of civil rights is raised the religious aspect will be removed from the discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all who have said that it was not opportune for us during the course of these recent troubles to discuss the matter here in our Parliament. <Col N="1541" /> We could have stood up and like a cock on a high wall crowed as loudly as possible, but would we be relieving the situation for those who were suffering at that time?  I think the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs, by the immediate action they took, by the tolerant views they expressed, and by seeking the bar of world opinion did all that anyone in this part of the country could do.  The only concern I have at discussing this matter even at this time is that any of us would say things that might in any way arouse further animosities in that part of the country. Our silence and, indeed, the silence of the Opposition Parties &mdash; a silence for which they have been commended in this House &mdash; is not to be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our intention now is to impress upon all the people up there that our silence down here should not be interpreted as a lack of concern, that if we here in the House do not express views which sympathise with the plight of the minority, the view that these reforms are long overdue, if we do not express these views in a very determined fashion it is only because we restrain ourselves from so doing in an effort to assure all up there that we hope we can build a nation for all the people of the island.  All of those people enjoy our goodwill.  Whether they belong to the majority or the minority, they enjoy our goodwill because they are citizens of the same island.  At a time when the Unionist Party have admitted discrimination which has been rampant for so long, it is not for us here to ask them to wear sackcloth and ashes.  They have set themselves out now, I hope, to achieve reforms and it is to be hoped that the Government in England and the representatives at Westminster will ensure that these reforms are carried into effect.  If they are not and if there is any halting of the reforms which have been announced &mdash; and, remember, that when reforms are announced it presumes the reasons for reform have existed for a long time; I do not want to dwell on that here now &mdash; then let them be fully aware that we are still concerned and that we shall use every possible opportunity before the bar of the United Nations and of the world to ensure that what is now being promised will be quickly fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things of which I think we are all personally guilty here is that we know less about the people in the north by and large than they know about us.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the fact that the leaders of the Unionist Party were at fault in not telling the people up there what we were really like when, in fact, they knew sufficiently well what we were like.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave if they were <Col N="1543" /> convinced we are what we would like them to think we are they would have told them.  At least it can be said they came amongst us in a way we did not go amongst them.  What is left now is for us to go amongst them.  Let us promote a campaign &mdash; and I must admit I have never considered this in my own mind before &mdash; of spending our holidays in any part of Ireland, including the Six Counties.  Let us promote Antrim and Down, Tyrone and Fermanagh. Let us not regard that part of the country as being an excluded part of the country.  Let us find out more about the people; let them see what we are and let us see what they are.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, in recent times, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, have done very important work in this particular field but many of us down here have not availed ourselves of these opportunities.  Let us recommend to our friends and associates, urban councils and county councils that they extend the pairing of towns.  Anything that we can learn about each other can only do good because we will find that many of the doubts that have existed in our minds for so long are not justified.</P>
    <P>Even as late as last night a gentleman called Mr. Taylor, a representative from Stormont, whose views I seldom find myself in agreement with &mdash; indeed, may I say, that there are many people in this House whose views I seldom find myself in agreement with &mdash; got a reception in Trinity College which I do not think any of us would be proud of, when he was not even given the right to express the views he had been invited to give.  I think it was a disgraceful situation when he had the courage to come down to this city to express his views, that he was not allowed the opportunity to do so by a group of young men who are supposed to be educated and who are supposed to be giving a reasonable example to the rest of the people.  The only way we can show Mr. Taylor and people like him that we do not associate ourselves with this kind of hysterical reaction is to express that view in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> The Taoiseach, and, indeed, all speakers with very minor exceptions, has given the lead that we all hoped would come from this House, that we do not pretend we are perfect but we do have a fundamental goodwill towards all.  The Ireland we envisage, as the Taoiseach has said, is not an Ireland dominated by Government.  It is an Ireland that has as much the genius and determination of the Orangemen as it has the genius and determination of the Catholic nationalist wherever he comes from.  This is what has created the main stream of culture in this country in centuries past. The people of the north should be told what their history represents and what they can contribute to present-day Ireland.  History should not be the basis of bigotry; history should be the basis of united co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has welcomed the acknowledgment from Major Chichester-Clark that we here, at least, are entitled to hope that our aspirations, our plans, our programme, our work and our dedication to this country can be shared by all without the assistance of any other country and certainly without the recrimination of past political or religious prejudice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow the contributions of my colleagues in the Labour Party, to hear the contributions of Deputies Harte and FitzGerald and to note, with a certain disappointment, the absence of contributions from members of the Cabinet, notably Deputies Blaney, Colley and Boland, notwithstanding the balance and the great concern&mdash;&ldquo;the low key&rdquo; as the newspapers have put it &mdash; of the Taoiseach's contribution, it can be said that there is now an opening up both in this House and throughout the country of a new attitude towards national unity. There is a new political attitude in the Republic and a new political dimension which I would certainly hope to see bearing fruit in the lifetime of this Dáil.  We are very much a post-Treaty generation and I would hope to see these new attitudes bear fruit in the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset we should assure the Taoiseach, who seemed somewhat agitated by certain of the reproaches <Col N="1545" /> against the Government last evening, that it is not our intention within this debate to adopt a purely party political attitude as may appear on other occasions.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question in the middle of August last asking for a statement from this House and yet we have had to wait until late October to have an elementary statement made within the House itself.  We had the rather cursory expressions of the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, which were mere repetition, put rather poorly, on his actions over the past few months when he was at the United Nations. We have not had any coherent account of the discussions he had with any other Governments.  The Government must take responsibility for failure to consult with this House more effectively during the past three or four months.</P>
    <P>In relation to our national aspirations, the newspapers, radio and television have been giving us tremendous up-to-date, informative and comprenhensive reports, and I do not share the rather ridiculous comments from my colleague in the same constituency, Deputy Cosgrave, when he censured the <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday on its attitude to Fine Gael's role in relation to Northern Ireland.  His comments were rather petulant and unbecoming, and unacceptable to the vast majority of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy O'Kennedy, though I am disappointed with the contributions of other Deputies, that it is the sincere aim of all parties to try to reach agreement on which a solution can be based.  Unfortunately, during the years Fianna Fáil have paraded as though they were the sole repository of this central aspiration.  This has been illustrated in every epilogue to every Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis speech. They have done it with great overtones of force and coercion which most of us have found appalling during the years.  I have no doubt that at the next Ard-Fheis, Deputy Colley, Deputy Boland and Deputy Blaney, nonspeakers in this debate, will be back with the same claptrap, completely unimaginative military-type argument which, in the context of the situation <Col N="1546" /> in 1970 in the matter of hopes for national unity, is completely unacceptable to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The hopes of the people of this country are for the removal of the last remaining obstacle to national unity. The fact that we are a very divided people in any national debate is of major importance and I hope we shall try to thrash out methods by which we may bring about a greater sense of unity.  One of the major difficulties in the situation has been the continuing failure, the perpetual failure, of successive Ministers for External Affairs to differentiate seriously between longterm aspirations for the ending of Partition and an attempt to bring about normalisation of politics in Northern Ireland, particularly by failing to bring into the political arena, nationally and internationally, the problem of civil rights.  Fianna Fáil's approach towards normalisation in the matter of civil rights has been completely disappointing and one must be harsh on the Government in that respect.</P>
    <P>In many ways we have seen and we can be proud of Ireland's foreign policy and the lead which we have given during the years on many world issues. As the only ex-colonial country in Europe, we have given tremendous help towards the solution of many African and Asian problems.  We have in the United Nations spoken at length on the problems of Czechoslovakia, Algeria, Tibet, Hungary and other countries but though we have had ample opportunity within the United Nations to raise the question of civil rights in Northern Ireland, Fianna Fáil Ministers have not availed of such opportunities.  It is of grave importance that this should be placed on record&mdash;the fact that notwithstanding the attendance of successive Ministers for External Affairs at human rights meetings of the United Nations, no effort was made to bring before these assemblies the position in regard to civil rights in Northern Ireland.  It would be wrong in a debate of this type to give chapter and verse of the violations that have taken place down through the years.  For it, the Government here must be indicted generally.</P>
    <P>What do we have in terms of a <Col N="1547" /> solution?  During the years we have had from Fianna Fáil the proposition that there was one of two solutions to by constitutional methods.  I do not by constitutional methods.  I do not think that any Fianna Fáil speakers have made up their minds as to the precise method they want.  There have been overtones, there have been implicit assumptions, there have been internal Cabinet disagreements and disagreements in the Party generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may continue, as I indicated, there is within Fianna Fáil the harking back to either of two solutions in relation to Northern Ireland, one being by long-term, and I mean very long-term, constitutional methods and the other by military methods. Frankly, I find fault with the Taoiseach's strategy in the recent events in that his statement on television did contain the germ of a coercive concept.  We welcome very strongly his repeated statements in Tralee and to this House in which he ruled out the use of force in the foreseeable future unless general disaster overtakes us in the form of total civil war.  He has repeated his rejection of the use of force or armed invasion of Northern Ireland but I should like to see confirmation of this from the Cabinet Ministers associated with him on this particular approach.  This assurance is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out to the Taoiseach <Col N="1548" /> that the movement of Irish troops at the Border, admittedly on humanitarian grounds, had, I think, an overt tendency to raise false hopes in the Bogside, to raise particularly false hopes in Belfast and to escalate a situation which admittedly we may now criticise by hindsight.  However, the decision made was the Taoiseach's: he did not consult with leaders of the Opposition; he held his Cabinet meeting and made his decision.  I felt at the time and I still feel&mdash;and I would have stated this had there been a meeting of Dáil Éireann in August&mdash;that this strategy of the Irish Government was an error of judgment, and I am glad to see that in many respects it has not been defended.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of Fianna Fáil to the Irish people, of course, has been that if we cannot have a kind of coercive solution to the problem then we must have a half-coercive federal solution. In other words, London will get out; London will insist on an Ireland in the context of Dublin and Belfast being involved in a federal solution. This is equally specious, and I think the Taoiseach in advocating the federal solution must be living in the Sea of Tranquillity, having gone up to the moon in the last rocket.  Therefore, the sooner the pretence is dropped the better, because otherwise we will meet with a complete lack of comprehension on the part of the people of Northern Ireland.  These are harsh words but they must be said because I think all the shibboleths and the nonsensical approach to the national question that have been built up in this country will not contribute to a solution.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, if we have to state that the Taoiseach was over-reacting on the question of force and in then advancing the federal solution as a solution to the national question, equally one can say this is simply going from the frying pan into the fire in terms of a general solution.  It was a mistake and the sooner the Government forget about it the better.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to agree, as a basic premise to the reunification of Ireland, that this issue is one which can only be resolved among the people of this island, more specifically by <Col N="1549" /> direct agreement with no threat of coercion, with no propositioning for a federal solution between the Protestants and the Catholics, North and South.  I would put it to the Taoiseach that there should be a general statement of principle to the people in this island that the only resolution of Partition is by agreement, nationally, jointly, on a unilateral basis between ourselves.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful in our approach.  We had the Minister for External Affairs, for example, going to the United Nations and talking in very histrionic terms generally about Partition and, as Deputy FitzGerald so rightly analysed, talking in the language of the 1920s and the 1930s, which has no relevancy to the situation today.  His double shuffle at the United Nations, when he could not make up his mind whether he wanted to talk about civil rights or about Partition, simply made him look even more foolish.  The Minister would have been much wiser and certainly would have received much greater support from this House if he had concentrated on the more appropriate question of civil rights in Northern Ireland as at that time.  It would have been more real; it would have been more immediate and would have evoked far greater response among the people of Northern Ireland.  In the long term it would have evoked a far better response, particularly from the British Government, who had a major responsibility at that time.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that instead his speech writers&mdash;I doubt very much if they were from the Government Information Bureau: I suspect they were from the &ldquo;Colley Bureau&rdquo; if anything&mdash;got 1920 speeches mixed up with the needs of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, I would say that in some respects the Minister's statements at the United Nations if anything confirmed the worst fears of the Northern Ireland Protestants and they confirmed the worst fears of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland which particularly did not want that speech then.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, come to a number <Col N="1550" /> of conclusions which I think can bear examination.  We have thrown out the concept of force, we have thrown out the concept of a solution for reunification along federal lines on the grounds that it is not within the present bounds of possibility.  It is certainly not in sight so far as our generation and certainly the great majority of Ulster Unionists are concerned.  I do not accept the statement made by the Taoiseach yesterday that he was willing to seek a solution along federal lines, to examine all the possibilities, to have a scrupulously fair deal for all, that financial and economic links with Britain would be preserved and so on&mdash; that all those things were currently being studied by the Government.  This is a lot of brouhaha and I do not think generally it bears very much examination now.</P>
    <P>I am equally critical, quite frankly, of the attitude of both the Taoiseach and of Deputy Cosgrave in relation to the operations of British troops in Northern Ireland.  We cannot have British troops in Northern Ireland notwithstanding that for decades there have been some thousands of troops in Northern Ireland and at the escalation of the crisis 6,000 or 7,000 troops were in Northern Ireland.  On the one hand, the Government were trying to take the old classical anti-Partition line and, on the other, they were trying to bring pressure to bear on the British Government to resolve a situation which they knew was incapable of resolution.</P>
    <P>What then are we faced with?  We have the rather obvious fact that to persuade the vast majority of the Northern Protestants, or even any sizeable section of them, will take a very long time.  It will take a generation.  It might in fact take much longer and there will be quite a long period, whether we in the Republic like it or not, in which our country will remain partitioned.</P>
    <P>Those are not easy words for me to speak.  I come from a family who have been involved in the Republican movement. Having made the earlier statement that one must accept that for quite a long time to come this country will remain partitioned, one must be <Col N="1551" /> content to see the unity question evolve over a number of decades.</P>
    <P>Are we then to suggest we do nothing about it in the interim period, that we simply stand back and say it is none of our business, that it is out of our hands, and is insoluble?  I do not think that we should adopt that kind of attitude.  There is a basic obligation on the Government to ensure the most democratic possible structure of government in Northern Ireland, to ensure so far as it is within our powers to do so, civil rights in Northern Ireland.  We have every opportunity open to us to bring about those changes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disbandment of the B Specials, which is certainly welcomed here, in relation to the support given by the Irish Government to the civil rights movement we still have obligations to fulfil, leaving the Partition issue aside, on the basis that this will erode itself in the future.  There has been a complete underestimation on the part of the Government of the tremendous role played by the Northern Ireland civil rights movement.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there has been a little bit of late catching-up on the part of some Cabinet Ministers fostering such movements in certain parts of Northern Ireland.  Indeed, I would suggest that the Government might investigate some reports that money has been passed in certain quarters.  Frankly, I do not want to embarrass the Government any further on that point beyond suggesting that, in relation to the publication of certain documents nationally and internationally from outside this Government, in relation to money going to certain organisations in Northern Ireland, there is a point to be made that Fianna Fáil will not try to do a little cosy takeover of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland on the basis that they ignored it for so long and found themselves, the Nationalist Party here, bereft of general involvement in the civil rights area in Northern Ireland and suddenly had to try to get involved in the Northern Ireland civil rights movement.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we must accept that the Northern Ireland civil rights movement has been a tremendous new force which, for the first time in half a century in Northern Ireland, united a great mass of non-Unionist people in the north which heretofore was divided into mutually antagonistic groups of individuals.  It is a matter of profound regret that there was no coherent opposition in Northern Ireland until the civil rights movement emerged.  It is to the credit&mdash;I do not think we in Ireland should in any way underestimate it &mdash; of that movement, and the many young people in it, that it achieved a political earthquake in shaking Northern Ireland out of the completely reactionary attitude of the Unionist Government, grown old in office themselves.  We must appreciate the tremendous work done.  It is certainly very much underestimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Fianna Fáil attitude to organisations such as the Connolly Association, which campaigned on civil rights when Fianna Fáil were campaigning on more esoteric aspects of Partition.  As a trade union officer and as a former industrial officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I met union officers in Northern Ireland and I certainly know something of the work done in that area.  I recall the work done by the Belfast Trade Council.  I recall the tremendous work being done for civil rights in Northern Ireland by people like Gerry Fitt and our distinguished visitor of this morning, Paul Rose.  Tremendous work has been done for civil rights in Northern Ireland when there was not a word from our Government, and indeed, in some respects Opposition Deputies have also been silent, but in all fairness it must be said that Deputy Michael O'Leary and many of my colleagues are on the records of this House as having raised <Col N="1553" /> the question of civil rights in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While I am critical of Fianna Fáil on this matter I am equally critical of the British Labour Party.  I remember my father who was very much involved with the IRA movement here and who was associated with Fianna Fáil in the early 1920s&mdash;in fact, we have a good deal of correspondence relating to the movement at that time&mdash;saying that if one were to scratch a member of the British Labour Party it was probable that one would find an imperialist underneath in some respects as well. This is very true.  There is no particular credit due to the British Labour Party and certainly there is no credit due to the British Tory Party because they were well aware down through the years of the discrimination by the Unionist Party towards the Catholic population in Northern Ireland.  They were aware of the acts of terror committed by the B Specials, and indeed, some of the acts of the RUC could also be questioned. These things were brought to the notice of successive British Governments during the past 20 or 30 years but in law, in practice, in observance and in reaction they were condoned by successive British Governments until things got too hot.</P>
    <P>It was the civil rights movement and not the Nationalist Party of Deputy Blaney vintage which was responsible for bringing these issues to the public forefront.  Neither was it a particular outmoded political operation of a certain jingoistic type of republicanism that brought about the tremendous change of heart in the British Labour Party and the British Government.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest to the Government that under no circumstances should any State aid&mdash;to use a polite term&mdash;be subvented from the Republic into the civil rights organisations in Northern Ireland lest we provide succour to any Unionist reaction on that basis.  There is another aspect to which I should like to refer because it is of great importance.  There has been a tendency among certain elements of the People's Democracy in Northern Ireland to arrive at instant political <Col N="1554" /> judgments on every issue.  I know that there has been a tendency to bring in what might be called ideological approaches which do not seem entirely relevant now.  The main issue in Northern Ireland is clearly the struggle for civil rights and when that issue is won it will be possible to build a new and healthy and political atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is not wise for any particular sections in Northern Ireland to talk at this stage about unrealistic demands, about workers' control or about the setting up in Northern Ireland of a small farmers' and socialists' republic. There have been overtones of this in certain areas of the Civil Rights Movement and it has only clouded the civil rights issue now.  This has been a dangerous development because it is confusing the struggle of the minority in relation to their particular demands. I should not like to see this happen any more than I would like to see the introduction of any Fianna Fáil outdated republican concepts which would equally confuse the people of the minority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many of the militant young people in Northern Ireland could learn a lot from the attitude of James Connolly while he was campaigning for civil rights there.  As we know, he advocated a workers' republic as a long term solution to the social and economic ills of the people of his country but he simultaneously campaigned for the setting up of the workers' rights in Northern Ireland to organise the trade union movement.  This was the binding force of his direct action.</P>
    <P>Some groups in Northern Ireland have called for the abolition of Stormont. I do not agree entirely with that approach.  This, too, could be a dangerous development.  We should not get directly involved in that argument because, while I have no doubt that the powers of Stormont have been eroded in recent months and will be eroded even further and while their overall control of the areas will be substantially circumscribed in the Northern Ireland area with successive and developing legislation from Westminster, it would be a mistake to advocate the abolition or the suspension of Stormont <Col N="1555" /> because that would above all abolish the parliamentary franchise of Northern Ireland which must be preserved in the context of the ultimate unity of this country.  We should not seek the abolition of this elected and representative assembly.  However, what I would like to see happen is the setting up of an impartial Westminster boundary commission who would have power to draw fair local government areas and electoral division boundaries in Northern Ireland.  There is a great deal of disquiet about the gerrymander in operation in Northern Ireland in this respect and in particular to the delineation in many areas as outlined by Mr. Faulkner in his recent White Paper. Perhaps our Government could make representations on this matter to Westminister.</P>
    <P>The stage of political maturity between those in Opposition and the Government in Northern Ireland has not yet been reached where we can hope to see the drawing up of fair local government boundaries.  While we are on this subject we might also have a look at the manner in which our own boundaries are drawn up, and, perhaps, we could set up a constitutional boundary commission who would be responsible for the drawing up of our parliamentary and local government boundaries so that the allegations made quite rightly by people in Northern Ireland will no longer hold their validity.  There is a new gerrymander in Northern Ireland with regard to the local government boundaries as anybody who looks at the sections of the particular areas will realise, particularly in relation to area 14, stretching from Kilkeel to Donaghadee, and area 2, stretching from Ballycastle to Larne.  These should have the attention of our Government.  These electoral areas have been extended deliberately to take in areas of Unionist majority. Our Government must speak with their tongues in their cheeks in terms of general application.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to stress at the United Nations that the Special Powers Act is still in operation in Northern Ireland.  Some complacency has grown up here.  Last night it was <Col N="1556" /> stressed that so much has been achieved in the recent past in Northern Ireland that we are inclined to say that things have improved, but in Northern Ireland the Special Powers Act is still in operation. We here are in a bad position to talk about it when we have the Criminal Justice Bill as impending legislation.  Nevertheless, we should point out at the United Nations that the Special Powers Act is in operation in Northern Ireland.  The police there have power to arrest without warrant, and there is the power of imprisonment without trial, and power to enter homes without notice.  There is the declaration of curfew and even a permit to punish by flogging.  In Northern Ireland we have the denial of a claim to trial by jury.  We, in this part of the country, should continue to look closely at the position there.  At times we have had even a conservative trade union action but on many occasions the trade union movement in Northern Ireland has demanded the withdrawal of the Special Powers Act.  Its withdrawal is one of the major acts of purification which should occur in Northern Ireland.  It is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement of the Taoiseach that the Criminal Justice Bill will not be introduced here in the immediate future.  May I say in relation to the Northern Ireland trade union movement and the skilful and perceptive trade union organisation, particularly in Belfast and elsewhere, that credit is due to them for preventing sectarian strife from spreading throughout the shipyards and the various engineering works and factories, both in Belfast and elsewhere.  It is important to praise their general approach of solidarity.  It is an important component in preventing the spread of sectarian strife in that area.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should have an extension of Telefís Éireann, to show the people in the north our cultural and economic developments, through the medium of booster stations along the Border.  We should resist the temptation at the moment because we will only confuse the situation further. We should concentrate on television in this part of the country and not introduce it into Northern Ireland until we <Col N="1557" /> develop a more acceptable televisionradio communication medium here. Telefís Éireann have done tremendous work in relation to the Northern Ireland situation but I do not think it is a very practical possibility to extend its programmes into Northern Ireland even though it would cost very little.</P>
    <P>There is, unfortunately, tremendous ignorance in the Republic about economic, social and political affairs in Northern Ireland.  The ignorance here among the population at large in relation to Northern Ireland affairs can be described as abysmal.  Irish people may not find this an acceptable statement, but it is a fact that there is total unawareness of the general social, economic and cultural development in Northern Ireland among our population. This is an aspect which needs change; it is an ingrained attitude here in the south.  I was amused to hear Deputy Andrews suggesting that we might set up factories in the north. The reverse might be a more appropriate suggestion.</P>
    <P>The industrial development in Northern Ireland has been phenomenal in recent years.  They have done wonderful work in terms of industrial training and growth centres and in preventing exploitation of land.  It is ironic that a community which has been so stricken with sectarian strife is so progressive in terms of economic development. The Northern Ireland community is extremely progressive in many areas. I would recommend to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, to have a look at the Craigavon general development. In the north thousands of acres of land have been taken over under the Land Development Act.  Gross capital gains exploitation has been prevented by the Northern Ireland Government notwithstanding the landowners objecting strenuously to the Government's moves.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that Northern Ireland educational developments are very much superior to ours.  We would not like to admit this.  The number of post-primary pupils in the north and south of the country is approximately the same, but we in the Republic have <Col N="1558" /> twice the population.  We tend to ignore this factor altogether.</P>
    <P>The personal income <i>per capita</i> in the north is one-third higher than it is in this part of the country.  It is nonsense for Deputy O'Kennedy to wish to tell them in the north how well off we are here or to try to assure them that we are better off than they are.  We are very much behind the north in social and economic matters and in general development.  Likewise, I would stress the changes advocated by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in respect of the Constitution. Deputy Cosgrave said there is no shred of justification or evidence that there was intolerance in relation to sectarian attitudes in the Republic. Deputy O'Kennedy said we should tell the people in Northern Ireland that we in this part of the country did not know the religious affiliations of our friends.  There is some hypocrisy in the Republic in relation to our attitude. We are not totally unaware of the religious susceptibilities of our neighbours, or unconscious of our inbred attitudes in relation to the five per cent minority here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many other changes are needed.  I do not agree totally with the statement of Deputy Cosgrave yesterday, nor do I agree with some of the rather blatant anti-clericalism displayed by some Deputies.  One can read their statements in today's <i>Irish Times.</i> Many areas of co-operation are open.</P>
    <P>I must express disappointment in regard to Article 44 and the equivocal attitude of the Taoiseach on the changes requested.  It is a matter of regret.  Likewise, there is a complete failure generally on the part of many Irish people to face up quite bluntly to Article 41.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that no law should be enacted providing for the dissolution of a marriage on grounds other than those acceptable to the particular religion involved.  The alternative wording recommended by the Committee on the Constitution in regard to Article 41 is, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, so much specious &ldquo;hoohah&rdquo; in terms of the caste system.  It is remarkable that an all-party committee should produce such rubbish, if I may say so.  There is need for review and the Constitution <Col N="1559" /> Committee should have another look at Article 41, but I suggest they acted courageously in relation to Article 44.</P>
    <P>There is need for an ombudsman in the Republic.  There is a demand for votes at 18.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government have failed to respond to pressures in this respect.  I have met numbers of young people completely disenchanted with Dáil Éireann and quite cynical about politics.  It is difficult to blame them because they have no opportunity of voting until they are, perhaps, 23 or 24 years of age.  If we want to involve youth we must introduce votes at 18. The Government will have to make up their minds very quickly even though the benefits initially may be small.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by Deputy FitzGerald's courage on the question of divorce.  He said, quite frankly, it should not be written into the Constitution. I support him in that.  We should at all times avoid bringing into the political arena this social and religious issue.  An all-party committee could usefully consider this matter in the light of the major developments in Britain from the point of view of legislation there.  We must at least consider the matter.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy FitzGerald's attitude, too, on the question of contraception. It is essentially a personal matter and it is not proper that anything in regard to it should be enshrined in legislation. We should calmly and dispassionately look at all these aspects of modern social life.</P>
    <P>With regard to our national games, I should like to see all the churches involved in these and not just patrons drawn from one particular denomination. That would be of tremendous benefit in breaking down barriers in Irish life generally and, from that point of view alone, it is an important matter.</P>
    <P>There are reservations expressed in regard to integrated education in Northern Ireland.  Certain fears expressed in Northern Ireland have been justified, but the Catholic Church, in particular, has not been as forthcoming, perhaps, from the point of view of education as it could have been.  The <Col N="1560" /> fears were understandable, but this whole aspect needs consideration now.</P>
    <P>There are other matters, equally difficult, equally delicate and equally embarrassing for many Members of this House and equally capable of crucifying, perhaps, some particular Deputy in the event of his becoming very deeply involved.  To what extent can one say it is a question of right of freedom, right of holding public meetings or issuing a newspaper?  Is it that which makes up the ethos of a non-sectarian society?  Social and cultural implications are intertwined. Attitudes are of major importance.  We cannot just ignore the tremendous role of the churches.  I have been very embarrassed in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown when constituents have said to me: &ldquo;It is all very well for you to defend this, that and the other, but if my child marries a Catholic the <i>Ne Temere</i> Decree is in operation and any children of the marriage must be brought up as Catholics. A Catholic clergyman must officiate at the wedding ceremony.&rdquo;  I am myself a Catholic, but one has to ask oneself to what extent do these inhibitions and internal regulations to which we subscribe conduce to a more democratic and a more integrated society, particularly in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to a man with whom I have often discussed the Northern Ireland question, a trade <Col N="1561" /> union official under whom I worked for a number of years, a former Deputy of this House, the late James Larkin. He was not the most flamboyant of speakers on the question of Partition. He was one of the most understanding personalities one could meet and he presented to the people of Belfast one of the most acceptable approaches to this whole matter.  In his speech to the Trade Union Congress in Belfast almost immediately after the introduction of the Government of Ireland Act in 1949 by the British Labour Government he said, on the question of national unity:</P>
    <P>If our struggles to build and maintain a united Irish Trade Union movement carry their own justification then should we not, with equal frankness and fortitude, face the logical corollary &mdash; a united, political, economic and social system, attuned to the real needs of the working people and their future welfare&mdash; a united nation and people living together in amity and liberty, bound together by a love for and an acceptance of democracy in its true sense, respecting each other's views and acknowledging each other's rights.</P>
    <P>Well I know this is political dynamite&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This was in 1949&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but dynamite is not only a destructive agent, it also has its positive use in clearing away obstacles so that the builder may create a new edifice &mdash; and our history of 30 years, with their record of frustration, twisted thoughts and sterile politics, shows clearly the need of clearing the ground so that we may build something positive and enduring for our people.</P>
    <P>He went on to ask, if this underlying sense of unity is still deep down in the minds and hearts of our people, and why should it not be when these same people live together and must therefore find a common purpose and a common interest in the one hundred different facets of life, how much greater must that instinctive sense of unity be at national level than it is in the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There is only one comment in which he attacked the British Government <Col N="1562" /> for bringing in the Government of Ireland Act and he made an impassioned speech at that time.  It is a matter of regret.  It is a matter of hope that perhaps after 26 years since he made that contribution we in this House may reshape our attitudes, the Government may reshape their attitudes now that they have a majority for four years and in the next four years take fresh initiatives and adopt new approaches to the Partition problem in the social, religious aspirations, and economic aspirations and in co-operation and harmony, in ultimate acceptance, so that we will bring into a united Ireland that vast majority of Northern Unionists who at this point of time abhor everything that we stand for but I have no doubt that with no coercion and no force and no overtones thereof over successive generations we will succeed in this aspiration to bring about national unity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand here in this Chamber today in a unique position. I have some reservations about my opening remarks but due to certain incidents&mdash;indeed there was one last night&mdash;I have no alternative but to proceed.  We have been told here in the Taoiseach's speech that it is his desire to see all sections of the community in the 32 counties living side by side.  I have no reason to doubt the Taoiseach's sincerity when he spoke those words but I should like him to know that there are sections of <Col N="1563" /> his party who I am afraid do not agree with the sentiments he expressed.</P>
      <P>I go back to the Presidential Election. I visited some booths in the constituency that I represent.  I came to one where there was wholesale intimidation by the Fianna Fáil Party. When I sought to have these matters rectified the county secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party in that constituency, who lives close to the polling booth, came and was very aggressive.  A member of the Garda Síochána who was in attendance had to restrain that gentleman from using physical force.  One of the things this man said was that I had no right to intervene, that this country did not belong to me.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that, in the local elections, an ex-Deputy of this House, a County Monaghan Deputy, a Fianna Fáil Deputy at that time, when speaking in the part of the constituency which I was contesting in the local elections&mdash;there were five seats and eleven candidates, I being the only Protestant&mdash;said that he would like the people to vote 1, 2 and 3 in the order of their choice for the three Fianna Fáil candidates but under no circumstances were they to vote for a man who did not worship in their church. Fortunately, his party decided that he should not speak in that area on any future Sundays.  I am proud to say in this House that I was elected to the county council, the only representative of my party in that area.  I am proud to say that I was the first Protestant ever to be elected to the county council in South Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had the elections which took place this year.  There were a number of points raised.  I was forced by a lot of people of different political persuasions and different religious beliefs to raise this matter at the time.  I took it as a joke and most people who knew me took it in a similar manner but, as the constituency, which was one of the gerrymandered constituencies, extends for 65 miles over portion of County Meath, County Louth and the entire county of Monaghan, it was only reasonable to assume that many people in that constituency did not know me personally and I have been <Col N="1564" /> forced at this time to make this statement. I was accused by members of the Fianna Fáil Party of being a member of that special force in Northern Ireland, the B Specials.  I was accused by an ex-county official of Macra na Feirme, a man from Inniskean, a Fianna Fáil supporter.  He saw fit, with his brothers, in their car, to tour the town of Carrickmacross in South Monaghan and to announce that a vote for Fox was a vote for Paisley. He could see fit, further, to produce a poster to post on every telephone pole in South Monaghan which read &ldquo;Vacancy exists in B Specials.  Must be anti-Catholic.  Contact Billy Fox or Paisley&rdquo;.  That is the evidence of the tactics that were carried on by the Fianna Fáil Party in the Monaghan constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies on the other side of the House that if their interjections are meant to distract me, the opposite will be the result.  We have the agricultural wages representative for the Monaghan area, a man from Rockcorry, who toured part of the constituency with the present Tánaiste.  He spread similar scandalous rumours.  They are well known in that part of the area and I am only bringing it to the notice of the House. There was a public meeting in the town of Carrickmacross at which one of the Fianna Fáil supporters in that area, a member of the South Monaghan executive of Fianna Fáil, shouted that I was a B Special and continuously insisted that I was.  The Chairman of the Comhairle Dáil Cheanntar, a solicitor, who incidentally is employed by a <Col N="1565" /> Protestant firm, toured the constituency and scandalised me on a sectarian basis, that I was a member of the B Specials.  These are facts.  It is well known in many of the business houses in Monaghan that these things took place.  We had, subsequent to that, a civil rights meeting in Monaghan town. On the evening it took place, I happened to be touring the Bogside and Belfast.  It is a well-known fact in Monaghan town today that the exFianna Fáil Deputy in that town had a certain group organised to boo me from the platform.  He made reference later to my election and said he was a better Irishman than I.  He did not give his method of determining that but he publicly made that statement. I am in a unique position.  Despite the unscrupulous and, indeed, unchristian attacks made on me during the election campaign, I am glad that I stand in this House today&mdash;and that can be interpreted as a symbol of the tolerance and the fairplay that exists among the majority of people in the Monaghan-Louth-Meath constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add that one of the Government Deputies&mdash;I do not see him in their benches at the present moment&mdash;went out of his way last night to intercept me and to tell me that I had no right at this stage to be crossing the Border.  When I replied that I had, and that I should like to think that all inhabitants of the Thirty-two Counties were free to travel from Cork to Antrim, he informed me that he could not do it.  The very same man stated in this House only three or four hours earlier that he had lived and worked and earned his first money in the northern part of this country.  He then told me that he could not cross the Border.  I asked him why and he said it was because of Paisley.  I told him I did not think about that man, and he told me that I was a supporter and inferred that I was a B Special.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to ask the Taoiseach to see to it that members of his Party do not accuse other Members of this House of being B Specials or followers of Paisley.  I can categorically say that I <Col N="1566" /> am neither a supporter of Paisley nor a member of the B Specials&mdash;and never have been in any other sectarian organisation.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to visiting the Bogside and the Falls Road area we had a meeting of the county council in Monaghan.  Following a certain speech which I made, I received this note and this document which I shall now read for the House:</P>
    <P>You should now withdraw your statement made at county council meeting recently that the B Specials were the cause of the recent troubles in the north.  The B Specials are a gallant band of men.  Read this booklet and it will give you some enlightenment (which you badly need) as to the true position.  This booklet is being sent to all parts of the world, including a lot of people in the south who do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>From: A true loyalist and native of Co. Monaghan.</P>
    <P Just="Right">NO SURRENDER.</P>
    <P>I and several other County Monaghan and Cavan men are assisting in the dispatch of these booklets&mdash;it is all in a good cause. It is the B Specials who have kept the north from being incorporated in an All-Ireland Gaelic Republic.</P>
    <P>Not only was I elected but I was elected the second representative for that county.  That in itself is evidence of what the vast majority of the people in that constituency thought of me.  This is the situation in which I was&mdash;a situation that the B Specials took exception to what a person says and an elected representative, a member of the Government Party in this House, can see fit to accuse me of being a member of that terrible band.  But I would not like to paint the picture that all the people and all the constituents in that constituency are mad men because were it not for the fact, as I said, that tolerance and fairplay prevailed, there would not be two Protestant representatives of that constituency.  I think from an historical point of view it is the first time ever in that constituency that two Protestant people <Col N="1567" /> were eleced as representatives in the same election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>On that note I would say that I am rather disappointed that the other Protestant representative had not the courage to come here and assure the people of Northern Ireland that the evils that are supposed to exist do not, in fact, exist despite what they may have read on the roads and the walls in County Monaghan.  I am sorry he did not see fit to stand up and be counted.</P>
      <P>A number of remarks were made here as to why the people in Northern Ireland claim to have fears.  I believe what I read in the papers that they have.  I believe that it is up to the Taoiseach to allay these fears not only as leader of this country but as leader of his own party.  Some speakers said that the question of the Irish language may be one of the obstacles, that the people in Northern Ireland say that if this country were, in fact, a Thirty-Two County Ireland we would not have the opportunity of procuring jobs in the Civil Service.  I am not sure that that is so.  I am not sure Protestants dislike the Irish language.  However, I think one thing that is wrong is that a certain type &mdash; not all &mdash; of people have associated themselves with these things which have put a certain slant on the Irish language &mdash; such as the Deputy who could see fit to make the remark he made to me last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a matter of hours ago, we had an MP in this city &mdash; it was referred to earlier by some speakers; I do not think any of us here agree with his theories &mdash; who was able to point the finger at some things they intended to do and which the Taoiseach stated yesterday, he was not prepared to do at the present time.  I refer to giving the vote at 18 years of age.  As one of the younger Deputies in this House, I think it is about time that people were given the opportunity of voting when they attain the age of 18 years. They are asked to pay taxes and contribute to the upkeep of the Government and the country.  I think it is about time they were given the opportunity of participating in the election <Col N="1568" /> of that Government.  I do not propose to go on much longer, as time is nearly out.  I should like to assure those people who seem to have fears of the Republic that I do not believe there is foundation for such fears, that I do not believe religious discrimination exists, at least to any great extent, although I believe we have political discrimination, speaking for my own constituency and it is on my own constituency that I am basing part of my theory.  Whether or not political discrimination or religious discrimination is the worst I am not prepared to judge but I know that we have political discrimination.</P>
    <P>Again, I am very honoured to have the privilege of speaking here, as the second representative elected for the constituency of Monaghan-Louth-Meath and I think my presence here can be taken as a symbol of the tolerance, fairplay and equal rights which exist in that part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If our proceedings here yesterday and today had been televised and if they were shown to people in Northern Ireland they would have done something to disarm the fears and suspicions there and to give on the whole a favourable impression of the quality of our public lives.  That impression might be qualified by some things that Deputy Fox has had to say just now but that in turn would be qualified by the fact that, as Deputy Fox said, despite the methods which were used against him, to which I shall have to return, he was elected and he is here and he is able to speak as he has spoken.  I feel that is a better testimony of tolerance in our public life than the tributes which we ourselves pay to our own tolerance from time to time and which do not perhaps impress other people very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach at the outset of our debate did much to set its tone by the statesmanlike tone of his own remarks following the tone of his important speech in Tralee.  This was taken up, certainly on the Opposition Benches, by speeches of the quality we have had from Deputy Harte, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, and as a Labour Deputy, I may perhaps be allowed to express pride in the distinguished <Col N="1569" /> contributions which have come from these benches beginning with Deputy Corish.</P>
    <P>The core of all the statements round this semi-circle was &ldquo;no coercion&rdquo;, that there will be no attempt to end the partition of this country by forcing in people who are not prepared to come in, who do not want to come in.  I support those who have urged that we give solemn all-party expression to this and the all-party factor is very important here.  I would respectfully urge the Taoiseach that he take that into consideration perhaps a little more strongly than he has shown himself prepared to do.  I would say here that there is a distinction between all-party solidarity and simply giving the necessary support to Fianna Fáil policy.  The Minister for Education the other day invoked the concept of national solidarity on national unity in a rather peculiar context, the context of nominating a Fianna Fáil candidate in a by-election in this city.  Apparently the electors were invited to express their desire for national unity by voting Fianna Fáil. I do not think any of us, outside of those benches, can accept that doctrine. However, we can and do welcome this emphasis, new emphasis though it may be, on non-coercion.</P>
    <P>What we must ask and what some Deputies have asked is whether we have drawn the logical consequences of this, this idea that there can be no unity without removing the suspicions and fears of the Protestants in the north.  The Taoiseach rather poohpoohed the existence of these fears.  If I may say so that is not wise.  These fears are very real, they are strong, they move people to violent and foolish action and we should take them into account and weigh very carefully the question of how we deal with them. We have to ask ourselves, and this is the most appropriate moment to do it, whether we have even begun to lay the foundations of a serious and coherent long-term approach to this matter which is pre-eminently one in which all parties here, and everybody in public life, must take part if it is to make progress. There are serious reasons for doubt that this is yet the case.  There are disquieting signs that attitudes quite <Col N="1570" /> at variance with this grand objective of national reconciliation to which we all pay tribute are at work.  I shall mention some of these.  I hope I shall be doing so, not in a polemical spirit, but in an attempt to indicate the kind of thing we must avoid if we are to make any progress on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government was reported the other day as saying at a public meeting that we must get rid of the wrongs not of 50 years ago only but of 300 years ago.  I do not know what he meant by that.  We had not the privilege of hearing him in this debate when he might have explained it but it will suggest to many people that the wrong that is to be undone is the plantation of Ulster in the 17th Century.  How?  By uprooting the descendants of the planters?  Is that it?  If it is not it, it is time that it was made clear because it was a statement not of a character to conciliate people in the north whom we are supposed to be trying to persuade. If we renounce coercion we have no alternative but to persuade and in order to persuade you must take into account the other man's feelings and opinions, his fears, even his prejudices. We have shown very little sign I fear of doing that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make this just an attack on any particular party or people and I have to say here something about the statement made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave.  I have great personal respect for Deputy Cosgrave.  I worked under him in the Department of External Affairs some years ago.  I learned to appreciate his consideration and his courtesy.  Unfortunately, like many people in our public life, sometimes perhaps when he stands up he gets a little crosser than he would deem it appropriate to be in private life.  He attacked the <i>Irish Times</i>.  Now it is all right for him to attack the <i>Irish Times</i> just as it is all right for the <i>Irish Times</i> to attack him.  This is part of the normal progress of debate.  I have no comment on that whatever. However, in the course of doing so he referred to the &ldquo;alien background&rdquo; of this newspaper.  The alien background ... The editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> is a <Col N="1571" /> Belfast Protestant.  Is that what is meant by &ldquo;alien background&rdquo;?  If it is, the sooner we give up any thought of conciliating or persuading these people the better; it will be better for us to retire into our own self-organised ghetto because that is what that expression conveyed.  I think it was an unguarded expression but I feel that Deputies who use that kind of expression should consider carefully what their attitude really is towards their fellow Irishmen, the more so as the Deputy concluded his remarks by drawing on, of all people, Theobald Wolfe Tone and his famous doctrine, more often quoted than respected, about &ldquo;the common name of Irishman&rdquo;. The background of Theobald Wolfe Tone was every bit as &ldquo;alien&rdquo; as that of Douglas Gageby, the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i>.  It was in fact the same.  We should think about that.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the course of this debate, which as I have said was on the whole at a high level, there was an incident yesterday which you, Sir, will recall.  My friend and colleague, Deputy Keating, used an expression which caused considerable anger in this House, and was responsible for a very angry reply, and you, Sir, rose in the dignity of your office and rebuked him and called on him to withdraw it. What was this terrible reference?  It was the comparison of the Taoiseach to Major Chichester-Clark.  Major Chichester-Clark, whatever we may think of him, is respected by the very section of the people whom we are supposed to be trying to persuade and conciliate.  Yet, we all take it for granted that a reference to this man constitutes a gross insult, that this man, therefore, must be some kind of moral leper from whom we all shrink.  The psychology of persuasion does not seem to be at work here and again we should look into our hearts and minds on these matters and see whether we are really trying to persuade.</P>
    <P>There have been tributes here to our own tolerance.  There is a strong and generous vein of tolerance in this society but, as in other societies, there are also streaks of intolerance.  We pride ourselves on our treatment of <Col N="1572" /> the Protestant minority here but I do not think it should constitute a matter for pride and self-congratulation; in so far as it is even-handed and decent we should be able to take it for granted. Even granted that it does shine &mdash; and it does by comparison with conditions in the North &mdash; let us ask ourselves this question: if instead of having this tiny minority of five per cent we had a Protestant minority of 33 per cent and if that minority disapproved of our political institutions here and was believed to wish to subvert those institutions, how would we behave?  We should ask ourselves that very serious question.</P>
    <P>Nobody who has heard what Deputy Billy Fox said today can be sure that we would behave in those circumstances very much better than they do up there.  When Deputy Fox spoke, when he exhibited that shameful placard and held it up before those benches opposite I looked for any sign of shame.  There was none whatever. One Deputy sitting behind the Taoiseach suggested that Deputy Fox had fabricated or forged this placard himself. That was the authentic accent of intolerance and bigotry.  It is in that tone that certain Protestants in the North of Ireland when they hear that a Catholic house was burnt out, say: &ldquo;They burned it themselves.&rdquo;  That indicates arrogance and intolerance, things which we must try seriously to banish from our public life, not just by lip service to toleration but by its actual practice and conduct.</P>
    <P>I think it is established that there is need for a change in the tone of our public life and that this debate is helpful in that direction.  What else is needed?  I have a little less time than I thought I should have to develop these ideas but then I am glad I surrendered time because it enabled us to hear Deputy Fox in his significant statement which should be commended. I suggest the following as things we ought try to do: first, actually to reach the Protestants of the north, not with an anti-Partition message at this time but with a firmly worded and unanimous message that we have no intention of trying to coerce them or get others to coerce them into an Irish <Col N="1573" /> State.  We have said it; the Taoiseach said it at Tralee and we greatly welcome that, but our message, I believe, has not yet effectively reached them. It is on this problem of reaching these people with that message that the services of all these able public relations experts that we have are needed.  We do not need them explaining this matter to the populations of Venezuela or Saudi Arabia, or wherever in the world they may have been sent.  It is in relation to this, the only population that we need and want to persuade, that we require them.</P>
    <P>A crew from Ulster Television was here very recently.  When I saw them they were looking for people to interview on this question.  I believe they interviewed Deputy Garret FitzGerald and they did interview a representative of our party but they told me they were having very great difficulty in getting any spokesman of the Government to talk to them.  I do not know if anybody ever did, or whether they went away without being able to get a Government representative to talk to the people whom we are supposed to be trying to persuade over a medium which can reach them, an opportunity which does not present itself every day.</P>

      <P>In order to make this message, this beginning of an attempt at persuasion, credible we need to drop altogether, I suggest, all forms of anti-Partition propaganda addressed to third parties.  We must cut them out and also say that is what we are doing.  I make a distinction here between anti-Partition propaganda and the publicising of the grievances, real and serious, of the minority in the north.  We are right in publicising those; we publicised them too little; we used too little pressure to bring about change in that domain where it was needed and also, as other Deputies have said, we confused the issue by mixing up civil rights and Partition so that nothing was really heard on the civil rights issue.  I hope &mdash; it is still only a hope; we cannot be sure &mdash; that with the implementation of the Hunt and Cameron Reports, supposing Mr. Wilson's Government <Col N="1574" /> stands firmly behind them and supposing these reforms are carried out, in that case, given equality of rights existing in reality, all forms of propaganda addressed to third parties on this subject should be cut out, and we should make that clear.  What is the use &mdash; if we are determined that we wish to persuade these people and that only by their persuasion will unity be obtained &mdash; of trying to persuade other people that there should be unity? We sent a man to Australia about this, a very gifted and able man. Suppose he does convince the Australians that Partition is wrong &mdash; so what?  We are wasting a man's time and talents on a quite futile mission.</P>
      <P>Again, we should let it be known that the implementation of the Hunt and Cameron Reports will open the way for better relations between the two parts of the country.  I believe the Taoiseach may make it specifically clear and that this is a beginning of better relations and not the signal for a stepped-up take-over bid.  Here, certain symbolic matters are important, such as how we refer to this entity. We say &ldquo;the Six Counties&rdquo; and various other things.  We avoid, particularly in times of stress, the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Northern Irelan&rdquo; is how the majority of the people of that entity wish their entity to be described.  We may say this is not geographically descriptive, that it leaves out County Donegal and so on. It is not geographically descriptive but if we want to allay passions and persuade, it is better to use the official name of the entity.  To refuse to use it implies that we do not recognise any kind of legitimacy on their side and that we are only biding our time until we can go in.  There is too much of that thinking about and we should discourage it courageously by the use of proper words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it should be recognised that before the forms of political unity can be profitably discussed there must be agreement that unity is actually desired. That is the first requirement.  The discussion of a federal solution may sound very reasonable to us and may one day be very relevant but in so far as it is expressed while they still <Col N="1575" /> show no wish even to talk about it, it can only appear to them as expressive of a stubborn wish on our part to dispose of them against their will. On some of our walls there used to be written up by a certain element in our population a slogan, &ldquo;Damn your concessions, England&rdquo;.  I fear the reaction of many Orange people &mdash; and we have to think of them also &mdash; to talk about a federal solution is: &ldquo;Damn your concessions, Dublin&rdquo;.  They have not got that far; they are not thinking in those terms and while they are not thinking in those terms we are only soliloquizing if we speak in such terms.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch briefly on the question of constitutional amendment. Again, the Taoiseach's statement on Article 44 was very much to be welcomed and it helped also to set the tone of this debate.  I should like to express, however, some regret at the suggestion in the Taoiseach's language yesterday that this matter was not urgent. I agree it is not a panacea.  It will not solve or end Partition overnight or otherwise speedily.  But it is symbolic; it is important; and therefore it is urgent.</P>
    <P>It is urgent because a Constitution should be an integrating document. It should be something which is respected and can earn the respect of others.  It now appears that one section of it at least &mdash; and I believe other sections also &mdash; lacks the support of, as far as I can find out, anybody in the Parliament of the State of which this is the Constitution.  Are we content that that should be so, that when children are taught the Constitution in classes they should be told: &ldquo;Oh, you can forget that bit.  You know, the Taoiseach said that was not much good the other day.&rdquo;?  I do not think that helps or that it engenders the right attitude towards the Constitution. I think it also encourages a tendency, already quite strong enough in our national life, towards intellectual dishonesty, that is to say, affecting to profess things in which you do not actually believe.</P>
    <P>Then it has been suggested that we should remove from our Statute Book all legislation that would not have been enacted in the conditions of a united <Col N="1576" /> Ireland.  Now, that suggestion was made.  It takes some courage to make it in public life here.  That it does was shown by the quality of an interruption from the Fianna Fáil back benches.  One interrupter asked Deputy Desmond what the policy of the Opposition on this question was, and another interrupter answered the first interrupter in the antiphonal manner these gentlemen sometimes have, by giving him the answer: &ldquo;Divorce, contraception and get rid of the Irish language,&rdquo; as a summary of what the Opposition are saying.  We sometimes get here a whiff of life as it is actually lived in certain strata of the political life of this country &mdash; and it is probably healthy that we do get it occasionally here, and we got it there.  Unless that method of treating grave national issues is actively discouraged by the Taoiseach it will continue and it will damage our national life and, above all, it will damage this effort at persuasion we are supposed to be engaged on. It is not enough here to pretend not to hear these things.  It is as well to hear them.</P>
    <P>There is also a serious need for education in our country on this subject, in this part of the country specifically, in the 26 Counties.  Children have been brought up and elderly men are continuing to live on the idea that this region is &ldquo;occupied Ireland,&rdquo; that it is held down by force.  Mind you, many of the Protestants are beginning to sympathise with this point of view, but it is a gross and dangerous oversimplification of the actual position. We must teach the children and teach those adults who do not know it, that Partition is not the root cause of this matter.  The troubles which we have just seen, the terrible troubles there, and Partition, are both off-growths of the same thing, that is to say, the deep historical division between the two main religious communities. People must be exhorted to see that and must not be encouraged to see this in oversimplified terms.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a need for more contacts with people there, more informal contacts, more effective contacts. My party have been trying to play their part in that and Deputy <Col N="1577" /> Corish and others have described what we did.  I think this is of use.  We believe that the Labour movement is one important integrating force in relation to this matter.  In connection with that I should like, like other Deputies, to praise the splendid work which has been done by the trade union movement, by the shop stewards in Belfast, in keeping sectarian violence out of the shipyards and elsewhere.  That, I think, is the best thing that has been done throughout this period.  I would think that these men deserve very high recognition for that.  They belong in the category of people who might be considered for the Nobel Prize for peace and I should like like-minded Deputies at some time to develop that idea.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, however, is this &mdash; and I am going to give a quotation here.  The quotation is this &mdash; it is syntactically rather odd but it contains an immense deal of wisdom under the idiosyncratic syntax:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The only policy for abolishing partition that I can see is for us in this part of Ireland to use such freeddom as we can secure to get for the people in this part of Ireland such conditions as will make the people in the other part of Ireland wish to belong to this part.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Taoiseach or do any of the gentlemen on the opposite benches recognise the source of that quotatiton?  It is Eamon de Valera, 1st March, 1933, here in the Dáil.  I would draw the attention of the Taoiseach respectfully to the fact that Mr. de Valera on that occasion did not say just that this was a nice policy, or an attractive policy, or one of many possible policies to be alternated with others.  He said it was the <i>only</i> policy for abolishing Partition that &ldquo;I can see&rdquo;.  Unfortunately after that he tried looking around for other policies and that was not so successful but on that day in March, 1933, he told it, as they say in New York, &ldquo;like it was&rdquo;.  I think we ought to try to follow in his footsteps there.</P>
    <P>There are very serious social problems in both parts of this island but it is for this part that we here have responsibility.  Yesterday one Deputy lamented the fact that the population <Col N="1578" /> of Derry was being driven by unemployment to emigration.  I wonder does the Deputy consider that this ill is peculiar in this island to the city of Derry?  It is not.  I would agree with those Deputies who have urged that our first attention must be given to setting our own house in order and that it is not in order and that in some ways it is economically and socially behind &mdash; in some ways only &mdash; the situation up there.</P>
    <P>The tragic time through which the north has been passing will not have been in vain if it leads us all in both territorial parts of the island and more importantly &mdash; much more importantly &mdash; in both the main communities of the Irish people to re-assess the position in the light not of the sins of the other party but of our own responsibilities for what has happened.  For the future our study should be in terms not of how we can get rid of the Border but of the immediate thing: how we in the two main communities can live more decently together in this island and how we here can make that part of the island for which we here are responsible into a society whose example, performance and style of living will attract people of both communities together.  It is in that way only that we will begin to move towards the achievement of what is the ideal of us all, a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reference to Deputy Cosgrave at the beginning of his speech Deputy Cruise-O'Brien took a phrase entirely out of context.  If he reads the speech carefully, even as reported this morning, without going to the verbatim report of the debate in the House, he will see that he was referring to a policy of 40 or 50 years ago and not in any way referring to anything that could by any stretch of the imagination be taken to refer to the present editor of the <i>Irish Times.</i> In fact, anyone who knows the facts in that regard knows quite clearly that it was a reference to the manner in which the paper in those days used to lecture us from across the sea, not from any part of this island.  Apart from that there is one other sentence that perhaps one might pick out of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's remarks in <Col N="1579" /> that regard and note particularly, because one of the complaints about Deputy Cosgrave is that he does not get cross enough so I was glad to hear Deputy Cruise-O'Brien saying he got cross when he was on his feet.</P>
      <P>I do not think there has ever been any case in the past 40 or 50 years in which the Government of the day on a national issue got as complete cooperation and as reasonable an approach as this Government got over the past couple of months.  They got it in spite of the fact that one major approach, to which I shall refer in a few moments, was rejected completely.</P>
      <P>This has been and will be for some time to come a matter on which it is easy by a wrong word to do incalculable harm; it is easy to get carried away, easy in the heat of the moment to say something that, on mature reflection, one would wish not to have said.  It was in that spirit and in that knowledge that we in this party made it clear all along that we were not going to play party politics on this issue.  In doing so we recognised that we might be criticised in certain respects perhaps because we did not object, because we did not criticise, because we did not repudiate steps that the Fianna Fáil Government might have taken and with which we did not agree.  It was of much more value nationally that one would make it clear to the world at large, and particularly to those in Britain as well as those in the North of Ireland, that we were at one on national issues though we might differ in details on the manner of implementation.</P>
      <P>The fact that we did not raise criticism does not mean that we accept everything, does not mean particularly that we think the handling by the Government does not in many respects leave something to be desired.  However, the principles are the same.  The basis of the whole trouble at present is the division of our country, the manner of that division by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and the fact that that brought about in Northern Ireland a government which has not changed its outlook for 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one says that, it is not to <Col N="1580" /> talk of Partition as such.  It is the fact that the division of the country enabled the government in the north to be so constructed that it would not be representative and would not consider it necessary to reflect in any way the views of such a very large minority in that area.  I agree with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien that it is a mistake to refer to the &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo;.  It does not really matter in one sense; it annoys them as it equally annoys me when I hear them referring to themselves as &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo;.  These are typical of the things we must try to avoid. If they have, by their 50 years of domination by one particular party, grown up to believe until a very short time ago that this was the right way, we too on our part down here cannot escape some of the blame for having allowed them to do so.</P>
    <P>There is at present in Northern Ireland a recognition &mdash; it has come only in very recent times &mdash; amongst the members of Stormont belonging to the ruling party that they have sadly neglected the rights of the ordinary people and that they have endeavoured in those years to copperfasten their role as second-class citizens.  The moderates to whom I refer realise now that that was so and are making efforts to alter the fact.  However, what we must not forget is that because this has been going on for 50 years, there has been, apart from the extreme right wing element symbolised by two people who seem to feed on hate &mdash; Paisley and Craig &mdash; a build-up at local authority level.  That is the level at which we must make a particular effort to show them that there is no real justification for their fears and that they have been brought up in an atmosphere that was not justified by the facts.</P>
    <P>I can remember in 1945 going up to Belfast to speak as the President of the Irish Tourist Association at a luncheon at which the then Lord Mayor of Belfast, Mr. Crawford McCullough, was the chairman and Mr. Basil Brook, as he then was, was also one of the speakers.  Even at a tourist luncheon like that one got the same outlook predominating, an outlook that one was not really to be considered as being in the same country. <Col N="1581" /> I am bound to say that when I got that reaction from both of them I probably did not help by coming back with a strong reaction about Partition, a reaction in a speech which they resented very much.</P>
    <P>We must not do anything that will give people any sort of excuse not to accept the realities of the situation. Speaking for myself and for Fine Gael, I accept unreservedly the <i>bona fides</i> of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and that it is his policy as the head of the Government to adopt the outline of the speech he made in Tralee.  I welcome that conversion by Fianna Fáil back to the policy of Griffith and Collins and I accept, as I say, unequivocally that that is the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We are operating in this part of the country under a written Constitution, a Constitution which sets out in Article 28 that it is not the Government but Dáil Éireann that has the right to determine whether there shall be armed force used or not.  I think, therefore, that the Taoiseach and the Government were very badly advised not to accept the motion we put down that this House declared that force was not something we believed should be used in dealing with the problem of the division of our country.  I cannot help feeling the only reason the Government did not accept that was because they felt, for party reasons, it would be undesirable to do something which had been suggested by us.  It would have been infinitely stronger to assuage the unjustified fears if that resolution had been put to this House at the end of the debate and had been accepted&mdash; as I think it would have been accepted &mdash; unanimously.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am not in any way inpugning the <i>bona fide</i> acceptance by the Taoiseach, as the head of the Government, of the policy he has adumbrated.  I think he made the mistake of not realising that it is not the Government, as such, who have this right under our written Constitution but it is Dáil Éireann who have the right and who should have made that declaration. Indeed, when the declaration was made by the Fine Gael Party one of the <Col N="1582" /> things that was at once noticeable was the reaction from the other side of the water.  It was stated in the editorial of a newspaper not always friendly to Ireland that they readily accepted it as being part of a policy which was going to assist both in the defusing of the present situation and in the consideration of long-term solutions.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the fact that the problem which we are discussing today was brought to the United Nations.  I do not criticise that; on the contrary we in Fine Gael thought, even before the Government moved, that it was a good thing because we believed then, and on looking back one cannot but believe now, that the introduction of the problem to the United Nations, whether it got on the agenda or not, was something that brought home to the British people their responsibility and the need to take urgent steps if a pogrom was to be avoided.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, we did not believe in seeking publicity for the sake of publicity.  When delegations from this party went to the north we did not look for any publicity in doing so but one of the things we discovered on all sides there was an acceptance of the fact that very much worse disasters were only avoided by a matter of hours.  I think there is little doubt that the early suggestion of the matter being taken to the United Nations helped to ensure that steps would be taken to avoid the confrontation that was so nearly imminent.  I do not suppose for an instant that anyone really believed we would succeed in having a formal resolution accepted at the United Nations.  I do not think that should have been the purpose.  I think the purpose should have been to ensure that there was an appreciation of our views and an appreciation of the urgency of action to avoid a confrontation of the sort that would otherwise undoubtedly have arisen.</P>
    <P>As a result of acknowledgement of the problem outside Ireland we have travelled a long way in ensuring that in any part of our island there is not going to be any acceptance of a second-class citizen in the future.</P>
    <P>It became clear that there could be <Col N="1583" /> no solution of the immediate problems without three things.  First, without the reform of the RUC and the disbandment of the B Specials, because without that there could not be any possible confidence such as is accepted internationally in any police force.  Secondly, there must be &mdash; if there was going to be the abandonment of a sense of fear &mdash; very radical changes in the powers of arrest exemplified by the Special Powers Act.  And, thirdly, there must be a clear and proper reform of local government administration for two reasons.  First of all because of the gerrymandering at that level up there; and, secondly, because it was at that stage local government had the allocation of housing.</P>
    <P>It was a measure of criticism of us here that someone from Northern Ireland was able to come to Dublin last night and say that for a population half our population they were building more than double the number of houses that we are building at present.  I accept in certain respects there is more of a backlog in one way there but I must say for that statistical reference to be able to be made was something that must put us to shame. There must be more than mere reform of housing allocations which are now going to be taken away from local authorities.  There must be real reform in local authorities and this reform must mean fair constituencies at local government level in order that we get rid of the type of gerrymandering which existed before by which parts of one county were taken into another and which exists at present whereby 36,000 people in Derry are enabled to get only eight seats because of the housing ghettoes crowded into that ward, whereas 22,000 in the other area can get 12 seats.</P>
    <P>Again, when I was in Derry I experienced some shame in being told that of course in the new proposals published in a White Paper by the Northern Ireland Government, the taking of part of a county from one administrative area and putting it into another was only in keeping with what the Minister for Local Government did here last year in the Electoral <Col N="1584" /> (Amendment) Bill.  Be that as it may, it is something that one wants to make sure will be in any local government reform &mdash; a provision not merely ensuring one man, one vote, but also one man, one vote of equal value.</P>
    <P>The worst thing the Government here did was the rejection by the Taoiseach of the proposal from this party for the formation of an all-party committee.  Many people throughout the country assumed that the Government, on a national issue of this kind, automatically passed confidential information to the leaders of the Opposition &mdash; I do not mean either one leader or the other.  Many people assume that governments do this.  Of course, it does not happen.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Taoiseach did not see Deputy Cosgrave when Deputy Cosgrave asked him to see him, but from that day to this there has not been a communication of any sort on this matter.</P>
    <P>That is bad.  It is wrong and it is not a national approach.  I believe that in relation to this problem it is not even yet too late to form an all-party committee. The formation of such a committee could do a lot to develop our consideration of the ways and means in which we can allay fears.  It could do a lot to ensure that we have a bipartisan approach rather on the lines of American foreign policy in certain respects.  I believe the implementation now of the suggestion we made then for the inception of an all-party committee would mean that there would be less danger of anything being said in an unguarded moment that might play on fears which were not justified.  It would mean there would be a constructive approach on all sides to harmonise and to co-operate and to weld together the efforts we need if we are to get an Ireland which is thinking on the same lines.  Unless we get all thinking on the same lines we will not be able to deal with the division of our country.</P>
    <P>If there was such an all-party committee there would not be the danger of a repetition of the inept handling by the Government of the information in relation to the call-up of the reserves and the establishment <Col N="1585" /> of medical stations along the Border. The handling and the timing of the dissemination of that information was so inept as to warrant great criticism, and we all know that once rumours get out it is twenty times harder to chase them and to correct them.  If in a clear and concise way the Government had made their views known at the same time they were taking action there would not have been rumours on all sides.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it was in the spirit that there was to be reform in relation to civil rights, in relation to the abolition of second-class citizens, that those of us who were at the Council of Europe took an entirely different line from any line ever taken by an Irish delegation abroad.  It was concentrated on reasoned amendment to human rights conventions to ensure that it would operate not only at Government level but also at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The success of that, the manner in which that resolution was accepted and signed, not merely by delegates from Northern Ireland and Great Britain but by many delegates from other parts of Europe at the Council of Europe meeting at Strasbourg, shows we got across the necessity of trying to make certain that the fears of others were wiped out, and it was done in a constructive fashion.  That resolution will be coming up again from the Legal Committee to the Council as a whole and the fact that it will come up will be an added urge, if urge there need be, to those who are responsible for seeing that these reforms are put through, whether at Stormont or at Westminster.</P>
    <P>Some people have said that it is too soon, too early, to talk of federalism or federated solutions.  My colleagues at Strasbourg with me can bear out that one of the extraordinary things on that occasion was that, whether talking to Members of Parliament on the Labour side or the Conservative side from Britain, or to Members of Parliament from other parties, one got the same reaction all the time &mdash; that something must be done.  There were certain fundamentals they wanted to protect but they were prepared to talk and to see how solutions could be <Col N="1586" /> achieved.  That is something that never existed before and is something of which we can take advantage.  Let us be fair and generous about this: on the one hand there is a moderate element in Stormont doing their utmost to put through the civil rights reforms so urgently needed, and on the other hand there is the declaration by the head of the Government here and by the other parties that they will do their best to allay any fears there may be in the north.</P>
    <P>This is something we can get across much better by a united approach; first, by a formal resolution in this House and, secondly, by the formation even at this stage of an all-party committee so that all the world will know we are speaking with one voice, and without reservations, on the same line. The formation of such a committee would probably in the future mean we would be able to add to it by the inclusion of moderate opinion from Northern Ireland as well.</P>

      <P>I think we can claim this debate has been conducted generally on a moderate note and in an objective way.  There have been one or two offerings that were not quite consistent with the general tenor, but one can ignore that, I suppose.  Nevertheless, one must conclude, having listened to the objective approach of the three different parties that nobody can say that in any way there was a pre-debate arrangement that all would be on one note.  There was no contact so far as I know between the parties. Nevertheless we can congratulate ourselves that this debate has been a mature one and I believe a very helpful one.  I am not going to refer to some of those jarring notes which were made during the course of the debate. Rather would I prefer to confine myself to general observations and perhaps some in particular later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I anticipated, and as I said at the start, I did not expect everybody would agree with everything the Government did and everything I said during the course of the days and weeks following the 12th and 13th of August last.  That would have been unreasonable. Again I would like to acknowledge the general support given to the <Col N="1587" /> Government's point of view.  Nevertheless, as I anticipated here yesterday and today, there would be some criticism of Government actions during those few days and especially the Government action immediately after the events of the day of the 12th and the morning of the 13th of August.  I want to say here and now I stand over everything the Government decided and and did on that occasion and I stand over everything contained in my statement on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We were faced with a very grave position and a very grave situation that had developed.  I believe the actions we took were in the best interests of securing a quick remedy to the most serious aspects of that situation.  Everybody here knows the feelings of tension that existed not only in the northern part of the country but in this part as well.  Everybody knows a lot of people were thinking in terms of taking strong action.  I am not suggesting that this was confined to what we might call subversive elements.  I believe the Government action in all its aspects held the situation here, which could have been a very serious one in the context of all the developments that took place in the north during those few days.  I believe when objective reviewers come to appraise that situation that will be the consensus of opinion.  I do not think I need develop that to any considerable extent or at any great length at this stage as everybody has admitted during the course of the debate one must be temperate, one must be moderate and one must avoid any words or phrases that would in any way tend to upset the present situation.</P>
    <P>Criticism there was of Government action and the criticism having been made one would ask what alternatives might have been suggested.  As far as I can make out the only two tangible things suggested were (1) that I might have recalled the Dáil and (2) that I should have paid a visit to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson.  Again, I would like to refer to the temper of the country as I understood it, and in fact, knew it to be at that time, not only just then but for the weeks which immediately followed the events of the <Col N="1588" /> 12th and the 13th August.  I believed then, as I believe now, that it would not have been advisable to recall the Dáil at that time and to have a debate. I said that it was with some degree of trepidation that I agreed to have this debate during those few days.  Perhaps my trepidation was not justified in anticipation.  Certainly it was not justified in the event but I believe such trepidation might very well have been justified had the debate taken place in the third or fourth week of August or the early weeks of September.</P>
    <P>Every one of us at that time, after the 13th and 14th of August, and having heard of the terrible events, woke every morning and turned on our radios apprehensive lest we hear of some more serious happenings.  If we had had the debate at that time even more serious happenings might in fact have taken place and it would have been very difficult for us to absolve ourselves against charges made that what was done or said here in this House would have contributed in some way to those happenings.  So much for the recall of the Dáil.  I know I have not dealt with it to any considerable extent but the last two Deputies who spoke will appreciate how difficult it is to pace a speech when one is limited to a very certain stricture of time.</P>

      <P>The only other suggestion made was that I should have gone to London to see Mr. Wilson during those few days.  I believe, although I must say I contemplated a possible visit, I would have made little progress at that time in relation to the situation that had developed in the north.  Let us review, for examination of that suggestion, the sequence of events as they occurred.  The Apprentice Boys parade took place on the 12th August.  We had the events of the 13th and 14th August in Derry and Belfast.  On the 15th August the Minister for External Affairs did in <Col N="1589" /> fact go to London and saw on that occasion Lord Chalfont, even though he hoped to see Mr. Stewart who at that time had left London on his holidays. Nevertheless he was able to put the Irish point of view to Lord Chalfont at that time.</P>
      <P>On the 18th August the British Prime Minister returned from his holidays and summoned a special cabinet meeting to deal with the situation in the Six Counties.  On the following day, the 19th August, the Stormont Prime Minister saw Mr. Wilson.  When the British Government met on the 18th August obviously they did not just decide that Mr. Callaghan would visit Belfast and Derry.  Obviously they made a more far reaching decision as well as to what approach Mr. Callaghan might make and what remedies he might suggest to relieve the situation there.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the meeting of the Stormont and British Premiers there followed the announcement of the visit of Mr. Callaghan to Belfast and Derry. That visit took place, as far as I remember, on Wednesday, 27th August. That was almost within a fortnight of the decision.  Had I gone to see Mr. Wilson is it not obvious he would have told me he had the situation well in hand?  British troops had already gone into Derry on the 14th August and into Belfast during that weekend.  Mr. Callaghan was going to the north to see what he could do to defuse the situation and I would have been told that it would be better before we had any further discussion to see what would come out of those activities and initiatives.  When I was young I remember learning a nursery rhyme that went something like this:</P>
      <P>Pussy cat pussy cat, where have you been?</P>
      <P>I've been to London to see the Queen.</P>
      <P>What did you get?  Bread and jam?</P>
      <P>What did you say?  Thank you mam.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that I would have received extreme courtesy from Mr. Wilson.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. At the end of April the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Aiken, went to the UN to apprise the Secretary General of what we saw to be developing. We also apprised Mr. Wilson indirectly of the situation but he was involved at the time in the big wages controversy. He had meetings day after day with the trade unions and he told me indirectly that because of these meetings and because of his preoccupation with that problem he was not then able to see me.  I appreciated his difficulty. Soon after that we had the general election here but shortly after that Dr. Hillery went to London to warn of the possible effects of the augmented Apprentice Boys parade.  I do not think that anybody can suggest that in these circumstances we were in any way neglectful of trying to prevent the events that we saw were likely to build up and which, did come to pass in the north.</P>
      <P>Our action in relation to our publicity campaign has also been criticised here.  As Deputy Sweetman knows there is a maxim in law <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> which loosely interpreted means &ldquo;facts speak for themselves&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the facts of the situation in Northern Ireland were often not let speak for themselves and the facts as they developed during these days were certainly not let speak for themselves. Therefore, we decided that it was necessary to recruit these specialists in journalism and in press relations in order to make sure that the facts were made known and that correct information was given and incorrect information refuted.  That was the sole purpose of augmenting the staff at the Government Information Bureau and, again, I should like to express my appreciation of the work they have done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald made many assertions and many criticisms on behalf of Fine Gael.  After the Fine Gael ten point plan was announced I said that it did no more than reiterate Government policy declared on a number of occasions; there is nothing new in it.</P>

      <P>I can bring the Deputy very far back, as far back, in fact, as 1921 and I quote from Dorothy MacArdle's book on <i>The Irish Republic</i> in which Mr. de Valera is quoted as having written to Lloyd George with reference to a statement made by Sir James Craig on the 19th July, 1921:</P>
      <P>... I have made it clear in public statements, which reflect the views of the Irish people, that Ireland, so far from disregarding the special position of the minority in North-East Ulster, would be willing to sanction any measure of local autonomy which they might desire, provided that it were just and were consistent with the unity and integrity of our island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going back a long time in order to indicate where the first thread of the fabric was taken up.  Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien has obliged us with a statement made by Mr. de Valera in the House in 1933. At the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis of the 12th October, 1954, Mr. de Valera referred to the entrenchment of the majority in the north as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the following day. I admit that he referred to that majority in the neighbourhood of Belfast and, again, he spoke about inducement of them.  At the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis of the 22nd November, 1955, Mr. de Valera referred to the injustices that were being wrought on the minority&mdash;this is in reply to Deputy Michael O'Leary, who said that we were insensible to the injustices and the discrimination until the 5th October, 1968&mdash;and said that a large number of the majority were alive to them. Mr. de Valera's statement may be found in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 23rd November, 1955.  On the 30th October, 1956, Mr. de Valera said that &ldquo;our plan is to win over the majority in the North&rdquo;.  At a press conference on <Col N="1592" /> the 8th March, 1957, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> Mr. de Valera said:</P>
      <P>We think force is not the real solution.  We do not want to coerce anybody.</P>
      <P>At the same press conference as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 9th March, 1957, Mr. de Valera said that &ldquo;real unity could not be achieved by the use of force&rdquo;.  In another statement made not by Mr. de Valera but by his immediate successor, Mr. Seán Lemass in addressing the Oxford Union on the 15th October, 1959, spoke of similar conditions operating in other areas, the outnumbering of people and their being outnumbered being the cause of their being denied their rights.  He said that similar conditions operate in other areas and contribute to petty acts of discrimination in such matters as housing and employment which characterised the local administration there.  Coming to more recent times, the Fine Gael statement was made on the 10th or 11th September. I had spoken on at least two occasions on the current crisis in terms very close to this supposed novel ten point plan of Fine Gael.  I want to say this in refutation of this claim because this seems to be a watershed in the mind of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  It is far from it.  The London <i>Times</i> acknowledged my statement and said that the Fine Gael ten point policy was only a reiteration of previous Government policy in this country.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that the only way in which it can or should be modified is with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland?  There must be consent and force is abhorrent. This is a technical point not covered in the Taoiseach's statement.</P>

The colleague sitting beside him now referred to it as our &ldquo;antics&rdquo; at the United Nations and as a distasteful effort.  He referred to the result of it as being humiliating for the Irish people. I am glad his senior colleague on the front bench has seen fit to laud our efforts and acknowledge that what was done was useful and important at that particular time in order to ensure that certain actions were taken by the British Government.</P>

      <P>Our actions were in logical sequence which led up to our going to the United Nations with the suggestion of a peace-keeping operation and with the request that Britain make use of the United Nations, knowing that unless Britain did make the request it could lead to unsurmountable difficulties.  It was a perfectly legitimate and logical sequence of events to go to the United Nations when Britain had refused to do so.  It did not take any promptings from Fine Gael to bring us to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on to other generalities, I wish to deal with another point which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald made.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is a man who, I know, likes to examine matters from a very scientific viewpoint.  He seldom makes loose statements and if he does he says: &ldquo;I hear it being said and this is how it goes.&rdquo;  He asserted last night that we had a Special Powers Act here and it ill-became us to ask the Northern Government <Col N="1594" /> to repeal their Special Powers Act.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald that there is a world of difference between the Special Powers Act in the north and our Offences Against the State Act.  Our Special Powers Act is in full conformity with the Convention of human Rights, which we signed and agreed to implement.  The British Government ratified the Human Rights Convention but derogated from it to the extent of its application to the Special Powers Act in the north.  Any relationship between our Offences Against the State Act and the Special Powers Act has long since been abolished. Anybody who feels aggrieved under our Offences Against the State Act has full right to go to the courts and, if he is not satisfied there, he has access to the Court of Human Rights. I notice Deputy Dr. FitzGerald nodding his head in agreement with what I have said but he put it in a different context last night.  I do not wish to go into detail on the powers of the Special Powers Act or the powers of the Home Secretary at Stormont.  They are so extensive that anything in our Offences Against the State Act pales into insignificance in comparison with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of amending the Constitution was referred to on a number of occasions.  An ombudsman was mentioned, and voting at 18 and various other provisions of a religious nature.  First of all, as far as the ombudsman is concerned, I do not believe we have a real need for an ombudsman in this country.  I hope Deputy Keating does not draw me out on him with his wry and cynical laughter.  Deputy Keating must know there is no subject of appropriate public administration which is incapable of being discussed here.  We have Question Time here every day, and every day each Minister is liable to be examined on any aspect of his administration. I have not heard citizens complaining that they have not had an opportunity, either through a Minister or through local representatives, of having any grievance aired or any remedy that should be applied put into effect.  If there were a necessity <Col N="1595" /> for an ombudsman or a desire among citizens for one I would not be adverse to examining the possibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to voting at 18 years, I wish to say that we have votes at 21 enshrined in the Constitution.  The amendment of the Constitution cannot be a light matter at any time.  I do not agree with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien that we should dash in and amend the offensive part of Article 44 with relation to the position of the Catholic Church.  There is more in the Constitution that must be examined. People here might suggest that if we were amending the Constitution we might include things that might appeal to the people in the north, for instance, divorce.  We might find that some people in the north might not go along with facilitating divorce.  There are many other points to be examined as well.</P>

      <P>It is.  The Constitution has been in existence since 1936 and it came into full effect in 1937.  It has served us well.  My predecessor, Mr. Lemass, knew that there were provisions needing attention and, perhaps, even urgent attention.  In the meantime I do not think we should dash in now to amend the Constitution. We seem to agree there is no need to acknowledge the special position of the Catholic Church.  Other points need objective examination also. I have no inhibitions about getting all parties in on this.</P>

      <P>I made the Government's position clear in my opening statement.  It is normal for a speaker replying to a debate here to deal with as many points as possible and I have dealt with all the points I can.  I was given half an hour to reply and I have taken the half hour I was given.  Our approach is the right approach.  I assert again I have no apology to make for anything the Government did or I said on 13th August, or since. I believe that what I did and said then was right.  I also believe that what I have said since was right.  I believe everyone is agreed on the fundamental issue, namely, the legitimate desire of the Irish people for reunification. There may be different ideas as to how that may be achieved, but there is a reasonable degree of unanimity with regard to certain steps that might be taken in this House.  Let us work on <Col N="1597" /> that basis and not introduce acrimony into this debate at this stage.  I could have introduced acrimony by replying to some of the references made to me by Deputy Corish's own colleagues, but I deliberately refrained from doing so.  As far as this party is concerned, we regard ourselves as the party of reunification. Fine Gael claim they are not responsible for Partition.  The Labour Party claim that only they acted with any degree of responsibility, and that only they were forward-looking in this situation.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, we are, as I have said, the party of reunification and so long as the other parties come along with us in that course they are welcome to join us.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons whose income is inadequate to provide general medical services for themselves and their dependants.  The percentage of the population covered by medical cards is thus a function of the general level of income in an area and even when similar criteria are applied in assessing applications, it is to be expected that there will be variations in the percentages so covered in different counties.</P>

    <P>With the increase in the numbers from this country travelling abroad it is desirable that information should be more readily available to intending travellers concerning the necessity for or desirability of vaccination against typhoid and other communicable diseases.

      <P>The Irish Heart Foundation, whose primary objective is to co-operate with the medical profession and business leaders to draw public attention to the loss of life through heart disease, engages in an intensive national publicity and educational programme.  I am aware that the foundation's programme concentrates attention upon cholesterol as one of the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease and suggests how the cholesterol levels in diet may be reduced.</P>
      <P>The foundation have also initiated a programme for screening the public to assist in the identification of overt cardiovascular disease.  This programme has been called &ldquo;Mediscan&rdquo; and, as part of the screening process, will investigate for high serum cholesterol levels.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is very hard for me to speak as an expert.  I was talking to someone representing the Heart Foundation recently and, if one looks at the publicity issued by the foundation, one will see that there is a certain emphasis on overweight.  It does suggest that the over-consumption of saturated fats may be an inducement to overweight and the formation of cholesterol.  Uninformed propaganda has been exaggerated to suggest that no one should eat any kind of saturated fat, but there is nothing in these leaflets here to suggest that everybody should take an extreme attitude.  The difficulty may have arisen as a result of a particular comment on a television programme which suggested a kind of panic attitude towards the consumption of butter.</P>

      <P>It is not possible for me to state with precision the total sum spent on cancer research in this country.  I can, however, say that expenditure under the auspices of the Medical Research Council and St. Luke's Hospital exceeded £33,000 in the year 1968 and I am aware of expenditure from other sources which would bring the figure considerably in excess of £50,000 in that year.  I consider expenditure of this order to be reasonable in our circumstances.  It must be remembered that cancer research in Ireland is not isolated from the main stream of cancer research in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to.  The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness had already indicated in its report that the problem of people who cannot control their consumption of beverages containing alcohol was a very serious one.  The commission recommended a number of measures in connection with the problem, including the greater involvement of general practitioners and others in the community in the treatment of <Col N="1603" /> alcoholics, the provision of psychiatric advice and care at out-patient clinics and of special units for those in need of residential care.</P>
      <P>Provision is made for the treatment of alcoholics at all health authority mental hospitals and at private mental hospitals and homes.  I have at present under consideration the extension of the existing facilities for residential care and I have asked mental hospital authorities for their views on the commission's recommendations in relation to alcoholism.  Mental hospital authorities were also advised in 1966 that the work of the Irish National Council on Alcoholism should be assisted and most of these authorities have responded by making grants towards the expenses of the council.  My Department also made a grant towards these expenses.  The council devotes itself mainly to the education of the public on the danger of alcoholism and on the means of helping those who are affected by the disease.</P>
      <P>A grant for the purpose of research by the Department of Psychiatry of University College, Dublin in the field of alcoholism has also been approved by my Department.</P>

Surely, the Minister is also aware that drugs are being freely peddled in clubs and in schools in this city?  I should like to ask the Minister could anything be done for the unfortunate people who have been &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; on drugs? I realise that he did not read yesterday's paper but if he had read it the Minister would have seen where a district justice did not know of a home in the country to which he could send a boy of 19.

He should be already aware of the steps being taken; that there is a special garda drug squad operating in Dublin, that we have taken measures to prevent the stealing of drugs from hospitals or dispensaries; that the security for drugs is now, I should think, pretty effective. We are introducing a Poisons Bill.  The legislation will come before the Dáil as soon as possible to deal with the control of those types of drugs not subject to control under present legislation. We have an out-patient advisory treatment on a 24 hour basis and a residential unit such as requested by the Deputy is being established at St. Brendan's Hospital, an in-patient unit for drug addicts.  Apart from that, we will be in touch with the medical profession on every matter concerned with over-prescribing of certain kinds of drugs, the use of amphetamine drugs and so forth.  We have also advised the various Departments concerned on the problems of drug smuggling.

In reply to the Deputy, may I make it perfectly clear that drug abuse and alcoholism are subject to characteristics of modern civilisation which it would take me half an hour to describe in detail so that, as the Deputy is well aware, no Government can stop drug addiction.  It is increasing everywhere.  All we can do is to try to limit it as much as possible. I would assure the Deputy that I have given instruction to the officers of my Department that in the course of the next two years we are not going to be in arrears in tackling this position as, quite evidently, some countries in Europe and abroad that I will not name have been.  We will do our best but I do not promise to stop an increase in drug addiction because it arises from causes not subject to absolute control by the national or the local authorities, as the Deputy well knows.</P>

We do have control over the issue and use and peddling of the hard drugs such as heroin but the use of hard drugs in this country is not a very great problem.  The main difficulty is the question of the illegal use of cannabis, marijuana and amphetamines. We are dealing with this as rapidly as we can and legislation will have to come before the Dáil.  I have no way of bringing it about by order. The Bill is being prepared.  It is a very complex Bill which covers a wide variety of matters concerning food and drugs.  It will come before the Dáil at as early a date as possible.  I hope to have sympathetic consideration of it by Members of the House&mdash;including the very difficult question of to what extent the Garda Síochána should be given additional powers in dealing with the discovery of the use of drugs.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer given to him by my predecessor on 20th June, 1968.</P>
      <P>No assessment has been made or is in progress in regard to the number of autistic children in the State.  As previously indicated, there is a residential unit of 30 beds for mentally ill children, including autistic children, at St. Loman's, Ballyowen, County Dublin, and a day-centre at St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  A further 24 bed unit at Beaumont, Dublin, has also been built and two additional 24 bed units are in planning at Stillorgan, County Dublin, and in Cork.  Schools are available at the units at St. Loman's and St. Kevin's and schools will be provided at the other units mentioned.  Transport is, or will be, provided at all units.</P>
      <P>There is a shortage of trained child psychiatrists and this presents a major problem in the development of services.</P>
      <P>Three of the units I have mentioned are, or will be, provided by voluntary organisations, mainly from funds contributed by my Department or by health authorities.  I am prepared to assist any organisation which can provide suitable services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that a survey is necessary in order to arrive at a proper assessment of the number of beds and the hospital accommodation that may be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing surveys. We have had the report of the Commission on Mental Handicap and we have examined all its provisions and have been doing surveys as to the number of beds required.  We have made plans for the provision of beds <Col N="1608" /> for mentally handicapped and psychiatrically ill children and we are making progress, as the Deputy knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the results of the surveys alarming or just what we would expect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is abnormal.  I would not say it is very alarming.  There are more mentally disabled or mentally handicapped people in every country than the people of these countries were aware of in previous years.  We are dealing with it as well as we can.  Also, in reply to the Deputy, there is so far very little agreement on what exactly is meant by the autistic child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will provide allowances to be paid in the case of all parents of mentally retarded and autistic children without regard to means of the family, in view of the special care to be provided at home by parents who cannot find accommodation for such children in any suitable institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the disabled persons maintenance regulations, allowances may be paid to handicapped persons over 16 years of age who are not maintained in institutions and whose near relatives are unable to maintain them.  The present Health Bill proposes that in assessing eligibility for these maintenance allowances only the handicapped person's own means and that of a husband or wife will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>While there is no special scheme for financial assistance for mentally handicapped or autistic children under 16 years of age who are cared for in their own homes, in necessitous cases health authorities provide special foods, medicines, drugs and appliances necessary for the home care of such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that it is necessary <Col N="1609" /> or desirable to provide allowances (as distinct from other types of assistance as mentioned) for parents as suggested in the question&mdash;thus setting mentally handicapped and autistic children apart from other ill or handicapped children in need of special care.  But, as the Dáil must be well aware, every effort is being made to expendite the provision of additional suitable accommodation for the care and treatment of these cases.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange for removal of duty and tax on all imported health foods not made or processed in this country, so that such foods may be available at a price free of duty to all who wish to obtain them but find that imposed duty makes it prohibitive to obtain supplies frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have arranged with the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce, and Agriculture and Fisheries that if the Deputy will submit to whichever is appropriate, having regard to any particular food he has in mind, the details in regard to that product, the question of exemption from duty will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared favourably to consider the general range of stocks available for sale in the health centres, most of which are imported and not readily available here, and which are of very great benefit to the health of the community in general if they have a knowledge of such foods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a complicated matter.  There are a great many of these processed foods which have perhaps rather a marginal effect on people's health.  I would have to consider all that.  The question of the reception or revenue is important in relation to the benefit conferred.  In the meantime, the matter will be considered by the Ministers concerned. The matter will be examined as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question. However, a high proportion of the graduates that have been indicated&mdash; about 40 per cent&mdash;are foreigners coming here.  We have had a great tradition of teaching foreigners the art of medicine.  It is a long tradition.  While there might be some modification in it. it is not one that would be or should be easily changed.  Our estimate of requirements of new doctors is one hundred per annum.  In the five years under question the numbers of Irish doctors qualifying amounted to approximately 850 or approximately 70 per annum more than our estimated requirements. We have always had a medical tradition.  The Deputy may be aware that there are parts of the world, including parts of England, where the entire medical service would collapse but for Irish doctors and nurses.</P>

Arising out of that discussion the two bodies undertook to consult their members about the administrative and disciplinary procedures regarded by the working party as necessary in order to guard against abuse. I agreed to have further discussions with the profession when the result of these consultations was available. Some days ago I received replies from the two organisations which I am now considering.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> Presumably the Deputies refer to a claim made by representatives of district medical officers for a major change in the basis of granting them time off duty.  As the claim has not so far been conceded by the employing health authorities, one of the staff organisations concerned&mdash;the Medical Union&mdash;has instructed its members not to make their services available as substitutes for district medical officers who may have to absent themselves from duty because of illness.  I have had discussions in the matter recently with representatives of the doctors; these discussions are continuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the medical officers referred to by the Medical Union in Question No. 16, apart from their holidays, have two days off per year from their duties &mdash;Christmas Day and Good Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officers have been in contact with the local authorities.  There is difficulty in making changes within a financial year in regard to such matters.  I myself was in touch with the Medical Union with a view to trying to have some understanding with them.  I would not wish to comment at this stage on any matter concerned with this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the Irish Medical Union have made it plain to the public that no member of the public would be deprived of medical services as a result of their action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That would seem to be the case.  I have not had any complaints of grave illness or failure to contact a patient arising from the action taken by the Medical Union.  I hope that will continue to be the case pending the settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of posts of district medical officers at present filled by temporary appointees; and if, having regard to the worsening position of doctor availability, particularly in rural areas, he will state what steps he will <Col N="1613" /> take as a matter of urgency to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of dispensary districts served by district medical officers on a temporary basis is 225.  There are 450 permanent DMOs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the only doctors available for temporary appointments in a number of dispensary districts reside outside the boundaries of the districts they serve. I realise that in some cases these arrangements may not be satisfactory for patients living at a distance from the temporary district medical officer appointed for their dispensary district. This situation will be improved under the proposed new general medical service with choice of doctor when dispensary district boundaries will disappear and eligible persons will be able to turn to the nearest doctor participating in the service.  Meanwhile, in the hope that the conditions of permanent appointments may prove more attractive than temporary appointments, the Local Appointments Commission has been requested to hold further competitions for permanent district medical officer appointments in a number of districts where the making of new permanent appointments will not create difficulty for the operation of the new service with choice of doctor. It is expected that a competition for 18 posts will be advertised soon by the commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are not permanent district medical officers in two of the areas mentioned, i.e., Shinrone-Moneygall and Ballinakill. No further permanent district medical officer appointments are being made in districts such as these two where the number of doctors who are <Col N="1614" /> available within a reasonable distance indicates that a choice of doctor scheme would operate satisfactorily for the areas when the proposed new general medical service is introduced.  In such districts local authorities would not be justified in making new appointments on a permanent basis at this stage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the Shinrone and Ballinakill districts, a service is being provided by doctors from adjoining areas.  While the temporary arrangements may not be fully satisfactory for all parts of the dispensary districts, the situation should improve when the new service, removing existing dispensary boundaries and giving the maximum choice of doctor, comes into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A change in the present practice of excluding married women from permanent nursing appointments under local authorities would involve a major policy decision with widespread implications.  I am aware that married nurses are being employed on a temporary basis by local authorities to meet staff shortages in some hospitals.  The limited extent to which this happens would not justify a change of policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister means is that they start at a salary which is the same as if they were starting for the first time and they then get increments but they get no credit for previous service and this in fact is putting them in a position very inferior to that of unmarried people.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows there have been improvements in the salaries and the increments of nurses as a whole and I could not make any commitment about further change.  It is a matter for the nurses' organisation. There have been considerable improvements. I am not saying that nurses are paid according to the job they do perhaps in relation to some other occupations but nevertheless, as the Deputy knows, there have been improvements and the salary scales for in-living nurses are satisfactory when compared with those in Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine local Health Authorities have not, as yet, decided to grant incremental credit to generaltrained nurses in respect of previous post-graduate experience.  My intimation that sanction would be forthcoming to the grant of such credit, up to a maximum of five increments, was designed to ease recruitment difficulties, where such existed, but it is a matter for health authorities to assess their own needs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I commented in a public statement on 21st October on some criticisms of the creamery milk price adjustments I announced on 3rd October which obscured the main facts of the situation. The facts are that:</P>
      <P>(1) Every creamery milk supplier in the country will, within the coming weeks, get a back payment of an additional penny per gallon on the first 1,000 gallons delivered in each of the months of May, June, July and August this year.</P>
      <P>(2) Suppliers of not more than 7,000 gallons per annum will also get with effect from 1st September last an additional penny per gallon.  Some 90,000 of the total of 112,000 creamery-milk suppliers deliver not more than 7,000 gallons each per annum and all of these will get the additional penny on their entire deliveries.</P>
      <P>(3) A further 15,000 suppliers who deliver between 7,000 and 14,000 gallons yearly will get an increase gradually declining from 1d and phased out at the 14,000 gallon mark.</P>
      <P>(4) Some 4,500 suppliers who deliver between 14,000 and 20,000 gallons yearly will bear no reduction.</P>
      <P>(5) The remaining 2,500 suppliers (only 2 per cent of the total) whose yearly deliveries exceed 20,000 gallons each will bear a phased reduction in price support according to the size of their deliveries.</P>
      <P>(6) The vast majority of creamery suppliers are accordingly getting a price increase at a time when increased production has to be sold on export markets at less than 1/- per lb for butter, which represents only 2d or 3d a gallon at the creamery.</P>
      <P>(7) Creamery milk price support will cost the Exchequer at least £31 million this year, as compared with some £25 million last year and £19 million in 1967-68.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> The large-scale suppliers of milk to creameries can, of course, produce milk at lower unit costs than those of the smaller suppliers, and the need for Exchequer support in their case is accordingly lower.  However, these large-scale suppliers will continue to benefit significantly from the Exchequer support.  For example, a supplier of 60,000 gallons per annum will still receive about 10d per gallon subsidy from State funds, which represents a total of £2,500 a year or an average subsidy of almost £50 per week.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the implication in Deputy Creed's question that the smaller producers are inefficient and unable to produce quality milk.  No change whatever has been made in the quality bonus of 2d per gallon, and all milk delivered to creameriees, whether by large-scale producers or small, is capable of being brought to the desired quality standard.</P>
    <P>The support adjustments which I have announced do not in any way represent a change of Government policy for creamery milk production.  They were in fact foreshadowed in the Third Programme which indicated that consideration would be given to the possibility of extending the phased system of price support for milk so as to channel a larger share of State support to the traditional supplier who is less well able to meet increasing costs than the large-scale commercial producer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask, first, if the Minister had discussions and consultations with the various farming organisations before this was introduced?  The Minister must surely be aware that in the past he and his Department, the agricultural advisory service and the county committees of agriculture throughout the country were exhorting farmers to greater efficiency.  Now that they have become more efficient &mdash;and this applies particularly to the production of milk&mdash;is it not true to say that because they have become efficient at some cost to themselves they have been penalised in price?  Is the Minister aware that his Department went so far as to give in many ways financial incentives to farmers to become more efficient and now they are being penalised as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1623" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is quite true, that we have in every way through the years in the Department made every endeavour to improve the efficiency of not only milk producers but of all other agricultural producers.  But the fact that this has been and continues to be the policy is in no way contradictory of what is now being done.  If we can improve efficiency&mdash;undoubtedly, it has been improved in the case of many milk producers&mdash;this brings about a situation in which their dependency on support by way of subsidy becomes less necessary in their case than in the case of the less efficient.  There is no contradiction such as appears to be in the Deputy's mind between encouraging efficiency and the scaling down of subsidy support and this particularly against the background of very depressed markets, glutted markets that are overwhelmed by production in other countries, particularly EEC countries, forcing us to sell at prices little better than give-away prices. That, coming back to rest on the Exchequer which of course is the taxpayer, makes it rather difficult if not impossible, to get sufficient money from the Exchequer or the taxpayers to help other necessitous farm groups as well as milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said, and perhaps I should say it again, that were it not for the phasing of support that is now being introduced it would not have been possible to give smaller producers the increased support now laid on the line for them.  Far from this exercise indicating any departure in policy it is only right to put on record that the earliest programming of ten years ago would have indicated&mdash;the Second Programme did, at any rate&mdash;that by 1970 we hoped to reach 550 million gallons of milk.  This is 1969 and by quite extraordinary increases in recent years we are approaching, and may reach a total quantity this year of perhaps 540 million gallons.  Far from running away from or upending the policy earlier enunciated regarding milk production we seem to be peculiarly &ldquo;bang on&rdquo; target in 1969 in that we are only about 10 million gallons or less short of the target set <Col N="1624" /> quite a few years ago of 550 million gallons for milk production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can see that milk producers, particularly those who specialised in milk production in the past few years, were encouraged to spend money on improving their farms, fertilising and liming their land, improving their buildings, building milking parlours at great cost to themselves, and surely financial incentives should not have been given if the Minister could see at that stage they were encouraging farmers to produce milk that could not be sold on a glutted market?  Surely the money should have been spent on diversification rather than on increasing milk production when there was no market for it?  Surely the Minister is aware that there are now milk producers who have completely lost confidence in the agricultural advisory service because it was through its advice that this was done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from there being any cause for losing confidence in Government policy regarding milk production the vast majority of our milk producers should, despite the difficulties I have outlined, be reassured of the Government's concern about their wellbeing. This must be particularly true of the vast bulk who constitute the under 7,000-gallon suppliers, over 80 per cent of the total of 112,000 suppliers. Despite the difficulties, we are continuing to maintain their price level. Those who have a greater size of herd have greater efficiency as a result of larger-scale production and a great opportunity of which they are taking advantage, quite rightly, by increasing yield against the pretty low national average yield of 520 gallons per cow which one might deplore.  These more efficient and better-off farmers have been able to get the benefit both ways and have been doing exceedingly well on milk, and good luck to them.  But we must remember that it is not the market sales of their produce that have created this situation but an average of over one shilling per gallon paid on every gallon of milk that is produced by all of them out of the Exchequer, from the taxpayer, as a result of which <Col N="1625" /> probably some money is being denied to their brethren in the agricultural community because of the inability of the Exchequer and the taxpayers to meet these rising commitments and other desirable new schemes that might have been set afoot were it not for the heavy financial pressure on the Exchequer as a result of the difficulties in marketing and the very sizeable continuing increase over the years in milk production.  This should be an assurance to our milk farmers rather than any question of dissuading them from continuing in the business they are at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that what the Minister is now proposing to do is in direct contradiction to what the Government set out to do in 1964 when the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was introduced? Is it not a fact that at that time the Government set 560,000,000 gallons as the target for 1970 for milk production?  What the Minister has done is to play a shabby confidence trick on the farmers.  He is jeopardising the future of this section of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept the interpretation of this decision that it involves a shift in Government policy against large-scale agricultural production?  If so, what effects does he anticipate in relation to our <Col N="1626" /> competitive position as an agricultural nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the last supplementary is concerned, I should like Deputies closely concerned with this matter of milk production to ask themselves whether the profit per gallon of the man producing 40,000 or 60,000 gallons of milk, if he is efficient&mdash;and I am suggesting that he is efficient&mdash;is not, because of his efficiency and his large-scale production, a greater net profit margin per gallon than that of the under 7,000 gallons producer.  I am asking Deputies to just think of this.  He is getting a greater net profit per gallon on his large-scale production, on the assumption that he is efficient&mdash;and I am accepting that he is efficient&mdash;than does the man&mdash; the majority of men; 80 per cent of the milk producers&mdash;for his under 7,000 gallons production.  That being so, and since half the price almost on average that goes to the milk producers comes from the taxpayer and the Exchequer, surely we must have regard to the wellbeing of the under 7,000 gallons producers, the traditional suppliers, the people who represent 80 per cent of the total numbers engaged in milk production.  If we were to put it another way, if we were not to increase the milk price for the smaller producer and allow the price to remain and this continued for any considerable time, as it might well have to, then this would be the end of the small producer.  They represent 80 per cent of 112,000 dairy farmers, numbering 90,000 people, who depend on this and who have been traditionally depending on it.  Why then should this fuss be created that the man who is getting the bigger net percentage out of the large gallonage production should get equal support from the taxpayer as does the smaller man who does not get the same profit per gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The modernisation of premises and equipment by firms already in the meat export industry has been the main factor in the increase of the capacity of the industry in recent years.  In considering the capacity of the industry, however, account must, of course, be taken of seasonal variations in supplies of animals for slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meat industry is on a private enterprise basis and I am not convinced that it would be in the interest of efficiency in the industry itself or in the interests of livestock producers to curtail the enterprise of persons wishing to participate in it or develop it. However, any such persons would have to take into account the very high standards of premises and equipment which my Department require in order to ensure compliance with the increasingly stringent conditions of the international meat trade, and they would accordingly have to be prepared to commit themselves to heavy expenditure to engage in what is a very competitive trade.  The position in regard to the existing capacity of the industry and the high standards of premises, <Col N="1629" /> etc. required is, of course, made clear to any persons who are proposing to establish a new meat factory.</P>

There is only one part of it which was declared by the High Court <Col N="1630" /> to be unconstitutional, which amendment, incidentally, was not given anything like the publicity which was first given to the judgment that declared it to be unconstitutional.  In so far as taking the Deputy's advice and that of his friends over there is concerned, one swallow never made a summer, as we know, and we do not even know if this is a swallow and we will not know until after the Supreme Court has determined the issue.

Therefore, while, legally speaking, they could go ahead and establish a mart without a licence, it could well be that when this matter is played out they would find themselves with a mart for which they had not sought or got a licence and in respect of which a licence might be refused subsequently; that they would then be in a position of having spent money on building a mart and have no licence and therefore no business.</P>

The interests of pig producers here in relation to the changes have been fully safeguarded by the increases in the minimum guaranteed prices for pigs, which came into operation at the beginning of this week.  Also, the reduction in the maximum weights for pig grades should tend to discourage smuggling from the Six Counties.</P>

Imports immediately prior to 7th July, 1969, were somewhat higher than at the same time in 1967 and 1968, but I am not aware that these have seriously affected disposal of the home crop. While the home crop is good this year, prices are well up to average.  Imports under licence will not be resumed until home growers have a reasonable opportunity of clearing their crop.</P>

      <P>The quality of the Irish growers' crop this year has been very <Col N="1633" /> good.  However, while no apples were allowed in after the normal date, 7th July, which has been the closing date for imports for the last six or seven years, it is true to say that in the latter days of that period more foreign apples came in than had come in over the same period in the previous two years.  Undoubtedly the carry-over would have been greater, and this, added to the good quality of this year's Irish apples, would have placed on the market a greater quantity of apples than would have been experienced in the previous two years particularly. There would have been a considerably greater quantity, between home and imported, available in the month of August than there would have been last year; but as far as I can find out from market reports in recent weeks I think the period that might have had the effect of reducing prices for home producers has passed.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement which I made <Col N="1636" /> on this subject in Dáil Éireann on 10th December, 1968, when I said, with reference to talks then proceeding between the two main organisations aimed at defining functions and working relationships between them:</P>
      <P>In the Government's view it is very important that these talks should lead to satisfactory undertakings between the organisations, as this is the real kernel of the problem of how the Government are to carry out effective consultations on policy matters with farmers' representatives.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am not wedded to any particular type of representative machinery for the purpose of discussions with Government and Ministers, provided the major organisations can agree about it.  If the main farmers' organisations wish to form their own council, I am quite prepared to deal with it and give it a reasonable share of my time and that of my officials.  Agriculture is confronted with many problems at the present time, and the sooner organisations get down to the serious business of examining these in consultation with the Government, the better pleased I shall be.  If they can agree on some way of working together and on the machinery which should form the basis for consultations with the Government, there would be no difficulty whatever in establishing close relations with the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>This is still the Government's position. The farm organisations and their members are well aware of it.  Agreement among the main farm organisations on the form of representative machinery is the kernel of the whole problem.  Meanwhile, the organisations are being given the opportunity individually to express their views as and when the necessity arises.  I had full-scale meetings with them in March and April last and I have agreed to meet them again soon to discuss current problems.</P>

      <P>Members of the former National Agricultural Council which was established in 1967 were appointed to the council for a two-year period and this period has now expired.  The last meeting of the council was held on 22nd August, 1968.  I have not so far taken any steps to reconstitute the council.  As the Deputy is, perhaps, aware, I wrote to the leaders of the two principal farm organisations on the 29th July last stressing the importance which the Government attached to the speedy working out of procedures for consultation on agricultural policy matters between farmers' organisations and the Government and invited both leaders to discuss this matter with me, preferably together, but separately if they so preferred.  I indicated that in the event of the working out of agreed consultation procedures being delayed it was my intention to have discussions with the principal farm organisations as and when the occasion required.  The President of the ICMSA accepted my invitation and we discussed the matter of a meeting held on 20th August last.  The President of the NFA, however, declined my invitation even though I repeated the offer to see him on two subsequent occasions.</P>
      <P>As to the form of any future council, I have repeatedly stated that I do not mind what particular type of representative machinery is established for the purpose of discussions with the Government and Ministers provided the major organisations can agree about it. I have already today invited another Deputy's attention to a statement to this effect which I made in Dáil Éireann on 10th December, 1968.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister received representations from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture who are most anxious to discuss many matters relating to agriculture since they are the representatives of the only statutory Agricultural <Col N="1638" /> Council Committee?

      <P>Yes, I have received a communication on behalf of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture in which suggestions were made which would, perhaps, be capable of being discussed further with representatives of the General Council. That I have not set up any such meeting was, perhaps, due to my hope that in the interim there might have been developments on those other fronts about which I have just been answering questions which would have had a bearing on the request from the General Council.  This does not mean that the General Council's request for discussions will be ignored; it will not.</P>

After consideration of the available evidence including detailed submissions by the developers and the planning authority and the report of the inspector, I made an order on the 3rd July last deciding the appeal by confirming the decision of the planning authority and refusing the permission for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The proposed development by reason of its magnitude and prominent location would be out of scale with its surroundings and seriously injurious to <Col N="1641" /> the visual amenities of Dún Laoghaire in general and the harbour area in particular, and its location on the seaward side of Crofton Road would result in the obstruction of views, both seawards and landwards, from many parts of Dún Laoghaire; the development would accordingly be contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.</P>
    <P>2.  The proposed development would generate increased vehicular traffic to an extent which would cause serious traffic congestion and interference with the free flow of traffic on roads in the area.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that 3,418 objections and representations have been received and that oral hearings have been sought in almost 1,700 cases, it is estimated by the planning authority that such an extension of time will be necessary so as to afford sufficient time for full consideration of the cases made.</P>

The committee's investigations are continuing with due regard, of course, to the present review of the structure of local government.  In the meantime action has been taken to give effect to certain recommendations of the committee in the Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Bill, 1969, the text of which was circulated some months ago, and the remaining recommendations are being studied.  In view of the stage reached in the various investigations I would be reluctant to recommend any action now which might result in a duplication of effort or in a delay in the formulation of comprehensive proposals for any necessary changes in the system, but I will certainly give every consideration to the question of how best, at the appropriate time, the experience and the expertise of persons both inside and outside the Dáil, may be availed of in finding solutions to the problems of local finance and taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum loan limits applicable to local authority house-purchase loans were increased substantially in June, 1968.  The value of loan applications which local authorities had on hands at 30th September last was £10.72 million, compared with £8.60 million on the 30th September, 1968, and £6.02 million on the 30th September, 1967.  As the existing limits are clearly not inhibiting demand for loans, I do not propose to increase them at present.  The limits are, however, being kept under review in my Department.  As to house building costs, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated in reply to a question from the Deputy on 17th July last, that there are no plans at present to appoint a prices advisory committee to examine house prices, but that the Minister will continue to have all complaints about house prices investigated fully.  I would also refer the Deputy to Chapters 5 and 6 of the White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> in which the Government's proposals for curbing increases in housing costs are outlined.</P>
      <P>I may add that, in general, I am not convinced that price stability would be encouraged by raising the present maximum loan limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Numbers 55, 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>House purchase and reconstruction loans issued by local authorities in 1968-69 totalled £6,670,000.  This year the Government have made available a total of approximately £9,200,000 for these purposes.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I have had requests in the normal way for increases in the amount of capital allocated for loans in 1969-70 from Clonmel, Drogheda, Dublin and Waterford Corporations, Carlow, Cavan, Dublin, Kildare, Kil-kenny, Limerick, Louth, Meath and Monaghan County Councils, Dundalk and Ennis Urban District Councils.  I have made increases in allocations totalling £850,000 to these authorities. They are also aware of the capital they will have available in 1970-71 for their schemes.  This would normally be used to finance loan applications received from now on.  At 30th September, Dublin County Council had 554 applications on hands for loans totalling £1,447,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am awaiting a report from the Dublin local authorities as to their position, particularly in regard to their current negotiations with building <Col N="1646" /> societies and assurance companies about guarantee schemes covering house-purchase loans advanced by those bodies.  I may add that in so far as building societies who advance considerable sums for house purchase are concerned, the net inflow of new money from the public in the quarter ended 30th September, 1969, totalled £2,260,000 compared with £876,000 in the corresponding period last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The position is that as against a total allocation last year of £6,70,000, this year already the Government have made available a total of approximately £9.2 million.  This does not indicate, as the Deputy has tried to allege, that there is no money available for this purpose.  The facts are completely to the contrary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that as a result of revision of rents and increase in rates very substantial demands have been made by local authorities on tenants in council houses; if in the case of Laois-Offaly he will take steps to provide money to subsidise such increases as cannot be met by the tenants, many of whom are in casual employment, have large families and may have to leave their houses; if he will fully investigate this serious matter and review the entire rent structure so that such rents can be met by the tenants; and if he will take immediate action to see that such increases do not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Increases in fixed rents are, by law, a matter for the local authority.  Any differential rent scheme approved by me provides that no tenant is required to pay a disproportionate share of income in rent, that special allowances will be made for children and that the <Col N="1649" /> local authority may, in cases of hardship, accept a sum for rent and rates less than the minimum required by the scheme.  A person in casual employment whose income falls, would, under such scheme, have his rent reduced.</P>
      <P>I may add that the income of the Laois and Offaly County Councils from rents and annuities on their cottages in 1968/69 amounted to £63,418. The subsidies paid from rates and central taxes for the cottages came to £140,117 in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister was not serious when he expressed the opinion that there is not widespread dissatisfaction following recent increases in rents which in many cases have taken place to the extent of £2 10s Od to £3 a week?  Is he aware this is causing very grave dissatisfaction among tenants many of whom are in casual employment and who, because of family commitments, are not in a position to meet increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware such increases have taken place.  Increases on fixed rents are matters for the local authority.  As far as differential rent schemes are concerned, they are based on the incomes of tenants and no tenant is required to pay an amount disproportionate to his income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister insists that a condition of the payment of house subsidies is that an economic rent must be based on the price of the house?  Is he aware that in the case of a person with an income of £20 per week, the full economic rent in Laois is £4 8s Od per week? Is he further aware that in accordance with the Departmental regulations no allowance is made in respect of children? I accompanied a deputation to the county manager this week and it was made clear that no allowance is made in respect of the number of children&mdash;that the rent was based on income.  Surely this is something the Minister should inquire into immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rent is the economic rent.  The maximum rent is only payable if the income of the tenant is sufficient to justify the payment <Col N="1650" /> of it.  As I said in my reply to the Deputy, any differential rent scheme approved by me provides that allowances will be made for children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is fair that those who are on a rent of one-eighth of their income should when they get an increases of £1 a week because of increased costs otherwise, have to pay 2s 6d extra out of it for rent?  Would the Minister agree that that is a fair way of doing this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>With regard to the housing in the non-municipal towns and villages in County Mayo, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to his Question No. 27 of the 20th November, 1968, and No. 33 of the 26th March, 1969.  No proposals in regard to housing in non-municipal towns have been submitted to me by the county council in the meantime.</P>
      <P>As regards the urban areas in the county, the net need estimated by the urban council for new local authority dwellings in Ballina for the four-year period ending on 31st March, 1971, was 12.  A scheme of 12 houses was completed last year by the National Building Agency Ltd. on behalf of the council.  Plans are now being prepared by the agency for a further scheme of 22 houses for the council, and sites are available for a further 40 dwellings.  In Castlebar, where the estimated need was for 53 dwellings, 24 local authority houses have been completed recently by the agency and the council have now asked them to provide another 24 houses.  The council has a reserve of approximately 43 acres of land available for the provision of further houses and private sites.  In Westport, the council estimated a net need of 45 local authority dwellings. The agency is at present examining tenders for a 24-house local authority scheme; the council is having plans prepared for the development of 50 private sites; and they have already acquired sites for a further 30 dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A provisional capital allocation of £600,000 in respect of local authority housing was notified to Cork Corporation last June to meet commitments existing at that time.  An additional allocation of approximately £1.7m. was made for the financing of the special local authority housing project being carried out by the National Building Agency Ltd. on behalf of the corporation.  A supplemental allocation, for the corporation's own housing programme, of £300,000, making a total of £900,000 for this purpose was notified on 26th September.  I understand that a request for further moneys will be made by the corporation shortly and I will review the position further when this is received.  The amount of capital made available to the corporation in the current year for housepurchase loans and supplementary grants is £658,351.  Their actual expenditure under this heading last year was £173,367.</P>
      <P>The total amount allocated for housing in Cork city to date in the current financial year is, therefore, of the order of £3.3 million as compared with about £1.4 million in 1968/69, and a little over £1 million in 1967/68.</P>

      <P>I am aware that as the Government's programmes for expanding industry, housing and agriculture progress there is a danger that water pollution could rise to an undesirable level from a public health aspect.  For this reason I asked An Foras Forbartha in 1967 to set up a water information division.  This division has been established. Its work will enable the areas where there are risks of water pollution occurring at a significant level to be identified so that appropriate remedial measures may be taken where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am already committed to the provision of loan capital towards financing the building of swimming pools in 11 centres.  Due to the demands on available capital resources for essential requirements such as housing and water and sewerage schemes.  I would not feel justified in taking on any further commitments in respect of pools until reasonable progress has been made with the pools already authorised.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that in recent times his Department have encouraged local authorities and development associations to proceed with plans for swimming pools on the basis that money would now be available?  This having been borne in mind by the people of Birr, they proceeded with plans with the result that they have quite a substantial amount of money on hands from local contributions but now they are told that money is not available from the Department.

At present, I have definite commitments in respect of 11 pools to the extent of £373,000 and tentative commitments for £65,000 making a total of £438,000 in respect of swimming pools.

      <P>In view of the fact that this committee has been formed since 1954 and that they have raised the necessary money to qualify for a grant, does the Minister not consider that the money should be allocated to them as soon as possible?  They were told that if they raised 25 per cent of the cost they would get the money and as I have said, they now have the <Col N="1664" /> necessary amount.  Every year, as the Minister is aware, lives are lost because of the inability of people to swim when they go to the seaside.  Therefore, I consider that this matter should be given priority by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> The nearest swimming place would be the River Shannon, 15 miles away. There is no place available for swimming at all and this presents a problem for parents bringing children to the seaside in the summer.  It is a hazard for children to visit the seaside from an inland town or outlying country area because these children are unable to swim.  Tuam is the nearest town with a swimming pool.  I realise that the Minister has priorities with regard to water and sewerage but I would ask him to give consideration to the provision of swimming pools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The location of Birr is not the deciding factor.  The fact is that £438,000 was committed for this purpose. In circumstances when there is urgent need for the extension of water and sewerage supplies and when there are grave housing needs, I consider that this sum is sufficient allocation for swimming pools at the present time.</P>

    <P>My attention has been drawn to the report in question.  I do not consider that the report contains any evidence that discrimination of the kind referred <Col N="1672" /> to by the Deputy occurred or would have occurred and I do not propose, therefore, to investigate the matter.

I regard such a threat as wrong and I ask the Minister to view this matter with the greatest possible seriousness so that citizens may exercise their rights and liberties without the threat of loss of employment hanging over their heads.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on pay claims on behalf of local authority officers are conducted, under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for local authority officers, by the local authorities and staff representatives.  The Minister for Local Government is not a party to the negotiations but pay increases recommended either in conciliation settlements or arbitration findings are, by law, subject to his sanction.  I referred the findings of the Local Authority Officers' Arbitration Board, on the claims by local authority engineers and county accountants to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the public sector because I wished to have the best possible advice on the implications of these findings for other parts of the public sector before deciding whether or not they should be sanctioned.  One of the conclusions of the review body was that if the findings for the engineers were implemented it might be difficult to avoid an increase of the order of 15-20 per cent in wage and salary costs in the public and private sectors, apart from general national pay rounds.  I accept their recommendation and I informed the staff side that it was proposed to give effect to revised scales of pay from 1st April, 1968.  Since then I have had a number of meetings with the staff representatives and I have been furnished with an interim report on the grade structure of the local authority engineering organisation by the committee set up to consider that subject.  Pending clarification of the position generally, I have deferred writing to the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of a grave anomaly in relation to the payment of disability benefit, in that people who are disabled from work for longer than a year, but have not got 156 contributions paid in respect of insurable employment during their lifetime at work, are required by present regulations to re-enter insurable employment, although certified unfit for work, in order to qualify for further disability benefit; and if he will consider amending the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a normal feature of insurance schemes that certain contribution <Col N="1677" /> conditions must be fulfilled before title to benefit is acquired.  A person insured under the Social Welfare Acts becomes entitled to payment of disability benefit when 26 employment contributions have been paid in respect of him.  When he has been paid benefit for 52 weeks his title ceases until he resumes insurable employment and has 13 contributions paid in respect of him, which entitle him to a further 52 weeks benefit.  A person who has 156 employment contributions paid in respect of him is entitled to disability benefit for an unlimited period.</P>
      <P>Employment contributions under the Social Welfare Acts are, of course, reckonable for other benefits&mdash;unemployment benefit, widows' and orphans' contributory pensions, old age contributory pensions and treatment benefits. I would point out to the Deputy that a lifetime at work is not necessary in order to accumulate 156 contributions. In the case of the vast majority of insured workers this is normally achieved after three years.  I cannot accept that a condition requiring an insured person to have paid a minimum of 156 contributions before becoming entitled to disability benefit for an unlimited period is, as the Deputy implies, unreasonable and I do not, therefore, propose to introduce the legislation which would be necessary to alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it rather unfair that a man should be denied disability benefit after a year out of work and that he should be able to get that disability benefit only by going back into insurable employment at a time when he is, in fact, receiving medical certificates to the effect that he is unable to work?  In other words, to get paid for not being able to work the Minister is asking the man to go back to work.  Surely that is both anomalous and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

The matter is not being treated with due concern.</P>

The position here is that this commission have been given the job to go into every aspect of conditions, pay and so on, of the garda force and the commission, as I said before, have got every facility from me and from my Department to help them in their work and any delay in bringing in the report cannot be attributed to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the practice of the Registrar of the Probate Officer in requiring from an applicant for a grant of probate an affidavit of the mental capacity of a testator at the time of making a will where the testator died in a home for the care of the senile aged, irrespective of the time of the making of the will, even where the will was made a quarter of a century before death or admission to a home for elderly persons; and if, having regard to the fact that this practice is contrary to modern thinking on psychiatric and geriatric problems, he will take action in and make a statement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Succession Act, 1965, provides that to be valid a will shall be made by a person who, <i>inter alia,</i> is of sound disposing mind.</P>
      <P>The rules of the superior courts require that the probate officer or a district probate registrar shall not allow grants of representation to issue until all the inquiries which he may see fit to institute have been answered to his satisfaction.  These rules, which validate a practice of long standing, seem to me to be quite reasonable and I do not propose to have them amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> In the case of persons who die in institutions such as those referred to by the Deputy, the practice of the High Court requires that acceptable proof of testamentary capacity at the time of making the will should be furnished to the probate authorities. This practice is in my view reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously contend that it is necessary for the purpose of granting a probate on foot of a will which was made a quarter of a century before a person enters a home for old people to require on affidavit the evidence of a doctor that at the time of making the will the person was of sound mind, memory and understanding when, as in most cases, the only reason for the presence of that person in the home for elderly people is advanced age?  There appears to be an assumption that because he dies senile at over 80 years of age he was incapable of making a will when he was 40 or 50 years of age.  It is contrary to all psychiatric, medical and geriatric thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates just as I do the wide scope of what we call testamentary capacity.  As the Deputy well knows, each case depends on its own particular circumstances, and, depending on circumstances, one could conceive particular evidence being required in connection with the execution of a will made a long time ago. I accept what the Deputy says about a person who had made a will 25 years ago and the fact of his being in a home for elderly persons should not mean that the will should be looked upon with suspicion.  I would agree with the Deputy.  If he has a particular case and will let me have particulars I will inquire into it.  I do not think that is the practice, broadly speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice why members of the public have to wait for upwards of an hour for service or to inspect folios in the general office of the Land Registry; and how soon the staff will be increased in number and the system so improved that the public will be no longer required to endure such bad service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that members of the public do not have to wait for upwards of an hour for service in the public office of the Land Registry.  Even at the busiest times, the longest a member of the public has to wait for service is normally about 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>Exceptional delay of an hour or so arises only when the document sought for inspection is attached to a pending dealing, application, etc., and takes some time to locate.  Reorganisation of the Land Registry, which is at an advanced stage, will include arrangements to make it considerably easier to locate a folio that is in action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister is acting upon information received which, no doubt again, was presented to him in the belief that it was correct, would the Minister make further inquiries or have more careful observations made?  My observations from personal experience and the observations of many members of the public are to the effect that waits of up to one hour in the Land Registry are the rule rather than the exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are something like 700,000 folios in the Land Registry which are filed in numerical sequence in accordance with the different counties. The average of active folios being dealt with is approximately 15,000.  A new system is being devised.  Naturally, it is difficult, possibly, to locate some of these folios that are in action very quickly: there might be the odd case in which there would be long delay.  I <Col N="1687" /> doubt if even the Deputy has not come across in his own office a file which he could not locate easily.  If he did not, he is unique.</P>

      <P>Can we expect an early decision on the part of the Government in relation to deserted wives and maintenance orders for them?  I am conscious of the Minister's concern vate sectors apart from general national in this matter, but it is a regrettable feature that this social problem seems to be swept under the carpet.  We all know the virtual impossibility of effectively ensuring the taking out of the maintenance order in Britain and the deserted wives have to live on home assistance poverty in Ireland while their husbands depart abroad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see if we get the answer.  Under existing law, local authorities are liable for the payment of malicious damage awards.  There is no provision whereby this liability may be met in whole or in part from State funds.  The interdepartmental committee which, some years ago, considered the question of amending the malicious injuries legislation recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that local authorities should continue to be liable for the cost of meeting claims.  Proposals for legislation, which I have had prepared on the basis of the Committee's report, have recently been approved by the Government and I hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill on the subject in the not too distant future.  This will afford Deputies an opportunity of discussing all aspects of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two supplementary questions to put to the Minister. Does the Minister not realise that it is considered to be the policy of the illegal organisation which is generally conceded to have been responsible for these burnings that its activities in a given area are to be carried out by people who are not living, and hence not known, in that area?  Therefore it is likely that the atrocities referred to were committed by people who are not Meath people at all.  Therefore, it is extremely unjust that the ratepayers of Meath should be asked to pay for acts committed by people who are not natives of Meath.  Further, does the Minister not agree that the original basis of the general liability for malicious injuries resting on county councils was that in earlier times, when travel was much more restricted, it was then very likely that if malicious damage took place it was perpetrated by a person from that county?  Nowadays, however, with improved transport, it is no longer likely, if malicious damage occurs in a given county, that the perpetrator is a native of that county. Therefore, it is unfair to impose this liability on the particular county in which the damage takes place in view of the fact that it is not likely to have been committed by a native of that <Col N="1690" /> county.  Would the Minister, therefore, not consider making this a national charge on the grounds of ensuring justice between counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the suggestion in the Deputy's first supplementary question.  I have not proof that no local people of that county were not concerned in this outrage. As far as the second supplementary question is concerned, as I said in reply to the question, the House will have an opportunity of discussing this matter shortly when the Bill comes before it.  I am aware that there are two views on the question of whether local authorities should or should not be liable for malicious damage.  That argument has gone on for a long time. Taking the average for the county, it is only about one penny in the £: this is, taking one year with another over a period.  I have said that this committee unanimously recommended that it should still be a charge on local authorities.  However, the Deputy and the House will have an opportunity of expressing their views.  There are arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> but this is not a suitable time to go into them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There will always be allegations and lies by those who wish to carry on that kind of propaganda for their own purposes.  This country is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights.  It has also accepted the special provision in that convention whereby any private individual who feels deprived of rights recognised by that convention may, after exhausting the remedies provided by municipal law or by domestic law, appeal to the European Commission on Human Rights.  In the face of this commitment&mdash;enforceable by an international tribunal&mdash;any suggestion that civil rights are being withheld from any section of the community here is completely misconceived. There is a long litany of the difference.  For instance, under the law as it exists in Northern Ireland, firstly, the Minister for Home Affairs may prohibit the holding of inquests on dead bodies in any area of Northern Ireland or prohibit any particular inquest. Secondly, the civil authority is defined as the Minister for Home Affairs, who may delegate his powers even to his Parliamentary Secretary or any officer of the RUC.  They are empowered to do all or any of the following things: impose curfews in any area between any hours: require licensed premises in any area to be closed; prohibit the keeping of motor cars by any <Col N="1692" /> person without a permit; prohibit any public meeting without any right of appeal to the courts; enter or be in access, without warning, to any land, buildings or other property whatsoever; close roads; take possession of any lands, buildings or other property or do any other act of interference with private property; order any person to furnish any information whatsoever; arrest persons without warrant and detain them indefinitely without trial without any prior proclamation by the Government and without any provision for an inquiry into detention by a commission as is provided in the Offences Against the State Act.  In addition, a person who does any act of such a nature as to be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of peace or maintenance of order in Northern Ireland and not specifically provided for is deemed to be guilty of an offence.  Finally, the Minister for Home Affairs there may add or vary new criminal offences without the positive approval of Parliament.  In view of that litany let those who want to denigrate the position here compare it with the position there.  There is no question of rights being denied here.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware that the provisions as outlined in the Special Powers Act do not happily reside in the Minister's hands here nor indeed does it seem to be his wish that they should.  I am aware that the Minister and I would equally reject any direct analogy between the Special Powers Act and the Offences Against the State Act here.  However, we are conscious that the Offences Against the State Act was brought in at a time of unprecedented national emergency in this country when the future preservation of the structure of the State was certainly called into question, but that particular atmosphere and climate no longer exist and within our Offences Against the State Act there are provisions which, if implemented and put into full effect, could certainly circumscribe our interpretation of civil liberties. Although redress may be had to international tribunals subsequently, nevertheless these provisions remain and perhaps they would be worthy of review by the Minister at this point in <Col N="1693" /> time without adopting a rather obdurate manner in relation to the current legislation.  We put this to the Minister in all humility because we do not wish to be classified by Northern Ireland spokesmen in a light which we do not particularly want, a view which would be shared by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, first, to bring in these powers that were acquired under the Offences Against the State Act there would have to be a formal proclamation as prescribed by law here.  Secondly, because of our subscription to the Convention on Human Rights we would have to show, before utilising any of these powers, that the ordinary courts of our land failed to deal with the situation. So there is this international safeguard there.  In those circumstances I see no reason to take this off the Statute Book to pander to the whims of those who evidently are not concerned with truth but concerned with misrepresentation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The film trade have always taken the view, which their association has again confirmed recently, that it would be a breach of confidence for the film censor or the <Col N="1694" /> appeal board to disclose to the public whether or not a particular film that has not been shown publicly has been submitted for censorship or to disclose information about any cuts made in a film that has been shown publicly. The owners of the film are, of course, free to release such information if they wish to do so.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy's question relates to the showing of this particular film at the Cork Film Festival, the position is that the showing of films at that festival is not regarded as coming within the ambit of the Censorship of Films Acts as the audience is made up of members of a club formed in connection with the festival and the shows are not open to the general public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <P>I think the House will appreciate that, if I have discussions on behalf of the country and not as a private individual with the Secretary General or with the Foreign Ministers of other countries and if I come out and tell everybody what they said, the possibility of further discussions or further useful progress would be totally excluded.  While I had, I think, four or five meetings with the Secretary General, all of them were calculated to be of benefit to the situation in the North of Ireland.  I think my behaviour should be such as not to prevent his being able to help if his continued interest finds some response with the British Government.  I do not mean to be obscure but I think that this type of work cannot be done from the house tops.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 169, 170, 171, 172 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>In my Budget speech last May I indicated that the balance of payments deficit for 1969 was likely to be of the order of £55 million.  This figure is inflated by imports of aircraft valued at £12 million and financed by foreign borrowing.  The trade figures for the first nine months of the year and such data as is available on the likely trend of net invisible earnings suggest that the outturn of the balance of payments for the year as a whole will not diverge significantly from my Budget forecast.</P>
      <P>The trade returns for recent months point to a slowing-down in the rate of increase in the import excess and there are expectations that this trend will continue in the coming months. The large upsurge in imports of capital goods and materials for further production which occurred earlier in the year appears to be levelling off while, on the other hand, exports may be expected to enjoy their normal seasonal upswing in the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the import excess would have been about £8½ million lower in the first half of 1969 if 1968 import and export prices had prevailed <Col N="1707" /> but contrary to what is implied in Deputy Cosgrave's question the terms of trade have shown a steady improvement in recent months.  The rate of increase in import prices has been slowing down while export prices show a stronger rising trend.  In June, the latest month for which figures are available, the terms of trade were more favourable than in any of the preceding 12 months apart from last November.</P>
    <P>While prospects of a continued improvement in the trade returns and in the terms of trade are encouraging the balance of payments position still calls for the utmost watchfulness.  The fact must be faced that deficits of the size expected this year are not sustainable for long without seriously depleting our external reserves.  If the balance of payments deficit is to be held to a reasonable level and at the same time sufficient resources are to be made available for the increased investment necessary for growth then consumer spending must be held in check.</P>
    <P>The future course of incomes is of crucial importance in determining the level of consumer spending with consequent repercussions on the rate of increase of prices and the size of the balance of payments deficit.  The public must realise that a continued scramble for higher nominal incomes in excess of real production is selfdefeating. It raises costs and prices, undermines our standard of living, diminishes our external competitiveness and so reduces the exports on which additional growth so heavily depends.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that I am keeping the situation under constant review and will take the corrective measures necessary to counter any forces which threaten to interrupt the forward momentum of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the trend in recent months in respect of the higher volume of imports has been reduced because of the severe credit squeeze which is operating and that in fact the action that has been taken has been to impose a credit squeeze on importers and traders who are asked to take the remedial action <Col N="1708" /> while the Government have taken and are taking no action to deal with the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply on behalf of the Minister, would he indicate what steps are contemplated to ensure that consumer spending will, in fact, be held in check?  Would he also indicate what steps are contemplated to ensure that the import excess will not grow to a more formidable figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there has been a reduction in credit available to importers and a reduction in credit available for consumer spending. I think there is another question dealing with that very shortly.  This itself is apparently having the desired results in the recent figures, where the rate of increase in the adverse trade balance has been reduced and, as against that, there is not an excessive strain on our external resources. In fact, our external reserves will be down this year, we think, by something less than £12 million as a result of increased investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 179 and 180 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that the credit situation or the increase in the banks' lending rates has resulted in an overall reduction in production or employment. Expenditure on schemes of national <Col N="1712" /> development financed through the public capital programme will be £25 million more in 1969-70 than in 1968-69. The banks' contribution to the financing of these schemes will be £50 million in the current year compared with £47 million last year and £25 million the previous year.  Issues from the Road Fund, which are outside the public capital programme, are estimated at £11.5 million for 1969-70 as against £11.2 million in 1968-69.  The Central Bank has asked for moderation in the provision of credit for consumption expenditure.  This is essential in view of the pressures on the resources of the banks, stemming mainly from excessive consumer demand in relation to the growth of national output and savings.  Thus businesses importing or selling consumer goods and also private persons may be unable to get all the credit they would like.  I regret any difficulties that may be caused but the fact is that the pressures I have mentioned&mdash;which have been stimulated by the rapid rise in money incomes&mdash; would, if allowed to continue unchecked, do far more damage in a relatively short time to employment and employment prospects than can be attributed to a moderation in credit for consumer expenditure.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of credit policy, in conjunction with budgetary and incomes policies, is to secure the largest and most rapid increase in production and employment compatible with the avoidance of excessive price increases and a tolerable external payments situation.  I think that Deputies will accept that this is a sound policy.  It is, however, inherent in it that, where the demand for credit is larger than the available resources, a choice must be made as to the way in which the resources are allocated.  It is necessary that priority be given to productive projects, so that production can continue to grow.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to credit generally and the effects of the policy which is being followed are kept under continuous review and suitable adjustments will be made as required by the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As for the first part of the question, I would invite the Deputy's attention to section 9 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, which provides that, in the case of a person resident here, a pension derived from previous employment in a foreign country or payable under its social welfare legislation is to be exempt from Irish tax if it would have been exempt from tax in the foreign country had the person continued to reside in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In August, 1967, the taxpayer in question proved title to a relief and claimed repayment of tax in respect of the preceding year of assessment 1966-67.  The inspector proposed giving effect to the repayment by having it set off against the taxpayer's liability for the then current year 196768. As, however, the year in respect of which the relief was due had already expired, the taxpayer was entitled to repayment in one sum and the repayment was made accordingly.</P>
      <P>In May, 1969, the taxpayer made a corresponding claim for repayment of tax in respect of the year 1968-69.  The relief claimed had, however, already been given by way of reduction in the assessment for that year and the question of a refund did not arise since there had been no overpayment of tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the exemption of widows' pensions payable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The recipient of a social welfare widow's pension would not become liable to income tax unless her pension was a contributory one and her total income from all sources, including the contributory pension, exceeded the existing effective exemption limit of £365 for a widow.  The question of the general level of the income tax personal allowance and reliefs is a <Col N="1716" /> matter which will have my attention at the appropriate time; but the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be feasible to discriminate against a widow, who had a pension from her late husband's employer, in favour of a widow who had the same amount of income, but derived from two pensions of which one was contributory.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if retired post office officials receive increases in their pensions whenever the salaries of serving members are increased; and, if so, if there are any arrangements whereby retired teachers, Gardaí and civil servants can benefit when increases <Col N="1719" /> are given to serving members, in view of the sharp rise in the cost of living in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension increases for all branches of the public service, including teachers, Gardaí and civil servants, are applied on a uniform basis to all groups.</P>
      <P>In the last Budget I accepted the principle of parity, that is, increasing existing pensions to the level of those of officers currently retiring, and I intend to move towards it over a number of years.  As a start, the pensions of those who retired before the general pay increase of 1st February, 1964, have, with effect from 1st August, 1969, been brought up to the level of the pensions of equivalent colleagues who retired with the benefit of that increase.</P>

      <P>It was indicated in the Budget statement that it would take some time to set up the administrative machinery to implement the scheme of <i>ex gratia</i> pensions for widows of certain pensionable public servants.</P>
      <P>A very large number of applications has been received and these are at present being processed.  In cases where death occurred many years ago considerable research is needed to ascertain full details of the husband's service, rank and pay.  Also, where retirement or death took place before 1st February, 1964, the salary the husband would have had if his service had ended on that date has to be determined so as to give the widow concerned the benefit of the pensions increases announced in the Budget.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is not possible to say when the first payments under the scheme will be made but if the Deputy repeats the question in a few weeks it is hoped to be able to furnish the information required.</P>

      <P>The Moy drainage scheme is being carried out primarily for the benefit of the farmers concerned and it has brought great improvement to the lands affected.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following representations made to me by the Irish Livestock Exporters and Traders Association I recently had a very full discussion with representatives of the association about cattle shipping facilities generally and, in particular, the role of the B &amp; I Company in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> As regards the role of the B &amp; I Company, I must emphasise that the company is providing a regular livestock service between Dublin and Birkenhead. They are prepared to guarantee a weekly capacity of 6,000 head of cattle which is well in excess of current demand.  In recent years the company have sustained heavy financial losses on their livestock carrying and a further heavy loss in this sector is predicted for this year.  The rates being charged by the company are not sufficient, even with a greater utilisation of the service, to obviate substantial losses.  The company are under a mandate to operate on a strictly commercial basis and have no funds which would enable them to continue to subsidise the livestock sector of their business. They are in direct competition with British Rail with whom they have been conducting discussions for some time past with a view to devising some scheme of rationalisation of the crosschannel cattle transport business. These discussions are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The long-term solution of the cattle shipment problem requires the provision of necessary shipping capacity on a regular basis which will be sufficiently remunerative to the shipping interests to enable them to guarantee the provision of the necessary ships and the onward transport capacity in Britain. The issues involved are receiving the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in consultation with the various organisations representing the cattle trade, the port authorities and, of course, the shipping companies concerned.  I am in close contact with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on these long-term aspects of the matter.  For my own part, I am strongly of the opinion that any long-term solution of the problem must necessarily be based on co-operation between the shipping companies concerned and the livestock trade.</P>

      <P>I propose to introduce legislation removing the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs from the scope of the Road Transport Acts, so as to allow their carriage for reward without a merchandise licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also propose within the existing number of licensed vehicles to permit all &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; licenses to operate vehicles without restriction in regard to area, weight or commodity. In effect, this means that every such <Col N="1727" /> carrier will be in a position to carry general merchandise throughout the 26 Counties without any weight or commodity limitation subject to compliance with road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>These relaxations will not apply to the limited licences issued to deal with specialised traffics such as newspapers which cannot be used for ordinary haulage business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this question.  On the agricultural side, in which cattle, sheep and pigs are concerned, there will be total liberalisation, no restriction.  That means, if we pass this legislation, that anybody can convey cattle, sheep and pigs where they wish within the jurisdiction. On the other side, in regard to existing licensees who hold licences, what is proposed is that each will have a 26-County licence without any restriction in regard to weight, commodity or area, so that as far as they are concerned, in effect what will happen is that every existing holder of a haulage licence will have a haulage licence without restriction or inhibition of any kind.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to the railways was outlined by my predecessor during the course of his speech on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill 1964, Parliamentary Debates Vol. 209, cols. 1735 to 1763, in which he stated that the Government had decided, after very full and careful consideration, to preserve the <Col N="1729" /> railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable. This continues to be the Government's policy in relation to the railways.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance for capital expenditure on the railways is provided by way of Exchequer capital advances to CIE under section 4 of the Transport Act, 1964 and I hope to introduce legislation shortly to extend the limit of £6 million on capital advances to the board imposed by that section.  Deputies will then have the opportunity of debating the Government's policy in relation to the railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Deputies are referring to demolition work on part of Pier No. 2 and the end of the link building. Pier No. 2 was completed in 1962 and the link building in 1967.  They formed part of a long-term development plan for Dublin Airport which also provided for a new terminal building.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement in 1966 about Boeing 747 aircraft capable of carrying up to 500 passengers and the placing early in 1967 by Aer Lingus of an order for two of these aircraft, it became necessary to undertake a complete re-appraisal of the long-term development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It emerged after detailed examination of the problems involved with the assistance of expert consultants that a much larger terminal than that originally envisaged was necessary. This building had to be centred on Pier No. 2 to avoid congestion on the apron and land sides of the building. Plans for incorporating existing buildings were considered and it was found <Col N="1731" /> that the only other practicable scheme would merely result in the postponement of the demolition work now being carried out and would result ultimately in additional cost of about £270,000.</P>
    <P>The portions of the buildings now being demolished, that is less than half of Pier No. 2 and a small portion of the link building, cost approximately £100,000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the rapid pace of technological development in aviation often involves premature obsolesence of aircraft, equipment and buildings.  The Boeing 747 is an extreme example of this and is creating problems for airports throughout the world.  It has recently been announced for instance that the new terminal building at Schipol completed only two years ago must be modified to handle this aircraft.</P>
    <P>The contract for the new terminal building is being managed by Aer Rianta but the approval of my Department was obtained for all stages of the project.</P>

      <P>The ESB are required by statute so to fix their charges that, taking one year with another, revenue balances outgoings. The board's most recent annual report, published in July, 1969, warned that their charges for electricity were insufficient and that they were making application for an increase.  Increases to take effect from 1st January, 1970, have now been approved by the Government and details will be announced very shortly by the board.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to anticipate the Bill which I hope to introduce this session providing for the establishment of a Nuclear Energy Board.  I may say, however, that the functions of the board will, initially at least, be mainly advisory.  I could not at this stage put a figure on the cost, but it is not likely to be very great since, as I have said, the board will for some time act largely as an advisory body, though at a later stage it may be required to carry out executive functions.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that it is essential that there should be expert advice available to the Government regarding the use of fissile and radioactive substances generally.</P>
      <P>No particular international contribution by the board is foreseen at the moment.  It is the intention that through this country's membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency, the board will have the opportunity of keeping abreast of developments in the nuclear field.</P>

      <P>Separate statistics of tourist traffic through Shannon Airport are not available as the traffic is not broken down by categories of passengers. Total terminal traffic for the first nine months of 1969 amounted to 434,733 passengers as compared with 348,006 for the corresponding period of 1968 or an increase of 25 per cent. It would be reasonable to assume that purely tourist traffic through the airport increased by a similar proportion.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>I had a general discussion in July with the chairman and director-general of Bord Fáilte Éireann about the tourist industry.  Among the matters discussed were the returns of tourist traffic in June, 1969.  Following that meeting a news release was issued in which I explained that experience throughout the country was not uniform and that in fact traffic returns up to June, 1969, showed an increase in inward sea and air traffic as compared with 1968.</P>
      <P>Figures so far available indicate that the number of visitors by sea and air has continued above the 1968 level. It is however too early to make an overall assessment of the 1969 season and it may be that returns in respect of the latter part of the year will be adversely affected by the disturbances in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Col N="1739" /> The main objective of tourist policy under the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development is to achieve a growth rate of six per cent per annum at constant values.  Within that general objective, the aim is to bring about an extension of the season so as to achieve maximum utilisation of all tourism investment and to provide increased employment in the tourist industry.</P>

The centres in areas where there is not a great concentration of Irish emigrants are very short of money.

The Minister has personal experience from <Col N="1744" /> the West of Ireland of thousands of our people emigrating.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The complete opposition of the Government to the racial policies of the Government of South Africa has been publicly declared on numerous occasions, and the Irish delegation at the United Nations has constantly supported condemnations by the General Assembly of South Africa's policy of apartheid and will continue to do so.  The Security Council has not, however, decided on any economic sanctions on South Africa and, in the circumstances, it is not the Government's policy to interfere with the activities of individual Irish firms wishing to trade with South Africa or with the efforts of Córas Tráchtála to assist such firms.  The embargo imposed by the Government in accordance with the Security Council resolutions in 1963 and 1964 on the sale and shipment of arms or military supplies to South Africa is, of course, still in force.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree there is a distinction to be made here?  Would he not agree it is one thing to allow trade and another thing actually to go out of one's way to promote it?  Would he not agree that <Col N="1750" /> this is what Córas Tráchtála is doing at the moment?  Would he not agree this is particularly unwise in view of the fact that South Africa vigorously discriminates against people on ethnic grounds and also in view of the fact that this Government is leading a campaign against discrimination of a similar kind in Northern Ireland?  By encouraging trade with a discriminatory regime the Minister is weakening our case against discrimination of a similar kind in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree at all.  As I have already explained, the Government's attitude, as exemplified at the United Nations at the moment and as it will continue to be exemplified in the future, is one of complete opposition to and condemnation of the policy of apartheid in South Africa. It has also been the Government's policy, however, in the United Nations to endeavour to make it as clear as possible that, if people are serious about this and want to do something about it, there is a provision in the Charter of the United Nations which can enable that something to be done.  I refer to the provision under which the Security Council can order either total or partial economic sanctions. These are mandatory.  The Irish Government has indicated that it wants this done and, if it is done, we will certainly support it.  But we also believe that the passing of empty resolutions, which everyone knows will not be effective, is tending to undermine the position and the authority of the United Nations and doing nothing whatever to advance the cause of those who are against apartheid.  Indeed, this attitude may be strengthening the existing dominance of the apartheid policy in South Africa.  In this context it does not seem to me in any way realistic for us to adopt a policy which would result in our exporters and their workers losing out in order to give the business available to such countries as the United States of America, Britain, Russia and many other smaller nations.  What is involved is not a question of principle.  We know that, if we stand back, these other countries will take the business and nothing whatever will be gained for <Col N="1751" /> the benefit of the anti-apartheid policy. Our attitude is that, if the United Nations is prepared to take effective action, we will back it to the hilt. We have indicated that quite clearly. In the absence of effective action the situation is one of people merely going through what might be described as a very hypocritical process of pretending to be against this policy in order, perhaps, to induce more conscience-stricken people to stand back and let them take the business.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is not necessary for the Security Council to take a decision for us to take the step, at least, of not promoting trade with South Africa? Surely we do not have to wait for the Security Council if we want to stop actually promoting trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a continuing decline in population along the whole western seaboard; and if he is prepared to take the necessary steps to establish industries in this region by direct Government intervention in view of the failure of private initiatives to have such industries provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the population in the counties on the western seaboard continues to decline, it should be noted that the reduction in the five years to 1966 was almost 16,000 less than in the preceding five year period.  The Goverment have provided valuable incentives to industrialists to establish their projects in these areas.  A recent analysis of some 40 projects for the establishment of industry showed a gratifying bias of capital investment in favour of the designated areas of the west.  I am confident that this trend will continue and that private enterprise will play its proper role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from two projects (one an expansion of an existing industry) which commenced production this year, I am aware of two proposals for the establishment of major industries and one proposal to expand an existing industry in County Mayo. Seventeen projects have been approved for grants under the small industries programme and a further twenty-five applications are being examined by the IDA.  Since industrial proposals must be treated as confidential, I am unable to supply further particulars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Conlon</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will consider extending the facilities for grants payable in respect of under-developed areas to that portion of County Louth which at present comprises portion of Monaghan constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Undeveloped areas were designated after consideration of the economic needs and merits of the areas concerned and have no necessary relationship with the limits of particular constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a particular need in that portion of Louth for the same facilities as are available in Monaghan county? <Col N="1755" /> It may be argued that in Ardee town there is no unemployed but many of the people in Ardee town and the surrounding areas have to travel very long distances to seek employment or to work in the GEC factory at Dundalk or to employment in Drogheda.  There is a special need to provide an incentive for an industry to be based in Ardee or in that portion of County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of the establishment of a further industry in Ardee or that portion of County Louth is not, of course, precluded under the present arrangements.  I would, I think, find it difficult to be convinced that it was necessary to designate that area in order to attract further industry to it.  The Deputy will be aware that certainly as far as the Dundalk area is concerned people are coming from Monaghan and other areas&mdash;indeed, I think about 300 come from the Newry area&mdash;to work in Dundalk.  So that the area to which he is referring, while I do not say it cannot be improved, is a lot better off than some other areas about which we have been hearing at Question Time today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out the special geographical position of Ardee town which is situated, as the Minister knows, a very short distance from the County Monaghan border. There are special circumstances prevailing in County Monaghan for industrialists who want to establish factories there.  In other words, they have only to move down the road to establish a factory in south Monaghan, thus depriving Ardee town of an industry.  I am not making the case to take industry from Monaghan but what I am suggesting is that there is a special case for the extension of such facilities as operate in County Monaghan to a town which is so close to the Monaghan border.</P>

      <P>I arrived back from my export promotion visit to the Middle East only three days ago, whilst the trade mission to that area has not yet returned.  It is too soon, therefore, to estimate the effect of the visit on Irish exports to that area.</P>
      <P>I have good hopes of a further substantial rise in exports generally this year.  Exports in the period January to September, 1969, were valued at £269.4 million which was £26.5 million higher than the figure for the corresponding period in 1968.  I am glad to say that some of this increase was achieved in countries with which we have a serious imbalance of trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that in order to reach full employment in this country in the 1980's about 7,000 new jobs will be required each year, he can say what progress has been made towards that target; and what proposals he has to provide the number of new positions each year.</P>

      <P>The NIEC Report on Full Employment estimated that to achieve full employment by 1980, an average of some 11,000 new jobs per <Col N="1757" /> year would have to be found within the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>Progress made in the six months ended 30th June, 1969, was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) 41 projects commenced production with an estimated employment potential of 1,935 at the end of the first year and 4,138 at full production;</P>
      <P>(b) 53 projects were under construction with an estimated employment potential of 2,944 at the end of the first year and 6,051 at full production;</P>
      <P>(c) In the same period there were 78 projects for which grants were approved but in which construction had not commenced.  These projects have an employment potential of 4,589 at the end of the first year and 7,667 at full production;</P>
      <P>(d) The total number of projects in this period, that is, the first six months of this year, therefore, was 172 with an employment potential of 9,468 at the end of the first year and 17,856 at full production.</P>
      <P>In the same six months period 119 small industry projects, with an additional employment potential of 700 persons, were approved for grants under the Small Industries Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The change-over to the metric system is not due to take place in 1975 or indeed at any fixed time. It will be a gradual process, which it is hoped will have been generally completed <Col N="1758" /> by 1975.  Substantial progress towards metrication has been made by a number of industries with which my Department has been in contact.  When the stage approaches at which the distributive sector and the public generally will be involved, I feel that the assistance of a steering committee would be useful and I will consider how one should be established.  Meanwhile inquiries should continue to be addressed to my Department.</P>

      <P>I raised no objection to the recent increases in the prices of tobacco and cigarettes which were necessary to compensate in part the manufacturers concerned for increases in the costs of raw materials, wages and overheads.</P>
      <P>My agreement to the increases in prices was first sought in July last. I did not consider it necessary to set up an advisory body under the Prices Acts to examine the need for the price increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is unsafe electrical equipment.  I am not aware that such equipment is being distributed but I would suggest that the Deputy should bring any examples of such equipment which have come to his notice to the attention of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to have them tested, and if found to be unsafe, to have reports on the tests published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of unsafe domestic electrical appliances has already, at my request, been under examination by the institute with the object of formulating a standard specification which would lay down minimum standards of safety for these <Col N="1766" /> goods.  It is my intention to prohibit by statutory order in due course the sale of electrical goods which do not comply with these requirements.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that this is a wide field and that it will take some time to complete the examination.</P>
    <P>As a preliminary step towards safety in the use of electrical appliances, I propose to prescribe, from the 1st December next, certain safety requirements in regard to three-core electrical cable fitted to domestic appliances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will take steps if necessary by the introduction of legislation so that the Land Commission <Col N="1770" /> will purchase all lands on a cash basis in future and not by land bonds which are considered unsatisfactory from the point of view of the vendor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  The Deputy will be aware that the Land Act, 1965, removed the restrictive application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and purchases for cash in the open market can now be made for all the purposes of the Land Acts.  In the current financial year a record amount of £600,000 cash has been provided for these purchases, representing an increase of £170,000 over the amount provided last year.  It is the Government's desire to provide a constantly increasing supply of money so that the policy of spending up the work of land reform can be implemented as announced in the Third Programme.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Land Bond Bill, 1969, I pointed out that the payment of owners in cash for all lands acquired and purchased by the Land Commission would involve the extraction from the capital budget, at the expense of some other sector, of a minimum of £2 million a year.  I also undertook to ensure that the disabilities under which land bonds labour at present are eliminated as far as practicable with the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that, from the point of view of many landowners, the land bonds system is most unsatisfactory.  Does the Minister not consider that it is most desirable that these complaints should be eliminated?  Would the Minister not consider that we would have a pool of land for the relief of congestion if it was all on a cash purchase basis.  The Minister and his Department might consider raising a long-term loan for this purpose.  There is no necessity to enforce tax for this purpose in one year: it can be done over a long number of years.  It would be more satisfactory from the point of view of the Land Commission's getting more land and getting more willing vendors if there were cash transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I dealt fairly comprehensively <Col N="1771" /> with this whole question of the land bonds system and that I accepted its disabilities.  Since that time, I had interviews with representatives of the Incorporated Law Society and other interests concerned to see what practical steps we can take to improve the situation where land bonds are concerned. At the same time, as I pointed out in my reply, to deal in cash exclusively&mdash;which we should all like to be able to do&mdash;would involve extracting an additional £2 million from the capital budget.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that I might have some difficulty in obtaining that additional money in cash, having regard to the capital budget difficulties which the Minister for Finance has at the present time.  In the meantime, we have very substantially increased the amount of land being acquired for cash&mdash;£600,000 now as against £430,000 last year.  I can assure the House that I shall do my best to have the cash ratio <i>vis-à-vis</i> bonds progressively increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As it cannot be in cash, would the Minister consider an earlier proposition made from this side of the House to change the operative date to the date the land is handed over&mdash;not the date the Land Commission more or less take over the land. Suppose, at present, the Land Commission purchase a farm on 8th December: it may be the following July before they are in a position to pay for it.  However, the land bonds are given out and assessed on 8th December. That is the present position.  Last year, I gave the Minister particulars of a case where a man got them and they were supposed to be valued on 8th December for £10,000.  However, when the land was finally signed over, his land bonds were worth only £8,000. The Minister said he would try to change the operative date to the date that final agreement is signed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The available records&mdash;which are in existence since 1st August 1961&mdash;are not kept in the precise form mentioned by the Deputy: indeed, having regard to the varying degrees of land quality to be found&mdash; not merely as between one county and another but even between one locality and another&mdash;it would be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to compile, with any prospect of accuracy, statistics based solely on the definition &ldquo;good quality agricultural land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the statistical arrangements regarding the purchase of land&mdash;irrespective of its quality&mdash;by non-nationals are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars of transactions which, during the period from 1st August, 1961 to 9th March, 1965, either attracted or were exempted from the 25 per cent rate of stamp duty have been recorded by the Land Commission in accordance with the procedure authorised by the provisions of the Finance Act, 1961; since 9th March, 1965, however, the vesting of interests in non-urban land in non-nationals&mdash; either as individuals or through the medium of companies&mdash;is under the direct control of the Land Commission pursuant to section 45, Land Act, 1965, and records relating to applications for Land Commission consent under the section are kept by them. Relevant statistics for the periods (a) from 1st August, 1961 to 9th March, 1965 and (b) from 9th March, 1965 to 30th September, 1969 are contained in a tabular statement which I propose, <Col N="1773" /> with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The restrictions imposed by section 45 Land Act, 1965, are stringently enforced by the Land Commission. While each application is considered on its merits, the position, generally speaking, is that Land Commission consent to the sale of farm land to persons&mdash;principally non-nationals&mdash;<Col N="1774" /> who are not qualified persons as defined in the section is unlikely to be forthcoming save in very exceptional circumstances.  In general permission is not granted to such persons to purchase land in order to engage in those forms or lines of production commonly practised by our own farmers.  I do not, therefore, accept the implication in the final part of the question.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>A.  Particulars of relevant transactions recorded in the Register kept by the Land Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act, 1961.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister really think it is desirable that there should be no accurate record of the amount of agricultural land held by non-nationals in this country?  Does he not consider it would be very easy to get an accurate record by addressing a circular to each Garda station and requesting the guards to supply that information to the Land Commission? The guards are very thorough and most exact about the discharge of their duty.  I feel it would be a very easy means of compiling a most accurate picture of the amount of land held by non-nationals.  Recently, I was astonished to hear from the Land Commission that no such records are kept. Is it not a fact that whatever the Minister may say, whatever I may say or whatever anyone off the street may say, there are no definite and accurate records to vouch or to prove the amount of land held by non-nationals in this country.

      <P>103 acres, in a size range varying from eight to 19 acres, for seven smallholders (adjoining or very close to the estate);</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will introduce a new retirement scheme for farmers as the present scheme is not attractive or availed of by landowners; and if a new attractive scheme will be introduced at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  I would point out that, in all, 33 landowners have to date intimated their willingness to participate in the life annuity scheme authorised by section 6, Land Act, 1965.  In fact, life annuities have been set up and are already being paid in 22 of these cases; in the remaining cases the necessary legal formalities are at present in train. The position to date, therefore&mdash;while not as satisfactory as I would wish&mdash; is by no means discouraging.  The possibility of finding ways and means to enhance the attractiveness of this voluntary scheme is being kept constantly in mind.  For the moment I am hopeful that as the scheme becomes more widely known&mdash;especially through the stimulus afforded by those who have already successfully participated&mdash;the appeal of its benefits will spread to an increasing number of eligible landowners.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this scheme is one of the most important schemes operated by the Department of Lands for many years and in view of the small number of people who have availed of it would the Minister take steps to ensure that more people will avail of it?  Could the Minister say whether agricultural instructors and people in the various advisory services are making this scheme known to farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's suggestions.  I would be less than candid if I did not admit that the extent to which the scheme has been availed of to date has been disappointing. <Col N="1780" /> The Deputy may have a very good suggestion in regard to officials other than Land Commission officials being asked to bring the scheme to the notice of suitable people, elderly or otherwise, who wish to get out of farming.  The only thing I would add is that obviously if the response to the scheme, which of course is voluntary, does not pick up in the next year or two we will have to re-think the matter altogether.</P>

      <P>The decision to close Montpelier national school was taken solely in the educational interests of the pupils and after the fullest consideration of all the relevant facts.</P>
      <P>I have examined every aspect of the case and I am fully satisfied that the decision was the correct one.  I do not therefore propose to have the school re-opened.  The inspector's report does not disclose that any argument of an educational nature was advanced in favour of the re-opening of the Montpelier school.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the decision to close this school, originally taken by his predecessor and subsequently endorsed by him, was based on incorrect information supplied by two inspectors who visited this school last May?  Is he aware that the information supplied by <Col N="1784" /> these inspectors was wrong in a number of respects and particularly in that they assessed the potential school-going population of the area incorrectly? Secondly, they grossly misunderstood and misrepresented to the Minister the parents' views in the matter.  In view of the fact that the chief inspector of the Department was in Montpelier last week and understood the position fully as it was explained to him by the parents, how can the Minister now, in the light of the report that Mr. Gearóid O'Sullivan, must have submitted to him in relation to the parents' views, refuse to re-open this school? Does it mean in effect that the policy of the Minister and his Department in relation to amalgamation means that the Department are determined to ignore the wishes of the parents?  In other words, have the parents any rights?  Surely the Minister cannot uphold this decision which was originally based on false information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In this very important matter it is a pity that so much has been said and done to cloud the issue.  In every statement I made in regard to this matter, in every letter I wrote regarding it and in my meeting with the deputation of public representatives, I clearly underlined the fact that the education of the children was the primary factor in my decision to close this school.  When a school comes up for replacement and in a number of other circumstances, the Department look around to see whether this school should be amalgamated for the benefit of the education of the children.  In this case Montpelier school, which is an old school, came up for replacement because of its condition and the Department took a look at the educational structure in the area.  It was clear from what they found in relation to the matter that if some of the children were sent from Montpelier school area to Castleconnell they would benefit considerably by having more teachers to teach them there.  It was also obvious that if those of the children from the Bridgetown parish were sent to the Bridgetown school it would increase the number of teachers there from two to three.  So, overall, the children of Montpelier would be very <Col N="1785" /> much better off from the educational point of view and so, also, would the children in Bridgetown.  It is my job as Minister for Education to look after the education of all the children.  I must take all the factors into consideration. I examined this matter on many occasions and I came to the conclusion that in the interests of the children of Montpelier and of Bridgetown this was the proper decision to make.  Once again I want to stress that this decision was made solely on the basis of better education for the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to have the additional accommodation available there on 17th November, in about three or four weeks time.  I may say further that there have been references here as to whether I consider the parents.  I think it is true to say that there are few Deputies who have clearer insight into the feelings of the people in rural Ireland in relation to their own locality and particularly to the school in their locality than I have.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to the House that in the past three or four years we have closed 614 small schools.  We had trouble in about 14 or 15 of those schools.  It is obvious that the people in the areas in which the other 600 schools were situated had just as great a loyalty to their area and were just as concerned about the prestige of their area as the people in the areas where we had difficulties.</P>
      <P>What I want to point out is that the people in these areas had to make a decision, and that decision was whether they should be more concerned with the apparent prestige of their area or with the education of their children and, in all these cases, they came down on the side of the education of their children.  This, of course, is also true in relation to a considerable number of parents in the Montpelier area.  I would appeal very strongly tonight to the parents in the Montpelier area and I would ask them to give this amalgamation a chance, because I know that if they do they will feel the same about it as the people in the other areas where there were difficulties previously, and they will come back to thank us for what we have done.  I make this appeal very strongly here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also assure them if they should keep their children away from school for a considerable time, that when the the noise and the tumult dies away and when the news value goes out of this matter, the people who seem to have an interest in keeping the pot boiling <Col N="1788" /> will move off very quickly and will not be seen again in this context, and the unfortunate children will be the ones who will be left with the scars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that in future when his inspectors are visiting areas where consultations are necessary those inspectors will not attend meetings in local churches, meetings which I would say are designed especially to silence those parents.  That has taken place in east Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 296 together.  The general scheme of free education was introduced and continues to be operated on the basis of schools which in return for a certain subvention from the State were prepared to abolish school fees.  On this basis very few of the schools under Protestant management would have been able to enter the scheme.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, with a view to meeting their special problem, the Government made available a block grant to the Commission for Protestant secondary schools, who agreed to be responsible for the distribution of the moneys to those Protestant pupils most in need of assistance.  The only way by which this aim could be achieved was through the operation of a means test.  I am satisfied that the members of the Commission have operated the means test fairly and equitably.</P>
      <P>I may add that the block grant for Protestant pupils has been increased considerably this year and on a <i>per capita</i> basis has been and continues to be far higher than that available to the other schools which entered the general scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has stated accurately what the position is, would he not agree that the end result of the arrangement made is that, in fact, Protestant families under the operation of the means test do not get free secondary education and, to the extent that they do not, there is as a result an apparent difference between the treatment accorded to them and that accorded to children of other families in the State?  Would the Minister not agree that in these circumstances it is a bit ridiculous to say that we are providing free secondary education when in fact we are not?  The means test is operating and by reason of its operation many children in Dublin city and elsewhere are not accorded free secondary education? Does the Minister not feel that this matter could be re-examined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent. We have improved the grant very considerably in relation to Protestant boarding schools.  As I mentioned in my original reply, this scheme was operated on the basis of schools, and free education was made available through the schools accepting a certain sum of money.  For obvious reasons it was impossible for the Protestant community to do this and, therefore, we went a very considerable distance to meet them.  As I say, particularly in relation to boarding schools we have increased the grant very considerably.  It is very much higher than for Catholic schools.  We have also recently made a school transport system available which will be of very great help to them.</P>

      <P>While appreciating the Minister's efforts to ensure that no imbalance develops, nevertheless would he not agree that the general principle seems quite questionable?  It certainly seems unsatisfactory to a number of parents in my constituency.  As Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, the net result is that for some Protestant families there is free secondary education and for others there is not?  Would he not consider, conscious as we are of the efforts he has made in this direction and the large amount of money involved, that perhaps in consultation with the interests concerned he might further review this system or at least keep it under sharp annual review?  It appears now that certain anomalies have developed.  I certainly would not wish that this should develop into a purely political atmosphere as in the case of the rationalisation of some schools.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 298, 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the intermediate and leaving certificate results this year was that due to the unfortunate happenings in connection with the examinations the work of compiling results was delayed by about 14 days.  Added to this was the fact that there was an increase of 11,134 or 26 per cent in the number of candidates taking the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  Furthermore, there is a limit to the number of assistant examiners that can be employed if uniform standards are to be maintained.</P>
      <P>However, I have had the position reviewed and I can assure the Deputies that all possible steps will be taken to expedite the issue of results in future years.</P>
      <P>As regards the failure rate I wish to inform Deputy O'Hara that the normal standard of marking was adopted this year.  It is only to be expected that with vastly increased numbers the range of ability will widen so that some increase in the percentage of those who do not qualify for certificates is inevitable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been studied by my Department.  It is not easy to pinpoint the reason for the higher pass rate in the case of girls.  It would appear, however, that certain subjects in the curriculum lend themselves to study by girls and that girls show a special aptitude for these subjects. I refer particularly to home economics, physiology and hygiene and art.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the small difference in the pass rates warrants any particular action by my Department. The fact is that in an examination such as the leaving certificate the number of boys who did not qualify for the award of the certificate cannot be said to be high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fact that the higher pass rate is attributed by him to the girls passing readily in certain subjects shows the total unfairness of the system in which a certificate is awarded to people who pass in a certain number of subjects, in which these subjects are open to girls and not to boys, and therefore you have a discriminatory position?  Would he not agree that certificates should be given indicating that people have passed in whatever they have passed in and that a certificate should not be withheld because people failed to pass certain subjects, especially in the case of boys where this particular unfairness arises?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this was the only reason.  There are possibly other reasons, but in any case I was particularly careful in my reply not to talk about failures but rather to talk about those who did not qualify for the award of a certificate.  As the Deputy is probably aware the candidates who do not qualify for certificates can get a statement of their results from the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say the weight it carries with an employer is usually related to the particular subjects involved and if the statement on the certificate shows a good standard in certain subjects in which the employer is interested, then it is of advantage to the candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The special assistance given to boys this year was due to the fact that there are at present no training facilites for them available in this country and that initially their training involved their going abroad.

      <P>The position is that recommendations in relation to the National College of Art arising out of a report of a working party were furnished to my Department.  The accuracy of much of the information set out in the report was challenged by members of the staff of the college.  As <i>prima facie</i> there appeared to be substance in the counter information furnished by the staff, a meeting was arranged between the members of the working party and representatives of the staff to discuss the issues involved.  Two members of the working party refused to attend this meeting.  As I did not feel that I could act on a report the basis of which was challenged I felt that I should make alternative arrangements for a re-appraisal of the work of the college and seek other advice as to the future organisation of the college.</P>
      <P>I have sought such advice outside of the country and hope very shortly to have the whole position in the college examined by a person who has wide experience of the organisation of art courses and making the necessary provision for them in relation to accommodation and other facilities.  Of the three members who resigned from the college council two were members of the working party.  It is proposed to re-open the college on the 3rd November when structural alterations in the present building will have been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Lisdoonan is a few miles from Carrickmacross, with a fair population, a church and a parochial house, but there is no telephone in the area.  Accommodation would be provided and every service is available. The post office at Stonebridge was closed in 1965, without making provision for a public telephone.  Lobinstown, County Meath, is a centre of population which merits a telephone kiosk.  The Minister may not be aware of the facts about the present telephone in Lobinstown.  It is in an ordinary room as in most post offices.  However, the Minister will appreciate that many more people would use the service if a kiosk were provided, where a person could have a confidential or a private conversation without everybody standing around the room listening to everything said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained in the early part of my reply that we have embarked on a five year kiosk programme under which we will erect a coin box outside call offices where the telephone is used reasonably often.  As I said, Lobinstown is not one of those.  The position there is exactly the same as in a great number of offices all over the country.  Far more use is made of telephones in other areas and it is in areas like that we are providing over the next five years kiosks outside the call offices.  The Deputy mentioned that Monaghan County Council had made an application&mdash;I was unaware of this &mdash;in connection with the provision of telephone facilities.  If Monaghan County Council are willing to meet the rental charges in regard to any place where they require a public telephone coin box it will be provided and <Col N="1814" /> my Department would be only too happy to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases in which it takes upwards of a week to repair faulty telephones in the Dublin area is usually relatively small.  Where such delay occurs it may be for a variety of reasons, such as difficulty in locating the fault, necessity to repair or replace sections of damaged underground cable, difficulty in gaining access to subscribers premises or bad weather.  Rebates of rental are not allowed automatically for short periods of faulty service because the expense which would be involved in keeping the necessary records would be out of all proportions to the value of such rebates. Requests made by subscribers for rebates in such circumstances are however sympathetically considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In many parts of the country where the plant and staff position is favourable telephone service is provided within a few months for all applicants.  Elsewhere all applications for business telephones are specially considered and those which qualify for priority treatment are attended to, service being usually provided within about two to three months.  I am aware that there is heavy delay in some areas in installing telephones to meet business applications which do not qualify for priority treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be desirable to deal with business applications on the basis <Col N="1816" /> of giving specially early attention to all cases where the work required was small.  In present circumstances, with a waiting list and increasing demand for new lines the works programme must be prepared in such a way as to use the engineering construction force to the best advantage.  This is secured by dealing with applications so far as possible by groups or areas, except where special priority is warranted.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done to expand the resources of the Department in order to improve the position and the allocation earlier this year of £50 million under the Telephone Capital Act, 1969, towards development of the service is evidence of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the standard of telephone service in a number of areas in the west of Ireland is not satisfactory particularly during holiday periods.  The main cause of the trouble is shortage of trunk circuits serving the principal centres, coupled with interruptions due to the fact that the circuits are carried on wires over very exposed long routes.  A co-axial <Col N="1817" /> cable which has been laid from Athlone to Roscommon, Castlerea, Claremorris, Castlebar and Ballina will be brought into service about April next.  A trunk cable between Ballina and Belmullet is due to be completed about the middle of next year and one between Galway and Clifden early in 1971. Completion of these cable schemes will eliminate delays and provide a high quality trunk service to all areas in the west.  In the meantime every effort will be made to maintain the routes in the best possible condition.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 348 together.</P>
      <P>Reception in the Six Counties of RTE's sound programmes from the Athlone transmitter is generally satisfactory. In addition, RTE's VHF transmissions are receivable over a large part of the area.  Concerning television, RTE's signals cross into the Six Counties with much the same effectiveness in most areas as BBC's and UTV's signals coming in along the east coast here.  RTE's programmes are receivable over a large part of the Six Counties apart from places shadowed by mountains, but satisfactory reception is possible in most cases only if viewers erect special &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; type aerials for the purpose as is done by viewers here who wish to receive external programmes. I fully share the Deputies' desire to improve the quality of reception of RTE programmes and I will do what I can to secure maximum improvement.</P>

I do not accept that at this stage it is something that demands an inquiry of any nature.

      <Col N="1825" /> A decision has not so far been reached on the application made to me by the Broadcasting Authority for an increase in licence fees.  The application, which is based on the need to meet increased operating and other costs, is still under examination.</P>
    <P>The quality of reception is a matter primarily for RTE.  I am advised by the authority that television coverage extends to 98 per cent of the country. The remainder is made up of small individual areas where reception is affected by adverse conditions of terrain. The authority has made a study of these areas and is dealing with them as quickly as possible in order of population density.</P>

An arrangement of the kind suggested cannot, therefore, be favourably considered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision in regard to Ballymun was entirely exceptional and was taken because of the special circumstances which apply there.  In particular, reception of RTE programmes on indoor aerials in the two-storey houses in Ballymun would not be satisfactory because of adjacent high buildings and it would not be possible for residents to <Col N="1826" /> have individual outdoor aerials because of the unique features of the building project.</P>
