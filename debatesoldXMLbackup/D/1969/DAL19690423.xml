    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the population of Connacht in 1926, 1956 and at the latest available date; the reasons for the decline; and if the Government have any special policy to arrest the decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are particulars of the population of Connacht according to the censuses of 1926, 1956 and 1966: 1926, 552, 907; 1956, 446, 221; 1966, 401, 950.  It would not be possible to isolate general reasons for the decreases.</P>
      <P>The Third Programme for Economic and Social Development outlines the Government's continuing plans for the development of the western areas, including Connacht.  In forthcoming debates on Estimates for the various Departments, Ministers will detail the Government's plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply and due to the fact that almost 200,000 people have been driven out of this country since Fianna Fáil first came into office, will the Taoiseach not agree that the policy of a Fianna Fáil conservative Government, led by a conservative Taoiseach, is doing untold harm to this country, and especially to the west?  Will the Taoiseach not further agree that, since the dead hand of Fianna Fáil came into operation in 1932, they have done more harm to the economy of this country than ever Cromwell did?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that his policy for saving the west has been and is a complete failure?  Would the Taoiseach not further agree that the Fianna Fail people are now not even interested in the west, or in the people of Ireland, or in saving the west?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will inform the House of the present position regarding Ireland's application for admission to the EEC; and if he can give a reliable date for the entry of the country into full membership of the EEC.</P>

    <Col N="1971" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community, as well as those of the other applicants, continues to remain on the Agenda of the EEC Council but, as Deputies are no doubt aware, there is still disagreement among the member countries on the question of the opening of negotiations. As I indicated in reply to a question on the 12th March, the date of Ireland's accession to the EEC will depend in the first instance on how soon the member governments can agree among themselves on the opening of negotiations with the applicant countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that our industrial policy as regards tariffs has been planned and geared on the assumption that we would be in the EEC by 1970, or at the latest by 1972, and in view of the fact that the reduction of tariffs and the importation of industrial goods from Britain and other countries are doing untold harm to our economy, does the Taoiseach not think the time has come for a review of this whole policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our industrial policy has been planned in relation to the worldwide trend towards freer trade and, unless we can gear our industries to reach a competitive stage and not be dependent on tariffs and other forms of protection, our industrialisation programme will not go ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when, according to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, membership of the EEC was just around the corner?  Is the Taoiseach joking the people about membership of the EEC?  It was the main plank in 1961 and in 1965, and I assume it will be again in 1969, 1970 or whenever the forthcoming election will be held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give a breakdown of the imports of £35 million from Germany; and the amount of such imports which could have been produced in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information, required in the first part of the question, for the calendar year 1968.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the amount of such imports which could have been produced in Ireland is not available. The Government are providing generous inducements to industrialists to promote increased industrial production but it is for industrialists themselves to assess, in the light of the technical and other factors involved, what it is economically feasible to produce. Only an insignificant part of the imports from Germany in 1968 consisted of agricultural products.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the inducement up to now must have been a failure because we had an adverse trade balance of £27 million with Germany last year? Would he not also agree that we should try to make a barter agreement with this country, especially in view of the fact that the importation of industrial products from Germany is doing untold harm to our industries here and to the workers employed in them?

      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the amount of Ireland's adverse trade balance at the 31st March, 1969, (b) the reasons for it and (c) what action the Government intend to take during the coming year to reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that, in the 12 months ended the 31st March, 1969, imports totalled £507.7 million and exports totalled £338.4 million. There was, therefore, an import excess on visible trade estimated at £169.3 million.  About 75 per cent of total imports is accounted for by imports of capital goods and materials for further production.</P>
      <P>There is normally an import surplus on visible trade, offset by net receipts on invisible items.  For the year 1968&mdash; the latest for which such estimates are available&mdash;it is estimated that net invisible exports were £137 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current external trade situation is under review at present in the context <Col N="1976" /> of framing the Government's overall policy of demand management of the economy.  This policy will be indicated in the forthcoming financial statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think this adverse trade balance of £169 million is a healthy sign for our economy?  Does he not believe we are heading for bankruptcy unless the Government do something to correct our trading figures with England and with other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

There could be no question of the Port and Docks Board proceeding with the implementation of their port development plan without the agreement of the planning authority or without publicising their proposals with a view to giving interested parties the opportunity of lodging objections.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that he gave a somewhat similar answer to a similar question three years ago?  At that time the Minister informed the House that this transformer would be erected.  Today he tells the House it will be erected next year.  Is it not time the Minister took some positive action so far as the district of Rosscarberry is concerned?  The people in the district have been suffering from poor reception for a number of years.  They have been expecting action for years but it has not been taken.

As I stated in reply to a somewhat similar question on 25th March, Clonmel exchange accommodation has been overcrowded and it <Col N="1985" /> was not considered advisable to add to the traffic load by connecting new subscribers, except those in the priority category.  Extra switchboards are being installed at present in accommodation set free recently by moving the postal sorting office to other premises.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary centre in the telephone automatisation plan for County Mayo is at Castlebar.  This will be the automanual exchange to which the trunk routes serving the area will be connected.  Subscribers connected to other automatic exchanges in the county who require calls which cannot be connected automatically &mdash; for example &ldquo;personal&rdquo; calls and calls to manual exchanges&mdash;will be served by the operators at Castlebar.  The plans for the new exchange building have had to be revised to provide for increased accommodation requirements and it is understood that the Commissioners of Public Works estimate that the building will be completed late in 1971 or early in 1972.  Installation of the exchange equipment will take twelve to fifteen months.  It is expected that automatic exchanges at Ballina, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis and Ballinrobe will be brought into service shortly after the Castlebar automanual exchange is opened.  It would be premature at this stage to forecast when the remaining exchanges in County Mayo will be converted to automatic working.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a call to the exchange may on occasion take up to a quarter of an hour or half an hour, the distance involved being seven or eight miles?  I understand that is due mainly to the fact that there are not enough trunk lines.  Surely it should be possible to <Col N="1986" /> reduce the time over such a short distance?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the delays may have arisen because of an insufficiency of circuits.  The Deputy knows a cable is being laid at the moment through Ballina and Athlone to serve a number of western towns. That will improve the service.  Last summer the position was aggravated because of the number of tourists and holidaymakers who made trunk calls between the hours of eight o'clock and 12 o'clock.  There was an all-time record number of calls and that naturally created difficulties.  We would not, in the ordinary way, provide staff suffi-cient to deal with the very large exceptional number of calls due to the unique summer weather.  That was part of the difficulty we experienced last summer.</P>

It is intended that, while withdrawing from some of these traditional dairying areas, the company should in other areas become associated in a development capacity with co-operative creamery societies which may be unable from their own resources immediately to undertake the rationalisation of the creamery industry and the provision of processing facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations made in 1963 by the Minister for Local Government require that car windows be so maintained as not to obscure the vision of the driver. The regulations specially mention unessential stickers.  No recent instruction has been issued to the Force concerning the enforcement of these regulations.</P>
      <P>It is of course possible, and would be in accordance with normal practice, that a reminder about this or any other law or regulation may have been recently given in any locality by a local officer, inspector or sergeant but no information to that effect is available to me.</P>
      <P>No separate records are kept of prosecutions for such offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that this is the only case on the records of his Department?  Is he also satisfied that it was not the sticker to which objection was taken but that the wording of the sticker was &ldquo;Boland must go&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I would not know of this prosecution but for the Deputy's question.  I am informed that the motorist in question had a very large sticker, 14 inches by four inches, on his window and if a car is found with a slogan of the same size saying &ldquo;Harte must go&rdquo; the driver will also be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that any person using a sticker of a nature that would be used in a general election <Col N="2007" /> will receive the same treatment as this individual received in Clare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice what regulations, if any, exist in regard to the control and supervision of organisations which raise money stated to be for charitable purposes; whether an organisation (name supplied) is subject to such regulations; and if he will state its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislative control or supervision over fund-raising for charity.  There are certain statutory controls over lotteries and street-collections but they apply irrespective of whether the object is charitable or not.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, not in a position to make any statement as to the purpose or object of the organisation referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the National Cancer Research and Relief Fund is an obvious racket and police tolerance of its existence is not alone inexcusable but is a grave embarrassment and handicap to the reputable and honourable organisations who are doing such excellent work in the field of voluntary fund-raising?  In the light of that, does the Minister not think that action is essential and that we should have removed from this country by whatever means we can people who are battening on unfortunate cancer sufferers and those <Col N="2008" /> who sympathise with them?  This is an established fact and it has been publicised widely in the newspapers.  Is the Minister content to leave the matter in the terms of his reply to me because if he is I shall have to go further and raise the matter on the Adjournment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is that there is no legislative control or supervision on fund-raising for charity. Legislation in this field might be desirable but I am pointing out to the Deputy that the legislation is not there. As to the grave allegation that the Deputy has made I can only say to the Deputy that I shall have the matter investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, having regard to the need to prevent further disruption of and harm to the film exhibiting industry, he will introduce legislation to amend the Cinematograph Act, 1909, to provide that no new cinema licences be granted unless the applicants for such licences surrender not less than two old licences in respect of each new one granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cinematograph Act, 1909, was enacted for the purpose of ensuring the safety of persons attending cinemas where inflammable film is used and it provided for the grant of licences in prescribed circumstances by local authorities.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to amend the Act for a purpose unconnected with safety precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, as Minister for Justice and the Minister responsible for the licensing of cinemas, consider the problem which is arising, in the Dublin area in particular, where there is a drift towards monopoly ownership of film exhibitions in the control of foreign interests which will jeopardise Irish-owned interests and also the whole film exhibiting industry here?  Having regard to this and the fact that the Minister is responsible for the conduct of cinemas, would he consider this position before it is too late to cure this monopoly situation which is potentially very harmful to the film exhibiting industry?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is such a danger as the Deputy mentions, it would not be a matter for me but, rather, would be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am concerned only with ensuring the safety of persons attending the cinemas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that this is on the same basis as intoxicating liquor licences where, in certain circumstances, two licences must be surrendered to obtain a new one and this is done in the interests of preserving good trading conditions?  A similar issue arises here and I respectfully urge on the Minister that it is his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that suggestion. I have no responsibility for the matters to which the Deputy referred.  I have, of course, a special responsibility for the licensing law but that is a different matter.</P>

    <P>The woman in question was arrested in May, 1967, and was charged with 23 cases of larceny and receiving.  She <Col N="2010" /> pleaded guilty in the district court and was remanded on bail to May, 1968, to see how she would behave in the meantime. While on remand she committed a series of forgery offences, by altering 26 money orders.  She was charged with these offences in March, 1968.  The amount involved was £388, none of which was recovered.  In May, 1968, the district court dealt with the forgery offences, to which the defendant pleaded guilty.  The court took into consideration the 23 earlier charges. She was sentenced to six months imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently.  She appealed against the severity of the sentences to the circuit court which dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentences.  She was legally represented at the hearings in the district court and circuit court.</P>
    <P>Following the appeal, she petitioned for mitigation but, as the petition disclosed no facts that were not available to the appeal court, including the fact that she was pregnant, the petition was refused.  She was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 18th November. Her medical history was known to the prison doctor.  She was under constant medical supervision while in Mountjoy and, in consultation with the National Maternity Hospital, was sent there for examination at fortnightly intervals. She shared a cell with two other women, one of whom was her sister. The cell was locked, as is customary, from 7.45 p.m. to 7.00 a.m. but during that period the prisoners were, of course, under the supervision of the night duty officer.  She was supplied with milk and eggs in addition to the ordinary prison diet.  She made no complaint about her treatment in prison either to the prison authorities, the Visiting Committee or to my Department and, in fact, expressed appreciation of the care given to her by the staff.  She was paroled on Christmas Day and on St. Stephen's Day to visit her family.</P>
    <P>On 11th February, 1969, as there were signs of a possible premature delivery, the Prison Medical Officer arranged to have her accepted into hospital on that day for observation.  A baby was born in the hospital on 14th February and died shortly afterwards. <Col N="2011" /> Without requiring her to return to prison she was released a week later.</P>
    <P>I may point out, in relation to the general comments made in the newspaper article, that pregnant women prisoners are invariably sent to hospital for the delivery; that they are, in fact, under constant medical care, and that if in any particular case imprisonment were having adverse effects on a prisoner's health and the prospects for the birth of the child, the question of the remission of sentence would be favourably considered.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that an employee of St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar embezzled £700 but that he was allowed to pay it back out of his gratuity and, further, that that man is now out on a pension of £8 per week because he was an active member of Fianna Fáil?

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1967: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) (b), page 9, line 11, after &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by the use or threat of physical force&rdquo;.  &mdash;(Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Higgin's amendment I should like to say that on this issue there is not much difference between Deputy O'Higgins's view and my own.  The draft, as it stands, means substantially what Deputy O'Higgins wants it to mean, so that the real question is whether any drafting amendment is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy makes the point that the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; could be held to include certain types of canvassing for membership of an organisation.  I agree with that&mdash;a threat of a boycott, for instance, is a form of intimidation in the ordinary meaning of the word.  But, and this is the point, we are not speaking just of intimidation but of an offence involving intimidation. This, I think, makes all the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the wording of the Bill as it stands.  First of all, it will be seen that the provision does not apply to cases where an offence has already been committed.  It is concerned only with persons caught in the act, so to speak.  Of course, one cannot speak with confidence of a person committing an offence until the court has found him guilty and so the section has to speak of the situation in which <Col N="2015" /> the man is doing something which the Garda reasonably believe to be an offence.  This does not affect the point I am making which is that the provision relates to acts in progress and not to actions that are already completed. This is important because it limits the type of offence to which the provision can relate.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the words used are &ldquo;an offence involving the intimidation of another person&rdquo;.  What I want to mention here is that it does not describe intimidation as an offence nor does it suggest that intimidation is an offence. In fact, intimidation, by itself alone, is not an offence at all.  There must always be something more.  Therefore we have to look at the section and see what the words could or might apply to.</P>
    <P>What offences could it apply to? Assault might seem the obvious one but in fact assault is covered by another provision, namely, paragraph (d).  The offences it applies to are very few.</P>
    <P>There is a common law offence of intimidating witnesses in judicial proceedings. Presumably there will be no argument about the desirability of allowing an arrest of a person in that case, and especially when, as will be seen, the arrest is permissible only where it appears to be necessary to prevent a continuation of the offence.</P>
    <P>There are some other offences that could be said to involve intimidation but that are more usually classed under the head &ldquo;menaces&rdquo;.  They either involve threats of personal violence &mdash;which the Deputy accepts as justifying arrest when the offender is caught in the act&mdash;or they involve threats by letter or the like, in which case the conditions required by subsection (3), as a preliminary to the arrest, could not possibly be satisfied.  Besides, in practically all of these cases there is a power of arrest under other provisions of the law, for they are felonies carrying heavy penalties.</P>
    <P>This leaves the only other offence that is of any significance under this head&mdash;and this is the one that matters <Col N="2016" /> in the present context.  The relevant Act is the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the offence is the intimidation of a person or a member of his family with a view to compelling him to do something which he is legally entitled not to do, or with a view to compelling him not to do something that he is legally entitled to do.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the provision that we have to look at and the point to be made about it is that the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; in that provision has already been the subject of judicial interpretation. As a result of this, it is established and well accepted that &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo;, in the context of the 1875 Act, is limited to the kind of intimidation that would justify a district justice in binding over the intimidator to keep the peace.  Primarily, this means a threat of personal violence, which is what the Deputy's amendment speaks of, but it also could include a threat of damage to a person's property, and I think it is right that the provision should extend to this.</P>
    <P>The net effect of what I have said is that, while I would not go so far as to agree that the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; should be restricted to threats of personal violence, it is in fact already limited, under the Bill as it stands, to intimidation which involves either a threat of personal violence or a threat of damage to property.  In fact, I expect that the Deputy would agree that it should extend to threats of damage to property, so that the net question is not one of substance but one of drafting. The legal advice I have is that it is quite unnecessary to state this and as I am sure Deputies will appreciate, there are sound and serious reasons why one should not indulge in what I might call over-elaborate drafting.  Basically, the problem is that if you try to define every word you use, no harm may be done in the immediate context but great harm may be done to the construction of other sections or even other Acts of Parliament.</P>
    <P>My legal advice is that it is better to leave it as it is and that it applies only to a very restricted number of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand <Col N="2017" /> the Minister's very learned contribution he agrees that what he wants to do is what I suggest he should do by means of my amendment but at the same time he thinks it would be better not to do what I suggest he should do.  It seems to me to be cockeyed. The Minister concedes, as I understand it, that the intention of this subsection is that the power of arrest without warrant in relation to offences which involve intimidation should be exercised only if the intimidation which is observed by the Garda is intimidation of a sort which is likely to result in physical violence to a person or damage to property.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting to the Minister is that that should be made quite clear and that he should spell out in the subsection that the only cases of offences involving intimidation in which the power of arrest will be given to a garda are offences where the intimidation involved is by the use or threat of physical force, that means obviously either to a person or to property.  This matter can be of considerable importance.  The Minister has given a learned statement of the law as it exists at the moment.  We are changing the law now.  We are giving a power of arrest without warrant to garda officers in particular instances. The particular one we are concerned with here is where an offence involves intimidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very clear recollection, and I think most Deputies in this House will have the same clear recollection, of time after time Government speakers standing up in this House and alleging that members of the NFA were guilty of, or were involved in, intimidation during the troubles in the agricultural world some months or some years ago. If an allegation of intimidation is made by a Government Minister against members of a vocational organisation, such as the NFA, is not that tantamount to saying to the Garda, in the context of this section: &ldquo;So far as those boyos are concerned you have power to arrest them without warrant, and go ahead and arrest them without warrant.&rdquo;  That is the kind of situation I am concerned with in this amendment. That is why I want to have it <Col N="2018" /> spelled out in this section that the power of arrest without warrant, so far as an offence involving intimidation is concerned, will exist only where it appears to the garda concerned that there is the use or threat of physical violence involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; has two different meanings in the sense that the statutory word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; must have certain elements in it.  Under the law as it stands there has to be a threat of physical violence, and so on.  The word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; is used by the ordinary man in the street in a rather different sense from the legal definition of &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; as we know it.  I can give many instances.  For instance, where people were told that, if they did not do a certain thing, or join a certain organisation, their milk would not be carried by the local contractor, or words to that effect, or a shopkeeper was told he would be boy-cotted unless he produced certain funds, that is the kind of thing which is regarded by the ordinary man in the street as intimidation.  What I call the legal man's definition is a different matter.</P>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person whom he finds doing anything which constitutes, or which the member reasonably believes to constitute, an offence, being&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an offence whereby, in the opinion of the member, human life is endangered or a risk of serious injury to any person or of serious damage to property is caused,</P>
      <P>(b) an offence involving the intimidation of another person,</P>
      <P>(c) an offence involving damage to property or involving drunkenness in a public place or disorderly conduct in a public place, or</P>
      <P>(d) an offence involving a breach of the peace or any other conduct which, in the opinion of the member, is likely to lead to a breach of the peace,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>if an arrest is, in the opinion of the <Col N="2019" /> member, necessary to protect human life, to prevent serious injury to any person or serious damage to property, to prevent the continuation of the offence or to restore or preserve the peace.</P>
    <P>He must have this in mind to operate this section.  As I have said, I am advised that, as the section stands, it is unnecessary to state what Deputy O'Higgins wants to state, and that the section, as drafted, has built into it in reality the conditions which Deputy O'Higgins has in mind.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy O'Higgins making his point I did not think there was much in the amendment but, listening to the Minister's reply, I think he has made Deputy O'Higgins's case for him.  I assume he was talking about the NFA when he talked about someone being told that, if he did not join a certain organisation or do something they wanted him to do, his milk would not be carried.  According to what the Minister said, the man who said that should be arrested.  According to the Minister, he leaves himself open to arrest.  It is only a short step from that to the trade unionist who goes on strike and says: &ldquo;We are not going to load a lorry,&rdquo; or something like that.  According to what the Minister said, he leaves himself liable to arrest.  That is the interpretation which the Minister appears to be putting on this, that that is intimidation.</P>

Early on, many of us thought this Bill was in many ways aimed at a certain organisation. The Minister said it was not, and that it was a tightening up of the <Col N="2020" /> law.  Now it appears to me that our first impression was right, and that the idea is that no one can open his mouth in this country or he can be charged with intimidation and can be arrested without a warrant.  It appears to me that that is the argument the Minister is making.</P>

      <P>Surely it would be essential to make some amendment to limit the interpretation that can be put on &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; within the framework of this Bill?  Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion is rational.  I do not know what the offence of intimidation as such is, despite the fact that I have had many years' experience in criminal work.  The feeling I have about this type of legislation is that there could be extensive abuse under it as a result of which arrest without warrant could be used even as a temporary device to get people away, in perfectly lawful situations, from what they are trying to do.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is in earnest in saying that he wants the kind of thing that is suggested by Deputy O'Higgins, then we have reached a stage where, if that amendment is not satisfactory to him, we should be able to agree between ourselves on a limitation that could be put on the bald words in the statute.  When Deputy Booth talks about the extension in the concept of the Act as referring to the endangering of life, damage to property and so on, that is, to my mind, only a very simple escape valve to justify the situation <i>post hoc, not ad hoc.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a suggestion by which all the matters that have been causing trouble may possibly be resolved.  The Minister may not be able to answer this now, but I think it could be decided in this way: what instructions will be given by the head of the Garda Síochána to the officers and members of the Garda when this Bill is passed into law?  They will be told: &ldquo;Here is a section which authorises you to arrest under certain conditions.&rdquo;  First of all, they have to have reasonable grounds for belief that an offence has been committed, and then that the offence involves intimidation.  I get the impression from the Minister's statement that there are only two offences really that come within this.  This is a matter that could be tested by reference to the instructions given regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on this general section which might not be strictly relevant but which I think is relevant <Col N="2023" /> indirectly.  As far as I understand, there have to be four ingredients before a member of the Garda can make an arrest.  First of all, he must reasonably believe that the matter constitutes an offence; there must then be an offence; there must also be the consideration that such an offence involves intimidation; and then he must be of the opinion that it is necessary to protect human life and so forth, as in the final words in the subsection.</P>
    <P>The first part of the section says he must reasonably believe, and that can be tested in court; it is a safeguard that is very properly put in here.  However, it is weakened to a very considerable extent by the fact that the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the member is necessary to protect human life, to prevent serious injury to any person or serious damage to property, to prevent the continuation of the offence or to restore or preserve the peace.&rdquo;  In order to allay rather considerable disturbed feelings about the section and the proposed extension of the powers of arrest that have been given by this Bill, I would suggest to the Minister that he might delete the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the member&rdquo; or that he should at least consider it between now and the next Stage of the Bill.  As I say, there is a safeguard in the fact that a member of the Garda cannot arrest without reasonable belief.  He would have to produce that reasonable belief in court, but that safeguard is largely nullified by the fact that his opinion cannot be tested.  If he says &ldquo;I was of the opinion&rdquo; he cannot be cross-examined on that.  That is final and conclusive. There was a legal case years ago in which a man was hanged as a consequence of a clause that was passed here in a hurry.  The word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; was incorporated and the man was hanged on that account.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, as I have suggested, get the exact words of the instructions that would be given by the Commissioner to the Garda when the Bill becomes law, and also consider deleting the word &ldquo;opinion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should emphasise that it is established and <Col N="2024" /> well accepted that intimidation in the context of the 1875 Act is limited to the kind of intimidation that would justify a district justice in binding over the intimidator to the peace.  This has been so judicially defined and primarily it means a threat of personal violence, which is what Deputy O'Higgins's amendment speaks of.  It also includes a threat of damage to a person's property, and I think it is right that provision should extend to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in every case the question of the arrest of a person is a process in the legal steps of charging that person.  Another important point is that there is a serious objection, legally speaking, to spelling out something that does not need to be spelled out.  If we spell this out here we will call in question the meaning in other Acts in which it is not defined. We have intimidation interpreted under the 1875 Act and the point made about changing the law is really misconceived. We are not changing the 1875 Act in which the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; is used, without definition, but, as I said, it has been legally interpreted and is quite definite.  As far as Deputy Costello's suggestion is concerned, I will have the wording re-examined. One of the best-known rules highlighted in the Garda code is that, so far as the criminal law is concerned, intimidation has been legally interpreted. I have given the House the <Col N="2025" /> quotation.  The instruction that would go out would be even more specific after this section is passed.  It would be limited in practice to one offence actually.  That is the 1875 Act, the relevant portion of which I have read. There is possibly something in the suggestion Deputy Costello made in regard to his fears about the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;.  I will have that examined. Possibly if the words &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; were substituted that might meet the Deputy's objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello is, as usual, approaching this in a most generous manner.  The Minister's comments do not, however, go any great distance in solving my doubts about the section.  I have no doubt the Minister is absolutely bona fide, as was Deputy Costello in making the suggestion, that an instruction to the Garda Síochána will in some way settle the fears or allay the doubts with regard to the wording of the subsection. No doubt Deputy Costello, in making the suggestion, and the Minister, in embracing it, both believe that an instruction properly worded will have the effect of ensuring that this section will remain on the rails from the point of view of enforcement, but I think both Deputy Costello and the Minister are overlooking the fact that an instruction can be changed at any time.  It can be changed from day to day or week to week.  I believe the only safe way to deal now with this matter is to spell out in the subsection what we mean and not leave it to the Minister of the day or the Garda Commissioner of the day to issue instructions as to the manner in which the particular subsection is to be implemented. For that reason I am not satisfied with the suggestion that we should pin our faith in regard to keeping this section on the rails on an instruction to be issued to the Garda Síochána.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy <Col N="2026" /> Booth, and, I think, the Minister, have fallen into error in presupposing that before this power of arrest, without warrant, operates an offence must have been committed.  Deputy Booth said that was a condition precedent to the operation of this section.  That is not the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let us get down to it.  The first point to remember is that this section can be implemented where no offence&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;has been committed. It can be operated where a garda reasonably believes&mdash;that is the phrase used in the section&mdash;that an offence has been committed.  The garda may be entirely wrong in his belief.  His belief may be entirely reasonable but, at the same time, he may be entirely wrong in that belief.  I referred earlier to a certain kind of situation, the situation in which you have Government spokesmen standing up here and alleging intimidation against members of the NFA, or any other organisation.  Is it not perfectly natural and reasonable to expect that members of the Garda Síochána throughout the country will have regard to what Government Ministers <Col N="2027" /> say in this House and, if they have to go into court and stand over their actions, will they not be in the position in which they would say: &ldquo;I thought that there was an offence being committed because I heard Government Ministers quoted on television and radio&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as saying that this was a scandalous situation and that all sorts of acts of intimidation were being committed all over the country?&rdquo; Because of that the gardaí would be acting in a bona fide manner and in a perfectly reasonable belief and they would be entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>And the court would tell them so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Costello says, the man would have been arrested before that.  What use is it to him if the court then tells the gardaí that they were wrong in arresting him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí would not do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this is a reasonable fear and it is all the more reasonable in the light of the Minister's attitude; he agrees he wants this power to deal with cases where the intimidation concerned is intimidation which involves the use or the threat of physical force.  It is for those cases the Minister wants this power incorporated in this Bill.  That being so, why not spell that out?  Why leave it in doubt?  In my view, in any event, it will be in doubt unless we spell out what we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be safeguards which are operated by particular Ministers.  The Minister who is dealing with this Bill has, as I understand it, indicated to Deputy Costello that the safeguard which Deputy Costello suggested would be implemented in the direction given to the Garda.  Please God, without wishing him any harm, we shall have a change of Minister because <Col N="2028" /> there will be a change of Government shortly.  Possibly the next Minister will not take the same view as this Minister or possibly this Minister, if he were still there, would change his mind.  Because of particular circumstances that might arise, you might have those kinds of safeguards, but surely the fundamental safeguard is to write into the Bill what we mean? There is even doubt as to what &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; may mean.</P>
    <P>The Minister's last contribution to the discussion seemed to me to revolve largely around the judicial interpretation of the meaning of &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; under the 1875 Act.  But, as far as this goes, we are not limited in the use of the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; to the use or the threat of use of physical force.  We can have verbal intimidation.  We can have intimidation of the sort the Minister mentioned&mdash;a threat to withdraw services, threats of boycott, and so on. Let us take a simple example of a person making a political speech outside a church gate who might become somewhat abusive in his language.  An offence might be committed in the choice of language he uses.  A garda, listening to it, might feel that this is a bit inflammatory, that this is likely to intimidate the person who is listening to the speaker from acting one way rather than another way.  As I see it, it is not stretching things too far to think that the garda, particularly if he were encouraged by speeches of Ministers in this House, might thereupon feel he was entitled to arrest the speaker without warrant.</P>
    <P>We have to guard against these dangers.  It is not the proper implementation&mdash;I am using that phrase in the sense of the implementation that is intended by the House&mdash;but it is improper implementation of a section, and again I am using the term &ldquo;improper&rdquo; in the sense of a mistake in the implementation of a section, that we have got to guard against.  What counts ultimately, if this has to be interpreted, is not what I say, is not what the Minister says, is not what Deputy Booth says, is not what Deputy Collins says, is not what Deputy Costello or anybody else says, but it is what is written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have one further suggestion to make which the Minister might perhaps consider. Delete paragraph (b)&mdash;an offence involving the intimidation of another person&mdash;and put in the particular offences he wants covered, that is, offences under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>While I shall examine any suggestion, I am not too sure that this would be the answer.  Indeed, I do not believe it would be the answer. Taking the section as a whole, all of what is said in subsection (3)&mdash;a person who is found by a member of the Garda Síochána doing anything which he reasonably believes to constitute an offence involving threatened danger to life, threatened danger of serious injury to a person or of serious damage to property or intimidation by any person or breach of the peace or involving drunkenness or disorder in a public place&mdash;all of that is subject to the condition that the garda must be of the opinion not only that the person is in the act of committing the offence but that an arrest is necessary to put an end to the danger to life, property and so on, as the case may be.  So far as the section deals with offences endangering life, it is meant primarily to cover cases where the danger is incidental; the garda would have immediate or unqualified power of arrest under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add to that and to re-emphasise that what Deputy O'Higgins is speaking of&mdash;&ldquo;intimidation&rdquo;&mdash;is mentioned in this section and that it comes from and has been defined in the 1875 Act and is limited to the kind of intimidation that would justify a district justice's binding the intimidator to keep the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, and the Deputy knows, that in such a case there is violence or a threat of violence and that this is a prerequisite as far as intimidation is <Col N="2030" /> concerned before this power could be exercised by the garda.  I should like to repeat, because it arises at various points in this Bill, that we cannot spell out everything and that to attempt to do so could affect similar words in other Acts.  I think Deputy Costello and Deputy O'Higgins will appreciate this point which always arises and particularly in a Bill dealing with the criminal code.  This is a serious problem at all times for draftsmen of legislation. But the Deputies will appreciate that here we have&mdash;as far as &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; is concerned&mdash;a word from the 1875 Act that has already judicially been defined and therefore it has that advantage.  It means a specific thing as far as the law is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the 1875 Act is concerned, it means a definite thing.  This is a 1969 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  It was not defined in the 1875 Act.  The point I am making, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, is that here is a Bill in which a word is used which already has judicially been defined.  Naturally, having already judicially been defined, the same definition, the same interpretation, will be applied to the words as used in this particular section.  This is the purpose of having it there in this form.  Again, let me repeat that in any of these arrests, where the power of arrest is exercised under this measure, as it is under the existing law, the arrest is a precedent to a charge and that a charge follows.  In fact, if it did not, the arrestor, if I might put it that way, would be facing certain civil proceedings. That is the position.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last suggestion made by Deputy Costello, it is my own off-the-cuff view, without studying the implications of it, that it would not suit the purpose of the section; but I will have it examined between this and the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a point and it is necessary to examine it a little bit further.  The Minister keeps making the point that, so far as the use of the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; in the 1875 Act is concerned, <Col N="2031" /> it has been the subject of judicial interpretation. He assumes from that&mdash; possibly rightly, but I do not want to be taken as agreeing with him&mdash;that therefore the reference to intimidation in this subsection is going to be interpreted in precisely the same way. The Minister may be correct in that, but I want to query it.  It seems to me that it is open to the court in interpreting this Act, when this Bill becomes law, and coming nearly 100 years after the 1875 Act and coming in different circumstances, to examine this entire section and to try to ascertain from an examination of the section what the Legislature intended when they wrote into the Act subsection (3) (b), that there can be arrest without warrant where a garda reasonably believes that a person is committing an offence involving the intimidation of another person.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that one of the factors which a court might take into account is that the Government of the day, through the Minister for Justice, resisted four square any attempt to ensure that the use of the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; in this subsection should be qualified by it being spelt into the subsection that the intimidation concerned must be intimidation by the use or threat of physical force.  Certainly, I would not be prepared to bet that in those circumstances, and having regard to the allegations of intimidation made against the NFA some time ago from Government benches, that a court is going to decide that the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; as used in this context means precisely the same thing as has been judicially decided in relation to the use of that word in the 1875 Act. It is very dangerous to allow this subsection to stand unaltered.  It is dangerous not to write into the Bill what we mean.  I cannot see why we should not write in what we mean when the position, as I understand it, is that what the Minister wants to achieve is what is stated in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to the Deputy is that my interpretation of the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; is also that of those who advised me and that it can <Col N="2032" /> be construed the way it has been judicially construed.  It is, perhaps, somewhat unfortunate that we started talking about intimidation in a non-legal way and it is possibly confusing some people because there are many things regarded as intimidation by the ordinary man that would not or could not be the subject of a charge, as the word is judicially interpreted.</P>

      <P>If the House agrees, we could discuss amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 6a together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss them together but have separate decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>To delete subsection (4).</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment, No. 6, obviously shows that he is not satisfied with subsection (4) as it stands. My recommendation to the Minister is that the right way to deal with this is to take it out of the Bill completely and not to try some patchwork operation on it.  When I say that, may I say at the same time that the Minister's amendment is largely a distinction without a difference when compared with the existing subsection (4) of the Bill?</P>
    <P>This is the subsection which gives a garda the power to arrest without warrant in certain circumstances which are set out in the subsection.  These circumstances are (a) where a garda is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence; (b) he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur, and (c) it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.</P>
    <P>Objection, and very serious objection, has been taken to this subsection by various persons and bodies.  I referred to the subsection on Second Reading.  There are various matters which must occur to one straight away about this subsection.  Under the subsection as it stands there is no time limit whatever imposed on the operation of the subsection.  A member of the Garda Síochána may, according to the subsection, arrest a person without warrant when he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>According to that subsection, an offence involving a breach of the peace which was committed at any time, maybe five or ten years ago, comes within the ambit of the subsection. There is no time limit whatever and it not only depends on an offence involving a breach of the peace having been committed at some time but even if a member of the Garda <Col N="2036" /> Síochána is satisfied that a person has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence, he may arrest that person without warrant.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes that if a Garda officer takes the view that at some time in the past a person engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of an offence involving a breach of the peace, the Garda officer should have power to arrest that person without warrant even though no offence involving a breach of the peace was in fact committed and even though the conduct complained of might have been engaged in 20 or 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the first complaint one has to make about the subsection as it appears in the Bill is that it is suggested that this very drastic power of arrest without warrant should be given to the gardaí without any time limit even though the circumstances may have been completely altered from the time when the offence was committed and even if there was no offence or if the conduct engaged in did not lead to an offence.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any way of dealing with a subsection such as that other than scrapping it entirely.  That is what I suggest should be done.  It is necessary, also, to operate the power of arrest, that the garda should have reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may be committed.  It might be suggested that some safeguard exists in paragraph (b) but who is to contradict a garda who states that he has reasonable grounds for believing what is contained in the paragraph, namely, that the person at one time engaged in conduct likely to lead to the commission of an offence, or, even though there was no offence committed, engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of an offence.  If he says: &ldquo;I saw that person who interrupted a public meeting 20 years ago attending another meeting at which the theme under discussion was `Boland must go&rdquo;' surely he can then say that the mere presence of the man at that meeting, when the conduct complained of in the <Col N="2037" /> past was interrupting a meeting, was likely to give rise to such an offence in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth at least is in agreement with me on one thing.  Before he came in I made that point.  Deputy Booth asked me if the case I had suggested of a person being guilty of disorderly conduct, or interrupting a public meeting, was a serious one.  Let me direct his attention to the Explanatory Memorandum that was issued with the Bill.  If he looks at paragraph 44 on page 7 he will find that it reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) supplements subsection (3), as regards breaches of the peace.  It relates to a situation <Col N="2038" /> where there is, at the time, no breach of the peace but where there has been one (or a threat of one) and there is a probability that there will be a further, and serious, one.  The situation envisaged is one where it was known that persons who had already been involved in a fight or scuffle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>a fight or a scuffle such as can very readily take place at a public meeting where enthusiasm goes a little beyond bounds.  Let me say, in case Deputy Booth takes me up on it, that this is not a quotation from the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>&mdash;would be likely to come across each other again at some particular time or place in the near future and to renew the fight on a serious scale.</P>
    <P>Surely Deputy Booth will appreciate that the example I gave of disorder at a public meeting is by no means stretching my imagination when one finds in the Explanatory Memorandum issued by the Minister in connection with the Bill that that particular situation is envisaged, where two people had been engaged in a scuffle and that they may meet again at some particular time or place and renew the fight on a more serious scale.</P>
    <P>For good or ill many of the scuffles that have taken place in this country have arisen because of differences of political opinion.  I do not think it is stretching the imagination to say that this section can be operated in the way I have suggested, that if a person at any time in the past&mdash;remember the important thing here and the really serious complaint against this subsection as it stands is that there is no time limit as to when the conduct was engaged in&mdash;engaged in conduct which might, even though it did not, have led to a breach of the peace and is likely to do so again he may be arrested without warrant.  I think this is not oversimplifying the meaning of the subsection.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment, which we are discussing with mine, is a distinction without a difference.  The Minister in his interjection claimed that his is merely a drafting amendment. I accept that.  In other words the substance, the meaning, the purport <Col N="2039" /> of the subsection as drafted is not intended to be changed at all by the Minister's amendment and consequently the objections&mdash;and there have been very real objections voiced to this subsection outside this House as well as inside it&mdash;will remain.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, and it is not stretching the meaning of the section too far, that this is the kind of section which may lead to a person being taken involuntarily into protective custody depending on the particular view that a garda may take at the time.  The only way to deal with this is to throw out the section in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment and very largely for the reasons advanced by Deputy O'Higgins though I wish to add one or two further of my own.</P>
      <P>I gather from the Explanatory Memorandum that the purpose of this section in this part of the Bill is in a sense to codify the existing powers of the Garda in reference to arresting with or without warrant.  I would be inclined to agree that codification is, perhaps, not technically correct, but that it is the intention to collect in this part of the Bill, and specifically state, what are the powers of the Garda in relation to arrests with or without warrant, leaving certain other powers still extant, such as statutory powers of arrest in relation to drunken driving and matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>In the Explanatory Memorandum this section is dealt with on page 5.  It is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with arrests without warrant by the Garda Síochána.  The powers of arrest it proposes to give are to replace both their existing common law and also some (but not all) of their statutory powers.  The intention is that the section should provide for all the Garda powers of arrest without warrant that are relevant to crime in general (including breaches of the peace and the like) or that are relevant to other provisions in the Bill (such as the provisions about offensive weapons), but it is not intended that these powers should supersede the powers of arrest given in particular <Col N="2040" /> statutes dealing with particular offences&mdash;for instance, drunken driving.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to deduce from that, that what the Minister wants is to have in this Bill a complete category of the powers of the Garda to arrest without warrant.  I also deduce&mdash;and I think I am correct in doing so&mdash;that the powers contained in the subsection we are now dealing with are new powers and that they do not exist at present.  In other words, he is creating new powers of arrest without warrant and, in doing so, he has not given to the House, so far, any reason why it is necessary for the Garda to have these new powers.  The only reference I can find on the Second Reading of this Bill is where he said:</P>
    <P>... we have set out not just to replace the existing provision whereby a person may be arrested on suspicion of having committed a felony, but to provide a comprehensive set of general rules governing arrest without warrant, ...</P>
    <P>We in this House are entitled to know what is the necessity for these new provisions for arrest without warrant.  I do not know what justification the Minister has for putting in these powers.  He made no case to justify their requirement.  He has not said that the Garda in the handling of crowds, or in dealing with demonstrations, or in dealing with the problems which they have to deal with at processions and demonstrations and matters of that kind, which are so common at present, are unable to deal with those matters effectively without these powers.</P>
    <P>The House should not be asked to give new powers of arrest without warrant without a complete case being made to justify the insertion in this Bill of these new proposals.  So far as I have been able to ascertain, the Minister has made no case for these provisions which would allow the House to judge and the country to determine what the reason is for the insertion of these clauses, other than what we all know happens when Departments are making proposals for legislation.  It is said: &ldquo;Let us put it in.  It may be no use.  We may never <Col N="2041" /> use it, but it is better if we have it.&rdquo;  I can find no other reason than that. These things are commonly suggested for insertion when Departments are giving instructions about the drafting of Bills.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister why these powers of arrest without warrant are now being inserted in the Bill.  What is the justification?  He has not told us why these new provisions are wanted.  This is a very drastic power.  Arrest without warrant down through the centuries was considered in criminal law a drastic power to give constabularies or police authorities.  If we are to do our duty in this House we cannot give any credence to these proposals unless the Minister can give us the reason why the Garda want them, and when they were not able to keep the peace or do their duty because they had not got these powers.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that apart from the reasons given by Deputy O'Higgins with which I agree, in spite of what Deputy Booth said&mdash;I think they are powerful reasons which could be taken into account&mdash; the real reason why I object is that no case has been made to the Dáil or the country justifying the insertion in this Bill of completely new powers.</P>
    <P>There are many other provisions of a drastic character in this Bill which have caused comment from various bodies.  There is no doubt that these new powers of arrest have caused perturbation among certain bodies who have taken upon themselves the voluntary task or duty of looking after the civil and constitutional rights and privileges of individual citizens.  The Minister probably will not agree.  He has gone to the extent of producing at public expense a pamphlet dealing with the Criminal Justice Bill and some of its critics.  I am not objecting to that. The Minister was probably right in doing it if he wanted to make his case &mdash;whether he made a good case is another matter.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which we must take into account in this House in considering proposals of this kind.  There has been created in the country a very widespread feeling of disquiet about the Bill.  It has been objected to by many bodies.  In the pamphlet the Minister <Col N="2042" /> referred to some of his critics.  He mentioned some and dealt with them.  He dealt with the Irish Association of Civil Liberties and the Citizens for Civil Liberties.  He dealt mostly with those two bodies, but there were others. There were the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council.  Recently a religious body took the unprecedented step of passing resolutions with regard to this proposed legislation.  I would suggest to the Minister that there is undoubtedly in existence in this country at present a strong public opinion against this Bill.  The Minister may disagree with the view put forward by these people.  He is entitled to. He is entitled to answer his critics, just as they have the right to make the criticisms. I would go so far as to say he is bound to answer them so far as he can do so.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that even if the Minister is right in everything he says in this pamphlet and in other documents circulated in connection with the Bill, and in his speech on Second Reading, he is bound, and we are bound as representatives of the public, to take account of this strong public feeling against the provisions in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister is convinced that these provisions are correct. Nevertheless, it is wrong for us, as representatives of the people in Parliament, to force something upon the people which is contrary to strong public opinion, and strong public opinion obviously prevails in bodies and amongst persons of repute that we are going too far in this Bill.  I think it is wrong for a Government, and it is certainly wrong for a Parliament, to run ahead in advance of public opinion, not merely without public opinion having been prepared for it but also without there being such a degree of necessity from the point of view of the public right.</P>
    <P>We should not go forward, in the face of such strong feeling among the public, with proposals which in themselves may be good and may be desirable but which are not essential at present.  This country has done without these specific provisions; the British people have done without them and many other peoples have done without them.  There has not <Col N="2043" /> been any suggestion that the gardaí cannot keep the peace and maintain public order and security without them.  Perhaps a strong case could be made for these provisions of arrest without warrant, but no case has been made for them.  In view of public uneasiness and disturbed feelings among people who genuinely hold these opinions the Minister would be well advised, and he would add to his reputation, if he said: &ldquo;These things are required.  I believe they are good, but in the face of public opinion, even though they are good, I do not think the country is ripe for them at the present time&rdquo; and he should withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still forgetting a very valid point which the Minister made in reply to his critics at page 6 of this booklet to which Deputy Costello has referred, that the arrest is not the beginning and end; the arrest is only the first step in a process of charging a person with an offence.  It seems to me that the Minister in his proposed amendment has clarified the position, but it does not appear to have changed the main principle.  The main principle is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum quite clearly to the effect that under the existing law this matter could be dealt with by a member of the Garda if he had a warrant, but the only difference proposed really is that he now may proceed without a warrant where it is not reasonably practicable to apply for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister's critics have got themselves worked up and got public opinion worked up to such an extent that everybody believes that this is now a most evil attempt by the Government to introduce widespread powers of arrest without warrant.  That is not a fact.  Supposing a situation arises such as Deputy O'Higgins has suggested and that a garda acts wrongly and irresponsibly, the case has to come to court and any garda who is caught out in this game of making arbitrary and unreasonable arrests will find himself in trouble with his superiors and may even find himself in trouble with the civil courts in a case for damages for wrongful arrest.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to make out that it is more fearful and more objectionable to be arrested without a warrant than with a warrant. I should not like to be arrested at all, but whether the garda has a warrant or has not a warrant would not make me appreciate his action any more or any less.  What we are trying to deal with here is a situation where there is an element of emergency, where there is likely to be a breach of the peace and where it is not reasonably practical for a garda to leave the scene and try to get a warrant.  However, if he acts irresponsibly he knows he will get &ldquo;the works&rdquo; himself.  I trust the gardaí, and even if I did not trust them they have enough of an eye on promotion to know that is not the way to get it.  We know members of the Garda are very reluctant to take action unless they know they have everything on their side.  They will not take any risks, so I think the Deputy is working himself into a quite unnecessary state of agitation which really pivots on the whole question: may the garda arrest with a warrant or without a warrant? That is the beginning and end of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know whether that will be any great protection to Deputy O'Higgins.  If the garda insists, then he will do it, and we are not taking away any protection.  We are, in fact, giving additional protection in that, in a moment of emergency in which it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant, a member of the Garda Síochána can act at once and take a trouble-maker into custody in order to preserve the peace. It is as simple as that.  All these highfalutin reasons in defence of a principle not at risk merely confuse the issue.</P>

I go further than Deputy Costello; I think the motive behind it is questionable and virtually dishonest.  It is no good saying there is limitation of time. Where is the limitation?  Where does the section stop the writ running?

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Three amendments are being discussed together. Our reason for imposing a limitation of 24 hours is the same as that advanced by other speakers in this debate.  The <Col N="2048" /> Minister refers to the six months limitation. Surely this is new law.  This will be written into the law, if this is passed, and therefore the whole question of limitation, if there is no limitation put in here, will arise immediately. I am sure the Minister would be the first to agree that if somebody is accused of doing something in breach of this measure, when it becomes law, it would be most unreasonable that such a person attending a perfectly peaceful meeting at a later stage should be arrested simply because a garda, to use the wording in the section, has reasonable grounds for believing that he is &ldquo;likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur&rdquo;.  In what way can he have reasonable grounds?  The previous subsection provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant where&mdash;</P>
      <P>he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence,</P>
      <P>This whole section is based on surmise and the unfortunate part of it is that it puts the gardaí in a very awkward position because they will be given powers, to use the Minister's words, in which they will use discretion. But it depends on who has the discretion.  The incidents that have occurred not so far away over the last few days show clearly what can happen if discretion is exercised by different people in different ways.  It is perfectly reasonable, I think, to suggest a 24-hour limit.  If the offence occurs within 24 hours it is likely to be a continuation of what the garda thought he saw previously.  If it does not then it cannot be held against the person and he should not be involved at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with some of the points raised by Deputy Booth.  In describing some of his arguments as nonsense I was not trying to be rude; I was merely expressing my view that the argument he was making was not in accordance with the <Col N="2049" /> section and it is the section we have to deal with here.  The point has been made, quite validly, by Deputy Collins and by other speakers, including myself, that there is no time limit imposed in this section.  The Minister, by way of interjection, referred to the time limit of six months in the case of summary offences.  That is quite irrelevant to the complaint being made.  We are not talking about the case in which an offence is committed and a garda brings a prosecution within six months. The complaint is in relation to paragraph (a) of subsection (4).  If the Minister and Deputy Booth study that paragraph they will see that the exercise of these powers of arrest, without warrant, does not depend on an offence actually having been committed at all.  Consequently this question of six months is simply not relevant to the argument at all.  It is set out here quite clearly that, if a garda is satisfied either that a person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or that he has engaged in conduct likely to lead to the commission of such an offence, he can arrest.  It is not necessary that an offence should have been committed at all.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point Deputy O'Malley is making but, with respect, I think he is wrong. It is a question of parsing this.  It is not if a person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace <Col N="2050" /> or has committed an offence involving conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  There are two separate things here.  The first is that he has committed an offence which involves a breach of the peace; that is one set of circumstances.  There is another and entirely different set of circumstances, a set of circumstances where no offence was committed but where conduct had been engaged in which was likely to lead to the commission of an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly that is so.  I accept the Minister's interpretation of that.  However, so far as the subsection here goes, there need not have been an offence involving a breach of the peace&mdash;will the Minister accept that?  Deputy O'Malley would not have heard the Minister, because he only nodded.  There need not be an offence involving a breach of the peace: that is quite clear.  These powers of arrest without warrant may be triggered into action if conduct had been engaged in that was likely to lead to the commission of an offence involving a breach of the peace&mdash;or likely at any time in the past.  There is no question of any time limit there.  If the action is triggered by an offence involving a breach of the peace, there is no time limit as to when that offence might have been committed.  That is the major complaint against this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth thinks the whole thing is very simple.  He has confidence in the courts.  He has confidence in the gardaí.  He thinks no garda will be foolish enough to get himself into trouble.  He thinks that, if a garda invokes this section wrongfully, or it is found afterwards by the courts that he acted wrongly, the garda will suffer a black mark and possibly fail to get promotion on that account.  With great <Col N="2051" /> respect to Deputy Booth, I think that that is simply not relevant to the argument here.  Our concern is the powers we shall give.  There is no question, to my mind, of a garda getting into trouble because what we are doing here is giving him the protection of this section.  Is it not a question of saying that the garda, if he had time to do it, would have been able to get a warrant?  It might be that a warrant would have been refused on the set of circumstances which the garda presents in seeking to issue a warrant.  Here, however, we are putting the garda in a position that he may take a hasty, spur of the moment, decision and we are giving him protection if he does that.  What can a court say to him, if it ever goes into court?  I disagree with Deputy Booth and I disagree with the Minister that this must necessarily end up in court.  I know the Minister has expressed a point of view&mdash;he expressed it in his reply to critics; he expressed it on an earlier section here &mdash;that an arrest is simply a step which must necessarily end up before the courts.  That may be the ordinary practice. That may be what is intended but that is not what is in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>If the Minister can satisfy me and the House that that is the law, then he wins that point in the argument, but he certainly does not win the argument under this section. Certainly, he does not command the confidence of the public in this section.  Certainly, he does not command the confidence of the Press in this section.  Certainly, he does not command the confidence of the various bodies which have taken the trouble to examine this Bill and have given their views in regard to this section. Only today, one of our daily newspapers commented editorially with regard to this Bill.  I think it would be <Col N="2052" /> worth the while of the Minister and Deputy Booth to listen to what it has to say and to apply it in the context of the discussion we are having on this section.  I shall not read all of it but it does say, in relation to the disturbances here yesterday:</P>
      <P>As might have been expected, the Criminal Justice Bill has not escaped the attention of that large section of the community who are campaigning for civil liberty in the North. About a dozen young people in the public gallery who were quick to seize their opportunity were directed to leave after they had demonstrated against the introduction of legislation &ldquo;such as the people in Derry are fighting against on the street.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the editorial comment goes on as follows:</P>
      <P>There is just enough truth in the accusation that parts of the Bill resemble the coercive Public Order Act in the North to deepen the doubts that are already felt in regard to its more obnoxious clauses.</P>
      <P>It continued:</P>
      <P>The activities of the British Army in the North, for instance, will inevitably focus attention on the provision in the Bill under which civil prisoners may be transferred to military custody.  This is a proposal which we have already criticised editorially and it has also come under fire from the Presbyterian Church, the Incorporated Law Society and other organisations whose views must be respected.</P>
      <P>Then, it concludes as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how many amendments may be made to the Criminal Justice Bill during its consideration by the Oireachtas, the fact remains that basically the liberty of the subject will be curtailed to some degree when it reaches the Statute Book. Considering that the 26 Counties of Ireland, at any rate, can claim to be one of the most peaceful and lawabiding States in the world it could be expected that any legislation dealing with the individual should be liberalising rather than repressive, <Col N="2053" /> the deletion of offences from the penal code rather than the defining of new ones.</P>

      <P>This is simply another straw in the wind.  Let us deal with the situation seriously.  This is one of the obnoxious sections in the Bill, one of the sections which the Minister should get rid of.  He should purge the Bill of sections such as this.  There are some good things in this Bill but the Bill has been soured by including sections such as this.  So long as the Minister and the Government, simply by counting heads in this House, insist on provisions such as the one we are discussing here, subsection (4) section 12, there is going to be no ready acceptance of the Bill by the people.  That is apparent and I would urge the Minister to reconsider his whole approach to this.  I accept without question that, even though the Minister only inherited this Bill, he believes the various provisions he is recommending are good and worthwhile provisions, but the point is that the Minister has not been able to convince the people of that.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is steamrolled through the House in its present form with subsection (4) of section 12 in it, and with the other objectionable provisions in it, it is going to be done by the majority vote of this House but it will clearly be without the majority wishes of the people.  I do not think that legislation, particularly criminal legislation, legislation dealing with individual rights and liberties, that is born in that kind of controversy and which is steamrolled through against the wishes of the majority of the people is going to find any acceptance by the people.  As sure as I am standing here, if this Bill is steamrolled through the House there is going to be a major surgical operation performed on it after the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to get my own amendment on the records. It is obvious that Deputy O'Higgins has swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the booklet issued by the Association of Civil Liberties notwithstanding all the misrepresentations and errors of fact that they have set out in that <Col N="2055" /> document on this section.  Therefore, it becomes necessary for me to deal with the matter point by point but first, in reply to those who ask &ldquo;What is the necessity for this section?&rdquo; the necessity is very simply stated.  The necessity is that the police have found themselves unable to intervene in the situation set out in paragraph 44 of the Explanatory Memorandum.  They know that a serious row is blowing up or about to blow up but their powers are inadequate because under existing law the earlier row had stopped and under existing law they cannot then interfere. It is to prevent the situation of leaving the police powerless, where a row has already taken place, and there is a danger of the same parties continuing this row in the immediate future, that these powers have been requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to the amendment which is really clarifying this section and spelling out the principles in clearer words, let us see what we have in subsection (4) instead of the misrepresentations made unwittingly by some people inside this House and I have no doubt made deliberately in some other instances.  It says that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant where (1) &ldquo;he is satisfied the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace&rdquo;&mdash;mark you, he has already committed an overt act, breaking the peace &mdash;&ldquo;or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission&rdquo; of a breach of the peace.  This, under existing law, is an offence.  In my time, and I am sure in Deputy Fitzpatrick's time, many a time and oft we had to defend people who were charged with this specific offence, that they did not get as far as the actual blows but they were on the very verge of it when they were prevented and it is an offence under the law.  Therefore, under this first leg of this subsection&mdash;and we are talking about arrest without warrant&mdash; the garda must be satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving actual breach of the peace, or has committed the offence of engaging in conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  In other words, he must have already committed an offence. Secondly, he has reasonable grounds <Col N="2056" /> for believing the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur.  They must have these two things; the individual has already committed an offence and, secondly, the garda must be satisfied that there is a grave danger of his committing a further offence.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the section says that &ldquo;it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant&rdquo;.  How anybody can seriously suggest, particularly legally trained men&mdash;unless they have their tongues in their cheeks&mdash;that a time lapse of God knows how long might apply under these provisions is beyond my comprehension.  Remember, he can only use his powers of arrest under this subsection without a warrant if&mdash;and this overrides these two other provisions&mdash;it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.  When a man like Deputy O'Higgins suggests that he might have applied for a warrant and that when the warrant was refused he proceeds to arrest, I am simply flabbergasted.  Deputy O'Higgins knows that, if a garda applied for a warrant under the section and was refused a warrant and proceeded to arrest a man, he would be paying damages for the rest of his life.  I could not imagine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a better case for false arrest than that.  He must get a warrant if he possibly can because this is the meaning of the section.  Unless there is an unreasonable delay he must go and get the warrant and if, having been refused, he arrests under this section&mdash;apart from the question of being dismissed from the force&mdash;he is certainly leaving himself open, if he is a mark for damages, to paying for the remainder of his life damages to the person he has arrested.  A garda officer under this section cannot arrest without a warrant if it is reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.  The whole purpose of the section, the purpose for which it is designed, is to enable the garda when blood is hot and when offences have been committed <Col N="2057" /> by a breach of the peace or fighting and the parties are liable to become involved immediately again, to have this power of arrest without warrant. It is not a question of waiting until they meet going to Mass the following Sunday morning or expecting them to cross each other's paths in five or six hours but it is a question of the danger of those who are involved in a breach of the peace clashing again without time for the garda to apply for a warrant.  If the suggestion is made seriously&mdash;I cannot accept that it is because I know the intelligence of some of those who make it, particularly Deputy O'Higgins, who spoke on this issue that there is no time limit, I must point out that time is the essence at the end of this subsection&mdash;whether the garda had time to go to the nearest commissioner and get a warrant or otherwise.  If he had time he is in trouble if he operates without a warrant.</P>
      <P>Let me come to the amendment. Deputy O'Higgins is correct in assuming that this amendment is essentially a drafting amendment designed to spell out more fully what is already implicit in the subsection as it stands in the Bill.  This subsection&mdash;I refer to the text as it stands in the Bill&mdash;has been seriously misinterpreted and I regret to say seriously misinterpreted by Deputy O'Higgins again today.  I stated this in my opening speech on the Second Reading and tried to give a brief explanation as to why this is so. When Deputy O'Higgins spoke he quoted my statement and said he could not quite follow it.  I noticed that in his quotation from my speech he stopped short exactly where the explanation began.  The essence of the criticism made of this section is that in so far as it refers to the past offence committed by the man arrested&mdash;that is to say, paragraph (a) of this subsection&mdash;it sets out no time limit so that according to the critics an alleged offence might have been committed 20 years earlier.  The same point has been made by Deputy O'Higgins today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second leg of the criticism is that paragraph (b) in referring to the likelihood that there may be a further breach of the peace involves preventive <Col N="2058" /> detention.  The critics further refer to the Explanatory Memorandum which said that what the subsection envisages is a situation where people have been involved in a row and a renewal of the row in the near future is envisaged.  They say there is nothing in the subsection about the near future. Might I now point out, with all due respect to those who have embarked on this type of criticism, that they have failed to appreciate the very meaning of an arrest in the context of the criminal law?  An arrest in the context in which we are speaking is a means, not the only possible means, but a means of securing the attendance of a person at court.  A person cannot be brought before a court simply on the basis that a garda suspects, however strongly, that he may be about to become involved in a row.  He can be brought only for the purpose of enabling the court to adjudicate on what he has already done.</P>

      <P>And it will be the position. In other words, the proceedings before the court must relate to paragraph (a) of the subsection because there is nothing in paragraph (b) to provide a basis for proceedings.  This immediately sets a limit of six months because we are speaking only of summary offences.  If indictable offences were in question there would be other powers of arrest on which the gardaí could rely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months is the limit from the time of commission of an alleged offence.  I am pointing out that that is the general law of the land.  It also applies to these summary offences because, if it were a serious offence, there are other powers of arrest which the gardaí could use.  However, there is no conceivable set of circumstances <Col N="2059" /> in which an arrest could lawfully be made under the subsection on the basis of something that had happened even as recently as six months earlier.  The reason is that as well as satisfying the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) the arresting garda must satisfy condition (c), namely, that he may arrest without warrant only if it is not practicable to apply for a warrant.  If the incident in relation to which the court proceedings occur took place six months or one month, or even a week previously, the arresting garda would, to say the least, have quite a task on his hands in satisfying the court that it was not practicable to apply for a warrant.  Likewise, if the expected resumption of the row was not something envisaged in the near future the garda obviously would have an opportunity to apply for a warrant and an arrest without a warrant would be illegal.</P>
      <P>Those who talk about time limits should realise that, paradoxically as it may seem to those who do not have occasion to apply the principle of practical situations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading, and interpolating as I go along, from my notes, as I am quite entitled to do.  I know that the truth is bitter to the Deputy. I know he wants to maintain the smokescreen that he and his Party have been hanging around this particular section.  We must get the truth through despite the stonewalling efforts of the Deputy who again misrepresents, even today, what is in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice the setting of a time limit would establish a presumption that anything inside that limit is acceptable. If people were asked to set a time limit in subsection (4) I doubt that many would suggest anything less than one week.  Those who have spoken of 20-year periods, including the Deputy, would presumably accept a week.  After all, it is quite a reduction.  In fact, under the section as drafted, it is clear that the time limit is likely to be expressed as a matter of hours rather <Col N="2060" /> than days and reference to months and years is quite absurd because there is the provision of subsection (c) in all instances, that in order to exercise his powers under this subsection of arrest without warrant it must not be reasonably practicable for the garda to get a warrant.</P>
    <P>I am not willing, therefore, to set a time limit for the reasons I have given. It would give an entirely wrong idea of the very limited scope of the subsection as it stands and would have the opposite effect to that claimed for it. However, I have said more than once that I am willing to make modifications in the text if they can be made without damaging the purpose of the provision and if they serve to reassure people who may be misled.  In fact, the amendment I am moving is an example of this.  It spells out more specifically what is clearly implicit&mdash;because it is part of the general law of the land&mdash; that an arrest under the subsection is permissible only when made with a view to bringing a charge for an offence under paragraph (a).  The opportunity is being taken to reverse the order of paragraphs (b) and (c).  This is purely a matter of drafting and presentation.</P>
    <P>If the House approves of this amendment I think it would be desirable for purposes of consistency to introduce another somewhat similar amendment to subsection (5) because that subsection, too, has implicit in it the idea that the arrested person must have committed a specific offence with which he can be charged.  I mention this matter so that an amendment on the Report Stage may be in order.  It is quite obvious&mdash;I suppose I cannot repeat this too often&mdash;that a person cannot be prosecuted unless the police can allege an offence as a basis for a charge and he cannot be arrested unless the police can charge him.  That is the legal meaning of arrest.</P>
    <P>We cannot read this section or, indeed, any other section of this Bill except in the broad context of the rest of the criminal law.  These people who have tried to misrepresent what is in this particular section have their full answer in the point made by Deputy John A.  Costello when he said that, even if this is so, even if this misrepresentation has gone on, even if what I <Col N="2061" /> am saying is perfectly right in every particular, again we should get away from this because certain sections, rightly or wrongly, are dubious or dissatisfied with it.  Surely the basis of this whole business is this: Are we to get away from these necessary provisions because some people have been sold the idea that this section of the Bill contains something that is not, in fact, there at all?  Are we to go on this phoney basis that some people were told that people could be held under this subsection in protective custody for all time?  Are we to approach this Bill on this completely erroneous basis which has been put forward by some of the critics of the Bill?  It is quite clear that some of the critics of the Bill are not legal experts in the sense that they do not know what the existing law is or that otherwise they have been misled and I agree that many people have been misled about what is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The essence of subsection (4) is that it is a power that is necessary for a garda where a row has started.  It gives him the power to stop that row escalating.  This is the purpose of this section.  It gives the power that is essential for the preservation of public order. It is a power under which a person cannot be arrested without a warrant if a warrant is immediately available.  It is a power that can be used only in the very limited circumstances of where blood is up and where a breach of the peace has already been committed with a grave danger of the row turning into something where, perhaps, skulls might be cracked.</P>
    <P>That is what is in this particular section and not what these outside critics are saying.  I am sure that all reasonable Deputies, if they understand this, will fully support the limited power that is being given here for an arrest without warrant in the circumstances which I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a great argument for our amendment because he has repeated, again and again, the question of this being necessary to prevent a breach of the peace occurring while blood is up. Perhaps the Minister knows of cases where the blood stays up for a long <Col N="2062" /> time but, generally, when one talks of something like that, it means that a row or an argument has occurred and that within a number of hours the people meet again under the circumstances which caused the row.</P>
      <P>If that is so, surely our amendment which says &ldquo;within the previous 24 hours&rdquo; should be sufficient because the Minister has repeatedly mentioned the fact that this was not a question of months or weeks or even of days.  He is talking about hours and if he is prepared to accept that point I am very much in favour of giving the gardaí whatever authority they require to keep law and order.  I am not a legal expert but I will have to explain to those whom I represent what, in effect, is meant by this.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of giving gardaí or anybody else the right to arrest somebody just because they do not like the colour of the tie he is wearing or for some such reason.  It appears to me that this is the sort of power that the Minister is anxious to give in the Bill and what he says about those both inside and outside the House who are criticising the Bill does not alter the fact that the Minister himself says he requires the authority only for the purpose of preventing a recurrence, where a breach of the peace has been threatened or has occurred and where, while the blood is up, another row may start.  We have an amendment down which says that this must be within 24 hours of the original occurrence and I would suggest that that being so, there is no reason why the Minister should not accept our amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a measure which was not rushed through the Department of Justice.  It is a measure which must have got a considerable amount of consideration from the Department, from the former Minister for Justice, from the Government and from the present Minister for Justice.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> No, Sir, I do not.  The Bill was printed as a result of a Motion passed by this House on the 22nd June, 1967.  It appeared about 12 months later and the Committee Stage is now being taken almost 12 months later again.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all that delay, and considering it has been necessary for the Minister to recast subsection (4) of section 12 and to withdraw completely sections 30 and 31, it appears to me that the public criticism of this Bill is well founded.  It is not reasonable for the Minister to say that the people who criticised section 12 and who say that they are worried about it, are doing so lightly.  They are not doing so lightly and the Minister and the Government have so conceded by introducing this amendment to try to retract entirely subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12, with which we are dealing, confers power of arrest without warrant.  I wish to join with the other speakers who have said that there is a dangerous trend in legislation in recent years to give too much unnecessary power to the Government and to the gardaí.  When the Road Traffic Bill was going through this House it contained a section enabling the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant for dangerous parking.  In my opinion the power of arrest without warrant should only be conferred for grave reasons and where it is absolutely necessary to deal with an emergency.  It is obvious that unless there is an existing emergency which can only be dealt with by immediate arrest the power to arrest without warrant should never be conferred. The power of arrest without warrant would, I submit, be necessary if a serious offence is being committed and would be likely to continue if the criminal engaged in it were not immediately arrested.  It would also be reasonable to confer the power of <Col N="2064" /> arrest without warrant if an offence had been committed and if the person who committed the offence were likely to escape if he were not arrested there and then.  Those are the type of cases in which power to arrest without warrant is necessary and in which it should be conferred.</P>
    <P>Let us look at subsection (4) of section 12 as redrafted by the Minister.  It will now read:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where&mdash;</P>
    <P>he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace or conduct that was likely to lead to a breach of the peace,</P>
    <P>I want to say that I believe that under that section the breach of the peace or the conduct likely to lead to the breach of the peace could have been committed 20 years ago.  That is my interpretation. I know the Minister has another interpretation.  He says that it must have been committed within the previous six months.  For the purpose of this argument let us concede that the Minister's interpretation is correct, but I do not agree that it is, and suppose that the breach of the peace or the conduct calculated to lead to a breach of the peace has been committed five months ago or five months and 29 days ago.  What is the urgency? Where is the emergency?  Has the thing not gone stale?</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say under the redrafted subsection in paragraph (c):</P>
    <P>...he has reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not promptly charged with the offence aforesaid, the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur.</P>
    <P>That subsection (c) is open to the construction that, if the garda believes that this breach of the peace is likely to take place in six months or less or more, he may effect the arrest without warrant.  I know the Minister has a different interpretation of the section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has another interpretation. He said in his statement a few minutes ago that it means if the person is going to commit the offence in the immediate future.  In section 44 of his Explanatory Memorandum he says &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;.  I want to ask the Minister, in dealing with a serious matter like this, what is the objection to writing &ldquo;the immediate future&rdquo; or &ldquo;the near future&rdquo; into the subsection? What is the objection to that?  This is open to argument.</P>
      <P>We lawyers&mdash;and the Minister is a lawyer&mdash;are accused very often of indulging in tedious and expensive arguments in the courts to define sections of Acts of Parliament.  That sometimes happens but, if it does, it happens because doubtful, sloppy sections of Acts of Parliament are churned out of this House and sent on to the executive authority to implement, and then there is an argument about them. Why not write into this subsection now &ldquo;in the immediate future&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; and do not leave it open to argument?  The civil servants and the parliamentary draftsman and the Minister, because he must take responsibility for this, seem to like to leave things as loose as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested from the other side of the House that the arrest is only the beginning of this and that it must end up in court.  A person could be detained in prison for at least seven days without any real court case taking place because he could be brought before a peace commissioner and, if the Garda authorities asked for a remand in custody, a remand in custody would be granted as a matter of form.  That person would have been deprived of his liberty for seven days. I think, but I speak subject to correction, that the man might never be charged with any offence.  He could be arrested under this subsection, as amended; he could be brought to a Garda station, and he could be detained there for whatever the statutory number of hours is&mdash;12 or 24.  He must be charged within a certain time but <Col N="2066" /> he could be detained for a certain time and released without a charge.</P>

Of that there is no doubt.  I believe that he could be detained in custody for the statutory number of hours and released without any charge being preferred against him.  I hope that, if that is not so, the Minister will be able to put it beyond doubt because that would be an outrageous situation.</P>
      <P>Even if the Minister is able to convince the House that that proposition is not well founded, it is equally objectionable that a person should be arrested under this very doubtful subsection and charged and then brought before a peace commissioner and remanded for seven days before he is brought before a court.  I believe that this subsection, as it stands, is a subsection that could very well be used by a member of the Garda Síochána if he wanted to cover up a wrongful arrest. It could be used in defence of an arrest which was in fact wrongful, and which otherwise could not be justified.  That could arise where a person who had been guilty of a breach of the peace, or conduct leading to a breach of the peace, in the past, was arrested by a member of the Garda on the spur of the moment, and in the heat of the moment, for some other offence which had nothing at all got to do with it, and if the garda were then driven to justify this wrongful arrest he could invoke subsection (4).  I am not saying that would happen frequently or that there are many such members of the Force, but it could happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was speaking briefly on the dental services, and I was making the point that we, in Mayo, had quite a good service, and a good county dental officer, but that there was a need for the appointment of two or three more dental surgeons. I was stressing the importance of trying to recruit dental surgeons who were trained and educated in this country and who have emigrated to England and America.  Many from my own county have gone away.  It is generally appreciated that in many counties there is a shortage of dental officers.  I am aware that that is the position in Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shortage of dental surgeons is a very serious matter.  Dental health has much to do with general health.  I know of many instances where people from Mayo have occupied beds in Dublin hospitals for long periods, due to the fact that they needed dental attention before they could receive surgical treatment.  That applied particularly in relation to hospitals like the Meath Hospital, Jervis Street Hospital and others.  If these people had received dental care at the proper time they would not have had to occupy these beds.  The improvement of the dental service is of vital importance to the health of the community.  I <Col N="2068" /> am afraid it is a matter which has been overlooked by successive Ministers for Health.  It is a pity that that should be so.</P>
    <P>The school dental service in many counties is far from being of the standard we would all desire.  The schools are the places where the problem should be tackled.  The proper care of children's teeth is important from a health point of view.  I appeal to the Minister to have serious regard to this matter and to endeavour to recruit dentists, and to get dentists who have emigrated to return to the country. The only way to induce them to come back is to offer attractive conditions and salary scales.</P>
    <P>The ophthalmic service is not what is should be, either.  The Minister must be aware that in County Mayo there is a shortage of qualified staff for this service.  At least one man who was engaged in this work threw in the sponge, so to speak, because he got fed up with the accommodation and facilities available to him.  Indeed, I admire the man for doing so.  No doubt, the Minister knows the person I am speaking about, but I do not want to mention his name here.  He was expected to carry out his work in conditions which were wholly unsuitable. One of the areas concerned is the Minister's home town of Ballyhaunis. The accommodation and facilities were not suitable.  It is unreasonable to expect a qualified man who has a serious sense of responsibility to his patients, as this man has&mdash;he is a distinguished member of his profession&mdash;to carry out his work under the conditions obtaining. That is another matter I would ask the Minister to examine.</P>
    <P>Last night I made a general reference to waste in the matter of requisitioning and distributing medicines and drugs.  I want to add to what I said last night because, while I was very critical of the system that operates, perhaps I failed to make any suggestion to the Minister which he might consider and which might help to solve the problem.  We all know that at present some official, having no medical or surgical qualifications&mdash;in other words, a layman; perhaps a welleducated man&mdash;is responsible for ordering drugs.  His decisions as to the <Col N="2069" /> types of drugs required, the quantity, and the specification of drugs and medicines are, in my opinion, based on guesswork.  I have no doubt that high-powered salesmen representing pharmaceutical groups in this country, and perhaps outside it, come down the country and dispose of their wares.  As I said last night, many of these drugs and medicines may be out of date or may not be in use at all now by the medical profession.  The system needs radical alteration.</P>
    <P>Our general practitioners, dispensary doctors and others who have the necessary experience and skill are the people best qualified to order medicines and drugs.  It is not necessary to have a situation in which a van or a truck will unload at dispensaries tablets, bottles of medicines <i>et cetera</i> that may not be suitable at all.  The proper approach would be to allow the doctors to requisition the drugs and medicines they require.  If a doctor were in a position to order so many dozen of this and so many dozen of that, according to his requirements, there would be a substantial saving and the colossal waste that is involved in supplying medicines and drugs would be obviated.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill was subject to strong criticism by Deputy Michael Pat Murphy of the Labour Party, and I join him in that criticism. My personal opinion is that this Bill was prepared not by the Minister himself but by certain elements in the Fianna Fáil Party.  No doubt the draftsmen were given the bones of the thing, but it was prepared not by the Minister himself but by Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, I make the same point as Deputy Michael Pat Murphy made, that is, that there is collective responsibility in these matters.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I think he is the type of man who would like to introduce a Bill here, listen to constructive criticism and be prepared to accept certain amendments to it if he thought it was in the best <Col N="2070" /> interest of the country.  There are many Members of this House who have experience of local authority administration in regard to hospitals.  They have engaged in discussions with their county managers at county council meetings and have had discussions with the medical profession.  I have had that experience, and when I see the Minister introducing a Bill like this it creates the strong impression in my mind that it is not his production at all, despite the fact that he is nominally responsible for piloting it through the House. The people who have been elected to county councils, who live among the people and who are members of different political Parties are the people best equipped to judge what is best for the health of our community.  Great credit is due to members of councils who, without fee or reward, for many years have helped to build the present services which are available in district, voluntary and county hospitals.  They have done this work in co-operation with nuns, clerical workers and other lay people.</P>
      <P>The Minister's stamp is not on this Bill.  He is not the type of man who would like to kick local public representatives around but he is definitely going to do that if this Bill goes through the Oireachtas.  He is throwing out the people who have been elected as representatives in their respective areas by different classes of people, and he is appointing health boards composed of what I might call faceless men.  I have no doubt that, with the pressure that will be brought to bear on the Minister, certain people will be appointed to these boards because of their political leanings and because of what they have done for the Fianna Fáil Party.  The appointments will be given to them as a sign that they are respected by the Fianna Fáil organisation.  They will be given to them as a sop, as a compensation for their services to the Party.</P>

      <P>Knowing the Minister's form I cannot imagine him coming into this House of his own volition and recommending this as a suitable measure to our people.  If the Minister says he is responsible for it himself, then let him take responsibility for it; but let him know this, that the people not alone in his own county of Mayo but throughout the length and breadth of Ireland will be sadly disappointed when they discover that the people they elected are no longer considered competent by the present Minister and by the Government to continue the work they have so nobly carried on for so many years without either fee or reward.  Members of this House get their cheques, but the majority of the members of local councils have no income of any kind from any public sources.  They leave their farms, their businesses, their professions and serve late and early in the interests of the people.  If the Minister says he is prepared to take responsibility for bringing in this measure and recommending it to the people, then he is a different man from the man I thought he was and I am very disappointed in him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill, on the draftsmanship of the Bill and on the flexibility shown in the Bill.  I agree with the Government's proposition that the State has not the duty to provide unconditionally all medical, surgical, specialist, dental, ophthalmic and other services for everybody, irrespective of circumstances. The State has not the duty to provide medical services for the better-off sections of our community and the money saved by not providing services for these sections should be devoted to improving the services for the needier sections in our community.  I agree that an insurance scheme would not work.  In order to get sufficient revenue from such a scheme one would need to spread one's net very widely indeed.  I am afraid that the bulk of the revenue would be collected from the workers <Col N="2072" /> and the small farmers.  I cannot see the sense in collecting insurance contributions from these in order to provide a health service for those better off.  Already between 80 and 90 per cent of the community are eligible for hospital and specialist services; about 30 per cent are eligible for the general medical practitioner service.  We know only too well what it costs to provide these services.  The Minister has told us that in 1965-66 it cost about £33 million to run the health services. The cost today is in the region of £51 million.  If we were to make all the services available to all, or if we were to extend the general medical practitioner service to the middle income group, an additional £20 million a year would be involved.  That is a sizeable sum and we must ask ourselves can we &mdash; the ratepayer, on the one hand, and the taxpayer on the other &mdash; afford to pay the additional sum required to extend the existing services to the better-off sections of our community?  I do not think we can.</P>
      <P>One of the notable features of this Bill is the provision of a choice of doctor in the lower income group. Many people say that they will not have a choice of doctor because the areas in which they live are too remote from the larger centres of population. I see no reason why the powers given in section 56 could not be utilised for the purpose of amalgamating dispensary districts and providing group practices.  This could be done.  It would be a solution to the problem in the remoter areas.  Provision could be made for group practices.  I have no doubt but that with a bit of goodwill it should be possible to work out a solution with the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another notable feature is the change with regard to eligibility for the various services.  Up to now we know that the means of an applicant for general medical services were calculated on the household income and family circumstances.  The incomes of children who were earning were taken into account.  This often deprived a person of a medical card. We all know that members of the family who work pay a weekly contribution towards the upkeep of the household.  It is very hard to expect <Col N="2073" /> these people, many of whom are saving to get married, to provide medical services for their parents.  The Minister has gone the whole way in solving that particular type of problem. This change will mean a substantial increase in the number of medical card holders, but the money spent will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Again, for the first time, it is now proposed to give real power to the proposed health boards to provide drugs and medicines for those in the middle income group who cannot afford to pay for these over a lengthy period. Many health authorities have been very dubious about their powers in this regard.  Some were very strict in the application of the authority given to them.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the figure of £2 per month as an appropriate figure when deciding as to whether or not a contribution should be made towards the cost of providing expensive drugs and medicines for a person in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>I must say I agree entirely with the proposal to set up regional boards for the administration of the health services. This is something I have been very much in favour of for a long time. When the regional boards are set up, we shall have uniformity in many fields.  We shall have a degree of uniformity in the standards applied in the consideration of applications for the various services.  We shall have, I would hope, a more efficient service, as well.  Again, I feel that, with the setting up of the regional boards, we shall take politics out of the operation of the local health services, which is a very desirable development.</P>
    <P>It will be very interesting to see how these regional boards develop as regards areas and boundaries.  I feel it will be particularly interesting in Munster where we already have three health authorities &mdash; the Limerick, Cork and Waterford Health Authorities &mdash; and it will be very interesting to note what becomes of County Kerry.  There have been suggestions within the county that it could well happen that North and West Kerry will be dovetailed with the Limerick Health Authority and that South and East Kerry will find themselves with the <Col N="2074" /> Cork Health Authority.  There is a great deal to be said against splitting a county.  It would be very hard on the local representatives, particularly on those who would represent people in different regions.  Again, it may be difficult for the Minister to decide as to how the county should contribute towards the cost of these regions when the county is split in two.</P>
    <P>A very good case could be made for a region in Kerry even though every county, in its own way, can put up a case.  Having regard to its population, to its remoteness from Limerick and Cork, having regard to the fact, in particular, that we shall have a new general hospital in Tralee, which is being recommended in the Fitzgerald Report, and having regard to the fact that probably in Cork there is already the ideal size of region as far as area and population is concerned and, again, probably, that the Limerick region may be overcrowded should other areas be added to it, I suggest that the Minister give very special attention to a region in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>I like the idea of a chief executive officer working in co-operation with the members of the regional board. This will be a very interesting development. Some people seem to think that these executive officers will be doctors but I cannot see how that will happen. Surely the primary qualification for a chief executive officer is that he should have vast experience in the field of administration?  Of course, on the other hand, if there is an able administrator who is a qualified medical practitioner, there is no reason why, on merit, he could not become a chief executive officer.  I see no reason at all why that would not be so.  I think the primary qualification however should be in the field of administration.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the basis for contributions by local authorities to the regional boards &mdash; whether it will be based on valuation or whether it will be based on population.  There is a great deal to be said for basing contributions on population.  It would be something new in the field of local administration and I think the Minister should look into this matter.  As far as the constitution of the regional <Col N="2075" /> boards is concerned, I should like to know whether it is proposed to give representation to urban district councils on these boards.  It can be argued of course that the urban districts have representation on the county councils and that county council members on the regional boards can see after the interests of the people in their own urban districts and that it would be their duty to do so.</P>
    <P>The Fitzgerald Report, which, I understand, has been accepted by the Government, will, in years to come, form a very important part of the administration of the health services in this country.  I am very much in favour of this report.  We must remember that the costs of hospital services and specialist services are by far the largest element in the cost of the health service as a whole today and that, if we are to provide an efficient service, we must look first to the hospital service and the specialist service for efficiency.  We should be guided very much by the Fitzgerald Report in the provision of an efficient service.  The day has come when the needy man should be able to go to an eminent specialist, if necessary, just the same as a wealthy man.  The only way this can be done is by more centralisation of our specialist services; and this in turn can be made possible by more centralisation of our hospital services. I do not agree with the principle of holding specialist services on a session basis, as has been the position up to now.  It is time-consuming for a specialist to have to travel 70 miles to a clinic or, as some specialists are doing at the present time, to travel up to 200 miles to clinics and back again. If these specialists were living within the regions or were attached to the hospitals or clinics, this would go a long way towards providing the type of specialist service to which the lower income group is entitled.</P>
    <P>The functions of the board, their executive functions and their reserved functions, <i>versus</i> the chief executive officer, are pretty well defined.  The public are fairly well protected by the fact that at least half of the members of the board will be local councillors. <Col N="2076" /> This is a very effective safeguard but I would appeal to the Minister to give these elected representatives a slight majority on the board.  It is very important in any democratic society to make sure that the public interest is safeguarded. Before the regional boards are set up the Minister shall consult with the relevant local authorities.  This will be a very interesting exercise and will probably be well worthwhile but my opinion is that the Minister will have a very difficult job because most counties will be making a case for a region of their own.</P>
    <P>In section 6 it is proposed to bring within the ambit of the health services certain services the expenditure on which hitherto did not rank for recoupment under the Health Acts, such as the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1952, the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1936 and the Blind Persons Act, 1920.  It is also proposed that the local councils should operate the home assistance schemes. I welcome the provision that the Minister will appoint the chairman and vice-chairman of the regional boards. It is vital to have proper and suitable people for these positions, people who should work in close harmony with the chief executive officer.  These men or women will have a vital role to play if these boards are to be a success.  It is only right that the Minister should ensure that the proper people are appointed.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for introducing something new in the field of local administration as far as the appointment of officers and servants of the health boards is concerned. I welcome the provision under section 13 whereby an officer may arrange for his duties to be performed for a specified period by a deputy, with the consent of the Minister or the chief executive officer.  As far as I am aware, under existing local government law, only professional people, such as district medical officers, are entitled to nominate deputies to perform their duties.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a very good idea to empower the chief executive officer to suspend an officer or servant of the board, under certain circumstances and for a period not longer than one <Col N="2077" /> month.  Up to now county managers, being human, were slow to suspend officers because it could take up to six months before the officer could be reinstated, or knew where he stood, because his suspension could be lifted only by the Minister.  It gives the chief executive officer more control over officers and servants if the chief executive officer can take disciplinary action by suspending for one or two weeks without having to refer the matter to the Minister.  There is a built-in safeguard for the officer too, because in certain circumstances the board may appoint a committee to hear his case and, if necessary, may recommend his reinstatement.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for departing from normal procedure as far as the control of officers and servants is concerned. This flexibility will mean more harmonious relationships and, at the same time, obviously, more efficient service.</P>
    <P>Under section 30 of the Bill expenditure by a health board is limited in that the board may not, without the Minister's consent, incur expenditure for any service over and above what is originally provided for in their estimates. Up to now local authorities, particularly county councils, operating the health services could, under section 11 of the City and County Management Act, 1955, by resolution, authorise additional expenditure in respect of any service.  The pity of it is that the impact of such resolutions is not felt until the following estimates meeting when the authorities must make arrangements to pay bills which had accrued over the previous year but which had not been provided for in the previous estimates.  Under section 30 there will be more control of expenditure and the health boards will probably be more realistic in estimating their expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give special consideration to health staffs who will be transferred from county councils to regional boards.  I know he will do that.  Many of these people will have personal problems in their own areas and any case made by them for the retention of their services in the local councils should get special consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The Bill proposes that the Minister shall, by regulation, specify a class or classes of persons who shall be eligible for general medical practitioner services. This will be difficult for a number of reasons but mainly because of the varying economic conditions throughout the midlands.  The Minister will find it difficult to make regulations which will suit the agricultural community in the west, and the east.  He will find it difficult to make regulations suitable for urban areas which will also suit country towns and villages.  But, at least, when these regulations are made there will be more uniformity in the application of services than there is at present where there are different standards not only in different counties but even within the same county and within the assistance districts of the same county.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give special consideration to cases where medical card-holders are admitted in emergencies to private nursing homes. Kerry County Council have experienced great difficulty in many cases where medical card-holders came to them after a period in a nursing home, and produced bills and asked the local authority to make a substantial contribution, far in excess of that laid down by law and regulation.  Some positive direction should be given to health authorities in this matter.  Where a person is admitted in an emergency to a private nursing home and where this is certified by a doctor the health authority should be empowered to pay the full cost of treatment in the nursing home and to treat the case as if the patient had been sent by the doctor to a general hospital as happens under section 15 of the Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if it is wise to continue making a charge of 10/- per day in the case of the middle income group.  Some health authorities have more bad debts <Col N="2079" /> than money collected on the paying patients' register.  It would be interesting to calculate the cost of collection in order to see whether there is a credit or a debit balance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for an appeal against a refusal by a health authority of a medical card.  Up to now there was no appeal.  Whether the appeal should be to the Minister or to an appeals officer is a matter of opinion.  There will be so many appeals that it will be impossible for the Minister to determine all of them and for that reason I agree with the idea of an appeals officer.  We would be only &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves if we provided that the appeal should be to the Minister in each case: it should be to an appeals officer.  Whether this officer should be appointed by the Minister or by the board is also a matter of opinion.  I think it is more desirable that he should be appointed by the Minister as in that case he would probably have more independence than if he were appointed by the board.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of mother and child services I should like to know what can be done in cases where the medical profession in a town decide they will not operate the scheme, as has happened in one town in Kerry.  Strangely enough, we have had no complaints from the public in that town.  I am told that the doctors charge no more than they would have got from the health authority had they entered into an agreement with the health authority to provide a service. We should look into this matter The Minister will probably be able to sort it out with the medical associations.</P>
    <P>I believe that home nursing and the home help service are the best means of keeping elderly persons out of hospitals and institutions.  Therefore, I should like to see more public health nurses being appointed with responsibility for providing these services. Again, these services should get the backing of the local representatives and the local representatives should, in many cases, take the lead in the administration of home nursing and the home help service.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a little more <Col N="2080" /> attention being given to the rehabilitation service.  I know that the Minister and his Department are doing their best, but perhaps more could be done at a lower level for this service.  I know of a number of cases of slightly retarded persons in my own county who have difficulty in obtaining employment. The health boards should have placement officers whose sole function would be to arrange for rehabilitation and for the placement of the persons in employment afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed under the Bill that, in cases of disabled persons who apply for disabled persons maintenance allowances, only the income of the applicant should be taken into account.  That is a great step forward. I have come across numerous cases in my own county where persons were refused this allowance because they lived with a married brother who was in good circumstances or because some member of the family was in fair circumstances. We know, of course, that the provision of this service will mean a considerable increase in cost, but this will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like again to thank the Minister and his Department for the manner in which this Bill was prepared and brought into the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We missed a great opportunity in introducing this Health Bill.  This Bill should have been a charter for the general practitioners of Ireland but, instead of that, we are about to make the catastrophic mistake of modelling our whole health system on the welfare state of Great Britain and on Medicare and the allied health services of the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the Minister's difficulty. Owing to the familiarity of our people with the kind of medical services that obtain in Great Britain and the USA, there may have been a very high degree of expectation that our public health service should follow on the lines of those countries.  That is where I think we have gone wrong.  We could have shown the world and I say &ldquo;the world&rdquo; quite deliberately, an example of how to run a satisfactory and effective health service.  I believe that, had <Col N="2081" /> we had the courage to do so, countries like Great Britain and the USA &mdash; who, in my opinion, are getting themselves into an inestimable sea of sorrow on the road they are travelling &mdash; might well have drawn back and said &ldquo;Let us do what Ireland is doing and see if perhaps they have not found the right answer to the problem which threatens to overwhelm us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The USA, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, have extended their Medicare service, as they call it, to include those whom they euphemistically describe as senior citizens &mdash; persons of 65 years and older. They are further burdening a Treasury which is already overburdened and practically crippled.  Now they are talking of cutting down on their foreign commitments in order to meet the overwhelming burden of providing a comprehensive health service for that section of their community of 65 years and over before they make any effective impact on the health problem of the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>The original estimate for the health service in Great Britain has already been exceeded by 300 per cent and is steadily rising to a point at which the British Exchequer itself is almost at the limit of its resources.  We might not mind that if those who are familiar with the services provided had it to tell that everything ordinary people could reasonably seek has at last been made available, but the very reverse is true. The British health services are in a state of chaotic confusion.  There is a pretence that the services are universally available.  They are not universally available, and neither is it true that what is available is in any sense adequate or effective.  There is a story <i>non e vero ben trovata</i> told of the British medical services which describes the case of a lady who applied for admission to a gynaecological hospital for an urgent gynaecological operation and being told that she must wait as the hospitals were overtaxed.  Three years later she got a telegram to say that a bed was now available, by which time, in the ordinary course of nature, the lady had recovered and she thanked God that a bed had not been available when she applied because, if it had been, it <Col N="2082" /> was likely that half of her inside would have been taken out.  But then, of course, there are others, the others who were correctly diagnosed as needing hospital care in order to deliver them from chronic ill-health but who are not able to get it or who, when they did get it, found the hospital to which they were admitted grossly understaffed. It is common knowledge that, but for the fact they had a considerable immigrant medical population in Britain, a high percentage of the general hospitals in Britain would have to close down.</P>
    <P>This all arises, in my suggestion, from the wholly illusory approach that the State should accept responsibility for everyone who is smitten with anything from a cold in his head to terminal cancer.  There is a horrible by-product of that approach to the public health problem.  It is that nobody now who does not describe himself as a specialist is regarded in the true sense as a doctor at all.  I would have hoped that we in Ireland would have detected the profound error of that whole approach and that we would have said to our people: &ldquo;Your doctor is the family doctor.  Bring your troubles to him.  We guarantee to you that, through the resources of the State, we will deploy behind the family doctor all the hospital requirements that he, in his experience, may consider it necessary to mobilise for the protection of your health.&rdquo;  I would have hoped that we would have said to the average member of the public: &ldquo;Forget the hospital.  Your man and the protector of your health is your family doctor.  And when we say `your family doctor' we mean your family doctor, not the doctor we choose to impose upon you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know it is part of the Minister's intention to provide, in so far as it is practicably possible, that there shall be a choice of doctor freely available under this Bill; but there is then going to be the endless struggle and battle between the Minister and the individual practitioners as to what the appropriate charges are to be.  What I do not understand is why he could not have approached this problem on a wholly different basis, and, taking example from the eminently successful <Col N="2083" /> principle of the Voluntary Health Insurance, why he should not have set up an insurance fund into which every individual citizen would pay an annual premium.  Where an individual is not financially circumstanced to pay that premium, then let the State pay the premium for him.  Then declare that any individual citizen consulting his own physician was insured against costs up to a certain limit as prescribed under the new Health Insurance system and that anything over and above that he choose to incur would be his own liability, leaving it to the general practitioner to deal directly with the patient.  You might get general practitioners who wanted to charge a fancy fee.  Very well then, let those who are prepared to pay a fancy fee go and consult them and pay out of their own pockets the difference between the fancy fee and the standard fee.  If that is what they want to spend their money on, let them go and spend their money on it.  That would limit the charge falling upon the Exchequer and avoid the detestable task which confronts the Minister of trying to cost every visit and cost every service the general practitioner provides for his patient.  That would leave to the individual patient the widest possible discretion to incur whatever medical costs he or she chose to incur at the general practitioner level, and would put an end to the wholly obnoxious belief&mdash;I regret to see it growing not only here but in every other country in the world&mdash;that the general practitioner is a kind of inferior doctor.</P>
    <P>I have been a long time in this world and I want to say with great deliberation that the general practitioner in a properly organised health service is the most important element in it. We are all familiar with the progress of science, which has been summarised as people knowing more and more about less and less.  You can get a degree of specialisation building up in the science of medicine to the point at which if you go to one practitioner of high distinction in one particular branch of medicine, whether you have a pain in your toe or a lump on your head, he will determine that it is due to cardiac malfunction, if that is his <Col N="2084" /> particular line of country.  Then you can go around the corner to another specialist of the highest distinction who will tell you &ldquo;Kidney malfunction is at the root of your trouble, my dear friend.  Place yourself in my hands and the lump will disappear.&rdquo;  Both men speak in perfectly good faith.  Both are men of the highest distinction in their own particular sphere.  But both of them have become so immersed in one particular sphere of therapeutics that their whole instinct is to relate the syndrome presented to them to the speciality in which they are primarily involved.  However, the patient presenting himself to a general practitioner presents himself to a man who, by his very training, is not only a doctor but a psychologist who if dealing with a sore foot first looks at the foot to see has the man got an ingrown toenail and then proceeds from that, step by step, through the various syndromes with which his training has made him familiar until he reaches the end of his capacity.  At this stage he says, and has the courage to say: &ldquo;I do not know what is wrong with you and because I do not know what is wrong with you I am referring you to so-and-so so that he may find out.&rdquo;  I remember once a distinguished specialist in this city saying to me about colleagues who did not belong to his hospital: &ldquo;Ah, those fellows, if they were walking through Stephen's Green and heard sparrows singing in the bush, they would not admit they were sparrows until they had eliminated the possibility of their being canaries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What I think is so tragic is that we have not grasped this opportunity of restoring in Ireland a full realisation of the importance and of the significance of the general practitioner, a realisation of the standing he should have in the community he serves and of the reliance that ordinary people should put in him, and have not, given an assurance that the State would mobilise behind him and place constantly at his disposal in the fullest abundance the scientific equipment and laboratory facilities that the best hospitals can provide when his diagnostic capacity has been exhausted by the problem presented to him.</P>
    <P>Had we done that, and had this Bill <Col N="2085" /> been designed on the basis of insurance in so far as the charges between the family physician and the family were concerned, I would have said to the Minister: &ldquo;You have got to face the facts in the modern world in which we live, and in the hospitals reorganisation programme on which you are embarking, and on which I think you are right, you have got to say to the Government that the only way to meet this is to make it a charge on the Exchequer.&rdquo; The people have got to make up their minds, do they want first-class hospitals, economically administered, to support the general practitioner down the country, or do they not.  If they want them, they have got to pay for them.  If they are not prepared to pay for them, they have got to do without them.</P>
    <P>I believe the people would have said: &ldquo;We do want them.  We are prepared to pay for them, and we recognise that this is a charge which ought to be carried on the Exchequer to be met by the taxpayer of the country as a whole,&rdquo; because they are not for the service of the rich, and they are not for the service of the poor; they are for the service of everyone.  It does not matter whether you pay your family physician a consultant's fee of three guineas, or a consultant's fee of 10s.  Once he has reached the end of his diagnostic capacity, with the equipment available to him in his consulting rooms, the same hospital facilities are available to the 10s doctor as are available to the three guinea doctor, and it is for the head of each family to determine for himself then. Why have we not tried to do that?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a detailed examination of this Bill on Second Stage.  I do not profess to be a specialist in public health problems.  I have not had the experience of Deputy Ryan and other Deputies who have served on public health authorities, although I was a member of the Roscommon County Board of Health 35 years ago, but the world has changed so much since then.  We do not build hospitals any more in fields adjoining graveyards, because the man who owned the field beside the graveyard wanted to sell his field for twice the price he would get from anyone else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> I have some experience of our local county hospital and the surgeon who operates it.  I will not go into his political affiliations, although I have a pretty shrewd suspicion of what they are.  Leaving that out of the question, he is a great and dedicated servant of the people.  He is one of those doctors who would work 18 hours a day if he thought there were people who wanted his care.  He is a great general surgeon. Of course he is something more.  He is a great psychologist and he loves his patients.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede, looking at the overall problem in the country, that the Minister is probably right in his desire to have general hospitals and regional hospitals.  He is probably right in his belief that, with the progress of medical science, and laboratory techniques, and the requirements of modern equipment, it is no longer possible to maintain a multitude of small hospitals, but we should not forget in this House that 70 per cent &mdash; and I think that is a conservative figure &mdash; of all the cases going into a county hospital are eminently within the range of the competence of a general surgeon. I am sure 90 per cent of my neighbours would sooner be treated by the county surgeon near their homes and families, than by a high-powered panel of specialists in regional hospitals 60, 70 or 80 miles from home.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that, in effecting what we believe to be a desirable reform of regional and large general hospitals, we are taking from rural people an amenity which is very precious to them, and that is the ability to have their operation or their illness within reach of their neighbours and friends.  We have to ask ourselves with great anxiety, are we completely sure about the price we are going to pay for withdrawing the hospital facilities, inadequate as they may be in some cases, from the immediate locality and will we get an adequate return in a superior service in the regional and general hospitals which it is our pur pose to create in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves &mdash; and this is something on which I have not heard the Minister give statistics to the House &mdash; what percentage of surgical problems <Col N="2087" /> are presented to the county hospitals which are well within the competence of what we habitually regard as a county surgeon?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighty to 90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighty to 90 per cent come within his range of competence. So, it is for 10 per cent only that reference has to be undertaken to a Dublin, Cork or Galway regional hospital.  We have to remember that, in order to provide for the ten per cent who are at present being referred from the county hospital to the larger hospitals in large centres of population, we are embarking upon a programme which will deprive the 90 per cent of the inestimable benefit, from their point of view, of a hospital which is accessible to their families and friends.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister answered me off the cuff when he said 90 per cent, and I am certain that no one will quote that figure against him as being a scientific statistical calculation.  It is a rough estimate of what the general impression has been.  Probably there has never been any precise statistical measurement made of so amorphous a concept as the kind of surgical problems that are within the competence of a general surgeon.  Roughly speaking it is of that order, measured by our past experience in references from the surgical hospitals to the central hospitals. There may be those who would say that maybe if another five or ten per cent were referred they might have done better than in fact they did.  I think the Minister will agree that the vast majority of cases requiring urgent surgical treatment are well within the competence of a competent general surgeon in a county hospital at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a substantial change in the whole system.  If we are, this is all the more reason why we should try to build up a closer relationship with the general practitioner, and it is all the more reason why we should try to present to the country, and to the world, our belief that the real keystone of a satisfactory health service is the family doctor.  If we are to do that, it seems to me that our prime purpose <Col N="2088" /> ought to be to put it within the reach of every family to go to the family doctor of their own choice.  I see no way of doing that except on the insurance principle I have just outlined. If we do that rather than seek to build up the whole complex machine which is functioning in Great Britain and the United States of America, we will have set our eyes upon a target which we will be much more likely to achieve effectively, to the far greater advantage of those whom we seek to serve.</P>
    <P>Surely it is madness to slither into a whole dialectic of chaos because nobody has the courage to say stop? Let us look at this whole problem again.  I do not know what estimate the Minister has made or what the ultimate total cost of this Health Bill will be, but it will certainly be a burden three or four times the original estimate which is at present in the Minister's mind.  I do not believe we shall be able to pay that and, if we cannot, the whole system will break down.  I do not want to see the situation arising in this country in which there is simply no accommodation in the hospitals for the people who need hospital treatment, no staffs sufficient to staff the wards which we have created in the regional and general hospitals envisaged in this Bill, and I gravely apprehend that this is the inevitable sequel to pursuing the general scheme on which the Minister's plans are founded.</P>
    <P>In the context of costs I want to draw the attention of the House to this aspect of the problem.  Fifty per cent of the total cost of the health services &mdash;and there is some argument whether it is 50 or 55 per cent&mdash;are to be borne by the State, and 45 or 50 per cent by the local authority.  I believe that is substantially the position but, whatever the proportions are, I think the present position in Cork city is typical, in which the rates are now levied at the rate of £5 in the £, of which approximately £2 is in respect of the health services.  We are always talking about the depopulation of rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland does not consist exclusively of small farmers living on small farms.  A very large part of the population of rural Ireland <Col N="2089" /> live in small towns and every house in those towns has a pretty substantial valuation.  When one talks of rates of £4 in the £ in County Mayo one should not be thinking of land only to the extent to which land is relieved of local rates; one should be thinking of the small shopkeeper, of the retired person living in a small house, of all the people who live in and about the small towns.  Their lives are being made impossible by the intolerable rise in the burden of rates.  Am I correct in stating that it is proposed substantially that half the cost of all the health proposals are to be borne on the rates in future?  Perhaps Deputy Ryan would say if that is the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the cost is, I want to warn the House it will not be borne on the rates because the ratepayers will not be able to pay it. I always remember Harry Truman saying when he was President of the United States: &ldquo;I remember 1929 and 1930 and 1931.  That is when they put me through the wringer.&rdquo;  What he meant to imply by that was that that was the period when his haberdasher's shop was made uneconomic by the fact that the cost of operating it exceeded the profits.  So he went through the wringer, as he said himself, and turned the key in the door and went down to Boss Prendergast to look for a job.</P>
      <P>Is there a Deputy who is familiar with rural Ireland who does not recognise that there are hundreds and probably thousands of small businesses in rural Ireland, each one of which supports and educates a family, which are just hanging on by the eyebrow?  Increase the rates by another £1 in the £, put another 10/- a week on them by way of rates and they will be in the same state as Harry Truman was in but they will have no Boss Prendergast to go to to get them a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said at the beginning that I recognise the difficulty of the Minister for Health, but there is only one escape from that dilemma and that is to recognise that the financing of the health services is not a suitable burden for the rates.  It ought to be shared by two <Col N="2090" /> sources: (1), an insurance fund to which those who can afford to pay should make their contribution and to which those who cannot shall have it made for them by the State.  It will be then for the fund to provide beneficiaries with the benefits to which they are entitled for domestic medical care, each individual making his own choice as to whether he will limit the expenditure to that level or supplement it from his own resources; and (2), the Exchequer, in respect of hospital administration which must be organised on the basis which enables the Exchequer to deal with it as it would deal with any business enterprise, on a basis of strict costings, estimates and results.</P>
    <P>I said in an earlier discussion on an Estimate relative to this Minister's Department, that I was happy to hear the Minister lay it down as a principle of his policy that hospitals owned by the religious would be owned, operated and controlled by them.  Under the new dispensation we shall have three kinds of hospitals: we shall have the local authority hospital, the hospital operated by a lay committee, and the hospital operated and controlled by the religious who own them.  But, whoever operates them, whether it be lay people or a health authority like the Dublin Health Authority, or a religious order, whatever the management authority may be, it will have to be sustained by competent management personnel with whom the Exchequer can deal on the basis of costs and revenue and it is only the Exchequer that can reasonably be expected to measure these costs and to report to this House as to what is required in the form of taxation; and it is only this House which can ultimately determine whether we are prepared, in the name of the people, to shoulder these costs or to inform the Minister that the people have elected to have less comprehensive hospital services than he proposes because the people simply cannot afford to pay for them.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask the Minister to look at this whole scheme again and to recast it, bearing in mind the circumstances of the ratepayers, bearing in <Col N="2091" /> mind the future costs of hospital administration and bearing in mind, above all, that we should give a lead to the world in producing a charter for the general practitioners of Ireland so that the world may come to recognise that the most important element in a successful health system is the relationship that exists between the family physician and his patient, plus the possible accession to an effective family physician of the opportunity of earning by his own exertions and superior skill an income appropriate to that skill which he is prepared to deploy in the service of those who trust him as their family physician. I believe that, if we do that, the world may well follow us instead of the reverse procedure of our accepting the view that what has so manifestly failed in Britain and in the United States of America should be adopted by us in the certain knowledge that, even on our miniscule scale here, it will fail as it has failed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overpaint the picture. I have had considerable experience from the point of view of the patient of the functioning of Medicare in America and of the health services in Britain and I believe Deputies would be shocked if they knew the extent of their inadequacy.  They would be shocked to hear the stories I have heard, not only from patients complaining &mdash; these we must discount because those in ill-health are inclined to exaggerate &mdash; but from young Irish doctors and Irish nurses who have participated in the public health service in Britain.  They have told me themselves they would rather work for half what they get in Britain under humane conditions in Ireland than go on participating in the farce of the public health services as administered in Britain at the present time.  Bearing these facts in mind, I would suggest to the Minister he ought to look at this whole scheme again to see if the insurance principle advocated in Deputy Ryan's amendment, remembering that it redounds to the relief of the ratepayers, should not receive more sympathetic consideration before the Minister irrevocably commits himself to the principles of the Bill.</P>
    <Col N="2092" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to express my disappointment with this Bill.  When one compares it with the White Paper produced by the Minister's predecessor in 1966 all one can say is that this Bill is but a miserable shadow of the health services envisaged by the Minister's predecessor. This Bill, indeed, bears little resemblance to the policy adumbrated in the White Paper.  In my opinion, there are two fundamental flaws in the Bill.  It has been introduced without the Minister having been able to obtain the agreement of the general medical practitioners in the country.  It is ludicrous for the Minister to introduce a Bill changing the health services without having reached agreement with those who will operate the services. The Minister said he had had detailed discussions with the medical profession with regard to various aspects of remuneration.  The discussions bogged down in particular in relation to the method of remuneration of the doctors.</P>
      <P>Speaking here some weeks ago on the Estimate for the Department of Health, I said the system of remuneration proposed by the Minister was totally inadequate and wholly unacceptable to the medical profession. If we are to have a satisfactory health service it is vitally important that those who operate that service should do so under what Deputy Dr. O'Connell described as ideal conditions.  The proposal to pay the doctors on a capitation basis is a bad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon drew attention a moment ago to the fact that the health services in Britain, operated on a capitation basis, are not giving the service it was intended they should give.  I have discussed this with the medical profession and I believe that the fairest and most equitable system of remuneration is a fee-per-service basis.  The capitation system proposed by the Minister would turn doctors into virtual slaves.  There is no proper provision under such a system for free time and no really adequate remuneration would be available to doctors called out in the small hours of the night and after normal working hours.  The dental service in Britain <Col N="2093" /> is operated on a fee-per-service basis and it is not without significance that the dental service there is operating so satisfactorily that there is a mass exodus of newly qualified dentists from this country to Britain.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister the importance of arriving at an early and satisfactory arrangement with the medical profession.  It is vitally important to the operation of any health service that our doctors be happy and contented with their remuneration.  Deputy Ryan, speaking here last week, emphasised this very fact.  While advocating a fair deal for our medical doctors, I am not to be taken as overlooking the fact that the patient is the most important person.  I gather, however, there is now good hope of an early agreement between the Minister and the medical profession with regard to remuneration. The information available to me is that the problem of operating on a fee-per-service system is a problem of control.  I understand a committee has been set up by the medical profession to examine ways and means whereby a proper system of control can be applied to the Operation of a fee-per-service system.  The professional man should be remunerated in respect of the service he gives.  I said already I feel it is a pity the Minister introduced this Bill without having been able to reach agreement with the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this totally inadequate Bill is that it seems to have been rushed &mdash; perhaps on grounds of political expediency and with a general election looming on the horizon.  It is rather a surprising measure in the light of the comprehensive White Paper which was circulated in 1966.  The reaction of everybody I have met since the Minister introduced this Bill has been: &ldquo;Good heavens, despite what has happened in Dublin Corporation, despite the trouble in practically every local authority this year in striking the rates, the Minister has introduced a new Health Bill which makes no provision for a proper system of financing this health service.&rdquo;  It seems that the unfortunate ratepayers will be burdened still further, particularly the people to whom Deputy Dillon recently referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> I believe, myself, that eventually this country will have the comprehensive medical service we all desire to see it have but that it will be provided on the basis of insurance, as suggested and advocated for a long number of years now by Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins.  There is no reason why we in this country could not introduce a comprehensive health service based on insurance.  It has been done in other countries.  I believe it can be done here. In fact, I would go further and say that the only way a comprehensive health service can be provided in this country &mdash; taking into account our economic and social circumstances and the resources at our disposal &mdash; is through insurance as advocated by Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins, and which represents Fine Gael policy on health services.  Strangely enough, the Minister's late predecessor did, in fact, concede that this suggestion was worthy of examination.  I regret very much that the Minister has been forced into the present situation whereby, as I have already said, with a general election on the horizon, he has had to introduce a Health Bill which contains merely certain modifications of the already antiquated and totally inadequate health service we have been operating in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which of the three insurance schemes that I have already heard from Fine Gael does Deputy O'Donnell favour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree on the one scheme.  The position, as I see it, is that there are certain modifications in degree.  Certain sections of the Bill are to be welcomed.  I want to be fair about this.  However, I have been looking at this <i>in toto,</i> so to speak, up to now.  Certain sections introduce a number of much-needed improvements.  Take, for example, the question of eligibility.  It is now proposed, in assessing the eligibility of an applicant for benefit, that only the income of the husband and wife will be taken into account.  Hitherto, the income of other members of the household was assessed as well.  This is a welcome development.  I am sure most Deputies have had experience of cases where applicants for medical cards and <Col N="2095" /> applicants for benefit under the Disabled Persons Act have been turned down because, in addition to the father and mother, there might be one or two members in the household who were employed.  Therefore, I certainly welcome this change under the heading of eligibility.</P>
      <P>There is another rather surprising omission from this Bill.  Certainly, the Minister made no reference to it. Maybe it was covered in a general way in the debate but it is a surprising omission.  I refer to the fact that this Bill has made no provision for reorganising the dental services of this country.  When I was speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Health a few weeks ago, I dealt in detail with the position of the dental services in Limerick.  I said that I had come across people who had been waiting two or three years for dental treatment and were unable to get it.  I referred to particular cases of people who needed treatment and who, because they were suffering from cardiac or other ailments, could only receive dental treatment in a hospital or would need to be hospitalised.  There are no facilities available for this type of treatment.  I understand that there is a shortage of dentists in the public service.</P>
      <P>We all know what has happened in recent years &mdash; and I referred to this in a different context &mdash; and that newly-qualified dentists are crossing to Britain to take up employment there. I understand that in certain counties there is a serious shortage of dentists. This presents the Minister with a serious problem which is difficult to solve.  I have a close relative in the dental service in Britain and I know that the remuneration there for newly-qualified dentists, compared with what they get here, runs not into hundreds of pounds but thousands of pounds. How our problem can be overcome is difficult to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that in recent times there have been improvements in the salaries paid to public dental officers but the public dental services are not satisfactory. I am surprised that the Minister <Col N="2096" /> has not specifically detailed any new provisions in respect of the public dental services, the school dental services and so forth.  I have already stated that it is vitally important to the operation of the public health service that the people who operate it should be remunerated equitably and adequately. I have referred to the doctors and another section of the medical profession to which I should like to refer is the nursing profession, whose conditions of employment leave quite a lot to be desired.  There have been improvements in their conditions and hours of work in recent years but there is still quite a lot of dissatisfaction amongst nurses in regard to remuneration, hours of service and conditions of employment.  I know that the Minister, like myself, would be inclined to help this profession and I would urge him to examine the legitimate grievances of the profession with a view to giving them the fair deal they deserve. Rarely a week passes that we do not read in the newspapers statements, letters or complaints about the conditions under which our nurses have to work.  The nursing profession is a very noble profession and one which in recent years has been attracting more and more attention.  There are still minor grievances, minor problems and minor difficulties which could be easily removed and the Minister is the person to do this.  I hope he will examine the whole set up in regard to the training of nurses, their conditions of service and so forth, and I have no doubt that by indicating his interest and by using his influence he will be able to right these grievances.</P>
    <P>In the concluding part of his introductory speech the Minister referred to an aspect of the health services in which I am very interested, the question of rehabilitation.  I understand that it is now proposed to enable the new health boards to provide workshops and so on, to aid the rehabilitation of incapacitated people.  Heretofore this was done by voluntary effort. A large and very successful experiment is in operation in the Shannon Industrial Estate where we have a factory building being operated by an organisation called Retos Ltd.  The Minister is probably aware of this, and indeed, <Col N="2097" /> if my memory serves me correctly, I think he officially opened this centre. This is an outstanding example of the way in which voluntary effort can be organised and assisted by the State towards rehabilitating certain types of incapacitated people.  I should like to see an extension of this type of experiment throughout the country. There are numerous types of incapacity which require rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is a wide and complex problem due to the fact that there is this variety of ailments, ailments which differ in regard to type and degree of incapacitation.  The point I am making is that I am doubtful if it is a good thing to give these local boards full responsibility for organising this service.</P>
    <P>The basic principle which applies to all types of control, particularly in relation to State participation and encouragement, should apply here and these local groups and voluntary organisations who are doing excellent work &mdash; we are very fortunate in this respect here &mdash; should be encouraged in this work and assisted in a big way by the State.  Only as a last resort should the State take over this work. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on his plans in relation to this very important problem of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat points made by other speakers.  I am very disappointed with the Bill but I am not without hope that before long there will be introduced comprehensive medical services financed by the system advocated by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, a health service based on insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for one Deputy after another to repeat the same old story in regard to health services year after year.  The Minister must realise that as Minister for Health he occupies a most vital and important position in the Government. He is charged with the responsibility of providing out of the Vote passed by this House the moneys necessary for the administration of the health services and for introducing what in the considered opinion of his Government is the best possible health legislation and also with ensuring cooperation <Col N="2098" /> between his Department and the medical profession, the nurses' organisation and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have never heard the Minister or any of his predecessors advising people as to what they should do so as to live better and healthier lives.  Year after year we seem to be commenting on increased medical services&mdash;undoubtedly very necessary &mdash; and on increasing the number of hospital beds&mdash;again very necessary, apparently.  But may I inquire what practical steps the Department are taking to keep people who are healthy out of hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department should have a special section whereby practical steps will be taken to teach people the importance of maintaining a high standard of health.  That has not been done.  Is it not true that a large number of hospital beds are occupied today because people eat too much fried food, too much white bread, too much white sugar, too little fruit and do not drink enough water.  I have yet to see any advertisement sponsored by either a health authority or the Department to inform the public that white sugar is next to rank poison; that a certain bleach is used in white sugar and that analysis has shown that from a health point of view the proper sugar to use is brown sugar and, if possible, brown cane sugar.  In order that people may live better and healthier lives they should be taught the importance of balanced diet.  It has been shown beyond doubt by the medical profession that lung cancer is associated with excessive smoking and that deaths from lung cancer have increased.  The Department are failing in their responsibility to warn the people of this danger.  An occasional observation by the Minister for Health on television or radio is of little use.  Local authorities under the guidance of the Department of Health should be able to alert the public to the danger.  There are no people more careless about their health than the Irish people.  Why, I do not know.  We have an appalling deathrate from cancer and our hospitals are taxed to capacity.  The Minister may not agree when I say that we have what can, perhaps, be described as one of the worst health services in the world, which does not provide the services the <Col N="2099" /> people require, which is financed mainly from the rates.  As Deputy Dillon correctly pointed out, the stage has been reached when the ratepayers cannot continue to pay for this inadequate health service.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with Deputies Ryan and Dillon and other Deputies in welcoming any move by the Minister to improve our health services.  An outstanding opportunity was presented to the Government of introducing a health service that would meet all the demands of our people.  It is generally recognised that the cost of medicines, and particularly of modern drugs, is very great.  Because of these everrising costs there has been a very great increase not alone in the contributions paid by the Department to health authorities but in the equivalent sum that must be raised by the health authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>I had expected, as I am sure the vast majority of the people expected, a completely new approach to health.  I wish to express the greatest disappointment with this Bill.  I cannot see any relief in it for the local ratepayers who have objected in an angry manner to the severe imposition on rates in respect of health services.</P>
    <P>The present medical card system is not a good or proper system.  I subscribe to Deputy Ryan's view that we should have a health service in this country which would be an example to all democratic countries in the world.  I say this because our excellent doctors, specialists, surgeons, nursing staff and nursing sisters make that possible.</P>
    <P>We should have a health service based on insurance.  Everyone has admired the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  I know of many people who would be out of house and home today, who could never have hoped to meet doctors' and specialists' fees, had they not been members of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  I had always hoped that the State would take the smooth working of this Board as an example for the provision of a proper and efficient health service, a health service based on a contribution paid by <Col N="2100" /> the citizen when he is well against the time he may become ill.</P>
    <P>There was an estimate sometime ago of what a normal contribution for a good efficient health service might be. I think it amounted to something like the price of a packet of ten cigarettes per week for every head of the population. The burden on the health authorities has now become so excessive that it cannot continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very interested if the Deputy would spell that out.  What does the Deputy mean when he refers to the price of a packet of ten cigarettes which, I think, would be about 2/4d?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to embarrass the Minister but I am long enough in this House to remember Senator Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Health telling us, when introducing the present Health Act, that about 2/- in the £ would be the rate required for the proper running of what he then described as a most efficient health service that would cater for all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A proper health service should be provided on the basis of insurance.  It should be so designed that the State would pay the contributions for old age pensioners, for widows, orphans, disabled and unemployed persons and those who are now covered by what the Minister describes as the &ldquo;blue card&rdquo; or the medical card, so that the service would be completely free for such poor sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand what the position in relation to health charges is likely to be in this country in ten years from now, but I say that the health of our people is of the greatest possible importance.  Our people are entitled to a proper health service which will provide them with a choice of doctor or specialist treatment and which will provide them with hospital accommodation. <Col N="2101" /> Every Deputy from rural Ireland, and perhaps from the cities, knows that one of the most urgent problems of our people is in relation to the health services.</P>
    <P>The measure of relief given in respect of health services under this legislation is so small as to be completely insignificant in comparison with what the people expected and in comparison with the health service that has been promised by the Government down the years.</P>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to county homes.  There are many county homes in the country in which our old people are ending their days and some of which are far from what we would desire in Ireland in 1969.  I have been in some of them and I have noticed that while every effort is made to have them kept spotlessly clean their lay-out does not make them attractive accommodation.  I am glad that Deputy McLaughlin is present. I have never been in the county home in Sligo but I propose to go there for the purpose of enlightenment on the first occasion on which I am in Sligo. I was told in the past week that a constituent of mine visited an aged relative in the county home in Sligo and was appalled and astonished.  He never thought old people would have to end their days in such surroundings.</P>
    <P>In Laois we have a county home on which £1/4 million was spent.  It was one of the present Minister's first duties to officially open this reconstructed county home.  I want to invite any Deputies who have been critical of county homes to visit the Laois one at Mountmellick.  Not alone is it one of the most outstanding county institutions in this country but I venture to say there is not anything like it, as a hospital for the aged, in any part of Europe.  It is an institution of which we are very proud.  We do not describe it as the county home because it is no longer the county home.  The sooner we get rid of the titles county home, union and workhouse, the better.  Fifty years ago everybody wanted to avoid the workhouse as it was then known but we are now living in an age when people expect high and modern standards if they are to end their days in an institution.  The sooner we get rid <Col N="2102" /> of those buildings that were erected in the period 1839 to 1843, the better. They are a reminder of bad times and of hardship.  There is a great deal of pride still left in our people and it is well that that pride should exist. Aged people who are friendless will go into an institution more readily if it has not got the title of county home.</P>
    <P>While our young people are busy with all the attractions of modern life there is a great tendency to push old people out of their own homes.  Greater provision should be made for the maintenance and care of old people in their own homes rather than in institutions. In every area there should be available a home nursing service whereby it should be possible for a nurse to call once or twice daily to render necessary services to old people in their own homes.  In many parts of the country no such service is available. There is nothing so sad as to see an old person having to leave the home he loved and go into an institution.  I am sorry to say that it is noticeable that, instead of keeping old people at home, members of their families are encouraging them to go into institutions and endeavouring to push them into them.  There was a time when people cherished the idea of looking after their aged parents or relatives. The sooner we revive that spirit, the better.  It should be possible to provide an up-to-date home nursing service for aged persons.</P>
    <P>The county hospitals, in general, provide an excellent service.  I have noted from a reading of the Fitzgerald Report that it is the intention of the Government to consider the establishment of hospitals on a regional basis. The existing county hospitals cater for the people of the county.  Everyone knows everyone else.  Everyone knows the staff, and there is an atmosphere of friendliness and confidence in such institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has ever been in any of the hospitals in the United States of America.  Perhaps he has.  One of the saddest experiences I ever had was when I visited a constituent of mine in the Bellevue Hospital in New York.  It is one of the biggest hospitals I ever saw.  It embraces <Col N="2103" /> a few blocks of the city.  We hear talk about the conditions in our old county homes, but there was one ward in that hospital with at least 80 to 120 beds and one could barely walk between the beds.  Naturally in New York one would expect the hospital to be thronged and it was.</P>
    <P>I remember the patient saying that it was bad enough to be ill in Ireland but it was a pleasure to be ill in Ireland compared with being ill in the United States.  He said that when one is ill in Ireland one has many friends to visit one, but when one is ill in the United States one is out of circulation and is wanted no longer.  They have not got time to call to the hospital.  Everyone is too busy.  I remember him saying that New York with all its millions can be a very lonely place in hospitals and visitors seldom turn up.</P>
    <P>One thing that can certainly be said about the Irish here &mdash; it is probably because we are a small country &mdash; is that we are a most charitable people and a most sympathetic people, particularly when people are ill.  It is looked upon as a work of charity and of mercy to visit a sick person in hospital.  I hope that will long continue.  Our system of county hospitals has been a success in this regard.  In rural Ireland particularly, when you are ill, at the first available opportunity all your friends and neighbours come to the county hospital to extend greetings and good wishes for a speedy recovery.  I wonder will we lose that atmosphere in the regional hospitals.  Perhaps not.  It would be sad if we were to lose the close contact which has already been established as a result of our county hospitals system.  I am sure it is the intention of the Minister to have available in the regional hospitals every possible branch of the medical services.</P>
    <P>In the report which is being considered by the Government it has been suggested that Tullamore should be the site for the Midlands regional hospital. I hope the Minister will not be browbeaten by any other local authority into altering that recommendation.  I believe that report is an excellent document.  Whether it is workable or <Col N="2104" /> feasible is another day's work.  I know that efforts have been made, because of the extensive stretch of territory in the Midlands, to have the recommendation in relation to the regional hospital for the Midlands altered.  I beg the Minister to resist in the strongest possible manner any effort that may be made either by the Westmeath County Council or by any other county council to alter that recommendation. I read over the week-end that Westmeath County Council were about to ask the Minister to attend a meeting of the county council.  If he goes to a meeting of the Westmeath County Council I am sure I am not foolish in presuming that he will receive an invitation to attend a meeting of the Offaly County Council.</P>

What was the purpose of submitting this report to the Minister and the Government if it is to be disregarded?  I am quite satisfied that a full and impartial investigation was made into the location of this regional hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offaly is blessed by having in Tullamore what can be and was described as the best county hospital in this State.  I am not a member of Offaly County Council.  I live in Laois. All over the Midlands there has been built up, not this year or last year or the year before but over many years, an outstanding confidence in the Tullamore hospital.  It was built up by a man who is now in retirement, a man called Surgeon O'Reilly.  Men of his type are few and far between.  He is a man who devoted about 20 hours per day to this hospital.  He had no hobbies.  He seldom left the hospital and he was always to be found at the bedside of his patients.  Because of his great skill as a surgeon, practically all <Col N="2105" /> his cases in the theatre were successful. Because of his devotion to duty over a long number of years a bond of confidence was created in the Midlands in the Tullamore hospital which had not prevailed in other parts of the Midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the outstanding service rendered by the Sisters of Mercy in Mullingar County Hospital.  I look upon that hospital as one of the most highly efficient in this country.  Since it is run by the same nursing order as runs the county hospital in Tullamore it could not possibly be otherwise.  I do not know any of the patients in Westmeath, but I seldom pass through Mullingar without dropping in to the county hospital and enjoying the hospitality of the Sisters of Mercy there.  I am very much alive to the fact that the special care and attention of the Sisters of Mercy in the Midlands is something which has built up a terrific volume of confidence among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a hospital is to be a success it must have the confidence of the public. In Tullamore the confidence is already there.  I make a genuine appeal to the Minister to have the terms of the report implemented so far as the location of the regional hospital is concerned. The Mullingar people may claim that they want this regional hospital in Mullingar and that they want <Col N="2106" /> another regional hospital down in Portlaoise. If this was feasible I am sure those responsible for compiling the report would have recommended it.  I strongly impress upon the Minister the necessity for adhering fully to the terms of the report.  If there are to be regional hospitals provided in the Midlands, a more suitable location cannot be found than the County Offaly which would cater for Westmeath, Meath and indeed the greater portion of the Midlands.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a growing practice that when a patient with a complaint, be it real or imaginary, approaches a doctor, after a short consultation the doctor will tell the patient he should see a specialist.  He will write out a little note for him and make a suitable appointment. When he goes to the specialist the specialist will say: &ldquo;I think we should have a second opinion&rdquo;.  I have a feeling that there is a ring somewhere.  I am not at all happy about the passing of a patient from doctor to doctor, more especially when I have to see the bills involved.  There are people who have no medical cards, who according to the present regulations would not be entitled to a medical card but who would be prepared to pay a reasonable fee to a doctor.  I have seen some astonishing and frightening specialists' bills.  There is a great hubbub about the £2,500 that a Member of the Dáil receives for his services here but, looking at some of the bills sent out by some of these highly qualified specialists and surgeons, one realises they would not have to consult very many patients before they could rake in £2,500.  I suppose it is not for us to question the qualifications of these gentlemen.  They are probably among the most highly qualified people in Europe and may be entitled to every penny they are receiving from a patient. I have no doubt they have very clear consciences when they are writing out their bills, but, as I said, some of the bills I have seen furnished have certainly caused me astonishment.</P>
    <P>There are many people who are not in the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme and who do not qualify for inclusion in the general medical services <Col N="2107" /> register.  All I can hope is that they will be preserved from any dealings with these gentlemen to whom I have referred.  The Department of Health should give every encouragement to people to join the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme as a safeguard for themselves.</P>
    <P>The financing of the health services should be based on insurance.  I am not satisfied with the present rates of benefit available for the sick.  I am not satisfied with the system whereby medical cards are made available.  It would, I suppose, be unreasonable to expect any improvement because it is the system which is at fault.  If we had health services based on insurance there would be none of the humiliation caused to some by the embarrassing investigation into means to find out whether or not people are entitled to medical cards and the time has come when these people must be provided with a better and more up-to-date health service.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with mentally handicapped children.  A great deal has been said already about this very serious problem.  We are short of trained personnel.  We are short of accommodation.  There are not enough suitable institutions available.  I appeal to the Minister to give urgent attention to the provision of accommodation and properly trained personnel.  The shortage of trained personnel is one of the most serious disadvantages from which we suffer.  I hope a really serious effort will be made to provide both staff and accommodation for the care and training of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>All mentally handicapped children should be removed from mental hospitals. It must be heartbreaking for parents to have to put a mentally handicapped child into a mental hospital because of lack of proper accommodation for these unfortunate children.  I know from personal experience that the resident medical superintendents in mental hospitals cater for these children to the very best of their ability. But mental hospitals are not suitable. These children should be cared for with other children.  The environment of a mental hospital is not a proper environment. <Col N="2108" /> I believe that the House will gladly vote any moneys the Minister may require.  We have had this problem with us for too long.  I trust the Minister will bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>There are, too, mentally defective children for whom no additional allowances are provided to cover the extra care and attention these children require.  There should be special monetary provision for these children.  All of us appreciate the enormous burden resting on the parents of mentally defective children.  I have known parents who literally became demented with the worry and torment of caring for these children.  I know, too, the financial burden such children may cause in a working class family.  I urge on the Minister the early formulation of a new scheme making generous financial provision available for the parents of such children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very difficult task.  It grows daily more difficult because of increased costs.  That is why I urge on the Minister his acceptance of Deputy Ryan's insurance scheme for the purpose of financing the health services. Such a scheme will relieve the rates and ease the burden on the ratepayers. Indeed, the burden is one which the ratepayers can no longer carry.  If the present trend continues we shall find ourselves ultimately going from bad to worse with every year that passes.  The time to make a change is now.  That is why I join with others in asking the Minister to reconsider his whole approach to health services because of the major part health plays in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, the first five chapters of this Bill deal with matters of administration, the setting up and rationalisation of hospital boards and the constitution of these boards.  These chapters have been pretty fully dealt with already in the course of the debate, but I should like to make one comment in relation to health boards. Subsection (2) (a) of section 4 provides:</P>
      <P>Membership of a health board shall consist of &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) persons appointed by the relevant local authorities,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> (ii)  persons appointed by election by registered medical practitioners and by election by members of such ancillary professions as are specified in the appropriate regulations under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>and, of course, three members appointed by the Minister.  There have been complaints that there has been, as it were, a gap in communication between ordinary laymen and the medical profession itself.  This section, however&mdash; really, it is a tremendous section&mdash; brings together three groups&mdash;the doctors, the laymen and the councillors. This is a most welcome development. This is the sort of thing we want.  We want involvement by all sections of the community on matters of health. I imagine that the doctors would agree on this.  Their main concern is the health of the ordinary people and, to ensure that they will continue to be in touch with the ordinary people as they are, this development of bringing together politicians, laymen and doctors will result in different ideas emerging from each of these three groups from which will emerge good decisions in regard to programmes, and so forth.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, my contribution will deal mainly with Chapter IV of the Bill&mdash;Health Services&mdash;and onwards. Section 60 deals with medical and midwifery care for mothers.  The section reads as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A health board shall make available without charge medical, surgical and midwifery services for attendance to the health, in respect of motherhood, of women who are persons with full eligibility or persons with limited eligibility.</P>
    <P>(2)  A woman entitled to receive medical services under this section may choose to receive them from any registered medical practitioner who has entered into an agreement with the health board for the provision of those services and who is willing to accept her as a patient.</P>
    <P>(3)  When a woman avails herself of services under this section for a confinement taking place otherwise than in a hospital or maternity home, the health board shall provide without charge obstetrical requisites to <Col N="2110" /> such extent as may be specified by regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If I may give an example of the type of matters that this section relates to, let me take the example of a condition known as spina bifida which, as we know, is a condition in children born with split spines.  It is very important that this condition be treated within 12 hours of birth; it is as serious as that.  An association has been formed in recent times of parents of children with spina bifida.  The association was brought into being to co-ordinate work and to encourage further work in this line of medical practice.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating that association on its establishment in the interests of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>Spina bifida children are paralysed from the waist down.  Up to 1956, approximately 94 per cent of these children died.  Operative procedures for this condition were developed in Britain which we were able to follow very quickly in this country.  Let us be fair to this country in terms of medicine and medical services.  We are not averse to taking a lead and a line from other countries where good and effective practices have been developed.  I congratulate the people here who were responsible for implementing so quickly procedures found to work so well in Britain.</P>
    <P>Medicine is a universal matter.  It is non-national; it is international&mdash;as it should be.  However, as I say, these operative procedures were followed here very quickly and are now the practice in Crumlin Hospital and in the Richmond Hospital.  As a result of following the British operative procedure it is now found that 70 per cent of these children survive.  The fact that, before 1956, 94 per cent of children born with spina bifida died whereas now 70 per cent of such children survive, represents a tremendous advance and is a marvellous tribute to medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>In order that maximum benefit may be received, the operation must take place within 12 hours of birth.  If that is done, then only ten per cent of the 70 per cent will need wheel chairs. Consequently, early operation is essential. That is one of the reasons why <Col N="2111" /> I welcome and, indeed, why the parents of spina bifida children will welcome the type of thinking behind section 60 and onwards of this Bill. In this country there are 62,000 births per annum and three per 1,000 births &mdash;roughly 180 births&mdash;per annum are spina bifida children.  Out of these 180 children, 150 survive.  That will give the House an idea of the cost involved. I take this specific ailment because it illustrates what I mean and it illustrates the importance of this particular section.  The cost involved is absolutely prohibitive.  Each spina bifida child needs five operations necessitating long periods in hospital.  The mind boggles at the thought of the amount of money involved.  Indeed, it would represent a charge on the health services for children of parents who could not afford to pay for this type of treatment.  The Dublin Health Authority have been most co-operative in cases of this kind.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme covers cases where the parents are members of the scheme at the time of the birth of the spina bifida child.  This is very good.  It relieves the parents of some, if not all, of the expense involved.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister to make this Bill even more effective by providing that, regardless of the income of the parents of a spina bifida child, the child&mdash;not the family&mdash;will be given a medical card, where the case is not otherwise covered, in order to ensure that the parents of that child will not be involved in any expense. It is recommended that spina bifida children be sent to ordinary schools. This is a good thing.  It is self-definitive and does not require further explanation by me.</P>
    <P>This operative service for spina bifida children is available at two hospitals&mdash; Crumlin Hospital and the Richmond Hospital&mdash;but quick diagnosis is necessary.  A diagnosis within, at the maximum, 12 hours of birth is necessary. If the child is born in some remote part of the country this necessitates the fast transfer of the child to either of the two hospitals I have mentioned.  A commission has been set up to examine the ambulance services.  One wonders whether we have <Col N="2112" /> ambulances which will take spina bifida children fast enough to either of these hospitals so as to ensure that the child will be cured, to some degree.</P>
    <P>I use that particular ailment as an example of the sort of problem we are meeting and facing.  I believe we are beginning to discharge our obligations to the parents of these spina bifida children given the type of thing that goes into Chapter IV of the Bill.  In relation to the question of charges for the mentally-handicapped I notice that a figure of £3½ million out of a total of £40 million of the health charges was paid towards the mentally-handicapped last year.  The Department pays towards the upkeep of the mentally-handicapped children in residential care and also contributes towards the diagnostic services and the disabled person's allowance that is given to about 3,500 adults.  This is very welcome.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is dear to my heart in the context of the mentally-handicapped and the handicapped generally.  If we encourage parents to keep children who are mentally ill and disabled at home, then we have a function to discharge to those parents who accept our advice.  Regardless of income, these parents should be given a £500 tax-free allowance in respect of any such child they care for at home.  I feel very strongly about this.  At this point of time we do not give enough recognition to parents in respect of those children whom they keep at home.  I would ask the Minister to meet his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with the forthcoming Budget in view, and to make this suggestion to him.  A disability allowance of £3 a week is fiddle-faddle and does not help these people to any great degree.  It is only touching the tip of the iceberg.  We have a duty to discharge to the parents of these children. That is one way of discharging that duty.</P>
    <P>The National Association for Mentally Handicapped Children is pressing for the right of every mentally-handicapped person to a disablement allowance payable to parents of children who are being maintained at home. There is an obvious reason why they <Col N="2113" /> should be kept at home.  Despite the fashionable misconception, mentallyill children do have emotions.  Whatever improvement they can make, it will be greater at home under the care of their parents than if they were in some institution.  This is not in any way to suggest that residential centres do not do a good job; they do a good job, but within the resources available to them.  It goes without saying that dedicated parents of disabled children would be able to give more care to the child in its natural environment. One can appreciate the emotions, difficult though they may be, of the mentally-ill or disabled child and it is important that whatever encouragement is possible should be given in the child's natural environment.</P>
    <P>On the question of the diagnostic services dealt with in this Bill, the Minister in the debate on his Estimate outlined the position of and the precautions taken in regard to PKU children.  He stated that 80 per cent of these babies are now being tested but I believe we can reach the stage and at the speed at which the Minister is going we must reach the stage where 100 per cent of these babies will be tested.  Let us refer to Dublin and Cork &mdash;I am not familiar with other areas&mdash; for their diagnostic services are first class and they do a very good job.  The question of diagnosis is dealt with at some length and the question of the smear test for women which reveals cancer or cancerous tendencies is dealt with.  This is the sort of service that money cannot buy and the Department, the hospitals and the medical people generally are to be complimented on their awareness of the need for this type of service particularly in relation to PKU and so on.  It has been only in recent times that we have become aware of PKU but when we did become aware of it we did something about it.  Given encouragement, even more will be done and more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of the mentally-ill, the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God have introduced a very important diagnostic and assessment service in Dublin and throughout the country.  They have a travelling diagnostic <Col N="2114" /> assessment service based in Dublin which caters for the city and the country.  The Order are to be congratulated on providing this service.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a long waiting list for assessment. Anything we can do to deal with the waiting list, the better it will be from the point of view of the children concerned and of the staffs in the medical centres.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute for some of the information I have imparted to the House to the writer of a series of articles in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I am not sure whether the writer is &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; Mary McCutchan. This series of articles was most informative and most helpful and I could be accused of plagiarism if I did not pay the writer this tribute because some of the information I have given the House I gleaned from these articles.  On the question of the rationalisation of hospitals in Dublin city and county I would ask the Minister to seek the views of all those involved in the running of these hospitals.</P>

I regret the occasion has arisen, but I do so now in order to maintain the rights of a Deputy <Col N="2115" /> and to indicate the courtesy that should be extended to any Deputy by any Minister.  At all times I had friendly associations with all Ministers and I seldom asked even a supplementary question because I framed my questions so carefully that any Minister could see what I wanted.  Generally I got a satisfactory answer and left it at that. This afternoon I was naturally very surprised at the attitude adopted in replying to Question No. 22 on the Order Paper.  There appeared to be uneasiness or a small bit of jitters on the matter.  I do not know if the Minister was aware of it but he appeared to have thrown his files over the microphone and neither I nor anybody near me heard a single word he said.</P>

      <P>I never mentioned the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, with due respect. I asked that question and it was not for the first time.  I asked it several times over a number of years because I knew that Colin Buchanan and Partners in consultation with Economic Consultants Limited were commissioned by the Government to carry out regional studies.  I also knew that the report would embrace recommendations for growth centres.  For about five years I have been bringing before this House the absolute necessity for the establishment of a major industrial estate in Sligo.  I have put before the House&mdash;and I am the only Deputy to do so&mdash;the fact that Sligo measured up to all criteria for such an estate: that it had an adequate water supply from Lough Gill regional scheme; telephonic communications with a coaxial cable from Dublin to Sligo; excellent road communications, north, south, east and west.  We have a very good port where we have many dockers idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not permit the Deputy to make a statement on this matter so far as Sligo is concerned, or any other area.  The question deals with the holdup in the circulation of the recommendations contained in the Buchanan Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there was a good deal of disorder at the time and it would have been very difficult for the Chair or the Minister to hear what the Deputy wanted to ask but that does not permit him to have a discussion on this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to point out that the NIEC Report a couple of years ago said that centres in depressed areas were suitable for growth centres and, of course, Sligo is in the centre of a depressed area.  That was not the fault of the Sligo people but of the Fianna Fáil Government which allowed 44,000 people to emigrate from the province of Connaught in the last ten years.  I shall quote the reason why my question was a valid one.  I shall quote from volume 236, column 1903 of the Official Report and it relates to one of the many occasions when I asked the Minister when the Buchanan Report on development centres was completed and when he would be in a position to issue its findings.  This is the answer I got and it has great bearing on the matter:</P>
      <P>The report on regional studies which was commissioned by the United Nations through An Foras Forbartha and was carried out by Colin Buchanan and Partners in association with Economic Consultants Limited was submitted at the end of September, except for certain survey and technical material which is still outstanding.  The report is being examined.  As indicated in a statement of July last by the Government Information Bureau, the Government intend to announce by the end of this year, the location of the major and intermediate development centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the reason why I was anxious to get a reply today.  The <Col N="2118" /> Information Bureau stated that this report would be issued by the end of 1968.  I asked again in February and I was told that it would be issued very soon.  When I asked today, this is the reply that I got:</P>
    <P>The Government are considering the question of regional planning and development in the light of the Report by the United Nations consultants on their regional studies. This is a complex matter and there has been no avoidable delay.  The Report will be published as soon as the Government have completed their consideration of the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>Now, there is a complex matter in it which did not appear to be there last October.  The point I am making is that we are going backwards.  I wish to bring into the open that it appears the Buchanan Report has been put in cold storage in order to be dropped like a bombshell convenient to the election date to create a talking point and to throw dust in the eyes of the electorate of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>We demand an industrial estate in Sligo as a right.  We do so because we have the essentials for the establishment of such an estate&mdash;an estate which will stop the flow of emigration and create employment opportunities. We know that the recommendations of the Buchanan Report must be in favour of an industrial estate in Sligo but we also know that the Government need not necessarily implement those recommendations.  If the report contains, as I am sure it does contain, a recommendation for a major industrial estate at Sligo, either the Government do not intend to implement the recommendation or else they are holding it up for reasons of political expediency.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Government of neglecting their duty in not having the recommendations issued.  People are leaving the West at the rate of 4,000 a year and no effort is being made to provide them with employment opportunities. I am deeply concerned about this flow of emigration and particularly about the flow of emigration from my own county.  I am also deeply concerned <Col N="2119" /> about those people who are trying to eke out an existence on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy cannot discuss social welfare benefits on this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to issue the findings of the Buchanan Report at an early date so that we, in my constituency, will know where we stand.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Gilhawley was, as he alleges, denied his rights as a Deputy here today, it was not by me. If he was not able to hear the reply he must place the blame elsewhere because the blame, as Deputy Gilhawley knows, and the reason why he could not hear the reply lies with his colleagues in the Front Bench of Fine Gael.  The reason why he could not hear the reply was because Deputies L'Estrange and Harte were engaged in their customary occupation of disrupting the proceedings of the House.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of courtesy by Ministers is concerned, I obeyed the Chair.  I answered Deputy Gilhawley's question when the Chair called upon me to do so and I answered the next question when the Chair called upon me to do so.  As I say, the reason why Deputy Gilhawley did not hear the reply was because of the disorder created by his own colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Gilhawley made that request, as he says he did, I was already dealing with another <Col N="2120" /> question in accordance with the ruling of the Chair.  The reply that was given here today is quite clear.  It explains the position quite adequately.  This report is one of considerable significance and, contrary to what some might believe from Deputy Gilhawley's remarks, it does not deal only with the Sligo-Leitrim area.  This is a report on regional studies covering the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sligo-Leitrim is included in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations are, as I said in the reply, complex ones.  The report is complex and the question of the adoption or non-adoption or of the adoption with amendments of the recommendations is a question of very great importance. The Government do not intend to take any rushed decision on this matter, even if a decision might happen to suit some particular area of the country. The Government intend to study the report and to base their conclusions on that study.  A great deal of consideration has already been given to the report by the Government, but we have not concluded our consideration of it. However, it is expected that it will be completed very soon.  When that is done the report will be published, probably with a statement by the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything more for me to add.  As I have said, this is a very important document and the decisions to be made by the Government will be vital and far-reaching ones.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24th April, 1969.</P>
