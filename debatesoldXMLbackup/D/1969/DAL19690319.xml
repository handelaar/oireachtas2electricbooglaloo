    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The health of the nation is one of the most important matters we have to deal with.  How many very wealthy people would give all the money they possess to have health?  As a nation we must do our best to see that nobody is neglected for want of medical attention.  We have a very good record as it is, but with modern achievements in the field of medicine more diseases can be diagnosed earlier on than was the case some years ago.  We must make those achievements as widely known as possible so that people will know they can be treated and cured.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on dealing with one matter which I brought to his notice during the year, that is, that the Dublin Health Authority were proposing to change over from turf heating to oil.  I was glad he agreed that it would be definitely against Government policy to allow things like this to happen, particularly having regard to the amount of money that is being spent on the development of the bogs of Ireland. Such a change would have a great effect on my own constituency which supplies the turf for such purposes.  I should also like to bring to the Minister's notice that quite recently in one of the daily newspapers it was reported that the Health Authority was once more thinking of changing to oil for the coming year.  I should like him to take note of that and step in again before any harmful decision is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own constituency was one of those that fought particularly hard to have the wireless installed in ambulances so that they could be contacted at a moment's notice.  It is heartening to see that so many of the local authorities have accepted the Minister's <Col N="467" /> generous offer to provide wireless telephone communication for all the ambulances in each local authority area.</P>
    <P>One disease which seems to be developing is multiple sclerosis, of which I come across more cases each year.  I was informed recently that Northern Ireland and Sweden had the highest rates of this disease.  Because of our proximity to Northern Ireland, I have seen quite a few cases of it.  I grant that it would be quite a small percentage of the overall population. Nevertheless, there is still quite a number of them.  It would be well if, for instance, a farmer or a selfemployed person suffering from this disease could benefit under some scheme for disabled persons so that assistance could be given to their family.  Under the present scheme of disabled persons' allowances, there is an income limit and quite often people cannot benefit to the full extent.  As this is rather a long illness, I feel that something should very readily be available to help such people.  It is hard to describe the anxiety of their families and of their dependants when that happens.  In a lot of cases, it takes the doctors quite a while to know exactly whether or not the patient has the disease.  It can take more than a year between going to the doctor and the specialist and all the tests involved before they can really be certain what it is.  I feel that some assistance should be given to those people of the kind given under the tuberculosis scheme a number of years ago to assist families and dependants.  If they are employed, they have national health insurance, but, if they are not, they have nothing and, quite often, there is no money available for them for quite a long time.  I have seen a few cases where the strain on them was so much that mental illness ensued and they had to be attended in a mental hospital for a period of time.  When that happened, it drove home to me the anxieties that were placed on a person like that.</P>
    <P>With regard to delay in the dental services, I am glad to note, as a result of the concessions the Minister gave last year to encourage recruitment to <Col N="468" /> the dental service, there has been an improvement in the number of applicants. There is still a very long backlog. People who have their teeth extracted have to wait, sometimes, six months and very often longer, sometimes running into years.  I suppose it will be quite a while before we shall be able to achieve something in that line in a matter of months.</P>
    <P>It is well to note that a high proportion of the time available is being devoted to dental treatment for children.  When a child reaches the teens he or she very often changes to secondary school or to some form of post-primary education and thus leaves the dental service.  I consider that records should be kept so that children coming into that age bracket will be put on a priority list and called before they change their school.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to know the amount of work being done for retarded children.  In the past two years, about 800 extra children were taken into schools and the Minister hopes greatly to improve on this figure, as time goes by.  Up to the present, the children taken were those for whom there was a chance that something could be done whereas children for whom there was very little hope of doing anything were left at home.  From the point of view of achieving anything, this was the best policy but we must bear in mind the hardship that remained on the parents of children for whom very little could be done and who, as a result, were left at home because those are the very children who give the most trouble.  I know of cases were the mother could not leave the house, unless somebody else was left in charge, because the child could not be left alone as it might harm itself in some way.  In fact, I know of cases where the county medical officer of health took away a child for a month or so in order to give the parents a rest.  The mental anxiety suffered by those people must be very grim indeed.  A great deal needs to be done to help the really bad cases that are disturbed and that cannot stay quiet, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is a big cross on the parents of such a child and I feel that a lot could be done to assist such families by <Col N="469" /> accepting such children into schools where they can properly be looked after.  It is hard on the other children in the family, especially where the children who are affected are sufficiently active to be in danger of doing harm to themselves and upsetting the household.  It is well to see education being provided for some of these children so that they can earn their living or be of some benefit to themselves in later life.  In most counties a school is provided and the Department of Education are providing transport for them to those schools.  A good deal of thanks must go to the voluntary bodies engaged in raising funds to provide an educational system and also to organise the transport of those children to the schools.</P>
    <P>As regards aid to those with eye trouble and so on, I think that in our hospitals here, particularly the Eye and Ear Hospital which specialises in such matters, not quite enough has been done or attempted in the case of eye grafts.  It is hard to explain in words the tremendous benefit there is for a person who can avail of an eye graft.  From what I gather very few cases, possibly some ten to 20, are dealt with here each year, a very small number considering the number who could benefit from eye grafts.  Across the water, where there is a special hospital for graftings alone, operations are being carried out practically every day of the week, excluding the weekends. Some money could be devoted to the Eye and Ear Hospital here so that more eye grafts could be undertaken each year thus giving people who have been waiting an opportunity of regaining that wonderful gift of sight.  Very often it is not disease that is responsible for loss of sight; it may be a small ulcer on the eye which branches out on to the cornea or seeing part of the eye, leaving a scar, and the only way of achieving sight in that eye again is by grafting.  There are other diseases that affect the eye which would also be helped by grafting.</P>
    <P>Grafts cannot be carried out without donors and very little has been done by way of requesting people to donate their eyes after death so that these eyes can be useful again.  I <Col N="470" /> should like to see the Department helping in this matter, giving people who have been waiting a number of years an opportunity of getting eye grafts.  In other countries that have developed this service the delay is not very long, possibly only a couple of weeks.  I should like to see much more done here to develop that aspect of our health services.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was dealing with infectious diseases maintenance allowances and disabled persons' maintenance allowances he spoke of the increases that have been given but there is one aspect of both cases that I wish to bring to his notice.  The people who get the five shillings and ten shillings a week increase in most counties are only those who were getting the full allowance at the time the increase was introduced.  In quite a number of cases of people getting a partial allowance, getting £2 or £1 a week down to 10/-, the increase is only granted in part or not at all.  It means their case has to be examined to see how much they will get.  The Minister should grant these allowances right across the board, to everybody who is qualified, regardless of whether they are on 10/- a week or £2 17s 6d a week.  This increase is intended in some measure to cover the increase in the cost of living and the cost to people with lower allowances is just as great as to those with full allowances.</P>
    <P>Whether it is because of the higher pace of living or not, mental illness seems to be increasing but I was pleased to see that in quite a number of hospitals the actual number of inmates was going down and that, with modern treatment, they were able to discharge people much more quickly and deal with a number in out-patients' clinics.</P>
    <P>With regard to out-patients' clinics &mdash;I came across this quite often in both Meath and Kildare&mdash;both St. Loman's and St. Dymphna's are remote from quite large areas of population and patients are naturally inclined to go to the hospitals nearest to them. Naturally, it would make it easier for their families to visit them if the patients were hospitalised because there would be a direct bus service.  It would <Col N="471" /> be much more convenient to allow patients to go into the hospitals or clinics nearest to them.  I think I have covered all the points I wished to raise.  I support the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from this Supplementary Estimate that the present system of financing health services is not satisfactory. Not only is it unsatisfactory but the financial situation itself is in a parlous state.  I cast my mind back to 1953, when the Health Act under which we are operating was introduced here. The Minister at the time told us that the increase in the rates would be only 2/- in the £.  At the moment expenditure is outrunning revenue.  The projections in 1953, whoever was responsible for them, were entirely wrong and we find ourselves now in a position in which the impact of the cost of living, as a result of Government policy over the years, is hitting the health services harder than anything else.  For some considerable time the Minister has been under pressure to change the system, to acknowledge its defects and accept that what was stated as health policy by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers is not in keeping with the facts now and that a change in the system of financing the services is necessary, not only in the long term but in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old dictum that one does not appreciate half as much that for which one does not have to pay.  A system whereby it has to be established, either through a public or a local representative, that a person is or is not entitled to health services is not a good one.  Medical treatment at any level, whether it be general practitioner or consultant, is a personal matter and should be maintained as a personal matter.  While one is glad to see a certain amount of control held in the Custom House, I absolutely deplore basing our health services on dependence on Government action.  I suggest, as I have suggested so often here, that the function of the State is to help as much as possible and encourage in every possible way the development of private practice, maintaining as far as <Col N="472" /> possible the relationship that existed in the past between doctor and patient.</P>
    <P>There are two salient features in this Estimate.  One is the increase local authorities have to meet.  A sum of £200,000 is required by local authorities and a sum of over £1 million is required by the voluntary hospitals.  I take it this £200,000 is only for the remaining portion of this financial year; I do not know what element of retrospection enters into it.  It will not make a very great impact on the rates.  But, no matter what anyone may say, the rise in rates is due to the health services. Recently the chief administrator in my own constituency told me that the major cost putting up the rates was the health services, and nothing else.  That proves that the present system is outmoded and the sooner this Fianna Fáil Government, for whatever period they remain in office, look for some other solution to this problem the better it will be.</P>
    <P>As I understand the policy of the Labour Party&mdash;I am not very clear on it really&mdash;it appears to be one under which everybody, whether rich or poor, will be entitled to free health services. That does not seem to me to be the solution to the problem.  It was tried by the first Socialist Government in Britain until they promptly found themselves in very serious difficulty after a short time; they had to take another look at the system and impose certain charges to try to offset the rising expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I said, people who get something for nothing do not appreciate it. I am sure most of us accept that it is the responsibility of parents to pay for the medical care of their children, if it is possible for them to do so.  I should like to see medicine taken away from the Custom House.  I have a great admiration for the officials of the Department of Health but they are not qualified to assess properly the personal demands associated with the full and effective operation of medicine. At the same time, I accept the fact that, while there are substantial subventions coming from the Custom House, the Department of Health is entitled to some control but the Department <Col N="473" /> is not entitled to lay down hard and fast rules and regulations, the sorts of rules and regulations which can, perhaps, be laid down in both commerce and agriculture.  It does not make for effective and good medicine or medical services.  Therefore, as I say, in so far as people are able to pay they should be asked to pay.  I am expressing my own opinion and I have expressed it here before.  I believe that a contributory scheme of some sort is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is getting away from the Supplementary Estimate before the House.  The Deputy will appreciate that we cannot have a general debate now on changes in the administration, financing and development of the health services which would need legislation.  Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing these points when the Health Bill comes before the House in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, I read the Supplementary Estimate carefully before I got up as I suspected I might be running into deep waters and it says: &ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Allowances,&rdquo; under the heading &ldquo;Administration, etc.&rdquo; I am trying to prove that the present administration of the health services is not making for good medicine.  The second heading of the Supplementary Estimate is: &ldquo;Grants to Health Authorities&rdquo;, which is actively concerned with expenditure on health.  That is very wide.  Perhaps the third heading is more important: &ldquo;Hospitals Trust Fund&mdash;Voluntary Hospitals' Deficit (Grant-in-Aid)&rdquo;.  In that we have a very wide coverage.  We have administration and grants to local authorities, and grants to hospitals.  I do not want to refer to the Minister's new Health Bill which I understand would be out of order.  Is not that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to go near that.  I am attempting to point out the fallacies which to my mind have existed over the years, and what I think should replace them.  Perhaps you would allow me to continue on those lines?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have a more relevant opportunity for discussing those points.  He can make those points on the Bill rather than on the Estimate which we are debating and which very much confines us to services as provided by existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It seems to restrict me, but I am endeavouring to show the House how money could be saved.  Surely that would be in order, because the whole purpose of the Estimate is to get more money to cover the health services which the State finds itself unable to pay for at the moment.  If you, Sir, will permit me to continue I will go on to the increase in the rates, which I think is in order.  Bearing in mind the remarks I have already made, I want to say that the charges on the rates are becoming prohibitive.  Therefore, for the further administration of the health services, no matter what the Minister may say, some new solution has got to be found. I have read the speech made by the representative of this Party, speaking on behalf of Fine Gael, in which he referred to the question of a contributory health service and this speech seems to me to have gone through unchallenged.  Am I allowed to continue on that line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That point would be relevant to the Bill and not to the Estimate which, as I said, is very much restricted.  The Deputy is wandering all over the health services advocating changes which would need legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really.  I am trying to reduce expenditure. Deputy Ryan spoke at considerable length on this subject.  His views might be a little different from mine.  He does not appear to have been pulled up by anyone last Thursday.  I find myself in the difficulty that I cannot continue to speak.  I want to obey the Chair. That is always my first desire when addressing the House, and the Chair will appreciate that.  I find myself somewhat restricted.  In discussing the question of increasing the rates, is it not in order for me to make a kindly <Col N="475" /> suggestion to the Minister as to how he might reduce the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the rates is one of the major subheads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I am not allowed to talk about the increase in rates.  I will no longer continue in that vein, but I will approach the voluntary aid hospitals. There is, Sir, a Supplementary Estimate of £1,080,000 for the Hospitals Trust Fund Grant-in-Aid.  Reading the Minister's speech it appears to me that the reason for that increase is that charges have become greater than they were heretofore, that salaries are increasing and that the hospitals themselves find that the maintenance of patients is costing them considerably more than heretofore.  That poses another problem. I got no indication from the Minister's speech as to how he proposes to reduce those charges.</P>
      <P>The only way in which I see they can be met is by acknowledging the fact that the health services are increasing and voting this sum of £1,080,000.  I should like the Minister when he is replying to make it clear to the House whether this sum of £1,080,000 which he is asking for, and which I am sure he will get, is the only sum that is required?  In other words, are the local authorities&mdash;not necessarily my own local authority but the local authorities throughout Ireland as a whole&mdash; supposed to put down £ for £ with this £1,080,000 in order to meet the charges they will have to meet when they send patients to voluntary hospitals for treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> That brings me to the suggestion about hospitalisation which we find in the country at the moment.  According to what I have been told, there is to be a reorganisation of the hospitals system, regional hospitals are to be introduced and the county hospitals are to disappear altogether.  It seems to be the present intention to abolish the county hospitals.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question last week the Minister said it was not a question of abolishing Wexford County Hospital but of abolishing all the county hospitals. If that is so, it seems to me that the charges which were borne by the local authorities will be imposed on them from some other direction. Therefore, regretfully I come back to the rates.  It appears to me that if we abolish our county hospitals we are abolishing a saving and a considerable saving on the rates, because patients will have to be sent elsewhere and the local authority will have to pay for them.  That is something which even the economists would be unable to get around.  The trouble with this country is that everything is worked out in the brilliant minds of the economists.</P>
    <P>The county hospital in Wexford has been there for 100 years, efficiently and well run by up-to-date surgeons under the aegis of the Sisters of St. John of God.  That is to be abolished and swept aside in spite of the fact that for the past 40 years we have been promised a new hospital in Wexford.  Now we are told that there is a regional scheme. Does that not mean that the patients who were treated before in our own hospital will have to be sent elsewhere, and that someone has to pay for them? Hitherto the hospital dealt with all major problems.  It was only the odd case that was sent to the voluntary aid hospitals in Dublin.  Ordinary operative conditions such as strangulated hernia, perforated gastric ulcer, or appendicitis were dealt with in the local hospital at practically no cost whatsoever to the local authority.</P>
    <P>The answer is that there will be regional hospitals under the control of the local authorities concerned.  That is all fine, but once you cross a county boundary today you have got to pay&mdash; you have got to get the money.  The <Col N="477" /> Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that if we send a patient from Wexford to Kilkenny, Kilkenny will have to be paid.  I understand the Parliamentary Secretary is a member of the Kilkenny County Council.  I am not a member of the Wexford County Council but as a public representative I have an interest in the matter of rates and I consider that the regional system may save money and that in the final analysis it may be beneficial from some angles. But it is a paper scheme which does not cover the immediate problems.</P>
    <P>The suggested position at the moment is that anybody in Wexford who will require an operation from 1972 onwards will have to be transferred to Waterford for that purpose. That means that such people will have to travel from some areas in Wexford farther than if they were going to Dublin.  It means also they will have to cross the bridge at New Ross and go through the town where traffic conditions are pretty bad and cause considerable delay.  I ask in all reason if it is suggested here that a person suffering from an immediate surgical emergency, instead of being moved to the local hospital, should be asked to go 40, 50, 60 or sometimes 70 miles to be operated on in Waterford.</P>
    <P>This is one of the beautiful dreams devised in the Custom House.  These dreams have been dreamt there but the result does not always work according to plan.  It is a matter the Minister for Health should consider seriously. He has informed me that he is not directly responsible for the suggestion &mdash;that it was apparently brought into being in the proposals of the FitzGerald committee.  That may be, but the only chance a Deputy has of citing a case is on the floor of Dáil Éireann.  Here, as public representatives, we can give our opinions as we see them from the facts we know.  I have had letters about the transfer of the Wexford operating centre of Waterford from different organisations. Even the soroptomists wrote to me.  The Irish Country-women's Association, the Association for the Blind, every philanthropic organisation in the country have written to me on this subject.  I got a fresh letter this morning from another society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I ask the Minister for Health and those who advise him to realise that this is a fatal mistake.  In the final analysis you will have two hospitals. You will have one in Waterford which I have no doubt will be found to be a failure and you will have to have another in Wexford.  Give us the hospital at Dunwoody which will save a lot of anxiety not only to patients but to relatives.  There is the humanitarian problem that when people go to hospital their relatives like to visit them and to do so they may have to travel considerable distances.  The sort of people who will be transferred to regional hospitals will have relatives who will not have the funds to travel to visit them. I ask the Minister to give this matter sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to make in relation to the regional system. I am glad to see that there is great knowledge now and appreciation of the need in this country to do something for severely handicapped children.  This work is under the control of the Department of Health and I am happy that the Department are showing considerable sympathy towards it.  Here, again, we propose a regional system, somebody having devised another beautiful dream in the Custom House.  We have been told that in three or four years there will not be a severely handicapped child awaiting admission.  At the moment there are 380 or 340 awaiting admission and in three years that situation will not exist.  We are to have up-to-date fireproof structures for fear these children, who are not the same as others, might burn them down.  It is far more likely that one of these children would fall into the open fire in his own cottage while he is waiting for admission.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that the Minister for Health appears to be sympathetic to the idea that this is a problem we must deal with immediately. If we are to deal with it immediately, we cannot wait until this beautiful dream in the Custom House, or wherever it originated, is realised. We must institute temporary establishments. Such establishments would not be needed for only three or four years <Col N="479" /> but for 20 years or more.  These temporary establishments would be localised in the counties concerned, not regionalised.  Anybody who has had experience as I have had, thank heavens not in my own family but through dealing with the problem in a period of four or five years, is aware that it is very difficult to get parents first of all to come forward and let you know they have handicapped children, and, secondly, to consent to have the child transferred to an institution. It is unsatisfactory to have these children kept in their homes because not alone do they wear out their parents but they are bad for the other children and the sooner they are domiciled elsewhere the better.  When you come to a parent and tell him that he can get admission for the child after three years, if this beautiful dream works out, and that the child will be transferred to an institution 40 or 50 miles away, as likely as not you will get a refusal.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should consider seriously this problem of the licensing and the assistance they may give to the voluntary committees growing up all over the country.  I have been particularly interested in the mental handicap committee in Wexford of which I am a member.  I know of other committees in other counties who are equally anxious to get mentally handicapped children into institutions as soon as possible.  The only thought is to get them into temporary institutions that will exist for 20 years, and it may well be that these temporary institutions will become permanent.</P>
    <P>It may be asked how are they to be financed.  We must come to the Department of Health for some capital funds the same as is done in social services, the Department of Education, for instance, being asked to build schools.  The Department of Health will have to assist local committees to do the same in the matter of the provision of local institutions, the Department going into co-operation with the various committees.  This is something which the Department must consider actively as the answer to this <Col N="480" /> problem.  The continuing financing of these institutions, we hope, will be done by the local authorities and by voluntary contributions from different societies in different parts of the country.  That is the right way.  It is healthy co-operation between private enterprise and the State.  That is where we will get results.  When dealing with medical services, you will always get better results if you have co-operation between the philanthropic and humanitarian societies and private enterprise, plus the State.  Private enterprise must reign supreme in the medical services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only a few brief remarks on this Vote which has been gone over very ably by our spokesman on Health, Deputy Kyne. I hope the few remarks I I have to make will be allowed and I make the case that they should be allowed because of the fact that a token sum of £10 was arranged for under this Estimate.  Let me quote the Minister's own words at column 279 of the Dáil Debates of the 12th March, 1969:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...a token sum of £10 under Subhead A to enable discussion to take place on the main Estimate which has already been agreed to.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of health authorities are in constant touch with the sick at that level and also at personal level and, therefore, we realise that this must be the most important Estimate to come before the House.  I say this while bearing in mind the enormous importance of other Estimates such as those for Education, Local Government and so on.  However, I think that education, social services and housing only assume an importance for those who have their health because health is the most important possession we have as human beings and for that reason we should not count the cost as being of the greatest importance when dealing with the health of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the services are constituted at present there can be no doubt that considerable hardship exists for a large number of people and the Minister in the course of his address referred to the need to make the entitlement of such people better known. Until the present <Col N="481" /> system is changed, there will always be great involvement in health matters for public representatives.  Perhaps there is too much discretionary power at the moment.  This, in effect, brings public representatives into the picture in trying to claim and to argue the entitlement of people to benefits which they should normally be entitled to.</P>
    <P>A particularly sore point with us at the moment is the question of the cost of drugs.  Drugs have now become the most costly element in an illness and their cost seems to increase all the time.  I do not know if there is any control over the price of drugs; I expect there is but to the ordinary person it would appear that there is no way of anticipating what the price of any particular drug will be because of the fact that prices vary so much.  This constitutes an enormous hardship to the medical card holder as well as to the person within the middle income group who is not a medical card holder.  It can affect to a great degree the medical card holder who, for some personal or other reason, decides to seek the advice of a doctor outside his dispensary area.  The cost of the visit to the dispensary will not prove very costly but the cost of the drugs prescribed by the doctor might well prove far beyond the reach of the person concerned and unless the dispensary doctor signs the prescription issued by another doctor or by a specialist to whom the patient has been referred there are no means by which we can induce our health authorities to bear the cost of these prescriptions.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the amount of money being spent by authorities on medicines for those outside the lower income groups.  I think it was the year 1967 to which he was referring when he said that the authorities spent £61,000 on such medicines.  This might seem to be a fairly big sum but I know that if all those who were so entitled got their entitlement to medicines such as this the cost would be far greater and that a great deal of hardship would be alleviated.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that while there is a barrier between those who pay for health services and those who <Col N="482" /> do not pay and while those who do not pay receive a restricted service, there is an injustice being done to the dignity of the human being and particularly human beings who are ill.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned personally with the care of the aged and I was glad to hear the Minister refer at length to this matter in the course of his introductory speech.  I was glad, too, to hear him comment at one stage &mdash; I think it was in reply to a remark made by Deputy Ryan &mdash; that it would be much better to pay a certain sum every week to keep a patient in his own home than to pay a much greater sum to institutionalise the patient.  The fact is that sons, daughters or relatives might well be prepared to look after the aged or the sick if only some compensation were available.  If a person has stamps, compensation will be available from the Department of Social Welfare and if a person has not stamps there is home assistance available but I would appeal to the Minister for Health and to anybody in a position to control or influence the course of health services to try to get away from the idea of home assistance.  The rigid means test and the whole concept of charity which surrounds this type of payment makes the system an outmoded and Victorian one.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the payment of money to people in the lower income groups should be looked into. We have a most demoralising system in regard to payments of this kind.  It is certainly no compensation to a son or more often a daughter who has to give up employment or, perhaps, who has never been able to take up employment because of the fact that he or she had an ailing or aged relative to look after.  It should not be left to home assistance to compensate such a person but rather a system more in keeping with the dignity of the person should be devised &mdash; a system which would recognise the enormous contribution that person is making to the community.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is time that vouchers were done away with where at all possible.  These vouchers are tags on a person's inability to pay and tags on a system which should not <Col N="483" /> exist in 1969.  Travel vouchers, perhaps, might be the exception but the idea of handing out vouchers for food and shoes, etc., has had its day.  It should cease.  In his speech the Minister referred to the question of patients in mental hospitals, to the enormous incidence of mental illness, and to overcrowding in mental hospitals throughout the country.  Nowhere in Ireland is that realised as much as it is in Cork.  We have an enormous mental hospital &mdash; Our Lady's Hospital &mdash;which is grossly overcrowded.  We have taken fairly advanced steps to relieve the situation, and to start from scratch and make a completely new approach to the whole question of mental health services, by establishing an acute unit in the relatively empty St. Stephen's Hospital which was once a TB hospital and we are lucky to have available.  There exists an enormous problem of overcrowding and a lot of improvement is necessary in Our Lady's Hospital.  I would ask the Minister to accede to any demands from that hospital for funds or to any requests for improvements.  The need is enormous.  I have seen beds where patients could scarcely stretch out their hands without touching other beds. Such overcrowding would not be conducive to the speedy improvement and restoration to health of a mental patient.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the relegation of aged persons to mental hospitals.  This is one of the reasons why so many hospitals are overcrowded. Many senile people, or people who have nothing wrong with them except their age, are being relegated to mental hospitals.  We still have to have a new approach to this question. We are all conscious of the problem but I do not know whether our approach is impatient enough.  We know the problem is there, but we do not know whether we are doing enough to see it properly solved.  These aged people cannot apparently be kept at home but they do not deserve to end their days in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>The whole question of mental illness is receiving a great deal of attention now and I hope it will receive more <Col N="484" /> attention in the immediate future. I can imagine in a very short number of years that people will raise their eyes in horror when they are told that aged people were put into hospital just because they were old and their illness was mental illness.  We must get to the stage where mental illness is treated in the same way as other illness.  I am sure that day is not far off when people who have no personal experience of the matter will be horrified when they hear that we shut people away in institutions.  The day will shortly come when mental illness will be treated as TB is today.  Not long ago it was something of a disgrace to have TB and we had an unenlightened attitude to TB that is laughable today. The same will apply to mental illness in a short number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to another matter about which I am very concerned, and that is the question of dental health.  At local level I have been concerned with the question of dentistry.  I was disappointed at the Minister's remarks.  He mentioned that dentists were scarce but there seemed to be no indication that he was beginning to grapple with the enormous shortage of dentists that exists.  We all want to improve the dental service.  We are all conscious of the need for dental care that exists in children.  Modern foods and the modern approach to the treatment of children, and perhaps an overindulgence in sweets, means the children's teeth do need care.  We had a situation obtaining in Cork Health Authority where we provided service in the City Hall at Cork.  It was a voluntary service and one which parents were at liberty to avail of without being referred to it by a visiting dentist.  It existed for a number of years, but the shortage of dentists was such that this service never really did what it set out to do.  We had to confine its activities to children under the age of ten years.  Any of us who have children know that children under the age of ten years have, with a reasonable degree of care, fairly good teeth. Their first teeth fall at six to eight years of age and they acquire a second set over the following couple of years and in that time their teeth are reasonabl <Col N="485" /> ably good.  Over the age of ten years children may have trouble with cavities and dental decay.  We were confining our activities to children under that age and were not catering at all for the needs of those who perhaps needed even more dental treatment.  Even with that curtailed service we found that we could not continue due to lack of dentists. The Health Authority advertised for dentists but were told that they could not be got.</P>
    <P>We have now reverted to a schools service for the last 12 months.  Parents in these areas are beginning to ask when is the schools service coming to their school as they do not get service at the City Hall.  We do not know, but we do know that the service is inadequate. During the lifetime of the previous voluntary dental service we had cases where people needing extractions got teeth extracted immediately but if they had cavities they were referred back for six months.  After that period the cavities, in some cases, had deteriorated to a stage where extraction was necessary.  That was the situation operating then but the situation is worse now.  In County Cork we are deeply conscious of the problem of the shortage of dentists.  It is not enough to say we have not dentists and leave it at that.  We must encourage dentists to come into the service and ensure that we have enough dentists to provide for the children of the nation proper dental services.  Much depends on proper dentistry. We want our children to grow up strong and healthy and to do our best for the next generation.  They will not grow up in such a manner if they are allowed to grow up without proper dental treatment and care.  Such a lack definitely interferes with their future health.</P>
    <P>The approach to dental health is appalling.  I was disappointed that the Minister was so brief in his remarks on the question of the improvement of the dental service.  He referred very briefly to arrangements being made for fluoridation in those areas which will not have fluoridated water supplies. This is another example of the lack of a link between the Department of Health and other Departments.  I have mentioned over and over again that <Col N="486" /> we have a situation sometimes where one Department is completely out of touch with another.  We have a Minister talking about areas without fluoridated water.  The fact is that the majority of those areas have no water at all. Vast areas in this country have no water at all.  There are areas where water has to be conserved and as much use as possible made of it because of the hardship of bringing it to the house. This is really a health problem and one on which there should be some link between the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government, which is responsible for the bringing of water supplies to rural Ireland.  There is very little talk about it.</P>
    <P>We have another problem in Cork Health Authority.  We have the problem of the payment of disabled persons' maintenance allowances.  In the Cork Health Authority we were conscious of the need to provide more comfort for aged people.  Many of these people find their way into hospital for no reason other than destitution and because they are not able to provide the extra money required to provide the extra nourishment which a disabled person needs as well as the extra money required to provide heat.  Conscious of these aspects we unanimously decided to pay disabled persons' maintenance allowances to people over 70 as well as to people under 70.  There appears to be no legal difficulty in doing this but our manager thought otherwise.  I still contend that he was wrong in thinking otherwise.  However, he refused to do this.  I know that the Minister is concerned with the plight of old people, particularly those in our institutions, and I would ask him to impresss on people like the manager of the Cork Health Authority the need and the desirability of making payments from any source open to us to elderly people, particularly disabled elderly people. Such a small payment might perhaps enable the person to provide more comfort for himself or herself or enable small jobs, perhaps strenuous ones, to be done for that person which the person could not do himself.  If such payments are not made many of these people will find their way into hospitals, where they will be <Col N="487" /> unhappy and will, through no fault of their own, be clogging up our health system.  On the other hand, if they are at home and are treated properly, having proper social assistance, social workers to attend to them and a proper domiciliary service it will mean that the turn-over in our hospitals will be far greater and the system will operate more efficiently and competently than it can do at present.</P>
    <P>I could not leave this Estimate without referring to the problem of mentally handicapped children.  This is a problem about which we are all concerned and I am glad to see that so much is being done for these children by voluntary organisations and by the Department.  However, a great deal more needs to be done.  The Minister in his introductory speech said that over the past few years 880 additional places had been provided for mentally handicapped children.  We are all in agreement with the efforts being made in this direction but it is not enough to say that we can tackle the problem bit by bit and that finally it will be solved. The whole future of these children is at stake.  Some of them are suffering from mild handicap, some from moderate handicap and some from severe handicap, and in the case of the first two categories a great deal can be done to turn these children into useful citizens who can cope for themselves in the future.  There is a time when these things can be done but if we allow it to pass we can never catch up on it again.  It is like providing an educational system for ordinary, healthy schoolchildren.  If we leave the problem for another four or five years then we will have missed the opportunity of developing the capacities which these children have and which can be developed if they are properly trained.  These children are our first responsibility and we should give them first priority.  Everything we can do to help them should be done this year and not next year.</P>
    <P>We do not hear so much about our physically handicapped children, our blind children and our deaf children, who can become useful citizens with proper training arising from the proper <Col N="488" /> approach.  For these children, too, we should do all we can.  There is a research unit in Dublin which has done a great deal in regard to the problem of mental illness.  This is a very formidable problem but anything that we do in this regard will bring a hundredfold reward in the future.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the old question of the financing of the health services. While we are conscious all the time of the cost of these services we should still aim to provide the best we can in the knowledge that this must be done. The question of financing the services is a very thorny one.  The collection of the necessary money by taxation or by rates is really a case of &ldquo;six of one and half a dozen of another.&rdquo; The rating system, of course, is completely inequitable and rates are being extracted from people who have nothing but the homes in which they live.  On the other hand, taxes are being extracted from people with only £6 5s or £6 10s a week.  However, this is not the occasion on which to debate the means of collecting revenue and all I am saying is that both systems are inequitable. The ratepayers are up in arms in regard to the imposition of health service charges and each year they say that a good deal more of the cost should be borne by the Exchequer and by the people generally through taxation. This is quite true, this should be done, but again we have the problem of evolving a more equitable system of taxation.  I will conclude by saying that we should address ourselves to that problem but, above all, we should bear in mind that the health service is the most important service we can provide and that it is not a question of whether or not we can afford it; we must provide the best possible service and find ways and means of financing it and distributing the cost as equitably as possible on our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate dealing with the health of our people, their very lives, and with the cost of providing these services.  The financing of the health services is the most hotly debated subject at all local authority and health <Col N="489" /> authority meetings.  As the last Deputy said, no matter how we manage it, somebody must pay.  The unfortunate thing is that the rates are increasing year after year and they are imposing a very real burden on all sections of the community.  Indeed, there are many small business people in the towns who are not able to carry on because of the increased costs.  It is a problem about which the Minister has received various deputations.  In Dublin 95 per cent of our charges are statutory and we cannot do anything about them.</P>
      <P>A number of our people are members of the Voluntary Health Insurance. If we could get more people to join, it might relieve a lot of the charges we have to meet.  The Minister for Health received the members of the Dublin County Council in a most courteous, kindly way.  I have no doubt that, if he could get the money, he would relieve the rates not alone in Dublin but all over the country, but we have many demands on the Central Exchequer and you cannot take the trousers off a Highlander.  I understand an inter-departmental committee has been set up to deal with the problem of rates and the rating system. At the moment people on static incomes, especially people on small pensions from the Civil Service, local authorities and so on, are asked to pay.  We have a system in the Dublin Health Authority whereby we help the old age pensioners, the poor widow and people like that, but it is taking it out of one pocket and putting it into the other.  At least we are trying to eliminate hardship.  We are concerned with individuals.  We are concerned to see that they do not suffer. We know we have the sympathy of the Minister and the Government.  We are all concerned about the increase in rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to home assistance, we have set up a very efficient social welfare department under the auspices of the Dublin Health Authority.  We are concerned to see that no individual in our society is hungry or in want. If we must err on this side of generosity in regard to home assistance and home help, I feel we should do it.  I have agitated for this for many years.  I have <Col N="490" /> been a member of that authority for nine years and I happened to be chairman of it for one year.  I am concerned with individuals.  I am concerned to see that nobody is hungry or in want.  I feel we have the backing of the Minister and his Departmental officers in this.</P>
    <P>If we err at all let us err on the side of generosity.  Home assistance does not apply only to old age pensioners and widows.  It applies to anybody from any walk of life who may, through no fault of his own, find himself in want.  You may have the case of a father dying and leaving five or six children.  I dealt with a case this morning where a father died and left five or six young chlidren, the oldest nine years of age.  They have not a penny.  The rent of their house is £4 a week.  We had to go to their aid. Otherwise, we would have them in St. Kevin's Hospital or some other institution.</P>
    <P>Under the auspices of the Dublin Health Authority we also have the &ldquo;Meals on Wheels&rdquo; scheme.  I want to take this opportunity of thanking the voluntary organisations and the religious organisations, the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charitable organisations for their work in this line.  We are dealing with about 2,000 old age pensioners in the Dublin Health Authority area.  It is a good investment to help these people because we have too many aged people in our hospitals and homes and we have not room for them all.  It is very costly on the Exchequer to keep them in hospital. We should be a little more generous with old age pensioners and look after them better.  I am concerned with people who are living alone.  I want to say that sons and daughters should have regard for their fathers and mothers.  In other countries in which I have travelled on deputations I have found them doing that.  I have found them doing it in Ireland, too.  There are thousands of children in Ireland looking after their fathers and mothers reasonably well, but you also find that section who are living alone and are nobody's children.  I feel that, if we are generous to them and help them, we will save them from coming into hospital <Col N="491" /> suffering from malnutrition.  I know the Minister is very concerned about the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>There are also people who are prematurely old and dejected even at 60 and are not entitled to any benefit except home assistance.  We are concerned about these people.  It is the concern of our society to help them. The voluntary organisations have been doing their best.  They cannot do much because they have only a certain amount of money which they get in voluntary contributions.  Things have improved a good deal.  The contributory old age pensioners have succeeded in becoming reasonably well off as far as the resources of the State can afford. However, this is another day's work. This is for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin we have seven per cent or eight per cent of the population with medical cards.  I feel that an old age pensioner who is not working should have a medical card automatically. This would be an encouragement for the sons and daughters to keep them.  I have known cases where old age pensioners have gone to hospital and the son or daughter has been billed with the expense for the time they were in hospital.  I am not dealing specifically with the contributory old age pensioner.  If he works for a few years after getting the contributory pension he is better off than he was at 60 because he has his pension as well as his pay but I am dealing with the person who is not working.</P>
    <P>I believe home help is very essential. I believe it would stop people from going to hospital.  If a daughter is working and has to stay at home to look after her mother, I believe it is the concern of the Minister to see that she gets something.  By giving that girl something to support herself while she is not working she will be able to look after the old person at home.  If that old person has to go into hospital it costs the Dublin Health Authority £15 or £20 a week, so by giving £4 or £5 a week to the person who is staying at home from work we shall save public money and relieve a lot of congestion in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Many of these charges should be subsidised by the Department of Health.  While the Department of Health gives a direct subvention to the hospitals, home assistance, home help and things like that are the responsibility of the local authority.  It is time that the State gave a 50 per cent or some substantial contribution towards these costs to which I have referred, because it is one of the biggest jobs we have.</P>
    <P>There are a number of geriatric patients who are in mental hospitals because we have no suitable place to put them.  We want our psychiatric hospitals to be acute hospitals as far as possible, but they are cluttered up with these old patients.  Due to modern treatment some of these people are living to 100 years of age.  During the year I was chairman of St. Kevin's Hospital, and there were three people who had attained the age of 100. People are living longer nowadays and naturally we do not want to see anyone die even for economic reasons.</P>
    <P>Great strides are being made in psychiatric treatment compared to years ago.  In the central psychiatric hospital in Dublin, St. Brendan's, and the two subsidiaries, there can be 100 or 200 patients admitted and a similar number discharged per month.  Even in the small hospital, St. Loman's, there are about 50 admissions and 50 discharges every month.  This shows what modern treatment and a more enlightened outlook can achieve.  A great deal is also being done by way of finding employment for these people and rehabilitating them.  They can go to work and come back to the hospital while they are undergoing treatment.  I wish to thank the Minister, the Secretary of his Department and the officers for the co-operation they have given in this excellent work.  There are a number of old hospitals, including St. Kevin's and other geriatric hospitals, that need to be replaced.  While great advances have been made, there is room for further improvement.</P>
    <P>Since 1953 there has been a big fall in the number of TB cases.  A number of factors contributed to that reduction: first, modern drugs and, secondly, the building of up-to-date <Col N="493" /> hospitals for TB patients. However, one of the most important contributing factors in reducing the incidence of TB was the psychological factor that, under the 1947 Act, a TB allowance was given to the patient.  Heretofore a person suffering from TB would say: &ldquo;What is the use of my going to hospital?  I have a wife and family to support and I have to keep working. If I go to hospital I shall only be worrying.&rdquo;  When the TB allowance came such people could be a little happier going to hospital and getting treatment.  The tragedy today is that TB is being contracted by older people. In my younger days the trend was for people of 16, 18 and up to 30 years to contract it.  Now the trend is the other way, at least under the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    <P>As regards the co-ordinating of various hospitals for more specialised treatment, I am a member of the co-ordinating committee on the north and south sides of the Liffey.  On the federated hospitals side there are seven hospitals plus the Dublin Health Authority, and we have had quite a few meetings with them under the auspices of the Minister for Health. Some progress has been made, but it will take some time to get the most modern hospitals and the best equipment available to treat our people who are ill.  The discussions are only at a preliminary stage.  One such hospital is to be built at St. Kevin's under the auspices of the federated hospitals and the Dublin Health Authority and the other at Elm Park.  By getting the most modern equipment for specialised treatment in a co-ordinated hospital we shall avoid overlapping in the smaller hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the United States they have gone into this problem in a big way, because the charges for medical treatment there have become prohibitive. I have been reading reports of commissions to see what they are trying to do.  If we succeed with the idea the Minister for Health and His Department have at the moment we shall be doing something very sound for which posterity will be thankful to us.  There are a number of small obstacles.  The boards that have been associated with <Col N="494" /> various hospitals for years are naturally conservative and do not want to give up what they have, but in the interests of the well-being of our people, there should be a sane approach to matters of this kind.  The best possible equipment for the treatment of any disease should be available in a particular centre.  In that way the little frustrations experienced by small hospitals would be avoided and the intelligent policy of the Minister and the Department could be implemented.</P>
    <P>On the north side there are three hospitals under the Dublin Health Authority.  Dublin Health Authority are trying to have part of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital utilised as a general hospital.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I feel that his remarks would be more appropriate to the Health Bill, which the Minister has promised to introduce and which will be before the House shortly.  At present the debate is confined to the Estimate before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, and apologise if I have transgressed the laws of courtesy. Great progress has been made in the matter of dental treatment.  I want to take this opportunity of thanking the dentists employed by the Dublin Health Authority for the wonderful work they are doing.  The lectures given to school children on the care of teeth are very useful.  There is, unfortunately, a shortage of dentists.  Dublin Health Authority are trying to overcome that difficulty and a big improvement has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the problem of mentally-handicapped children.  There is a huge waiting list for admission to institutions. Great advances have been made during the last few years.  I know the deep interest the Minister has in this matter and I would ask him to continue the good work he has been doing. Everything possible should be done to help families who have the problem of a mentally-handicapped child.  The care of such a child imposes a great strain on a mother.  I know of one case in Dublin where there are three mentally-handicapped children in one family. This strain on the mother is very <Col N="495" /> severe.  Some parents do not want to have such children admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  A child may be taken into a home and may be transferred after some time to a public hospital.  I have great sympathy with parents who have a mentally-handicapped child. This is a problem which concerns us very deeply.  We have received wonderful co-operation from the Minister and his Department in this matter.  All possible help should be given to parents of mentally-handicapped children.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that I could deal with but I shall conclude by saying that voluntary organisations should co-operate to a greater extent with the Department of Social Welfare and the health authorities.  They are co-operating fairly well.  If at all possible, aged persons should be kept at home in their own surroundings. Dublin Corporation have made an effort in their housing programme to house aged persons with younger families.  We have had the experience that where elderly persons are housed with younger people the younger people have looked after them and have been helpful to them, especially in the case of elderly people who live alone.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Department well.  They have a big job to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Health Act was introduced I was a very young member of a local authority and I remember travelling to the town of Sligo to hear the then Minister for Health tell us that when the Bill was passed everything would be well and that the cost to the ratepayers of the three or four counties represented at that meeting would be not more than 2/- to 2/6d in the £.  One can judge how far out the estimation was and how misleading a statement it was to the members of county councils present when one looks at the estimates for the current year of most county councils and finds that some of them are seeking an increase in rates under the health heading alone of from 4/- to 6/- in the £ in one year.  It is not now but many years ago that the Government Party should <Col N="496" /> have introduced a health scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke referred to the allowance being paid to TB patients in 1947. In case Deputy Burke may have forgotten, I am bound to remind him that in 1947 a brother of mine had TB and we tried to get him into an institution. There was absolutely no chance of getting him into any institution in this country.  Fortunately, a sister of mine, who was nursing in England, came home to care for him.  Were it not for the care that my sister gave my brother I doubt if he would be alive today.  Perhaps, as Deputy Burke says, the Government did pay an allowance at that time; I do not know; but I certainly want to put it on the record of this House that after 1948, when the inter-Party Government had been a very short period in office, nobody had to take his place on a waiting list in order to get into a sanatorium.  The inter-Party Government built sufficient sanatoria to isolate TB patients.  The Members of this House should never forget that, no matter on what side of the House they are.  Certainly the members of my family will never forget it. It is only right to mention that in passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the care of the aged, as some speakers have said, a very big percentage of the people of this country are very kind to their parents and look after them in their old age but there is a very limited number of cases where children neglect their elderly parents.  There is also the case of elderly persons who have no children to look after them.  In the West of Ireland &mdash; I am sure nobody knows this better than the Minister for Health&mdash; in the part of the country he represents, no more than in the part of the country I represent, we have a very big number of old people.  There is a waiting list in most county councils for the admittance of old people into some institution or other &mdash; county homes, and so on.  In one county in the West of Ireland, there is a waiting list of 25 aged people who are living alone and who are trying to get into a home. Some type of institution will have to be built to provide for the accommodation of these people and it must be <Col N="497" /> provided immediately in view of the present desperate situation.</P>
    <P>It might be a considerable help if an allowance were paid to the young people in a house to look after the old people there.  An allowance as high even as £4 a week in respect of mobile aged persons would help to leave accommodation in some institution for aged people who are not mobile.  We must be more than thankful for the work which any society or voluntary organisation is doing for our aged citizens.  If it were possible for some of these people to have a prefabricated unit erected which would be equipped with television, washing-up places, and so on, so that some of our public health nurses could look after the people there, I am sure it would be a great benefit to mobile aged citizens. Something like that, or both of these efforts together, would certainly give relief in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; is outmoded and outdated.  We have inherited it from the British regime in this country.  Probably it was then called &ldquo;outdoor relief&rdquo;.  It means the same thing.  It is a dirty word and the way it is administered is even dirtier. Very often, the people concerned are poor and, like most of us, are too proud to admit it.  Some neighbour or a local councillor might mention the matter to the home assistance officer. An application form has to be filled up and an investigation must be made and then the application must go before the superintendent and up to the county manager for the miserable amount of money which is given to a person under this heading.  In these days, there should be an easier and a better way of doing this.  It is not difficult for a home assistance officer, particularly in the rural parts of our country, to find out the circumstances of a person, thus avoiding the tremendous amount of probing that goes on at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that over the past four years, 880 extra beds have been provided for mentally-handicapped children.  That means that 220 beds were provided, on average, in each of the past four years.  I am sure that every county council in Ireland has a <Col N="498" /> waiting list for the admittance of such unfortunate children into some type of institution.  Certainly, that is the situation in the counties I am most familiar with.  The number of beds under this heading must be increased substantially. When the parents of such a child decide to apply for some type of institutional treatment for the child, its name is put on a waiting list.  Somebody with more influence, although the application may be made later, is able to have his child taken first.  That is most unfair.</P>
    <P>Every mentally-handicapped child should be cared for free in an institution, irrespective of the means of the parents who, undoubtedly, have suffered enough as it is.  We have voluntary organisations all over the country which are doing a tremendous amount of work for these unfortunate children. In the town of Mohill, County Leitrim, a number of people set up a type of school there to give some education to these children who could not get into any boarding institution.  The organisation sought an allowance from the Minister's Department and from the Department of Education in respect of the transport of the children to school but, because a sufficient number of children was not involved, the allowance could not be given.  Surely that is not fair?  An allowance should be made available wherever local people are making an effort such as this.  Were is not for the generosity of the county councils concerned, it would indeed be a sad situation.  The financial help an organisation would get directly from the Department would be very small. Much more help should be given to them.</P>
    <P>We all know that some counties, particularly in the West of Ireland, have advertised for dentists on numerous occasions and are failing to secure them.  Something must be done about this service.  Schoolchildren need dental treatment and that aspect of our health services is very much neglected. I discovered recently that, in one county, the dentist calls to the national school once a year.  Nobody could call that a service.  If the Department of Health is to protect the teeth of our children it will certainly have to increase <Col N="499" /> the number of inspections in our national schools.  An inspection once or twice a year is not sufficient. It will have to be increased to three or four times a year.</P>
    <P>The hospital rationalisation committee reported recently to the Minister. I take exception to the downgrading in that report of the surgical hospital in County Roscommon.  This hospital has given a tremendous service down through the years to the people of that county and to the people of South Leitrim.  I trust the Minister will see to it that the surgical hospital in County Roscommon is not down-graded. We had surgeons there like Mr. O'Hanrahan, who gave a tremendous service at a very cheap price to the people of South Leitrim and North Roscommon.  It would be most unfair to have this hospital down-graded in any way.</P>
    <P>I was glad to read last week that the Minister said we would have the new Health Bill this week, I think.  It is long overdue.  We have only to consider the issue of medical cards and the percentage issued in some counties as against others.  On 26th February I put down a question to the Minister, as reported at column 1729, Volume 238 of the Official Report, asking the Minister for Health the number of applications for medical cards in each year since 1954 for each health authority giving (a) the number of applications received and (b) the number rejected to the latest convenient date.  The Minister replied that the information sought was not available.</P>
    <P>My reason for that question was the disparity in the percentage of medical cards issued in one county compared with another.  On the same day, I think, I had a question asking the Minister the percentage of population covered by medical cards to the latest available date and the Minister gave that information to 31st December.  On going through the percentages we find that County Carlow has 47.2 per cent of its population covered by medical cards. That figure may be reasonable; I do not know anything about Carlow, but here is something worth looking into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> Leitrim has 34.7 per cent, Sligo 35.4 per cent and Roscommon 50.1 per cent of the population covered.  When I discuss this and ask the county manager or the people in the health section in County Leitrim or in County Sligo about this they will tell me it is because the people did not apply.  I know well that the people applied, but County Leitrim and County Sligo have the one county manager who decides who is and who is not entitled to medical cards.</P>
    <P>The net result of this silly way of issuing medical cards is that we have a county manager in Roscommon giving over 50 per cent of his population medical cards &mdash; and if you were to compare any counties in Ireland you would certainly compare Leitrim and Sligo and Roscommon &mdash; while we have a county manager in Leitrim and Sligo who is prepared to give only 34 per cent of the population medical cards. The sooner this method of issuing medical cards is changed, the better and the more satisfactory for all of us. That was why I put down this question. The Minister may be right; the information may not be available, but I do not think it would be very difficult to get it.  If the Minister gives me any encouragement, I will repeat the question.  Probably he did not know what was in my mind in asking the question; it was exactly what I have now explained.</P>
    <P>We have a number of dispensary doctors operating in a temporary capacity in some counties.  In County Roscommon we have them in the following districts: Ballinlough, Lough Glynn, Ballinameen, Athlone No. 2 and Athleague.  I think the Department wrote to Roscommon County Council saying that any vacancies should be filled only in a temporary capacity. That is not the right procedure.  If the county council can get people to occupy the dispensaries permanently, the Department should sanction that.</P>
    <P>As regards disabled persons' allowances, we have the case of the person who is ill or not physically fit and who applies to the local authority for this allowance.  He must get a certificate from the local dispensary doctor saying he is not physically fit. He is then <Col N="501" /> examined by the local MOH who sometimes cannot make up his mind whether or not the person is disabled. I remember that once we had a MOH in my county and an unfortunate man who grew up to only about four feet and was 28 years of age and had a hunchback applied for an allowance. The MOH could not make up his mind whether or not he was disabled and decided to send him to an orthopaedic surgeon.  How daft can these people be with this sort of carry-on, or where will it end if it is allowed to go on?  If you take it up with the Department they will say they have no control over it.  One day, while this procedure was going on, I suggested to the MOH that I would take this boy into a county council meeting.  Then he decided he was disabled.  It is terrible that a county MOH cannot make up his mind whether a person in these circumstances is disabled or not.</P>
    <P>After going through all this we then have the home assistance officer waiting to investigate means and going to the person's parents or brother or whoever lives with him to see what land they have and what stock is on it. Ultimately, the poor fellow ends up by getting 50 per cent of the disabled person's allowance.  That is a desperate situation.  In this particular case I think the man should have got the maximum allowance, that there should be no doubt about it.  He lived with his mother who was a very old woman. The means test is too rigid and I think 90 per cent of such people should get the maximum allowance.</P>
    <P>We come now to the burning question of rates which is troubling all of us.  We find that last year 35 per cent of the rate collection was for health. At present we have 87 rating authorities, 27 county councils, 49 urban authorities, seven boroughs and corporations and four county boroughs.  In 1968/69 a total of £37,660,000 was collected, of which 35 per cent was for health services.  That was an increase over the previous year of £2,950,000. One would be inclined to ask at this stage what will be the increase in the current year if it was over £2 million last year.  It will certainly be much greater.  We are all prepared to admit, although the Government do not seem <Col N="502" /> to be doing anything about it, that this rating system is out of date and outmoded.</P>
    <P>These words were used by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency in the last general election. He said they would revise the system, that they would make some change.  However, nothing has happened and, each time one looks into the matter, it becomes just a little bit more ridiculous because some county councils get only £150 if they increase the rates by one penny while others will get an income of £2,500; and, coupled with that, there is recoupment to the tune of 50 per cent.  The system is outmoded and out-dated.  It is a most unfair system in present circumstances. I trust the Minister will introduce the new Bill very soon and that this problem in connection with the rates will be solved.  The Government have on numerous occasions accepted most Fine Gael policy.  If there is one particular Fine Gael policy they should accept it is Fine Gael policy in relation to health services.  The Minister for Finance referred to it in the last Budget.  There will be no comfort until all are on the one level.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme has proved that.  The only solution is a contributory scheme and the Minister has his opportunity now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters falling to be dealt with on this Supplementary Estimate will fall to be dealt with again on the promised health legislation but, since it is likely to be some time before that Bill comes before the House, there are some aspects of the present health services to which I think it is appropriate to refer.  The fact that so much money is spent on health services indicates the extent to which the community and this House are concerned with the need to provide the best possible health services for all our people and, in particular, for those of our community who are not able to look after their own health needs out of their own resources or the resources of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present health services grew up in a patchwork sort of way.  Many of <Col N="503" /> the defects inherent in them are a legacy from another era from an alien Administration.  That does not absolve us from trying to provide health services not merely catering for those who require them but also financed and paid for on an equitable basis. Many of the services at the moment do not provide either the benefits or the financial assistance we would like them to provide.  The real area of disagreement arises out of the method of payment for the services.  I agree with the Minister that, no matter how the services are provided, and trusting that the services provided in the future will be higher than those provided at the moment, it is inevitable that they will cost money.  It is equally inevitable that the more the services are improved the greater will be the cost.  Agreement is fairly general on this and I should like now to quote from the White Paper issued by the Government some years ago in which it was stated at paragraph 116:</P>
    <P>The Government, having studied this issue, are satisfied that the local rates are not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money on this scale.  It is therefore proposed that the cost of further extensions of the services could not be met in any proportion by the local rates. Following this decision, other possible sources of revenue to meet the additional cost are being considered. It seems likely that the general body of central taxation must bear the major part of the burden.  Pending further consideration of the methods by which extensions of the health service will be financed in future years the Government have decided to make arrangements which will ensure that the local cost of the service falling on the rates for 1966-67 will not exceed the cost for the year 1965-66.</P>
    <P>At that time there was specific relief for that year.  Whether the health services are paid for out of rates or out of central taxation, the obvious fact is that they must be paid for, but there is one very clear difference and distinction. As I understand it, approximately one-seventh of the population are <Col N="504" /> liable in respect of rates.  If the burden of cost were spread over the community as a whole it would be much more widely spread.  Most of us are naturally concerned with the impact in our own particular area.  In respect of the Dún Laoghaire Borough the proportion of the rate required for health is the largest single item in the rates estimate. It is over 34 per cent of the total rate.  The estimated increase this year is 1/- in the £.  Out of a total rate last year of 67/- in the £ no less than 24/4d was in respect of health services. Most people feel that the burden of expenditure falling on ratepayers is excessive because of the manner in which liability falls to be met.  In respect of most other forms of raising public funds&mdash;in respect of a certain proportion at any rate of expenditure and thereby a certain proportion of the money raised from taxation &mdash; people have a choice, but, when it comes to rates, people have absolutely no choice, irrespective of their capacity to meet them.</P>
    <P>The rate is fixed on the basis of the valuation.  While older buildings are based on old-time valuations, nevertheless in many cases the valuations bear no relation to the actual capacity of the person to pay.  Therefore, I want to urge the Minister on these Estimates to consult with his colleagues in the Government in order to try to meet the very serious problem which health authorities face this year.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that the whole question of the health services will be discussed on the Bill which is to be introduced, and which it is proposed to circulate shortly.  The fact is that by the time that piece of legislation is enacted into law, most of this financial year will probably have elapsed, and the problems which the rating authorities are faced with will not be eased by the proposals for the health services included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the Dún Laoghaire and the Dublin Health Authority is particularly acute.  Statistics have been published, not merely the figure which I have quoted.  It is a fact that, although the present health services are based on a 50-50 contribution from the State and the local authorities, <Col N="505" /> the urban ratepayers pay a higher proportion than the rural ratepayers in respect of health services.</P>
    <P>It was intimated in the Budget last year, and I understand it has since been confirmed, that an investigation is being undertaken of a proposed method of financing the health services on an insurance basis.  We have argued for many years that this is the proper way to finance the health services.  As Deputy Reynolds said a few minutes ago, the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme confirms that. Undoubtedly, it is confined at the present stage to a relatively limited section of the community as a whole, but the fact that it has worked so satisfactorily on a limited scale justifies its extension to the general body of persons covered by the health services.</P>
    <P>It is only right that in considering this Estimate tribute should be paid to the voluntary organisations.  The Minister and other speakers have adverted to the great work which is being done. This applies particularly to the groups catering for the aged.  Undoubtedly, because of their activities, the proportion of elderly people in the Dublin Health Authority area admitted to institutions under the control of the authority has dropped.  Unfortunately, many of these organisations are formed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and, in many cases, operate without any great help except what they can organise locally.  The help and assistance provided by them and the comfort and consideration they extend to aged persons living in their localities are a very real and considerable benefit to the persons concerned. It is paradoxical that, for many reasons, very often elderly people living in urban areas are more lonely than people living in the country.  In many cases they have no relatives living near them and consequently they depend to a considerable extent on the help of bodies of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the proposals in regard to retarded children. I am glad to see that progress has been made towards providing a unit at Stillorgan in my constituency.  Those of us who have been approached by constituents are concerned at the lack of adequate accommodation for retarded <Col N="506" /> children.  This is one area in which there has never been a satisfactory solution in respect of education and training for some of these cases.  For too long the matter has been passed between the Department of Health and the Department of Education, with neither accepting responsibility for what each Department claimed was the duty and area of operation of the other.  That was particularly unsatisfactory in these cases, because the unfortunate children and their parents or their families are the direct sufferers.  I believe that the need for much greater facilities for retarded and autistic children is very considerable.  Up to now I think the unit at St. Loman's was virtually the only one available.  In my constituency at Stillorgan there is a special school for deaf children.  The work which is carried out there by the Sisters, the application of modern teaching methods, and the use of technical and other modern facilities and equipment, make an enormous difference, and make it possible for those children to get the benefit of training which would not otherwise be available to them.</P>
    <P>The need for further facilities for retarded children is very considerable. Deputy Reynolds also referred to the suffering and anxiety, and the sense of sorrow and tragedy, which prevail in a household where there is a retarded child.  There is an obligation on all of us to try to provide a much better health service than that with which we were satisfied up to the present.</P>
    <P>In advocating a proper health service, referred to by Deputy Ryan and others, we have proposed a service based on insurance in order to do away with some of the objectionable features of the present service.  Most people find that the officials of local authorities, in investigating individual cases, operate in as reasonable and fair a manner as possible, but the very nature of the system is defective and, from any point of view, is objectionable. Many of us are familiar with cases of people in receipt of old age pensions, contributory or non-contri-butory, who find that in respect of some health service they require, perhaps, medicine prescribed, they are obliged to look for a medical card. <Col N="507" /> They then have to submit themselves to an inquiry or inquisition under the present system.  A great many of them resent it for many reasons, some of them because they feel that once they are entitled to pensions they should also be entitled to the consequential services which follow.</P>
    <P>Our proposal to establish a health service based on insurance seems now to be generally accepted as a practical proposal.  What the Government announced in the course of the Budget&mdash;this has since been said to be the subject of investigation&mdash;justifies us in expressing our conviction that this is the only method whereby a proper, adequate health service, which will provide benefits to the standards required, can be financed.  Undoubtedly, it must, as any service will, cost money.  It will involve contributions from the persons insured, from the employers and from the State.</P>
    <P>The defect in the present system is that a great many people are obliged to pay an ever rising charge by way of rates irrespective of their capacity to pay, of their economic and financial circumstances.  At the same time, their neighbours as well as themselves find objectionable the health service now in existence which is not merely inadequate but incapable of providing the standards they require.  Our proposals provide that apart from persons now covered, such as old age pensioners and those in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and home assistance, farmers with low poor law valuations would be given these services and with medicines. We also propose that such a service would be based on a choice of family doctor and that hospital and specialist services would be available.</P>
    <P>One of the special problems which most persons have is the cost of drugs and medicines.  Despite all the modern developments both in the production and sale of drugs and medicines, it is characteristic of modern medicine that drugs and other medicines become ever more costly and an increasingly greater burden on those obliged to pay.  Those of us with experience of the work of the Dublin Health Authority have found that people have been shown to <Col N="508" /> need a contribution in respect of the cost of expensive drugs.  In many cases persons who apply for medical cards to the Dublin Health Authority are not deemed to be entitled to cards because of their incomes, but cases occur where either the wage-earner or his wife or family have prescribed for them expensive drugs and medicine, and in these cases the authority make contributions. All these cases require examination and investigation as to means, and it is probably this aspect of the health service provided by statutory authorities that evoked the recent comment by the Bishop of Killaloe.</P>
    <P>Many people who approach public representatives do so because they find either they are not able to state adequately their cases or are unaware of the help and relief which will be provided. Those of us who have had occasion to deal with the Dublin Health Authority are familiar with the large number of cases where the applicants are not considered to be entitled to medical cards but where, because of the high cost of medicines, they are deemed eligible for contributions for whichever period prescriptions are regarded as necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposals which we make include the provision of community welfare centres.  It is completely in line with the experience, on a limited scale, of voluntary bodies.  We are familiar with voluntary institutions and committees who operated in the past, including nursing organisations which no longer exist and which did great work. At present there are many voluntary groups in different areas.  They provide for the needs of old folks and others. Their work has provided an immense service in Dublin in respect of the voluntary hospital.  The contribution which the voluntary hospitals have made to medicine in Dublin for generations has won for these hospitals and their staffs a high reputation not only in this city and in the country but abroad.  I was glad to understand that no proposals are in contemplation which would in any way weaken the area of responsibility of the voluntary hospitals or lessen the contribution which the voluntary hospitals are making to medicine and the care of sick persons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> The demands this year for health services by the Dublin Health Authority on Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation have already been referred to.  The increase is quite staggering.  As I mentioned, in the case of Dún Laoghaire the proportion taken by the health services in the estimates for the current year was over 34 per cent.  The increase in respect of health services this year in Dún Laoghaire is another 1/- in the £ or slightly more. The increases are very considerable and I want to endorse what has been said, that there is an urgent problem which must be faced and which must be faced before any consideration is given to the Health Bill which is to be circulated shortly, irrespective of what health scheme emerges after the passage of that Bill into law.  Obviously it cannot take effect in the current year, or certainly for the greater portion of it, so that the estimates being considered now by the local authorities make it imperative that the Government should, through the Minister, indicate a decision to these authorities.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago I asked the Minister for Health if in view of the substantial increase in the rates due to the health services he was in a position to say what contribution would be made by the Government from the Central Fund to ease the burden and he replied that he had communicated with the health authorities and had asked them to re-examine their estimates. Deputies who are members of health authorities or local authorities, or those of us who have been in contact with either the officials or the members of the authorities, are aware that not only are reductions unlikely but that in most cases they are barely providing, from the projected rate which it is intended to be struck, for the existing service.  The authorities themselves at preliminary meetings examined the estimates submitted and certainly so far as Dublin Health Authority is concerned and the various authorities responsible for providing the rate in respect of health services the position would indicate that the prospects of any reductions are negligible.</P>
    <P>If the rate element in respect of <Col N="510" /> health was extracted then in a number of cases the increase, which as I have said is very considerable, would be very much less.  The present position, therefore, is one which calls for an immediate decision in line with the paragraph in the White Paper published over three years ago in which it was stated that the Government, having studied the issue, were satisfied that the local rates were not suitable for collecting additional money on the present scale and proposed that the costs of further extensions should not be met by the local rates.  That decision was announced over three years ago and the position has deteriorated further since then.  The delay in introducing the Health Bill, the fact that no alternative satisfactory scheme has been produced, has meant further additional burdens being imposed on the ratepayers and on persons already taxed, has imposed demands on them which in many cases they are unable to meet without hardship.  The only way in which this service can properly and satisfactorily be provided is on the basis of a contributory insurance scheme. Until this is done then the ratepayers, the various local authorities and the health authorities expect that the Government will come to the ease of their problem by making additional funds available to offset the increase for the current financial year.</P>

      <P>There are a few aspects of this Estimate to which I should like to refer.  One problem to which I should like to refer is that of phenylketonuria babies, commonly known as PKU babies.  A PKU baby is an infant who may become severely mentally handicapped if the condition is not diagnosed at a very early age. In order to diagnose this ailment the common practice is to take a blood sample from the baby and have it tested and then the decision is arrived at, whether or not the baby is a PKU baby.  This test has been carried out very successfully and the response from people has been reasonably good but not 100 per cent.  However, that is not my complaint.  My complaint is that in regard to these children who could become mentally retarded&mdash;and some have failed to respond to the test and <Col N="511" /> have become mentally retarded&mdash;the Department are not aware of the difficulties, the hardship and financial expense involved for those who have to rear these children.  There is a particular type of diet known as Lofenalac which costs £6 a tin.  The parents are told by the Department and by the Dublin Health Authority that when acquiring this food they should get in a month's supply.  The parents say: &ldquo;Very well, we will do that,&rdquo; but some children require two tins a week and you can just imagine the cost involved &mdash;£48 a month.  These parents go to the dispensary and are told there that the food is not available, that they can get it for them but only in a week's supply. We have one section of the health authority telling them they should have a month's supply and when they go seeking it from another branch of the same authority they can only get it in weekly supplies.  One can see the difficulty involved for these people.  They may have to queue up at the dispensary for two to three hours and, when their turn comes, they may find that the dispensary has not got the particular food they require.  This is a serious problem, which will eventually cost the State a considerable amount of money, and should be taken in hand immediately.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had studied the Minister's statement he would have seen that the Minister expressed the view that, even in conditions of full employment, there would be some voluntary emigration.  This view was endorsed by the National Industrial Economic Council in their Report on Full Employment.</P>

      <P>As has been explained on previous occasions, figures of gross emigration are not available, while reliable figures of net emigration, that is the excess of the number of emigrants over that of immigrants, are available only for the periods between Censuses of Population.  Between the Census of Population in April, 1956, and that in April, 1966, the total net emigration was 292,608.</P>
      <P>For periods subsequent to the April, 1966, Census of Population the only indicators available for net emigration are the figures for net outward passenger movement by sea and air which, as explained in my reply of 6th March, provide only a rough guide to the level of net emigration.  Using these figures as trend indicators it may be estimated that net emigration in the years to April, 1967 and 1968, amounted to 15,000 and 18,000 persons respectively.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to a report that butter of an inferior quality is finding its way into the market in Dublin; if any investigations have been made into this allegation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of allegations that some butter offered for <Col N="525" /> sale on the home market is not of the normal high standard of Irish creamery butter.  However, the quantity appears to be relatively small and very few specific complaints about butter quality are received in my Department; each of these is thoroughly investigated and any necessary remedial action taken. With a view to further strengthening the existing provisions in regard to butter quality, I propose to apply some of the additional requirements for concerns manufacturing for export to firms engaged in the packing of butter for the home market only.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that Dublin Corporation tenants of long standing who transferred as weekly tenants to houses repossessed under the SDA Acts do not receive any rebate in respect of their tenancy if they wish to purchase their houses; if he has received any proposals from Dublin Corporation to rectify this anomaly; and if there is any initiative he can take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval was given in 1961 to a proposal by Dublin Corporation to sell, at market value, 233 dwellings repossessed by them and 188 of the houses have since been sold.  Discounts for long-standing tenants under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, do not apply to such houses.</P>
      <P>I have not received any subsequent proposals from the corporation about the sale of these houses.</P>
      <P>The initiative to sell or retain the houses rests with the local authority, who are empowered by statute to use them for the purpose of any of their functions or to sell or otherwise dispose of them as they think fit.  The local authority are required to pay the person from whom they recover possession the full value of the house, less the amount of any loan remaining unpaid and other expenses due to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that a tenant who has been for 14 or 15 years a corporation tenant and who having applied for a transfer <Col N="526" /> was transferred by the corporation to one of these houses and paid a weekly rent unaware of the fact that the house was a repossessed house under the SDA, is being wronged by Dublin Corporation by not being allowed any percentage rebate for the years during which he was a corporation tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These houses are in an entirely different category.  As I pointed out, the corporation are required to pay the person from whom they recover possession the full value of the house less the amount of any loan remaining unpaid.  They are, obviously, therefore, required to get the market value of the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that for quite a considerable time, due to the dangerous building crisis in Dublin, these houses have been let at ordinary weekly tenancies and that the tenants who were transferred to these houses were unaware that they were repossessed houses and regarded them merely as another corporation house?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that there is a certain amount of unauthorised back garden workshop development proceeding in certain residential areas of Dublin; and that the present Planning Acts allow such work to proceed for quite a period despite objections by residents, causing upset and automatic depreciation in the value of property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints have been made to my Department from time to time alleging unauthorised development in residential areas of Dublin city and these have been referred to the planning authority for investigation and action where appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>In the case of unauthorised development the planning authority may take prosecution proceedings under section 24 of the Act for failure to obtain permission and may serve an enforcement notice under section 31 of the Act.  It is the experience of the corporation that such action usually precipitates an application for permission for the retention of the development.  In the event of a refusal of the permission sought an appeal may be made to me. It has also been found in the case of proceedings under section 24, that the courts are reluctant to give a decision pending the outcome of the application for permission for retention of the development or of any appeal that may have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While allegations of unauthorised development are investigated promptly it is inevitable that there be some time-lag before it is decided that the circumstances of the particular case justify prosecution or enforcement proceedings. An unauthorised development <Col N="529" /> may have been carried out in good faith and the Act provides that the developer has the right to have his propostal considered by making a planning application for the retention of the development.  I do not think any change in this position would be justified at present.</P>
    <P>If complainants feel that they have a strong case it is open to them to seek an injunction from the courts restraining the owner of the works from carrying on the business in such a way as to cause annoyance.  If it is a question of noise under section 51 (3) of the Act a notice signed by those affected may be served on the owner of the premises from which the noise emanates and if the noise is continued seven days after the service of the notice proceedings may be taken against the owner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already announced, I propose to make regulations introducing a general speed limit of 60 m.p.h. with effect from 1st April next.  In deciding on the limit of 60 m.p.h.  I had regard to the recommendations of An Foras Forbartha who conducted an exhaustive study on the subject at my request.  As I have already indicated, the operation of the speed limit will be kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Minister to think I am against speed limits in principle, but I understand the speed limit in England and on the Continent is 70 miles per hour.  What I am concerned about is that people who have a long journey to go and who want to drive at more than 60 miles per hour may feel they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb and, in fact, would be tempted to travel at 75 miles per hour.  If the Minister was prepared to accept 65 miles per hour it would be much more likely to be observed by the public at large.  Would the Minister reconsider fixing it at 65 miles per hour and, if he finds it unsatisfactory, reducing it to 60 miles per hour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Forbartha recommended that whatever speed limit <Col N="541" /> would be introduced it should be at one of the 10 miles per hour steps. The report clearly indicated that the correct limit to impose was 60 miles per hour.  The 65 miles per hour would affect only 6 or 7 per cent of drivers on the best sections of the road.  The 85th per cent high speed is 59.1 miles per hour and it is international practice in imposing an overall speed limit to adopt the speed that corresponds most closely to the 85th per cent, and that is 60 miles per hour, which would affect, it is believed, about 13 per cent of drivers on the best sections of the road.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Arising out of the Minister's reference to the Nass Road, would the Minister not agree that, whatever about the merits of a speed limit, the Naas Road is not a fair yardstick?  Would he not agree that the reduction there was from 80,90 and perhaps 100 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and not from 70 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour? Would the Minister not further agree that the Naas Road was, in fact, being used as a motorway whereas it was <Col N="543" /> never constructed for such a purpose? Therefore, if he has come to his decision on the result of the speed limit on the Naas Road, he has acted on false premises, so to speak.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have appointed Mr. Con Murphy to inquire into and report on the recent <Col N="548" /> maintenance workers' strike.  Mr. Murphy's terms of reference are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I.  to inquire into the causes of the strike;</P>
    <P>II.  to make an estimate of the cost of the strike to the parties involved, directly and indirectly, and to the economy generally; and</P>
    <P>III.  to examine and report on the course of the negotiations, and the procedures and actions of the parties to the negotiations and of others concerned in the strike.</P>
    <P>I have asked Mr. Murphy to submit, as early as possible, an interim report on Item II in the terms of reference. The Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have each been asked to nominate two assessors to assist in the work of the inquiry.  A public invitation to persons who may be in a position to help in the inquiry will be issued shortly.</P>

I did not ask Mr. Murphy to make any recommendations. I did not tie him down as regards holding the inquiry in public or in private.  I presume he will decide on his own procedure in this matter.  Some part of the inquiry would have to be in private because a great deal of valuable information would not, I think, be available to a public inquiry.</P>

      <P>The upward movement in interest rates is world wide and we in this country cannot expect to be insulated from it.  In particular, having regard to the free movement of funds between Ireland and Britain, lending rates in the two countries are related.  However, notwithstanding the recent increases, our rates are still lower than those in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Local authorities enjoy a concessional rate of interest on short-term borrowing from banks and, as regards their longer-term borrowings from banks or elsewhere for their own housing or sanitary service schemes, the increased cost of such borrowing will be moderated by the loan charge subsidies which are payable by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in connection with the Finn.  There were general discussions with the authorities in Belfast about drainage generally.  There has been considerable co-operation between the Belfast authorities and ourselves in this matter, but not with particular reference to the Finn.  The Finn is quite low down on the priority list.</P>

      <P>The late Deputy <Col N="556" /> O'Malley, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, gave me information by way of Parliamentary reply: he said he was in contact with the Belfast authorities about this and he assured me that, when these authorities made any approach to have their side of the bank attended to, he would give favourable consideration to work on the Donegal side.  Since the Minister for Finance has said that £100,000 is nothing to spend on a referendum surely he could find £20,000 to do the work necessary on the Donegal side of the River Finn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;the World Bank&mdash; has sanctioned a loan of $14½ million to the Electricity Supply Board.  The loan is repayable over a period of 25 years and interest is payable at 6½ per cent per annum.  Payment of the interest and repayment of the principal will be guaranteed by me as Minister for Finance under powers given by the Electricity (Supply) Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proceeds of the loan will be used to finance part of the cost of the <Col N="565" /> ESB's new pumped storage scheme at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow: It is expected to meet about half the cost of the project.  This is one of four new generating stations at present being undertaken by the ESB.  The Board has a very heavy investment programme because of the continuing growth in the demand for electricity arising from our economic development. The growth in demand here is higher than in most other European countries and indicates the progress we are making.</P>
    <P>The decision of the World Bank to invest in Ireland and in our industrial future is welcome, particularly at a time when our expanding programme of capital investment is tending to exceed the capital available to us from traditional sources.  It is a gesture of confidence by this major international investment institution in our industrial future and in the competence and efficiency of our electricity authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I was speaking about PKU children.  I mentioned that there is a particular type of food which these children have to get to keep them from becoming mentally retarded in after life.  The parents must have a prescription to obtain this food and the usual procedure is to go to the local dispensary on the day appointed.  If this procedure was adhered to it would be all <Col N="566" /> right as far as the parents are concerned but I have known parents to be told on arriving at a dispensary that the food was not available and that they could not be told when it would be available.  These parents might have queued for two or three hours and then be told this when their turn came to be attended to.  They are then told to go to James's Street to get it and having arrived there they would be told that an authorisation had been issued for them to get the food at their local dispensary and they would have to make the journey back to that dispensary again.</P>
      <P>I have known instances where this happened and when the parents went back to the dispensary they were told again that the food was not available and to go back again to James's Street. It is disgraceful that people should be subjected to this treatment and that they should have to go through this rigmarole in order to get food to keep their children from becoming mentally retarded in after life.  If it should happen that these children did become mentally retarded they would have to be supported by the State in institutions so that the parents are doing a service to the child, to themselves and to the State in obtaining this food for their children.  We should cut out the dispensaries altogether.  It is a ridiculous system.  Parents may have two or three babies requiring this food; it can only be obtained by prescription and the parents are not going to resell it. In any case, it is not saleable and these people are only getting it because they need it.  The parents did not ask to have these PKU children: the Lord sent them to them.  The Minister should take a particular interest in the parents and the children and give them every assistance.  They should not have long periods of waiting at a dispensary. They are fighting to keep their children in a healthy condition and so spare the State the cost of keeping them in institutions in after life.</P>

    <P>This food costs £6 per tin and some parents may require two or three tins every week.  I know one individual who has paid out £600 for this food over the last two or three years.  These parents should be given the food free of charge.  Only about 15 such children <Col N="567" /> are born every year; some of them do not survive any longer than a couple of weeks, so that only from 12 to 15 have to be catered for every year.  When the children come to three years of age they have to be given a dearer food which costs £10 a tin.  This might involve the purchase of three or four tins a week and no family income, no matter how large, could stand that.  It would not be too much for the Department to say to the parents that due to their difficulties, due to what they are doing for the children and the State, they would be given the food free of charge.</P>
    <P>These children are subject to many other diseases.  They are prone to colds if they are exposed to a mild breeze and consequently parents are faced with chemists' bills for prescriptions and medicines.  Coupled with that they have the normal expenses involved for this particular type of child.  These parents have enough expense and surely we should come to their aid in regard to providing them with free food?  Some of them have medical cards but a large number of them are beyond the range of medical cards.  I know a farmer whose valuation is £2 too high to enable him to get a medical card for a PKU child.  This man, who has just acquired his farm, is in debt to the tune of £12,000 and yet he has to pay out £6 a week for this child.</P>
    <P>I must say that the responsible personnel of the Dublin Health Authority have been extraordinarily kind to these people.  They try to facilitate them in every way but their hands are tied.  If the Department or the Minister made an order that these parents should be provided with free food for these children it would relieve the pressure on them.  Because I am advocating that free food should be provided for these children it does not mean that I would favour the provision of free food for all types of children.  I would love to see that happening but I realise that the Department of Health must budget for its expenditure just as the State has to budget.  However, I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in regard to these children and try to facilitate their parents.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should <Col N="568" /> like to refer is the question of drugs. The Minister dealt with this matter in his introductory speech and referred to the Act governing the problem.  I feel very strongly about some aspects of the taking and distribution of drugs.  I would say that, first of all, the Minister should provide adequate facilities for dealing with those already taking drugs.  There is no sense in trying to hide the fact that there are people taking drugs because if we do that the problem will progress so far that we will never overcome it.  There are people taking drugs and vast numbers of them.  Teenagers are taking drugs.  I should also like the Minister to introduce adequate legislation to curtail this drug abuse.  We should have people who have been properly trained and are properly equipped to deal with illegal trafficking in drugs and I should also like to see the introduction of an educational programme designed to inform young people about the dangers of drug-taking, to show them that by taking drugs not alone are they demoralising themselves but are failing in their personal task of character building.  The programme should also point out to them that drug-taking is not a matter of hero worship because people, especially younger people, seem to think that if you take drugs you are a hero.  I should like to see such a programme conducted in our secondary schools by people competent to speak about the problem and what it involves.  In other words, it should be a programme which would deglamorise the taking of drugs.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister set up a commission to deal with this matter and that it is now half way through its task, if we can know where the halfway mark is in this matter, but I do not think we need a commission to tell us how serious this problem is. There are certain drugs which are illegal in England and which you cannot even have in your possession, which you can obtain readily here.  You can walk any main street in Dublin any evening and you will recognise those who are taking drugs.  You will read it in their faces.  As I say, we should have specially trained personnel to deal with this problem but there is <Col N="569" /> no point in having them unless we give them the requisite powers to deal with drug pedlars, to take them into custody, and to question them.  They cannot do these things under present legislation because the Act is somewhat antiquated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is revising it and has asked for a report on it.  The list of drugs in the Act should be brought up to date.  The list was compiled in or around 1934 and it was signed in 1937 and since then only one or two drugs have been added to the list.  I would ask the Minister to treat this matter as a very serious matter and to set up facilities for those unfortunate enough to be taking drugs already.  There is no particular place to which these people can be sent and a special unit should be set up to deal with people who can be treated as individual patients and not as outpatients in a hospital getting the same treatment day in day out.  I would like to see a rehabilitation centre set up so that these people can, if possible, be rehabilitated and enabled to lead an ordinary life.  I am aware of one individual who was taking drugs and I recommended him to a hospital and to a doctor.  He went to three different hospitals before I heard about him and in each hospital they thought that was the first hospital he had been to with his problem.  He could have gone to five or six hospitals and each would have thought the same thing.  This is because we have no specific centre to which we can send addicts.  I do not think that such a centre would cost a lot.  Certainly it is essential from the point of view of curing these people who are a part of our community, part of the people for whom we are responsible.  We are responsible for each and every individual irrespective or whether or not he takes drugs or is a drug pedlar.</P>
    <P>We never see the really bad cases of drug addiction here for the simple reason that here they only get the mild forms of drugs and then they go to England to get the less mild forms. England caught on to this when it was too late.  They brought in legislation three years too late.  Let us not close the door when the horse is gone.  Let <Col N="570" /> us take steps immediately and treat this as a matter of urgency and let us not be fooled by the fact that it is not done openly here as it is in England.  The people on the commission should investigate the problem in such a way that they have every person who has any knowledge of the problem brought in and asked for information on it. They did put an advertisement in the newspapers asking people to come to the commission and that there would be no law case or anything like that, that it would all be confidential.  This is too formal.  A Minister cannot do a thing like that and a commission cannot do it.  There are individuals in the country who know these people and who know what is going on.  These are the people to get into the commission. They would gladly give information to the Minister and to the commission about it.  I could give the Minister names of people who are interested in it, people who have been interested in it abroad and who have come home and would give us details.</P>
    <P>The police squad set up to investigate this problem, considering their number on this work, are doing a tremendous job.  I congratulate them. However, the number is too small. They cannot possibly cope.  There were three of them but recently I believe they got a fourth.  There may have been others added since but this is a countrywide thing and we should have people based all over the country, watching at the docks, particularly at the big ports.  The police have been given temporary powers to investigate this problem but I would ask the Minister for Justice to designate a particular squad to look after this problem, to restrict the people who come in with drugs and when they get information to follow it to the last and not to have them saying, as has been said: &ldquo;We got information about a person coming into Dublin.  That person was going to meet a particular boat in Cork.  We watched him as far as the train.&rdquo;  When they were asked: &ldquo;Why did you not follow him to Cork?&rdquo; they said: &ldquo;We could not go.  We cannot be relieved from duty here.  We gave it to the police in Cork.&rdquo;  Of course, when it went to Cork some young policemen got it, people not familiar with the <Col N="571" /> problem, and they went on like rookies to the boat in Cork looking for a small parcel and the sailors made a laugh of them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Health in view of the fact that this concerns his Department to see that a squad is set up and that this squad is not seconded to inspectors as regards getting particular men if they have to track down somebody.  If we continue to treat this problem as lightly as we are doing I have no doubt we will find ourselves in a short while in the same predicament as they are in in England. Heaven knows in a country such as this nobody wants this to happen.  The Minister himself is fully conversant or should be fully conversant with the problem of drug taking and I would ask him to look into it urgently and not allow the commission to dawdle along on their own initiative, to give them a push.  I feel the commission will need a lot of zip.</P>

      <P>Even if they need a drug to get them working on this particular thing I would be prepared to give it to them.</P>
      <P>I suggest we should have people going around the schools to deglamorise the taking of drugs in the minds of young people.  I think this is important. I must admit there is a certain risk involved because it cannot be done without mentioning types of drugs and it will be bringing drugs to the notice of those who are not already taking them.  Even with that risk the people who would do this job should be well versed enough in it to put the case forward and to deglamorise the taking of drugs in such a way that it would leave the children under no illusion as to what is right and what is wrong.  Some of them take drugs for the kick.  Some of them take them just to see what they are like.  Anybody will take a thing once and if it is nice he will take it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children should be educated in such a way that they realise what the problem is.  The Minister for Education is involved in this.  He said some time <Col N="572" /> ago here in the Dáil that there would be no difficulty in this.  If there is no difficulty let us get at the problem immediately and get people who are capable of speaking on the subject to go out and deglamorise this habit in all the secondary schools in Ireland.  It is in the secondary schools the problem arises.  I know of one teacher who had an idea that drugs were being taken in the school and carried out an investigation with the help of the more adult children.  It was revealed that drugs were being taken and were readily available; that in any of these powwow houses in the city of Dublin these kids can go in and get their formula for drugs and can get them.  This can lead to injections and they can get the syringe.  These things are available and if they are I cannot see why the police do not know about it and why legislation is not introduced to give them power to go in and take the stuff away. I realise that the Minister is aware of the problem.  My reason for mentioning it is to bring to light the specific cases of which I am aware.  I would ask the Minister in view of the urgency of the matter involved to start immediately on this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about medical cards.  Many people receive medical cards who some of us think should not have them and there are many people who do not receive them who should have them.  The Minister said he did not like people living on their own, that he would like to see them living with their sons and daughters or in-laws and being taken care of.  It is highly commendable to look after our old people.  People can be deprived of benefits by reason of the fact that a son or daughter is living with them.  Inspectors have deemed applicants for medical cards to be ineligible because of the fact that they are not living alone.  A number of country people come to the city to live with a son or daughter and these people have been deemed not to be eligible for a medical card.  I should like the Minister to look into this problem of medical cards for elderly people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the dispensaries when I was referring to PKU babies.  At no point have I been in agreement with <Col N="573" /> the dispensary service.  I live in an area where a number of people have to depend on the dispensary service and I receive constant complaints with regard to the service.  The other day there was the case of an infirm old lady for whom a prescription had to be collected. The dispensary hours are ten to 12.  The lady in question sent a man to collect the prescription.  This man went to the girl behind the protective grille who told him that the dispensary was closed.  He pointed out that it was only 11.45.  The girl then told him to see &ldquo;himself&rdquo;, which he did and was asked what he wanted.  He was told that nothing could be done until he had got the paper stamped, for which he had to go to the girl behind the grille. This kind of thing is happening in the case of hundreds of people, particularly aged people who are not prepared to bully their way through the dispensary service.  The dispensaries are established in order to facilitate the people who use them.  Patients should not be left in something that corresponds to a bread queue, sitting on benches with people suffering from all kinds of infirmities.  These elderly patients are people who have soldiered through life and who have assisted the development of our economy and who deserve assistance and a certain amount of courtesy when they attend at a dispensary.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter and to improve the dispensary service from the point of view of those who have to depend on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to discuss our health services on this Supplementary Estimate for the simple reason that I am firmly convinced that the Minister for Health, whether by design or otherwise, shows no sign of implementing what is in the White Paper published over three years ago.  The best way to postpone action in regard to any social service is to publish a White Paper because the White Paper inevitably entails delay and if there are grievances, if there are problems to be sorted out and Deputies want action the Minister has the grand way out of introducing a White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when the White Paper on the Health Bill was published the Government <Col N="574" /> expounded at length on the wonderful new health scheme they proposed to introduce.  At first glance the White Paper seemed to indicate that everything would be fine with the health services, that it was proposed to correct all the anomalies, all the injustices, in the health services.  The late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, then Minister for Health, suggested that there should be discussion on the White Paper and we have had discussion ranging over three years and at the end of the three years we do not see anything for all the discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister may use his favourite expression, &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;, but I do not think it is rubbish to tell him that nothing has emerged from the discussion. We still have the dispensary system; we still have people humiliated and degraded by our present out-dated medical service which makes second-class citizens of our lower income group.  I think the Minister will agree that they are being treated as second-class citizens.  I would hope that the Minister would be a little more dynamic and push a little more and have the proposed Health Bill introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At present, dispensary medical officers are over-worked beyond imagination. There are people who are not receiving proper medical attention.  I do not know if the Minister has ever visited a dispensary in the city.  It would be an education for him to visit Ballyfermot and see the queues of people there awaiting prescriptions or medical attention.  I have here a letter which I received this morning which describes the different queues for medicines in the dispensary.  One queue is for prescriptions issued by the district medical officer.  The second queue is for prescriptions issued by an outside doctor or a hospital.  There are certain restrictions imposed on patients who present prescriptions from hospitals. These prescriptions can be filled only at certain times.  They cannot be filled on Saturday morning or any morning in certain dispensaries.  People are told that they can be filled only in the afternoon. I cannot see what is wrong with a hospital prescription.  This is what is happening at dispensaries&mdash;people humiliated and degraded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I have here a letter describing a case where a lady, her husband and a child were ill with a severe dose of influenza. The doctor gave them a prescription and the patient pointed out the difficulty of collecting the medicines when the whole family were ill.  The doctor suggested that they should go to James's Street, the headquarters of Dublin Health Authority or attend at a dispensary at 9.15 a.m. where, the doctor said, there would be no delay. As the matter was urgent, one of the family went to James's Street dispensary and was told there that urgent medicines should be got in Essex Street which is over three miles away.  When the person got to Essex Street less than half the medicines were supplied.  By the time they got the second half the patients had recovered.  When they went to the dispensary on another occasion at 9.15 they found there were two queues, one for the Dublin Health Authority prescriptions and one for prescriptions by outside doctors.  They are kept waiting over two hours in these queues for medicines and then they find in many cases the dispensary has not got the requisite amount of drugs or the right drugs.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to have everything ideal, but we have no right to treat people like this just because they are not able, by their own means, to provide proper medical care for themselves. The person who can afford the medicines can call into any chemist and get exactly what he requires at his own convenience.  It was promised that there would be radical changes in all this and that these dispensaries would be abolished.  The Minister may say that it called for investigation and discussion before any radical changes could take place.  However, the White Paper issued over three years ago indicates that all these discussions had already taken place.  Paragraph 43 of the White Paper says:</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of study has been carried out in the Department of Health on the extent to which a choice of doctor is practicable and on how schemes to provide such a choice could be organised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> As a result of this study they found it could be provided and that only a small fraction of the population, less than five per cent, was outside the range of at least two doctors.  Therefore, I cannot accept any statement or countercharge by the Minister that it since became necessary to carry out an intensive study into whether this proposition was practicable or not.  In relation to people who are urgently in need of medicines, who are not in a position to purchase these and who are not in possession of a medical card, the White Paper says:</P>
    <P>To provide for cases in need of urgent medical attention, there is a procedure for the issue, by members of the health authority and other designated persons, including assistance officers, of temporary authorisations to eligible persons whose names are not on the register.  These have a maximum period of validity of one month.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember I wrote to him concerning at least 12 cases where these temporary authorisations were rejected at dispensaries.  Although the provision was there for it, the Minister did not exercise this right, and these people were humiliated in that these authorisations or temporary medical cards were issued by members of the local health authority and the dispensary rejected them.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of service we have at the moment, this second-class medical service confined to the lower income group.  Despite all the assurances by the Minister, we have not yet seen the Health Bill which he promised last year, which he promised on the occasion of the commemorative session of the first Dáil.  He stated that there were so many amendments, so many things to be done, but we would have it within ten days.  Now we are on the verge of a Recess and we still have not got it. Why did the Minister not take the opportunity of presenting this Health Bill to the House on the occasion of the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health?</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell at some length on these qualifications for a medical card.  No one seems to know what constitutes eligibility for a medical card or what factors are taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I have seen too many cases of people who have medical cards, who are considered entitled to have medical cards, whose income did not increase but who were rejected on the expiration of the medical card in September last.</P>
    <P>There is one particular case of a husband and wife, both old age pensioners, with one son working.  The aged couple had a medical card.  The husband dies.  There is no increase in the family income; actually it has decreased by virtue of the loss of the old age pension of the husband who has died.  The Dublin Health Authority rejected that widow's application for a medical card without offering any justifiable reason other than the fact that there was only one person to seek medical attention now and there was no need for a medical card.  Gross wages of the family are taken into consideration, but the Minister will agree with me that there is no law in the land compelling a son or daughter to hand up their total wages.  The fact that they pay income tax, national health contributions, the expenses involved in travelling to and from work, the expenses of young adults considering marriage&mdash; these factors are not taken into account in the assessment for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The husband is asked to present the form to his employer.  He must suffer this humiliation in so far as the employer knows he must seek a medical card.  There is an interminable delay.  I brought to the attention of the Minister on one occasion here&mdash;and this is not an isolated case&mdash;the case of an old lady who was being treated for high blood pressure.  The card expired and she waited another eight weeks. Meanwhile she was without treatment, and it was only due to action by the Minister that she finally got her medical card.  Of course, the authority would not accept the fact that they were wrong.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister some time ago whether a directive had gone to the Dublin Health Authority or to other health authorities, as there seemed to be a general rejection of applications for medical card renewals.  The Minister denied any action by him in this matter, but it seems very peculiar that under the Dublin Health Authority <Col N="578" /> people who were considered eligible last year are not eligible this year, despite the fact that the cost of living has gone up so much.  The White Paper says that these factors will be taken into consideration and that only the means of the individual will be assessed.  I should like to know when the Minister will introduce this utopian scheme.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I would ask the Minister to urge the health authorities to adopt a more positive attitude in this matter.  Whereas the Department should be endeavouring to help a person to receive the medical card and other benefits, the whole Department is orientated towards obstructing the issue of these benefits.  This negative attitude being adopted by the Dublin Health Authority and other health authorities throughout the country is the cause of great concern among the public.  I believe they should be thinking of ways of helping people to get a medical card &mdash;not of putting obstacles in the way all the time.  I know it is prevalent in other Departments but I think it is very prevalent with the health authorities. Where people consider they might be entitled to a medical card, the officials should help them to make their claim. I appeal to the Minister to make this point known to health authorities so that qualified people who need medical attention and drugs will be granted a medical card.</P>
    <P>I now want to ask the Minister about one very sore point&mdash;assistance towards the cost of drugs in hardship cases.  Is the Minister aware of what happens to a person who receives assistance towards the cost of drugs? The usual procedure, as I know it, for a person who has a drug bill of £2 a week is to receive assistance to the extent of £1 a week.  This person&mdash;in Dublin&mdash;must travel to the Dublin Health Authority, pay in £1 to the headquarters of the Dublin Health Authority, bring back a receipt to the dispensary and get the drugs there.  A lot of old people are involved here. The trouble, expense and inconvenience are tremendous.  I cannot understand why it cannot be paid into a dispensary, thus avoiding all this unnecessary delay and travelling.  I know people who, after tremendous delay, <Col N="579" /> came back with the receipt only to find the dispensary closed.</P>
    <P>Where 50 per cent assistance is given towards the cost of drugs, would I be right in saying that this involves no cost on the health authority by virtue of the fact that the Dublin Health Authority, and other health authorities, receive 50 per cent off the retail price of drugs because they buy in bulk and, as a result, there is no payment by the health authority although they state that there is?  This is an important point because people believe they are getting reductions when the Dublin Health Authority are not paying out one penny towards them.  As I know it, 50 per cent only of the retail cost of drugs is charged to the Dublin Health Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a lot to say about that, shortly.  I am now asking the Minister, if he does not intend to implement the proposals in the White Paper, to consider something urgent and radical in relation to dispensaries so that, without introducing new legislation, he will adopt some radical measures to ease the burden on the people in the lower income group who must attend dispensaries and suffer the humiliation of queuing for their drugs.  The Minister may say that there has been delay in the implementation of this legislation because he has had to have discussions with the doctors.  These discussions have been dragged out over months&mdash; I do not think I would be too far wrong in saying about seven months&mdash; in secret.  I wonder at the purpose of secrecy in these discussions.  They affect the public.  They affect the taxpayer. Therefore, there was no need for secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, when he presented his proposals to the profession&mdash;without giving them time to consider them&mdash;the Minister made a statement to the press, issued the results of his decision on the method of payment to doctors and made public his proposals, which are a capitation rate for doctors.  There was nothing startling about that because, in 1966&mdash;over three years ago&mdash;it was <Col N="580" /> conceded by the Government that the capitation rate seemed the most likely method of payment the Government would offer under the scheme to doctors.  The capitation rate seemed the most favoured by the Government.</P>
    <P>I think we should discuss these proposals because they affect the implementation of the new Health Bill, whenever it comes about.  What the Minister proposes is £1 per year to the doctor for taking care of a patient in the lower income group.  His Bill does not extend beyond those patients in the lower income group, the 30 per cent of the population.  I might say to the Minister that these are the people who, because of poverty, overcrowding, large families, will make the most demands on the doctor.  A survey in Britain of the number of calls made on a doctor in a year under the National Health Service revealed that those in the lower income group make 25 demands a year on the doctor.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in which the Minister offers doctors £1 a year to take care of a patient who, on average, will call on him 25 times in that year. If the Minister knows anything about trademen's costs or about a service charge for a machine he might have in his home, he will know that the average amount he pays as a service charge to have a tradesman look at a machine three or four times a year is £6 10s 0d. Despite this, he offers doctors £1 a year to look after a patient who, on average, will call on him 25 times in that year and, for those over 65 years of age, for the people who will constantly be attending the doctor, week after week, he offers 25/- a year to the doctor.  This is an absolute insult.  It will result in a breakdown in negotiations and in delay in implementing any Health Bill which may come before this House. The Minister offers doctors five shillings for duty between 6-11 p.m.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has looked into these proposals or if they were just presented to him for submission to the doctors but they constitute an absolute insult.  Furthermore, they make no provision whatsoever for week-end duty by a doctor.  The Minister expects a doctor to work at week-ends at the normal rate of pay.  We all know that tradesmen and other <Col N="581" /> workers must get overtime for week-end duty but the Minister would not consider paying the doctors overtime for week-end duty.  He denies them a 40-hour week.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions preventive medicine and elaborates at length on this.  He says there must be more and more emphasis on preventive medicine. Yet his proposals make no allowance whatsoever for preventive medicine. He talks about the high costs of hospitalisation and the need to reduce them. Still, his proposals to the medical profession are orientated more and more towards hospitalisation of patients. This is the insult that he offers the medical profession, an insult which will result in a breakdown in negotiations and in no implementation of the proposals in the Health Bill.  Consequently, we shall have the dispensaries staying with us.  These are dispensaries which are humiliating people and that is the situation which the Minister envisages.  He might like to know that these proposals have been rejected out of hand.  This will result in doctors quitting the service because the general practitioners would not opt for this scheme which would reduce them to a status lower than a labourer.</P>
    <P>Hospitalisation costs must naturally, under the concept of a capitation scheme, go up.  I do not care what the Minister says about a Hippocratic Oath or the duty of doctors to do their best for patients; where the doctor is in doubt or worried in his conscience he will see that the patient is admitted to hospital.  I cannot see why it should be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister to consider the idea of a fee per item of service system.  It would not cost any more money; it would help the patient and produce a more efficient health scheme for the lower income group.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this as a proper means of ensuring that the new Health Bill will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister said about rising hospitalisation costs I should like to mention the length of stay of patients in hospitals.  I see that in 1960 the average length of stay was 20.1 days.  In 1964 it was 17.6 days.  I believe we could reduce the average <Col N="582" /> time spent by patients in hospitals if we brought about a more efficient system within hospitals, such as not admitting patients at week-ends except in emergency.  There is nothing more annoying than to have a patient admitted on a Friday afternoon and a diagnostic work-up not started until Monday, thus wasting three days.  This adds considerably to the cost of hospitalisation. Having worked in America for four years I saw that patients could be admitted at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and the whole battery of diagnostic tests could take place that evening and the patient could be discharged at 12 o'clock next day.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us now to bring about a more efficient and streamlined system in hospitals when the cost of maintenance is so terribly high.  It is incumbent on the Minister to have a study made of what is wrong and why patients are so long delayed in hospitals, especially patients for investigation. We all know, and no doubt have had experience of cases of patients who could not be discharged from hospital because the consultant was not available or because he forgot to arrange the patient's discharge.  This is very important, now.  When we talk in terms of £7 to £10 a day maintenance we must take this into consideration and ensure that patients are not delayed in hospital longer than necessary. In view of the very large deficit in voluntary hospital accounts it is necessary to have an intensive study made to see in what way we can bring about savings.  I believe my suggestions would do this.  We should streamline our diagnostic services within the hospitals so that they could operate on some kind of shift system, so that work will commence immediately on the evening of a patient's admission.</P>
    <P>I believe there is need for the Minister to examine the present problem of the Hospital Bed Bureau.  I think it was set up by the Minister for Health to ensure that patients would be admitted to hospital, but I think it is not operating properly, that hospitals are not abiding by the scheme operated by the Bed Bureau.  I think geriatric cases are not being given beds in voluntary hospitals when they should get them and that there is a great reluctance on the part of these hospitals to accept <Col N="583" /> geriatric cases or people in their sixties and over.  The Minister should make it a condition of grants to these hospitals that a proportion of their beds be available to geriatric cases or for admission of these people who need medical or surgical attention.  The Minister would be enlightened if he discussed the matter with the Bed Bureau or with St. Kevin's Hospital.  They will explain the problem of how these old people are constantly being admitted there and of how very much overcrowded they are because voluntary hospitals refuse to take these patients.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in the bill for drugs and, while the Minister says he dislikes this, he realises that the increase is necessary because patients are kept out of hospital due to these modern life-saving drugs.  While it might seem that there is an increase in the cost of drugs the saving in hospitalisation must be tremendous.  Some years ago we might admit every case of pneumonia to hospital but now, with modern antibiotics, we can treat them at home and save enormous cost.  None of us, therefore, should be concerned because of the increase in the cost of drugs.  The best should be used and if they keep patients out of hospitals the cost is well worth while.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists for admission to the Eye and Ear Hospital and for treatment at the Dental Hospital are a source of concern to the public who must use these services.  Up to quite recently I know that the waiting list for admission for eye operations for the National Health group was tremendously long.  In many cases patients who should receive proper surgical attention for eye conditions cannot have these operations in time.  I ask the Minister to look into this problem because it is a source of very great concern to people requiring operations on their eyes, such as school children with squints, who are kept waiting indefinitely for admission.  The same problem arises about treatment at the Dental Hospital in Dublin.  For dentures the waiting list is one year or more.  I brought a particular case to the attention of the Minister and he conceded the facts having investigated the case.  The person concerned had <Col N="584" /> mass extraction of teeth, some extra surgery, was left without any teeth at all and was waiting for over a year to get plates.  One does not have to be a medical man to realise the great danger to people's health who are left in such a position.  It just is not good enough for a hospital to say it cannot do better than one year.  We must do better if we intend to offer any kind of proper service to our people.</P>
    <P>At page 51 in the White Paper it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the ophthalmic service will, as soon as practicable, be extended to the middle income group generally, in accordance with section 21 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>Has that proposition been implemented? It did not call for new legislation. Provision was made in section 21 of the Health Act of 1953.  I should like the Minister to tell us what improvements he has made or is making in the dental health service.  At the moment it is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister implemented the provisions in relation to the aural services? At page 55 of the White Paper screening tests are dealt with.</P>
    <P>.....it is proposed, therefore, to introduce an extension of the Health Acts so as to permit health authorities to arrange, without reference to income groups, programmes for screening for symptoms of specified diseases.....</P>
    <P>Has that been implemented?  Have we got cervical screening on a national basis, at no cost and without reference to income groups?  What progress has been made?  This is a vitally important matter because many lives can be saved if disease is detected in time.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the cost of these extensions would be?  The present health services are far from ideal, but they cost the country a good deal.  I do not think we are getting satisfaction for the money spent.  It is our duty to provide proper services and we will have to make up our minds to provide the money for these services.  I think I am right in saying that we have less GNP devoted to health services than any other country in Western Europe or, for that matter, the United States of America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The Minister is anxious we should pay more attention to preventive medicine. We all know that the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme provides for the hospitalisation of patients.  There have been some extensions, but they are not worth considering.  I believe the scheme has contributed enormously to the cost of hospitalisation.  This House voted a considerable amount of money towards the setting up of that organisation.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest the Minister should ask this body to arrange some form of no claim bonus for people who have regular check-ups. That would be a tremendous incentive and it would discourage the all too frequent hospitalisation that occurs now.  It would also result in increased benefits.  These check-ups would be part of preventive medicine.  This is the way in which to reduce health costs.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on his own initiative, made provision for the free treatment of diabetics.  That was an admirable thing.  He was touched by some personal cases he came across.  I should like him to act similarly in some other cases.  Thalidomide cases are in need of constant medical attention.  In Britain someone accepted responsibility for proceeding on behalf of such cases against the German company. No one has done that here.  That is not right.  Someone sold the drug here.  The Minister has a duty to see that these victims are compensated for life-long disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us the extra <Col N="586" /> number of places provided for mentally retarded children but he did not tell us the number of places needed to cater for all those on the long waiting list.  I should like to know the number on the waiting list at the moment.  When does the Minister think he will have a sufficient number of places for these and I do not mean in St. Brendan's or St. Loman's?</P>
    <P>In the White Paper also it is stated that some major replacement projects would have to be undertaken, including a new St. Laurence's Hospital in Dublin and a major hospital to replace some of the small and outdated units plus the building of a regional general hospital in Cork.  That was three years ago.  We still have the old St. Laurence's Hospital.  There have been minor improvements, but no new hospital.  It is conceded there was a need for such a hospital and a need for a major hospital to replace some of the small and outdated units in some of the voluntary hospitals.  I should like to know when this replacement of the major hospital complex is coming, where it is being built, what is happening and what progress has been made over the past three years on this important project.  Many people are being held up in their plans to improve the hospital services due to this matter.  I should also like to know what the Minister is going to do about the FitzGerald Report, if he is being influenced by local vested interests or if he proposes to implement the recommendations in the Report.</P>
    <P>I think the proposals of the Minister for the reorganisation of the health services are piecemeal proposals.  There is need for a radical overhaul and for the institution of a brand new health service.  Some time ago Fine Gael speakers said there was a vast difference between their policy with regard to health and ours, but there is not such a great difference between the two concepts for a proper health service. There is this difference: Fine Gael propose the elimination of what they call the &ldquo;jet set&rdquo; but it is our opinion that, if you are to have a proper health service, you will have to include those. They may not use the service so much but they must contribute towards it in order to make it economic.  The insurance <Col N="587" /> principle was advocated in both policies except that we say that it would not work on its own, that the money provided would not be sufficient and that help would have to come from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We believe that everybody should be included in the health service and that if you make it an all-embracing service you will make it more economic.  It will not cost very much. The Minister's scheme is confined to the lower-income group, to the people who make most demands on it.  We believe that if it was extended to the entire community the extra cost would not be significant.  The burden of the health services falling on the rates is very big.  The Minister says that that portion of the costs of the health services borne by the Exchequer is raised in taxation from the people.  He is right in that but when money is raised from the rates for a service such as the health service it may not be the most equitable way of raising it.  The ratepayers are not necessarily the people who can afford to pay.  Widows pay rates, old age pensioners pay rates and this is not an equitable system of raising money.  Taking the health costs off the rates would mean increased taxation, but those who could afford to pay would pay.  This would relieve the rates of up to 40 per cent of the cost and the relief to those who cannot afford it would be considerable.</P>
    <P>The money will have to come from the central Exchequer, it will have to be raised by increased taxation.  The health services will have to be financed by moneys from the central Exchequer plus the operation of the insurance principle with contributions from every earning member of the community. The Fine Gael policy on health is not vastly different from the Labour policy which is the only proper way of organising a proper health service, something which is greatly needed at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have not got proper facilities in our hospitals.  I would like the Minister to visit some of what are called the most modern, advanced and up-to-date hospitals and see the deplorable conditions under which they are being operated.  We are not providing modern <Col N="588" /> facilities and there is a great need for more and more money to go into these hospitals.  Money spent on them would be well spent because it is the community that benefits finally.  The Minister's concept of what is needed and my concept are vastly different and he should visit these hospitals and see the primitive conditions under which they are trying to work.  A statement made in this connection by a visiting professor to this country is completely true.  He said that conditions were deplorable.  That is true and the Minister cannot shrug off this statement by saying it is rubbish.</P>
    <P>We have a situation here in which our health services are antiquated and out-dated.  They do not provide proper benefits for the people and we all know that the main concern of all our working class people is that the health services are not providing them with what they need.  Medical attention and the cost of drugs are a considerable burden on them.  We have got to do something drastic to improve our health services.  We have to stop humiliating our lower income group, who are compelled to suffer intolerable humiliations when trying to obtain medical services for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the enormous impact of the health charges on the rates must be tackled in a positive way.  At present this prickly burden is being placed on the people and the cost is out of all proportion to the services being provided. The huge rates bill is being very seriously affected especially in the towns and in the rural areas.  In 1968 the local health authorities were led to believe that the Department of Health would be giving them grants to relieve the burden on the ratepayers but their hopes were rudely shattered by the Minister's circular letter in which he stated bluntly that no further increase for health would be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the local authorities should economise.  Does he seriously think that the local authorities could economise?  On whom are they to economise?  The old and the sick people and those in receipt of disability allowances?  Surely he was not <Col N="589" /> serious when he asked local authorities to economise.  In some parts of the country the schools medical inspection scheme has broken down completely, or is very unsatisfactory, simply because public health doctors cannot be obtained.  Why is this?  Is it not up to the Minister to find out the cause and then remedy it?  Children who have been classed as requiring dental treatment have in many cases to wait years before the treatment is available.  This is not good enough in 1969 and, in fact, we have gone backwards instead of forwards in this regard.</P>
    <P>On many occasions we have been promised better health services, but they have not yet materialised.  In several parts of the country we have vacant dispensaries.  Something is wrong when we have such difficulty in filling these posts.  A few years ago it was practically impossible to be appointed to such a position and doctors had to show that they were very highly qualified when they applied for the post and, of course, they had to have a knowledge of Irish. We should really think more of the sick, poor people who use our dispensaries. It is disgraceful that sometimes they should have to wait for hours before they are examined by the doctor.  Recently the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries complained because he had to stand in a centrallyheated building for ten minutes. Surely we should think of our sick people who have to wait for hours to be examined by the dispensary doctor?</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the mentally retarded, in my constituency of Roscommon we have a voluntary organisation which acquired a site for a school for the mentally retarded and I would appeal to the Minister for help in regard to this matter.  The Minister is aware of this problem as his constituency adjoins Roscommon.  I would also ask him to consider upgrading the Roscommon County Hospital and if he would consider giving us 30 more beds and an assistant county surgeon.  This would be far more practical than moving the hospital to Galway.  In conclusion, I should like to appeal to the Minister to do whatever he can for the unfortunate people covered by this Estimate who cannot help themselves.</P>

      <P>When discussing the Department of Health a man's mind goes back a long way, particularly when he hears rumours about regional hospitals and about a regional hospital in Cork.  I remember in 1949, when we had a doctor as Minister for Health, coming up with a deputation from the South Cork Board of Public Assistance which at that time had spent about nine years preparing plans for a Cork regional hospital.  Anyway, we had £18,000 spent on paper in the regional office.  We arrived at the Custom House and met the then Minister and his officials and when we told him about our plans they said &ldquo;Out of date.  Any plan prepared three years previously in regard to a hospital is out of date, throw it in the wastepaper basket and get a new plan.&rdquo;  The then Minister was the only Minister I ever met who was decent about money.</P>
      <P>At that time the regional hospital in Cork was to cost £2 million and when I informed him that my committee had no intention of paying one penny of it he said that they would give the money to us.  I said to him that he was talking about cancer wards and so on which would all cost a lot in equipment and he said &ldquo;I will give you that, too&rdquo;.  I got everything in the world from him and coming away he said &ldquo;You must admit that I am the most decent Minister you ever met&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;Yes, but there is one fault to it.&rdquo;  He asked me what that was and I replied &ldquo;You have no intention of being here when the bill is presented&rdquo;. The bill has not been presented yet. The site for the hospital is still there and we are awaiting a move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in Cork has been completely different from that of Deputy Dr. O'Connell in regard to the staff and officials dealing with health matters there.  I have always found them&mdash;and this is the general opinion of my colleagues on the county council and in the health authority&mdash;most sympathetic and most anxious to help in every possible way.  I never heard anyone complaining about this 40-hour week about which Deputy O'Connell is so anxious.  I have been chairman of our small health authority in the South Cork area for some 16 years.  During that period I was able <Col N="591" /> to keep pretty good control in so far as finances were concerned.  Estimates were fully examined.  In fact, the passing of the estimate for the South Cork Board of Assistance used to take two full days to examine.  The Estimate this year was hardly on the table when it was gone through, although where we were dealing in pounds, those boys are dealing in millions.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the number of new posts that have been created by the Cork Health Authority since they took over from us about five years ago. It would be very interesting to have that information.  The Minister need not bother; I will put down a question to him.</P>
    <P>There is something else I should like to know.  Is it the Minister's intention to amend the regulations discriminating against the agricultural community and preventing them getting any benefits under the Health Acts?  I heard Deputy Foley a while ago talking about the unfortunate man who was £2 over the valuation.  In any other case where a farmer's means are being assessed they are assessed on his land, but under the Minister's Health Act they are assessed on land and buildings.</P>
    <P>When the professional classes are being assessed I have yet to see the valuation of their homes taken into consideration in the assessment of their means.  Why is this done in regard to the agricultural community?  When does the Minister intend to remove that discrimination from the Health Acts? It is a matter that has gone too far.  I went to our health authority manager on a case and I said to him: &ldquo;Look, there is the man's poor law valuation&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;No, there is £12 15s valuation on buildings which must be added to that.&rdquo;  I must admit I do not watch every bit of legislation going through this House.  I do not know how the Minister got away with that bit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you have any dealings at all with your constituencies you must have met this as well as I did, but I did not hear a word from any one of you in connection with it.  However, I will have an answer to that one next Wednesday, too.  I will put down a question and I will get that.  I like to have those things on record.</P>
      <P>These fellows are great for working on paper.  For Cork it is all based on the regional hospital.  When the regional hospital is built the Mallow hospital will be downgraded, the Bantry hospital will be downgraded and you will be landed into Paradise without dying or going to Heaven or anything else when you land into the regional hospital in Cork.  Could the Minister give the approximate date when he will cut the first sod for the regional hospital in Cork?  We would like to hear that.  I had hoped long ago that poor Donogh O'Malley, God rest his soul, would be cutting it.  He was the only man, when you come to look into it, who realised that he lived among the people, that we are all ratepayers and he said: &ldquo;So far shall the demands for health on the rates go and no further.&rdquo;  He was the man who said: &ldquo;You will only pay the same as you paid last year.&rdquo;  We did not have any of that since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At every health authority meeting I have attended during the past four years some new post was created and a couple of thousand or £3,000 or £4,000 &mdash; in fact, I think, £5,000 for one fellow &mdash;was clapped on to the rates.  Of course 50 per cent of that goes on to the Minister but those are the things that have built it up.  We now find ourselves in the position where God help the unfortunate devil who is over the valuation or beyond the medical card stage in regard to his health in this country.  I have seen bills from hospitals pouring into my house at the rate of about 15 a week.  In one case for 11 days the bill was £203, by the time the botchers were done with him and all <Col N="593" /> the other queer things we hear about modern science.  By the time they were finished with the poor devil the bill was £203, and he was one of those where the difference between the land valuation and the valuation of his land and buildings put him out of court.  Where is he going to find 200 quid?  I would like the Minister to investigate the increased charges to those who are supposed to be people who can pay covering the period since this Health Act was brought in or since the Cork Health Authority Act was brought in, up to now.  He will find that that man if he was treated in the same manner five years ago would be billed for £30 or £40.  It has mounted that much since then and there is no stopping of it.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to dispensary doctors?  That is another matter I would like to know something about.  Before I was removed by this Act from the high office of chairman of the Cork Health Authority, we were engaged on the reconstitution of dispensary areas.  I have watched the position fairly closely since then.  Can the Minister tell me the last date on which there was a permanent dispensary doctor appointed in Cork county? There are doctors appointed temporarily. In thickly-populated areas there is a very grave problem.  A poor person may become ill suddenly and his friends do not know where to find a medical doctor.  The dispensary doctor's residence has been sold.  There is no dispensary doctor there.  They may ring up a Cork telephone number and find that the doctor, operating the 40-hour week referred to by Deputy Dr. O'Connell, has gone to the dogs for the night and there is no doctor available. When will we have a decision &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;decision&rdquo;&mdash; from the Department of Health authorising us to fill the vacancies for dispensary doctors in Cork county?</P>
    <P>I did not come in here to take up the time of the House.  I am giving the facts as I know them and making my complaints based on facts.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell was very worried for fear the ratepayer would get any relief in regard to the charges for drugs and other medicines.  The ratepayers of <Col N="594" /> Cork county cannot afford the increases in health charges that have been occurring year after year.  These increases have made the payment of rates impossible, particularly for the people here discriminated against, the agricultural community, and have driven the rates beyond all bounds.  As chairman of Cork County Council I shall have to face the bill and consider it within the next month and I should like to know from the Minister what relief he intends giving before I consider the rate because, unless there is relief, there will be trouble as far as rates are concerned in Cork county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As representing two western counties it is my view that small farmers and very many of the people living in towns and villages should get free health services similar to those given, say, to holders of medical cards.</P>
      <P>The public should be better informed with regard to the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme which was established some years ago.  It may seem surprising that I should say that but when one asks people who are hospitalised or who have to receive medical care if they are in this scheme they say that they do not know anything about it.  This scheme should be brought to the attention of the public and information regarding it should be sent to people's homes with a full description of the advantages to be derived from the scheme.  If that were done a greater number of people would be covered by the scheme.  The subscription to the scheme is one of the best investments a family can make. For a family or for an individual it is a great advantage to pay the £5, £6 or £10 for coverage for health expenses under that scheme.  I would ask the Department to issue more propaganda about this scheme in the next 12 months.  Membership of the scheme would relieve the tension and strain associated with hospital charges, doctors' fees and the price of drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the White Paper on the Health Services and have been told that the cost <Col N="595" /> of medical care is not a cause of worry or hardship to families.  There is nothing causing more worry than the increasing cost of doctors' fees, hospitalisation and drugs and medicines. A health insurance scheme, such as suggested and put before this House by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, would be the only solution to this problem. Those in public life, whether in Parliament or in local authorities, and the people who are paying know the seriousness of this increasing demand being made year after year.  For well over 20 years now in most countries there has been a steady increase each year in rates.  That has been due, in no small measure, to the health services. Some years ago when Fianna Fáil brought this health scheme into operation we were told it would cost only 2s in the £.  They could not have visualised that such an all-round increase would take place.  The result is that the health services represent one of the heaviest imposts on the rates.</P>
    <P>If we increase the rates, say, for the improvement of roads, the people see that a useful job has been done throughout the county, but when a heavy burden is imposed for health services they do not see it except as a family sees it when they have to pay for the services.  In order to relieve this burden, there should be a small levy on employees, on employers, and on the farming and other sections of the community.  Whether the Government want to admit it or not the time has come when some change will have to be made in the method of collecting money for the health services.  In counties like Sligo/Leitrim that have not many industries or a great source of employment, particularly Leitrim, I cannot see people being able to continue to pay rates at £4 10s in the £. We in public life are receiving several letters in connection with the revision that has taken place in house valuation, which is another way of increasing the rates.</P>
    <P>County Managers will tell us when we go to local authority meetings that if we will reduce the services then they <Col N="596" /> can reduce the estimate or at least hold it where it was last year.  That is something we representatives cannot do.  We cannot say we will cut down disability benefit or increase hospital charges. Nor can we say we will reduce home assistance or any of those other benefits that come out of the local authority funds.  It certainly would not be in keeping with the trend today, which is to improve people's position instead of worsening it.  If the Government do not devise some means of providing the extra money that is needed I can see something happening similar to what happened in 1967 when the farmers of this country went out marching.  If the Government do not take notice, the people will reach the stage when they will have to refuse to pay these exorbitant rates.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for county councillors or public representatives on any body to cry out about rising rates.  We are asked continually to make representations on behalf of those people.  We try to get hospital bills reduced and help to get allowances for people.  We do all these things we are asked to do, and we cannot then come along on Estimates day and cry out about the size of the rates.  The Government must examine this problem very carefully.</P>
    <P>There are throughout this country today very hardworking young men employed as dispensary doctors.  In my area alone, in a village called Dromahaire, there is one of the most dedicated dispensary doctors one could find anywhere.  He has been there for the past four or five years, but he is not permanent.  He has no guarantee that if there was a vacancy declared tomorrow he would be appointed to the post.  If we make representations about the matter we will be told it is the function of the Local Appointments Commission.  In 1969 the Government should have power to appoint to a permanent position a man who has done a good job and who has proved himself, beyond all doubt, to be the right person to fill the post.  We know from experience in the Drumkerrin and Kiltyclogher areas that it is impossible to get doctors, because there is no doctor's residence there.  Anyhow it is very hard to get dispensary doctors <Col N="597" /> to go into rural areas today.  In order to entice these young men to take up these appointments they should be told that after 12 months, if they prove satisfactory, they will be made permanent. A married man with a wife and children would feel more secure if he was permanent and if he knew he would qualify for a pension on retirement. To leave a man indefinitely without a permanent appointment is not at all fair.</P>
    <P>Throughout the length and breadth of this country we have many mentally retarded children who are scarcely ever heard of.  Of late, voluntary organisations are doing a great service by collecting these children, if they can be brought out, bringing them to a special school &mdash; backed up by a grant from this Department &mdash; and transporting them home in the evening.  These voluntary organisations deserve the gratitude of the Minister, of the Department and, indeed, of the nation. The Minister should do all he can to provide money which will go part of the way, at least, towards accommodating a number of those children.  The school at Rosses Point in County Sligo cannot meet the number of applications made to it for admittance.  It serves maybe four counties but it is only touching on the problem.  The Sisters and the staff of that hospital deserve great praise for their work.  I appeal to the Minister to tackle this overall problem as soon as possible. Some homes are wrecked by the presence of a retarded child or children up to the age of maybe 16.  One could not expect such a home to be like any normal home.  What a difference it would make to the parents and brothers and sisters of such a child if it were removed from the home and they knew it was being well looked after and trained to do something useful.</P>
    <P>Our nurses deserve all the consideration the Department of Health can give them.  One has really to be in hospital oneself to appreciate what these girls have to go through and what they are doing.  For some time past, there has been negotiation for increased remuneration for our nurses.  The present position is not clear.  The matter should be settled without delay.  I do not think that nurses in surgical and county hospitals are as organised as, say, <Col N="598" /> mental hospital staffs.  The Minister should attend to this matter without delay and demonstrate to those people that their work is fully appreciated by the Department as, indeed, it is by those who are cared for by them.</P>
    <P>The care of the aged is a national problem.  There are many aged people living alone, particularly in the rural areas, who have no friends or neighbours near them.  There is no hope of getting them into a county home because the accommodation is already taxed to the limit.  I have made attempts to get certain people into county homes and I was unsuccessful.  I approached three hospitals and, while I received every courtesy, I was told that there was no room for those people.  Extension work is being carried out on the county home at Carrick-on-Shannon but I doubt if it will be sufficient to cater for the demand that will still exist.  Emigration takes many of our boys and girls and parents find themselves with nobody left and, in rural areas, they can be living in isolation. When they fall sick, it is too bad that we cannot get them in anywhere.  We must remedy that position.</P>
    <P>In days gone by, there was at least the county home, although we do not like to talk now about those places. This Government or the next Government must tackle this matter at a completely different level.  Comfortable homes capable of accommodating 20 or 30 such persons should be established in various centres rather than a large institution here and there which means that a person who comes from another area may not receive visits from relatives or friends because of the long distance involved.  With the establishment of a number of these small homes in central areas, more people would have visitors.  It is very sad to go into a county home and to find there somebody whom you had thought was dead and gone.  It is indeed sad, when they speak to you, to notice how glad they are to see you.  That would not happen to such a great degree if we had more homes in central situations and not on such a large scale as we have at present.</P>
    <P>We hear much talk in this country about tourism and we go out of our <Col N="599" /> way to build fine roads and fine hotels to attract tourists.  In spending that money, we should not forget our old people and the fact that those county homes we already have cannot accommodate all those who need to be sent to them.  There are plans for a county home in Sligo.  We already have an old and outdated home there which has been kept in use.  I trust it will not be very long until the Minister for Health comes to Sligo to declare the proposed home open.  Certainly, it will be a boon for those of our aged people who will be accommodated there.</P>
    <P>We often meet people whose mentally retarded children have to be sent for accommodation in other counties: for example, children from Leitrim going, perhaps, into a home for mentally retarded children in Dublin or going, perhaps, to the home at Clarenbridge, County Galway.  Because of the distance involved, the parents and relatives of such children are under heavy expense from the point of view of travelling.  It should be made quite clear through the Department that vouchers should be provided to take the children to these homes and back again because this is a very expensive operation.  The parents are quite happy to keep the children at home during the holidays and do all they can for them but the financial strain is heavy.  Therefore, it should go out from the Department that vouchers would be made available through the local authorities for the conveyance of these children.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a fine regional hospital is being established in Sligo. It was said that this would be opened in June but I think it will be September before it is ready.  It will certainly relieve the heavy pressure on the present hospital where people find themselves with three rows of beds in a ward instead of two, and up to twenty patients in accommodation meant for about fourteen.  I cannot say the same about Manorhamilton where the hospital was officially opened by the Minister for Health in 1954.  It cost £350,000. I think it never got off to a favourable start.  From the day it was opened it had only the services of the local surgeon who gave 40 years' service and <Col N="600" /> had to do surgical and medical work of all kinds, attended sometimes by dispensary doctors from surrounding areas.  When the Department went to the expense of establishing this new hospital it was ridiculous not to provide medical services.</P>
    <P>In the past three or four months the local council have been pressing hard to get the Department to appoint a medical man.  This takes a long time, going through various channels, Appointments Commissioners, and so on, with papers passing between the council and the Department and, perhaps, when the appointee arrives he may not like the place and decide not to stay.  He may not come there according to the terms of appointment as published. This is, in itself, a cause of much discontent among the people. If the Department are in favour of keeping people in the country they should go the whole way and not leave just one surgeon there all through the years.  That has happened and it is not to the credit of the Department.</P>
    <P>The big bone of contention in the dispensary areas of Sligo and Leitrim was the question of doctors' residences. Doctors coming to rural areas today naturally want a comfortable residence whether married or single.  Even single men prefer a home of their own to lodgings.  There has been much discussion about dispensary districts and I think the previous Minister, the late Deputy O'Malley, intended that the whole dispensary system should be examined and changed.  Due to the information supplied and views expressed by Sligo and Leitrim and many other counties, the Department have agreed that it would be very hard to serve the needs of people scattered over a wide area without having a system based on dispensary districts.  I agree with that.  In those two counties as I know them, I think the dispensary system is the only one whereby you could keep in touch with the people, many of them living in backward areas. I cannot see one big centre meeting the needs of many of those people.  It is not as in previous times when one could travel a distance of 9/- or 10/-, when transport was cheap.  That day has gone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> I appeal to the Department to provide comfortable accommodation in all new hospitals for patients who go to clinics and also for patients for X-ray.  I know of patients who sat for three hours waiting for a doctor and they were rather surprised that they were not worse leaving the dispensary or hospital than when they came in. They sat on a long seat in a draughty corridor and were left there until they were called in one by one.  Some of them were sick people.  I have known of a patient going for an X-ray left undressed and waiting so long that he decided to dress and go away.  When he was dressed and going home somebody said that he could have the X-ray then but he refused.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>Patients going to dispensaries or hospitals should have comfortable accommodation just as in the case of patients staying in the hospital.  Those who come in might be worse than those inside.  That is a matter that should be carefully examined because we get these complaints and we know they are true.  I spoke to one young man who stood for well over an hour in a dressing-gown, famished, while waiting for an X-ray.  The result was that he put on his clothes and went away.  It is right that the Department and the Minister should know these things and should check and query them.  The people concerned are paying their share just as much as anybody else.</P>
    <P>We have today a number of people who do not qualify for a medical card, but there is a heavy demand by these people for tablets.  There are patients who have to pay up to £2 a week for tablets in order to keep themselves alive and their only hope is to get these tablets on the basis that they are hardship cases.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with these people as generously as possible.  It is not easy to provide money for everything, but a great number of people would be bedridden in county homes, or in their graves, if they were not able to procure the tablets they need through the dispensary or through some chemist. It is a great relief to them when they can do so.  I am sure the Minister and <Col N="602" /> his Department will deal fairly with these people.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to avail of this opportunity of addressing myself to this important Supplementary Estimate for Health.  It is an Estimate to which everyone in the country looked forward because great things were expected in this by-election or general election year.  It was felt the Government would implement at least some of the policy adumbrated in the White Paper produced by the late Deputy O'Malley when he was Minister for Health.  If the Government had any sense of responsibility they would realise that there devolves on them a moral responsibility to honour the promises made by the late Deputy O'Malley in that White Paper.  Much needed improvements were promised. There was to be liberalisation in the provision of medical cards.  There was to be liberalisation of the means test.  There was to be a choice of doctor; no patient would be stuck with the same doctor, and <i>vice versa</i>, irrespective of how much they loved or hated one another.  We were promised, too, the abolition of the archaic dispensary system.  Nothing has so far been done.  The promises seem to have been brushed under the carpet.  It is astonishing that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to implement at this crucial period some of the promises contained in the White Paper.  We can only assume that the Government are so badly off as to be well-nigh bankrupt of ideas and resources.</P>
      <P>Not only has the Minister not improved the health services but he has failed to give relief to the ratepayers from the crushing burden of rates arising primarily out of the cost of the health services.  Those of us in local authorities know that the cost of the health services is in the main responsible for the spiralling rates.  All pleading with the Minister to relieve the rates of this crushing burden and place it instead on the central Exchequer has been ignored.</P>

      <P>I respect your rulings, but I have perused the Minister's speech very carefully and I can assure you, Sir, that the Minister did deal with the impact of the health services on the rates and with what he was hoping to do in that regard.  One would expect, therefore, that everyone would be entitled to comment on the matter. I also listened to other Deputies ranging at large over almost every aspect of the health services, without any attempt being made to restrict them in their particular contributions. However, if you rule that I am not in order in discussing what every other Deputy discussed&mdash;that is, the impact of the health services on rates&mdash;I shall bow to your ruling.</P>

      <P>One of the primary reasons for my intervention in this debate is the report of the consultative committee on the general hospital services of the future and the hospital system.  I certainly hope that what is contained in this document is not given effect to, otherwise there will be consternation throughout the land.  If one relates this report to one's own constituency or to the health authorities in one's own constituency one is appalled at what could happen if effect were given to it.  It contemplates a radical change in our health services.  The regionalisation of the health services is to some extent understandable but one realises, in respect of South Tipperary and, indeed, in respect of County Tipperary at large, that if the FitzGerald Report is implemented it involves leaving all County Tipperary without its own hospital service; it means the closing down of the main hospitals in the county, in Nenagh, Cashel and Clonmel and also the smaller hospitals at Carrick-on-Suir, Clogheen and Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report has shocked and appalled the public representatives on South <Col N="604" /> Tipperary County Council; they are appalled at the prospect of all our patients being obliged to go for treatment to places like Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  It may be argued that these regional hospitals are within reasonable proximity to various points in our counties but the mind boggles at the thought of a chronically ill patient being transferred from Clonmel to Limerick or Cork.  Apart from that there is also the problem of the relatives visiting the patients.  They would be unable to visit patients in such far away places.  The cost of travel in this country is very high and it would be extremely difficult for relatives to visit patients in these places at regular intervals.  My colleagues of all political affiliations in the South Tipperary County Council and its subsidiary bodies and of the North Tipperary County Council and its subsidiary bodies are unanimous in our outright and positive opposition to the FitzGerald Report.  We will never allow it to come into operation in our county.  We will never allow the hospitals which we have improved and developed at such considerable cost to be closed down or relegated to the status of what are called community health centres.</P>
    <P>I do not know what a community health centre is.  I presume it is a clinic where people will go for inspection or for outdoor treatment.  It is appalling to think of our hospitals being degraded to this status and our smaller hospitals being closed down.  While we are most concerned with efficiency we will never accept what is contained in the report with regard to the wiping out of the whole hospital service of County Tipperary and the relegation of our people to faraway places for treatment.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has accepted the report in principle but he would need to be very wary before he commits himself to implementing it in its entirety, especially in Tipperary generally and in West Waterford where we are outrightly opposed to the suggestions contained in it.  I would hope that before any of the recommendations of this report are embarked upon the members of the local health authorities would be given the courtesy of consultation in advance, that the Minister would consult with us before <Col N="605" /> implementing the radical aspects of the report so that there would be some degree of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The closing down of our main county hospitals cannot be condoned in any way.  These are institutions which have been extensively and expensively improved over a long number of years.  Under the British system there used to be poorhouses or almshouses but they were transformed into modern hospitals, highly staffed and equipped.  We are intensely proud of the work done by our county managers and our health officers in transforming them into the finest institutions in the country and we will not see them closed or relegated to the status of community health centres by a stroke of the pen by Mr. FitzGerald or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Most other Deputies will have been as alarmed as I have been and in this matter I am calling for the determined opposition of all political Parties in South Tipperary to the idea of closing down the wonderful surgical hospital which we have at Cashel.  This is where, in the main, all the surgical treatment in South Tipperary is carried out.  Closing down the County Hospital in Clonmel, which is essentially a maternity hospital and a general hospital, and closing down the general hospital in Nenagh would be nothing less than disastrous and no sensible public representative could condone or have any hand, act or part in such an action which would have farreaching consequences for the large population involved.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to our nurses and the wonderful type of nurse we have.  It is not a vain boast to say that our nurses are the finest and most dedicated nurses in the world.  It is the wish of myself and my colleagues that we should appreciate our nurses fully and ensure for them the very best conditions of employment, respect their high standard of education and ensure that their remuneration is suitable to the outstanding work they perform.  We would also wish that they should have suitable avenues of promotion open to them and that nurses returning from British hospitals should receive full credit for their cross-Channel nursing <Col N="606" /> services.  It is to be regretted that so many of our girls must go to Britain to be trained as nurses and I would ask the Minister to do what he can to provide more opportunities for training nurses in our own institutions. Many of these girls do not go to Britain for training of their own volition but because the opportunities are not available here.  Naturally, having qualified, they very much desire to return and to work in our own hospitals.  They should be welcomed with open arms and the high degree of efficiency and skill which they acquire in these wonderful hospitals in Britain should fully be appreciated. We can best do that by ensuring for them conditions and remuneration commensurate with their skill, training and education.</P>
    <P>I should like to see our nurses having the same opportunities for promotion as are available in Britain and elsewhere.  There should be no restriction in regard to promotion and I would ask the Minister to ensure that nurses in our hospitals, our lay nurses, are afforded promotional opportunities to all grades up to the full status of matron.  I would like to see this being possible even where a religious order is running a hospital.  The Minister can say whether or not this is true but it is alleged that no matter how highly qualified lay nurses may be they cannot obtain promotion in hospitals run by religious orders unless, it is also alleged, they join the order.  This is not intended to denigrate in any way the wonderful work of these religious orders in our hospitals but it is only fair to the nurses concerned that in any sphere of their employment the opportunity for promotion should be there.  One can well understand how utterly frustrating and disappointing it must be for a highly qualified nurse, who has devoted her life to this noble profession, to find that she may never be able to become a matron in one of these institutions.  I should be very glad to hear the Minister's views on this matter.  I feel that we will continue to lose some of the finest brains in the nursing profession if there is not a change in this regard and unless there is this promotional opportunity for them in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> I want now to pay tribute to the Jubilee nurses.  This wonderful nursing group has now virtually disappeared and it is a great pity.  Their origins were essentially British but, be that as it may, we remember with pride the wonderful work they performed throughout the country when our health services were even worse than they are today and these gallant ladies moved through the sick poor operating as angels of mercy and being of wonderful assistance to the local dispensary doctors.  They did herculean work for our people and their going leaves a void which it will be difficult to fill.  Indeed, in places where the Jubilee nurses have already disappeared we have as yet been unable to replace them, certainly in parts of my constituency.  The Minister will have to concentrate on speeding up the provision of many extra district nurses to fill this gap caused by the disappearance of that wonderful institution, the Jubilee nurse.  The group was financed by the donations of local people and perhaps by a contribution from a local health authority.  Their position was precarious and they had no semblance of security at all.  It is a wonder they operated so long in such difficult circumstances.  It is a pity they were not merged properly in the reorganisation of the health services in recent years and properly compensated for a lifetime of endeavour for our local communities especially in respect of pensions and the like.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for the interest he has displayed in the welfare of the aged.  It is a good thing that he has empowered local authorities to make grants available to deal more effectively with the problem of the aged.  No doubt the health authorities throughout the country will rally to the Minister in this regard and interpret his wishes in the spirit in which he intended, to provide generously moneys for all those wonderful voluntary organisations which are doing such wonderful work for the care of aged people.  It is high time they were recognised by the Department of Health and its Minister.  I know the local authorities will be only too pleased to make <Col N="608" /> available the necessary money for the purposes intended.</P>
    <P>How much worse off the health services would be and the standard of living of these poor, aged people were it not for the outstanding work being done by these voluntary organisations? How many more of these aged people would wind up in the county homes? The county homes of this country would be cluttered up and overcrowded altogether were it not for the efforts of these voluntary bodies in providing meals on wheels, visiting regularly, providing comfort in cash and kind and making it possible for these old folk to live at home.  This is the truly wonderful aspect of this matter, the many thousands of people throughout the country who have been afforded the grand opportunity of remaining at home whether they lived alone or with relatives, by the efforts and the sympathies of these voluntary bodies in providing the meals on wheels, in providing money and coal and comfort by their visits.  Therefore, it behoves us all and especially the State to supplement the old age pension or the widow's pension, whatever the small State pension might be, by generous allowances whether it be disabled persons maintenance allowance or home assistance or special grants of this kind.</P>
    <P>I feel that however much we spend on the transformation of our county homes we are not making them any more attractive to our old people nor, indeed, to their families.  My experience, as a public representative, is that there is still this ingrained reluctance to permit of one's relative being despatched to the county home no matter what kind of fancy name we append to it.  This old stigma is still there.  Consequently, the work which the Minister is laudably helping in is to be encouraged and promoted in every way.</P>
    <P>After that I would hope to see us providing more adequately for our geriatrics as they are known by the provision of a number of beds in all our local hospitals rather than concentrating on the building of a grandiose county home, providing a home for the old folks in their own environment. I think the most practical idea <Col N="609" /> would be the provision of additional beds at the local hospital, even if it were only ten beds, for geriatrics.  There they would be in their own environment and could hope for visits from their friends and relatives much more often than if they were sent to the county home.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the recent circular which the Minister issued to all health authorities.  Instead of getting the good news from the Minister that he was increasing the subvention for the health services this year in conformity with the increased wages and salaries and costs of all kinds, we had a rather worrying letter issued to us laying down strictures of economy which we were all obliged to conform to.  The Minister may not have intended it that way but when one talks about economising in respect of the health services or the provision of proper health services for the local community one can hardly be expected to economise unless one is forced to cut back on the services.  A cut back on the health services is something which none of us could condone.  Is it seriously suggested that we should cut back on the cost of medicines and drugs?  Is it seriously suggested that we should cut back on the subventions which we are entitled to pay to private institutions?  Is it suggested that we should adopt a get-tough line in respect of the provision of medical cards? God knows the line is tough enough and the means test odious enough without inculcating into the minds of managers or officers of health authorities the idea of getting tougher still and cutting back on health services which, even at their best, leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I observed that in the Minister's speech he particularly mentioned that the cost of medicines has increased considerably since the scheme of free drugs and medicines was introduced. This is quite true.</P>
    <P>However, it is also to be appreciated that these free drugs and medicines were designed to assist people in the middle income group who would not normally qualify for a medical card, who would have a sick patient on their hands for a long period and for whom it would be a financial burden <Col N="610" /> which they simply could not afford.  It is right and moral, equitable and just in these circumstances that free drugs and medicines should be provided. They are so being provided by most health authorities in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is appreciated that the cost of drugs and medicines is exorbitantly high in this country and, perhaps, in most countries.  It was hoped that the Minister would tackle this problem energetically and effectively and would clamp down on the obvious exploitation in respect of the cost of drugs and medicines, the excessive charges, the obvious colossal profit which the manufacturers are making.  It is difficult to understand the variation in the cost of these commodities and the fact that the State is so helpless in trying to grapple effectively with this problem and to bring costs down to more rational proportions.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot be expected to get their medicines and drugs on the cheap.  We have to be very careful about providing health services on the cheap.  There is already a feeling that too much of our health services is based on the criterion of money rather than actual need.  There are various grades of health service and medicine as between the private ward, the semi-private ward and the public ward.  It is generally felt that there are various grades of treatment for varying classes of patients.  It is an acknowledged fact that everybody does not experience the same bedside manner as is displayed towards the paying patient.  That is distinct from the grunt and the growl which the holder of the medical card may get from the same individual.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we had hoped that the Minister would have implemented a free choice of doctor.  It is intrinsically wrong that a medical card holder should be condemned interminably to the same doctor.  There ought to be a choice.  Is it not a fact that the right of choice of doctor is so ingrained in people that even the very poor who have medical cards in some cases do, in fact, go to a doctor other than the dispensary doctor and pay their £1 for this right of choice?  Is it not a fact <Col N="611" /> that quite a large percentage of medical card holders do not attend the local dispensary doctor but feel obliged to exercise a choice and pay the local doctor and secure the drugs prescribed at the dispensary in the ordinary way?  This choice of doctor is fundamental and should be conceded without further ado.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to liberalise the rigid means test applicable in the case of medical cards.  He should eliminate the embarrassment and humiliation involved in seeking a medical card.  There is the odious means test carried out by home assistance officers in which the entire family income is calculated.  As a result, an applicant may be told that he is exceptionally well-off and his application for a medical card is rejected.  The late Deputy Donogh O'Malley said in the White Paper that he produced that he would liberalise this test, that he would exclude the income of certain members of the family in the calculation. That promise has yet to be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>In the area that I represent I observe that members of the Defence Forces, our soldiers, are, in particular, victimised by this odious means test for the purposes of medical cards.  I put it to the Minister that it would be a worthwhile exercise to ascertain the number of Army personnel, in the grade of private in particular, who hold medical cards or whose medical cards have been withdrawn.  It is a very niggardly test, indeed, which determines that an Army private with a wife and a large family is not entitled to a medical card.  I know for a fact that where Army privates and their families held medical cards, the cards have been withdrawn.  An army private or corporal may have access to excellent medical treatment from the Army but that treatment is not available to his wife and children and they are the sufferers.  I know it to be a fact that the wives and children of Army personnel are suffering great privation and hardship in recent times as a result of the denial to them of proper health services by reason of the withdrawal of medical cards or the <Col N="612" /> persistent refusal to grant medical cards to these categories.</P>
    <P>I raised questions in this House with the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence is not concerned about this matter.  The Minister for Health will probably tell me that these people are subject to the same means test as is applicable to other citizens. I choose to think that the wage or salary of an Army private is not so high that he and his family should be precluded from having their names on the health register as such.  I would ask the Minister to consider this situation.  It is a matter of very grave concern to me that so many Army privates and their wives and families in particular should be in a state of desperation as to how to provide money for doctors' fees, drugs and medicines and hospitalisation.  I maintain that their standard of living is not so opulent that they can be regarded as being in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>I want to lend my voice to the pleading in this House for a more humane approach to all those unfortunate people in the lower income group who are dependent on the dispensary services.  There is no proper accommodation provided for them.  We have had to raise this matter here before.  Many of our dispensaries are in a scandalously dilapidated and ruinous condition.  They are cold, damp and dark, and, apart from all that, there is no privacy provided for the people who have to avail of them. These places are utilised for many purposes.  Apart from their use by the dispensary doctor and nurse, they are also used by home assistance officers, rate collectors and the like.  Many of our people are humiliated and greatly embarrassed by the appalling circumstances prevailing in these dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek an improvement in these premises.  We must have due regard to the dignity of the human person and ensure that the same kind of treatment is given to the medical card holders as to the person with a big fat wallet.  Admittedly, if we get the choice of doctor which is envisaged in the White Paper it will mean the withering away of this dispensary service.  Knowing what the people have to contend with when <Col N="613" /> they queue up at the local dispensary for a check-up by the doctor and the provision of the proper treatment by way of drugs and medicines, I am quite satisfied that the old red ticket system of many years ago under the British regime was a far more honourable system than the present one.  The present system degrades and humiliates a person from the very onset of the investigation, from the moment a person enters a dispensary and queues up in the cold dilapidated atmosphere, to the manner in which the drugs and medicines are dispensed and to the treatment afforded in the public wards of hospitals as distinct from the semi-private or private wards.  Under the old red ticket system, you merely presented yourself for the ticket and you got it without question.  There was no means test.  Need was the criterion, not money as is the case now.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate, therefore, has been a shocking disappointment to us all.  We are all regarded as astute politicians, and it was rather expected the Minister would avail of this unique opportunity of giving us a general election Health Estimate &mdash; that the least he would do would be to make good the promises made in the White Paper on the Health Services to provide a choice of doctor, to liberalise the means test for the medical card and abolish this dispensary system of which I have been talking.  It was also expected that he would rid the local taxpayers of the crushing burden on the rates and make the cost of the health services a charge on the Exchequer. In getting rid of the burden as ratepayers we know we shall have to meet it as taxpayers, but we contend that the raising of this sizeable amount of money for the health services by way of direct taxation is a far more equitable system than raising it through the rates.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will take his courage in his hands and indicate as soon as possible to all our health authorities that he will make the health services a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>All of us who are members of health authorities are anxiously awaiting an announcement by the Minister in this regard.  I represent part of County <Col N="614" /> Waterford; in fact I am as much a Member for West Waterford as I am for South Tipperary.  Naturally I am very familiar with the affairs of Waterford County Council and I think that council were right when they refused to strike a rate in recent weeks. They realised that while they have an obligation to strike a rate they also have an obligation to strike a rate which their people can afford.  The increase in the rate in County Waterford has been such that they felt they would not be justified in passing it on to the people at large.  They have declined to strike a rate until such time as the Minister makes known his decision on the contribution he proposes to make to the health charges.</P>
    <P>Much has been done but much more remains to be done in respect of mentally and physically retarded children. I am concerned about the interminable delay before proper institutional treatment can be provided for so many of these children.  The Minister is giving attention to this matter, but we are depending, in the main, on the religious orders, to whom I wish to pay tribute for the wonderful part they are playing in grappling as effectively as they can with the problem of the mentally and physically retarded.  We have not advanced very far in regard to health matters generally when institutional treatment cannot be provided for these unfortunate children except after most strenuous efforts and after waiting for years for bed accommodation.  The position has become much easier in securing proper institutional treatment for the mildly handicapped but it is still extremely difficult to secure proper institutional treatment for the severely handicapped.  I do not have to elaborate on the sad, sorry situation in any household where there is a child of this kind and the great tragedy of it.  We realise the impossible task of coping with a patient of this kind in the home and the great cross which parents and the family at large have to bear.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have a very close look at this situation again to see what he can do to accelerate the provision of bed accommodation for these unfortunate people.  It is a serious indictment of our institutional services <Col N="615" /> at large that so many of these severely mentally retarded boys and girls of very tender age &mdash; 11, 12, 13 years &mdash; are finding their way into our mental hospitals and are domiciled with adult male or adult female mental patients. It is an intolerable situation and the Minister ought not to condone it.  He should see to it that steps are taken to ensure that no mentally or physically retarded child under, say, 18 or 20 years is permitted to be domiciled in a mental hospital.  It is utterly unsuitable for this purpose and there are grave dangers attendant on their being based in such an environment.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity of asking the Minister, if he has not already done so, to extend the school medical service to children at post primary level.  It is intrinsically wrong that the service is not continued once they leave the national school.  Whether it be treatment of the ear, nose, throat, eyes or anything else, it will have commenced in the primary school but parents find that the free treatment will not be continued while the child is attending secondary school or vocational school.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that school children, irrespective of age, are given this free medical treatment and that this silly business of stopping the service at national school level ends once and for all.  It is a matter of very great concern to parents that this anomaly in the health services should be rectified without any further delay.  It is surprising that we have to mention it so often in this House.  It is a reasonable request and it is so obviously necessary that it is difficult to understand why it has not been implemented long ago.</P>
    <P>I want, also, to express my concern about the difficulties of securing certain specialist services and, in particular, about the difficulty of securing dispensary doctors in certain parts of our country and in certain parts of my constituency.  As the Minister and his Department are well aware, we are finding it extremely difficult to secure a permanent dispensary doctor at Ballingarry, Thurles.  The people there, especially the medical card-holders there who are entitled to the dispensary <Col N="616" /> service, free drugs, medicines and the like, have been bereft of these rights for some considerable time past as a result of our inability to provide a permanent doctor and dispensary service there.  We have a temporary arrangement and the doctor concerned is doing the best he can, but it is utterly and totally inadequate.  The large number of people in this dispensary district are in a truly bad way for a doctor.  They have to travel long distances for a doctor and they have to pay dearly for a doctor even though they have medical cards and are entitled to this facility free.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the anxiety of mind of the large populace in the Ballingarry area, a renowned mining area.  Mining is a dangerous and precarious occupation. There goes with it a pretty high incidence of accidents.  These miners and their families, farmers, workers and people at large in this area have had no permanent doctor living with them and serving their needs for some considerable time.  No words of mine can adequately express their anxiety, their constant worry, their ingrained fear of ill-health &mdash; their fear of a pain in the middle of the night, their fear of accident and their fear of the known virtual impossibility of securing a medical practitioner within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I know this matter has been before the Local Appointments Commission on many occasions and that they would seem to have recommended somebody for the post but nobody ever took up the post.  I do not know what is wrong. If it is a matter of inadequacy of salary, this I think would be a function of the Minister.  We, as a health authority, have done our best to make the post as attractive and as lucrative as possible. We are concerned lest the trouble might be that of accommodation.  We have now provided excellent housing accommodation as well as an excellent dispensary, duly repaired and modernised, in the hope of attracting a permanent appointment of the kind we desire.</P>
    <P>Recently, I wrote to the Minister asking him if he would be good enough to receive a deputation in respect of this very important and very urgent <Col N="617" /> matter.  In due course, the Minister replied to my letter under his own hand.  We are all politicians and supposed to have thick skins but I believe the Minister set out deliberately to be outrightly discourteous to me in the reply he caused to be issued to me. Not alone did he fail to reply to my query as to whether he would receive a deputation but he went on to tell me about the part which other politicians played in this matter of bringing to his notice the position at Ballingarry. Obviously, the letter was couched in such terminology as to ensure that I would derive very little political kudos out of it.  I can find political kudos in many ways without seeking to make a mockery of the sufferings of the people of Ballingarry as regards their lack of doctor and proper dispensary services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>None of us wants to make politics out of Ballingarry but we urgently want to provide a dispensary doctor there.  I ask the Minister to forget his politics.  I do not give a damn who gets credit for this; he can give the credit to anyone he likes but at least let us have regard to the situation which has existed for far too long in Ballingarry.  Let us get them a doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate that the Government and the Minister have an obligation to implement all that is contained in the White Paper on the Health Services.  Otherwise, we can only conclude that it was merely an election gimmick.  No doubt it secured quite a lot of votes for the Party but they cannot, with impunity, publish an important document like this without the moral obligation that goes with it of doing what it said it would do and of implementing it in good time.  It is difficult to understand why it has not yet been implemented.  I ask the Minister to have regard to the spirit and intention of the late Deputy O'Malley and give to the Irish people what the late Minister said he would give them: <Col N="619" /> a much improved health service, not perhaps the kind of health service that the Labour Party have in store for the Irish people but certainly an improvement on the present system which has done so much to cause hardship and suffering and create fear in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was absent I adverted to the FitzGerald Report.  I shall not repeat myself except to ask the Minister to indicate to us in the House, and particularly in our own environments, as members of local health authorities, when he proposes to give effect to any of the measures contained in this most controversial document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions by questions and again in the course of this debate some Deputies have appealed to the Minister to extend the school medical service to post-primary schools.  I do not agree with this. If there is to be any extension of the service it should be in the other direction, so as to take the infant through its life until the child starts going to school.  Further, I ask the Minister to have a good look at this scheme and completely reorientate it.  As it works now it has advantages, but many of the bigger advantages are missed.  The proper approach to this problem is that the family doctor should examine the child each year from the day of its birth until the child starts going to school.</P>
      <P>This would be an annual examination to correspond with the birthday of the child and the family doctor would be able to pick up all the complaints, for all practical purposes, that are now picked up in the school medical service.  This would have the advantage that the family doctor would be more integrated with the family and also that defects in the children would be discovered earlier and they would get earlier treatment.  Further, by having those ailments treated before the child goes to school, no school time would be lost.  At present the children first go to school and next they are taken from the school environment into hospital.  My suggestion would avoid this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> The people who now carry out the school medical examination are on the medical staff attached to the public health office.  Those men should be given a different job in the public health office.  They should be graded as specialists dealing with different aspects of children's diseases so that the family doctor would be able to direct the children to them for a second opinion.  Those men, with more specialised knowledge, would be able to give an opinion which might mean that the child could continue in its environment or they could direct it further.  That would take some of the pressure off the clinics, particularly the Dublin clinics, which deal mostly with children.  It would reduce to some extent the amount of investigation that has to be done in hospitals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the scheme should be continued through the national schools. It is my opinion that, if the scheme is operated as I suggest, and any grave ailment or defect continues without being discovered before the child reaches secondary school, it reflects gravely on the doctor, or doctors, concerned.  It would be foolish to extend this scheme into the post-primary field.  Strangely enough, the only place into which one feels it should be extended is the university. Some of the people in university would appear to need medical advice, but so far nobody has suggested we should extend the service to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I urge the Minister to consider my proposal rather than the proposals put up by other speakers.  In relation to how medical services should be paid for, insurance has been proposed on a number of occasions.  It is only right we should put it on record that this idea first came from the Irish Medical Association.  I think the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme resulted from the work done by the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are complaints about the Voluntary Health Insurance but, by and large, it has met a great need. Mostly the complaint is that not enough people are aware of it.  I have a slight personal crib.  I think it is <Col N="621" /> unfair to have exemptions.  If a parent declares that a child suffers from some chronic disease the Voluntary Health Insurance will accept the family but exclude them from treatment for the particular disease, or diseases, as the case may be.  But they continue to extract the full premium.  They are offering a 90 per cent service for a 100 per cent premium.  In such cases they should abate the premium.  Their answer seems to be that, if they did, the scheme would not pay.  It is hard enough on parents to have a specific disease in a family and be compelled to declare that when looking for insurance cover without finding themselves not only having to pay for their own family diseases out of their own pockets but having, at the same time, to cover other people's diseases as well.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the Minister recently made some offer to the doctors with regard to payment under the proposed health legislation. I should like to put it on record that I, as a dispensary doctor, am grateful to the Minister for his having taken cognisance of the fact that a doctor should be expected to work only a reasonable number of hours in the day.  This is the first time we have had such a high authority behind us in this.  Most doctors are conscious of the fact that the Minister certainly has the interests of doctors at heart.</P>
    <P>County hospitals and the FitzGerald Report have been referred to.  Roscommon county hospital has been earmarked for downgrading.  Naturally enough this will be resented.  The one fear I have is that when the present medical and surgical staffs retire we will not be able to get people of their standard to continue working in the hospital and we may find our hospital closing, not because of the Minister's decision but because we cannot get first-class staff.  This has happened in other circles.  It has happened in dispensaries. We have heard about the situation in Ballingarry; everything is laid on but they cannot get a medical officer.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Manorhamilton. In view of the fact that Sligo is now being extended I think the proper approach is to convert Manorhamilton into a first-class medical unit, <Col N="622" /> a unit not catering for either surgery or midwifery.  The establishment of Manorhamilton as a first-class medical unit would be of tremendous benefit to the people in the area.  It need not be confined to Leitrim.  I would take in Sligo patients if they wished to go to Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>The one thing that struck me in this debate is the fact that every Deputy who spoke wants an extension of all services but he does not want these extended services to be paid for out of rates.  As the Minister stated, somebody must pay for them.  Medicine is a very dear commodity.  By and large, the county council with which I come in contact is fairly reasonable in interpreting the hardship clause.  This is very important because there are people who opt for private or semi-private accommodation in hospitals who are not, in fact, able to pay for such accommodation.</P>

      <P>They find themselves with bills they are not able to meet. Local authorities must draw the line somewhere.  In some cases they have to decide they will not accept more than their statutory obligations.  I have felt for some time now that there is an obligation on doctors, and this includes myself, to point out certain things to patients before they go into hospital. It does no good for a patient to come home and find himself faced with a bill that makes him twice as sick as he was originally.</P>

There is just one snag; people are not prepared to pay.  Money can be found for other things but it just cannot be found for medicine and, no matter how it is <Col N="623" /> found, it will be resented in the long run.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few remarks I should like to make.  I am disappointed because I expected that by the time this Supplementary Estimate came before the House we would have before us the proposed new Health Bill.  I also expected that we in the local authorities would have some indication from the Minister and his Department of the actual contribution or recoupment which he was in a position to make to the local authorities for their expenditure on the health services.</P>
      <P>In that connection our local authority met a fortnight ago last Monday to discuss our estimate.  At that stage our county manager had a circular from the Department pointing out that their contribution to the health service expenditure will be no less than last year. Last year their contribution was 54 per cent.  We adjourned that meeting for the simple reason that we felt it would be impossible for us to strike a rate without having the information regarding the exact contribution.  We adjourned until 18th March, which was yesterday, and went back to find that we were still awaiting the information from the Department.  Having discussed the estimate for health at length, we discovered that because of the increased demand from the county manager which for last year was 5/8½d in the £ we were expected to strike a rate not knowing whether we were to get a 54 per cent contribution or a greater contribution from the Exchequer.  After five hours that meeting was again adjourned because we felt that without the information from the Department and because of the inability of the people to meet the increased general demand on the rates of 11/6d in the £, we could not take a proper decision on the question of striking the rate.  We were left in the position that Carlow County Council had to adjourn the whole matter until next Monday which is the last date left to us to strike the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I should say in all fairness that the Minister has agreed to receive a deputation tomorrow <Col N="624" /> morning consisting of the chairman, my opposition colleague and the county manager.  I hope he will be in a position to tell them then that he will be able to give us a substantial increase in the contribution.  When the Health Act was introduced, I was a member of Carlow County Council but not of this House, and we were told that the health services would not cost the rates more than 2/- in the £.  The position today is that the health services which last year cost 25/4d in the £ will, under the present estimate if not altered, jump from 25/4d to the large sum of 30/- in the £.</P>
    <P>There is no Member of this House who would cheesepare on the Estimate for Health because of the necessity to give the people the service that is due to them but I think it is unfair that the local authorities should be put in the position of not knowing where they stand when their estimates are being produced.  It is disgraceful that in this day in 1969 we should still be subjecting people who cannot afford to pay for their own medical services to the indignity of having to obtain a medical card and, having done that, to find that because they hold the medical card they are not entitled to a choice of doctor.  This is something over which nobody could stand.  A person who has the money to pay can go to the doctor of his choice but the unfortunate individual who cannot afford to pay is forced to go to a certain dispensary doctor.  This is something that must be changed and the sooner it is changed the better.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this Supplementary Estimate, under the heading of hospitalisation, I want to say on the question of regionalisation of hospitals that we have no county hospital in Carlow and that we are compelled to send our patients to Dublin or Portlaoise. As the Minister is aware, the subsistence allowance for the Dublin hospitals, and I speak open to correction on this, is 63/- per day.  We have in our town a private hospital which has a surgeon available and which is run by a nursing Order of nuns who also employ lay staff.  If a patient has to be sent there the subvention payable to that hospital is only 25/4d per day. There is something radically wrong <Col N="625" /> here where you have a hospital such as this which is up-to-date and has surgical facilities available and yet the subvention to that hospital is so low compared with Dublin hospitals and hospitals elsewhere.  I mention this point for the simple reason that over 12 months ago the Sisters who had been running this private hospital for a number of years left and had it not been for another Order taking it over Carlow would have been left without any surgical facilities whatever.</P>
    <P>We have progressed to the point where at the moment we have plans for a maternity unit in Carlow and I hope it will not be long before we get the go-ahead sign from the Department for this maternity unit.  It is then planned to transfer the district hospital to where the present maternity unit is in St. Dymphna's.  It was stated today that if the Minister were to visit some of the hospitals throughout the country he would be appalled.  I am very anxious that this maternity unit should go ahead quickly so that we can move the patients from the present district hospital to a wing in St. Dymphna's. The nursing service in the district hospital is perfect and the doctors are perfect, and nobody has any fault to find in that regard but the building is an old building and personally I feel that the day it is vacated the proper thing to do would be to put a bomb under it.  It is not a suitable place for a hospital.  It served its purpose down the years and great credit is due to the nursing staff and the doctors for the work they are doing in such an oldfashioned building.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Dr. Gibbons who mentioned some of the rural dispensaries. We have also found difficulty in this regard in one area where a house is available for the doctor but the post is only advertised as a temporary post and the doctor is expected to reside in a rural area.  So far as I am aware, the council have not been successful in getting somebody to fill this post which is in Shangarry. We did suggest to the county manager that the matter should be brought to the notice of the Department of Health and I think it was mentioned to the Minister that in such a case as this, in a rural area, there should be some <Col N="626" /> enticement to doctors to reside there&mdash; in other words, that there should be some extra remuneration paid to doctors who would reside in these areas. The dispensary served the area for many years and we have had resident permanent doctors there years ago but when the last vacancy occurred we were not in a position to advertise it as a permanent position because we were awaiting a decision with regard to the Health Act.  This is one of the reasons for the delay in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department may have in mind a pilot area for the development of the medical scheme and I would urge the Minister to give favourable consideration to the town of Carlow when considering this matter. It would be an ideal place for the pilot area.  I was glad to note the Minister's statement that he proposes to take power to deal with the problem of drug abuse.  I believe there is great abuse of drugs in the country at the moment and I would certainly support any move to take action in this matter. I would ask the Minister and his Department to let us have, before Monday next, the amount of the contribution which his Department will make towards the health services in Carlow. I would urge the Minister to increase the contribution by a large percentage especially as we in Carlow are one of the smallest administrative units in the country.  As far as I am aware there are certain areas which are receiving higher contributions than we are and I would urge the Minister to make a decision on this matter and to let us know the increased contribution so that we can decide on the estimate for the coming year.  We are not prepared in any circumstances to deprive the people of medical services but we feel that we are not being treated fairly with a contribution from the Department of only 54 per cent considering that the increased charges in Dublin hospitals due to the latest increases will fall on the Carlow County Council to the extent of £32,000.  That is the estimated cost for the coming year which is a staggering figure.  Taking all these matters into consideration, we have a fair case for a substantial increase in contribution from the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Like a number of Deputies who have spoken before me I should like to express disappointment that the Health Bill which we were promised almost daily in the last couple of months has not yet been produced. The Minister told me in this House that it would be ready on the 16th February, on the 28th February, on the 5th March and that it would be ready today.  I do not know whether the idea is to wait until the general election is declared and then produce the Bill around that time and say: &ldquo;Only for those fellows forced an election we would be able to have this through Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  I am not entirely in agreement with what I see reported about what is supposed to be included in the Health Bill but at least we should see what is in it.  It leaves us discussing the Health Estimate here, even if it is last year's Estimate, in a type of vacuum.  We are talking about the Health Estimate and we are talking mainly about what we expect to be done in this coming year and it is very hard to relate it to what should be done when we do not know where we stand, whether or not it is proposed to change entirely the whole health services within the 12 months from now.</P>
      <P>Dispensary doctors who, I suppose, will almost completely disappear under the new scheme have come in for much criticism from certain speakers here.  This is hardly fair because I suppose 99.9 per cent of them are dedicated people who do an excellent job.  The few throughout the country who do not do their job properly are, as in every other walk of life, bringing their profession into a certain amount of disrepute.  For that reason we all hoped that the choice of doctor would be introduced because it would very soon sort out those wise guys who do not want to do what they are being paid to do and it would soon separate those who are prepared to give a service from those who are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as long as this service is continuing as it is now and as long as we are operating the dispensary system, it is only right that an effort should be made to have vacancies filled.  The Minister, I am quite sure, is aware of the situation which has built up over the last few years where, when dispensary <Col N="628" /> doctors were retired or died or the dispensary district for any reason became vacant, it was found extremely difficult to fill some of them, the main reason being that doctors could not be recruited from outside the service.  This had the result of doctors who were in the service being able to choose the better type of district and, therefore, the districts that were not supposed to be so hot were left without a doctor for a long time.  In many cases the neighbouring doctor was attempting to cover the district.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very helpful to me and to Meath County Council on one occasion when we found it difficult to get a doctor for Nobber.  I am glad to say there is a doctor there now but it was a year or a year and a half before a doctor could be found who would stay there.  The fact that one has been found now is something for which we are very thankful.  Situations like this arise all over the place at the present time.  On the Meath-Westmeath border the district of Clonmellon is covered by a doctor who lives in Mullingar. That doctor is 30 miles from the end of his dispensary district.  There is a dispensary residence and a dispensary in the area.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be far better not to have a dispensary doctor for the area at all than to say to the people in that district: &ldquo;If you become ill and you want free treatment and if you have a medical card the only doctor you can call on is the doctor in Mullingar, 30 miles away.&rdquo;  This is entirely wrong.  I do not know who is responsible for allowing this to happen but it should not be allowed to continue. Kells is quite close to most of the area.  A doctor from Kells was servicing it for a long time.  Surely it should be possible to arrange in a case like this that a doctor from Kells could cover at least portion of the area until such time as adequate arrangements are made.  The present situation should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Many people may not agree with me but I feel that the most important thing coming before this House is the health of the people of this country.  Money spent on health which allows people to continue in their employment rather <Col N="629" /> than remain ill for a long time is money well spent.  It is just too bad that in the year 1969 we have a situation where people have written to me to say that they have been ill and have not sent for a doctor because he lives so far away and they cannot afford to have a private doctor.  I have pointed out to them that the doctors in Kells if they were aware of the situation would be prepared, I know, to give their services at a nominal fee or, perhaps, for nothing at all because of the fact that the people are really poor but they should not be put in this position. I suggest that the Minister and his Department should make every effort to have this straightened out.  It is not an isolated case.  This occurs from one end of the country to the other.  Until the Minister succeeds in getting his Bill before the House and through the House, until we know exactly what is going to happen with regard to dispensary doctors we will have a continuation of this situation.  Doctors, being human, will only pick the best areas they can get and something must be done.  Either the Minister should scrap the present arrangement and say we will go back to the old system where any doctor who wants to become a dispensary doctor is entitled to become one whether he is inside or outside the service or, alternatively, he should bring his proposals before this House to change the system so that we will know where we stand.  Leaving the dispensary system like Mohammed's coffin suspended between Heaven and earth is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>I have a few, perhaps, disjointed comments to make which I will make as briefly as possible.  One of them is in regard to the ambulance service. Everybody in this country, particularly those who have nothing at all to do with ambulances, has got a perfect system for operating an ambulance service.  It is not unusual to be told that the perfect service is to have a 24-hour ambulance on call with a full service of doctor, nurse <i>et cetera</i> for accident cases all over the country. Those of us who have some little knowledge of the problem know this is the nearest thing to being impossible. Having said that, I honestly believe <Col N="630" /> that a lot more could be done with our ambulance service.</P>
    <P>For quite some time we have had before the Minister and the Labour Court and the County Managers' Association a proposal to bring rates of pay and conditions of employment of ambulance drivers into reasonable line with what they should be.  We succeeded in getting, very grudgingly, certain adjustments.  Ambulance drivers live relatively close to the hospital where they work and are usually on call by phone.  The arrangement made was that so that there would not be excessive overtime pay, they would be paid a rate fairly comparable with the rate paid to lorry drivers in the area although lorry drivers usually work from 8 a.m. on Monday until 5 p.m. on Friday, whereas ambulance drivers work over the weekend if needed and, in addition, at night.  It is not unusual for an ambulance driver, after being on duty all day, to be called out at night for a serious case and naturally, because they are dedicated to their job, they go when called.  When the arrangement was being made about rates of wages there was a rate of £2 10s per week added for what was called &ldquo;stand to,&rdquo; that is, on call allowance, and for overtime, and written into it was that the overtime should be cut to a minimum.  What has happened? In most hospitals the situation is that ambulance drivers are now told that they are being paid for doing this type of work and are asked to work practically every night.  This is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the things that ambulance drivers rightly complain about is that in many hospitals doctors have got into the habit of discharging patients at 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 at night and the ambulance driver is called from his home to drive a patient home at that hour of night.  One of them told me recently that it is not unusual that he and the nurse may take a patient home, reaching the person's home at midnight, to find nobody there because the patient lives alone, and having to go in and light a fire and to get the home ready for the patient.  This should not happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I would suggest that the Department of Health should contact all hospitals and tell them that under no circumstances should a patient be discharged after 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  There is no reason why a patient who has been examined in the morning or early afternoon should be discharged long after dark.  This sort of thing has been done, not alone when beds are needed. We all appreciate that hospital beds are very scarce and that when accident cases come in at night there might not be sufficient beds to accommodate them.  It is no answer to get a patient who is reasonably well and is recuperating out of bed and to send him home in order to make room for cases coming in late at night.</P>
    <P>This is one of the complaints that we get.  This adds to the work of the already over-worked ambulance driver and of nurses and of all the hospital staff.  This problem could very easily be dealt with if the Department made a ruling that patients should not be discharged after a certain hour, apart from those who voluntarily leave.</P>
    <P>There is the remarkable thing that I have discovered happens in quite a number of hospitals that an ambulance, car or minibus which has been taking patients into the hospital clinic during the day may be returning to the very place to which a patient is later discharged. It is a waste of money that an empty minibus or a minibus with two or three out-patients or an ambulance with one or two patients should go to a place and hours later, after dark, an ambulance should be requisitioned to drive a patient to the same place.  That is a waste of time as well as being upsetting to everybody concerned. It is something that could very easily be dealt with if there were a proper approach to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on a matter which I have dealt with here on a number of occasions.  It is a waste of time and money if patients who have to go to hospital, particularly patients who are seriously ill, are brought by ambulance to the county hospital which may be 20 miles away when they could be taken to a local hospital which may be only three or four miles away but which happens to be under a different health authority. <Col N="632" /> We know that arrangements can be made to have payments made for patients who have to go into other than county hospitals, particularly if the local hospital has accommodation for them.  If somebody gets ill in Mornington which is four miles from Drogheda, an ambulance must be called and a driver may be asked to return to Mornington in order to take the patient to Drogheda.  The excuse is that the Drogheda ambulance is in a different district.  This type of red tape should be cut if anything is to be made of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>There is a number of old folks' homes in the country.  The people who look after them are doing a great job. Only those who take the trouble to visit these homes know the type of work, apart from ordinary cleaning, feeding and cooking, which has to be done by those working in these homes. It often annoys me when I hear people referring to nursing staff and non-nursing staff because as far as I can see, particularly in old folks' homes, most of the non-nursing staff have to be psychiatrists as well as everything else in order to keep some of the old people in good humour and to look after them.  Non-nursing personnel are regarded as being a lesser breed.  Therefore their rates of pay must not be too high and they are treated differently from everyone else.  I am not trying to take from the tremendous work done by doctors and nurses in hospitals and homes but the Minister would be doing a good job if he could find some other description for those who are broadly described as servants employed in these homes, as distinct from officers.  The servants are the people who clean the wards, who cook the food and who carry the food to the patients in many cases and who also try to humour patients and keep them in good form. I would ask the Minister to consider having some other description applied to these people and also to consider bringing their rates of wages into line. When people talk about low paid workers, these people always come to mind.</P>
    <P>It is grand to talk about low paid workers and the necessity to increase wages until application is made to have <Col N="633" /> that done when immediately there are all the reasons in the world why the line being maintained by the County Managers' Association cannot be broken and the argument is made that if wages are increased in one hospital others may be greedy enough to look for an increase, although they are as much entitled to it and should get it. The Minister would be doing a good job if he simply recommended that there should be a fair rate of wages paid to these people.  I do not consider that the present rate is fair.  There is no use in blaming the trade unions because I represent one of them and we have been doing everything possible to get the scales improved as much as possible but on every occasion we come up against the stone wall, that costs are too high and must not be increased. If money is required for anything else, it can be found.  When it comes to finding a few shillings to put into the pockets of workers, it cannot be found. The thinking is that if the increase sought is not granted, that is so much saved.  I think the Minister agrees with me that nursing and non-nursing personnel, as so called, should be paid for the job they are doing and the sooner this is recognised the better for everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>Last October, as, indeed, every October, the Minister got an estimate of the probable costs for the coming year based on the figures of expenditure up to this in the local authority. In answer to a supplementary question last week, he admitted to me&mdash;at least I think he did; I think he assented to the suggestion I made&mdash;that since that time costs have gone up by at least 25 per cent, possibly more.  I thought it was a little bit thick, in view of that, for the Department of Health to write to the local authorities and suggest that a cutback should be made on the services available.  I grant you it was stated that the cutback should not affect the services.  How you can spend less money and, at the same time, provide the same services is over my head; but this appeared to me to be the suggestion, and I think a mistake has been made.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to find services without money and it is not possible <Col N="634" /> for the Minister for Health, by waving a wand, to produce the money he requires. He must get that money from the Government through the Department of Finance.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, when he spoke last night about a cutback in social spending, was adding his little bit to the necessity for a cutback on health services, which can only be regarded in many cases as social spending.  If he was, it is very bad news for the country.  I suggested to the Minister last week that instead of asking these health authorities to cutback on their estimates of last October, he should have realised that costs have gone up and will continue to go up and that, therefore, the money must be found somewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no use at all in doing what he did some years ago.  He went around a number of health authorities and when he came to Navan he suggested that Meath, being a rich county, might be asked to subsidise some of the poorer counties.  I should like to tell the Minister, in case he does not know it already, that there are people as poor in Meath as there are in Mayo and that a poor man in Meath is just as poor as a poor man in Mayo; that the rich man in Mayo is as rich as the rich man in Meath.  Meath has the reputation, the much exaggerated reputation, of being a rather wealthy county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <P>Will you swap then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall consider that.  As a matter of fact, as somebody mentioned to me recently, there are so many people being sent from the west over to Meath that a swap would not make much difference.  However, I can assure the Minister that even the Mayo people who have come to Meath have expressed views on the payment of rates.  Even though Meath rates are the lowest in Ireland, the land of Meath is the highest rated in Ireland.  Somebody told me that was because in 1837 the Griffith valuation was carried out and lands which might now be under water but which were used at that time for growing wheat, were very highly rated.  That is why people pay high rates in Meath, although some people <Col N="635" /> seem to imagine they have the land for nothing there.  People who own houses or businesses of any kind in small towns and villages and even in districts away from the towns and villages are paying increased rates.</P>
      <P>Unlike other local authorities, we struck our rate and increased it by 5s. in the £, but that does not mean that we do not expect the Minister to be able to find money somewhere to relieve what will almost certainly be a supplementary amount which we will require next year.  The Minister says we should cut back on the estimate we made last October.  We have gone at least 25 per cent over our present estimate, and we shall be very much surprised if there is not a five per cent or a ten per cent increase on that by the end of the next financial year.  Therefore, if he has any money, we shall be very glad to get a supplement from him.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to do something which was suggested in the White Paper.  I understand it could be done under the new Health Act, and it is long overdue.  It is in relation to medical cards, free medical treatment, and so on.  Is there any reason why the Minister cannot now set out some type of scale for the issue of medical cards?  One of the problems we have in County Meath is that a man gets up at half past six in the morning and drives a car forty miles into Dublin, works on a building site, perhaps until nine o'clock at night, takes home a wage packet of £16 or £17, out of which he must pay for his car, a big or small rent for his house.  Even if he has five or six children, because of his high gross income he will be refused a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister could give a ruling in cases like that and allow travelling expenses to be deducted the very same as he allows rent to be deducted from gross wages when the issue of a medical card is being considered? This is the sort of thing which makes the system almost unworkable. It is no use saying to somebody that he should be able to pay a doctor.  As far as I know, most people who require a doctor will pay for the <Col N="636" /> treatment if they can afford it.  But it is very hard luck on people who cannot afford it to be told that, unless they have a medical card, they cannot have free treatment; or, worse still, they must pay £2 or £3 for a prescription if they are seriously ill.  The time to have this matter dealt with is long overdue and the Minister should do something about it.</P>
    <P>I said at the start of my speech I did not intend to delay the House long, that I had only a few points I wished to make.  I know my colleagues who have spoken from these benches before me have covered most of the ground. There is only one further point I wish to make.  The question of the supply of dentures and spectacles to local authority patients must be straightened out.  At the present time the local authority officers in the Meath county council are doing everything they can to ensure that people are examined and issued with the appliances they require within reasonable time.  Surely it should be possible to get the requisite number of dentists back into this country who would be able to make extractions and have dentures supplied instead of having a waiting list which, I understand, every local authority has at the present time.  If it is a question of money, if it is because dentists in England are getting more money than they are getting here, we must face the fact that dentists cannot be got unless they are paid.  Therefore the Minister should encourage them to come back here by seeing the salary scale is one which will attract them.</P>
    <P>Again and again we come across the problem of people who have their eyes examined and go to have spectacles issued.  Some of them ask to have a better type of frame and pay for it, or they bring the frame which they originally had and, therefore, should not have to pay anything.  Many of the suppliers seem to get mixed up over these things, and I continually get complaints not alone from County Meath but from all over the country to the effect that people were supplied with spectacles and were charged so much for them.  They inquire whether they should have paid for them, and why they did not get them within reasonable <Col N="637" /> time.  That is the problem the Minister should have straightened out.  If it is not straightened out by the Department of Health, there is no use in going around and asking the local authorities to do something about it, because all of them have their own problems to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he introduced this Supplementary Estimate and on the manner in which he explained its financial aspects and implications.  We all realise that this Supplementary Estimate was necessary owing, largely, to the increases paid in respect of infectious diseases maintenance allowances, costs of drugs and medicines, better working conditions and increases in salaries and wages of health staffs and that all of these increases took place following the preparation of the estimates last year by the health authorities.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of this Supplementary Estimate on which I should like to comment.  First of all, the Minister says he proposes to increase the capitation rates payable by health authorities as from 1st April next for services in the voluntary hospitals in order to bring the rates nearer to what it would cost health authorities to provide the services in their own hospitals instead of sending the patients to the voluntary hospitals. I can see the logic behind this from the point of view of making the voluntary hospitals pay their way to a certain extent.  At the same time, I know that the health authorities must still keep sending patients up to the voluntary hospitals no matter what the capitation rates payable to the voluntary hospitals, because there is not room for many of these patients who require surgical, medical and or specialist treatment in the county hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kerry, some time ago, there was a very large waiting list of patients for admission to external hospitals and, again, there was a very large waiting list for admission to the County Hospital in Tralee.  This matter was ironed out fairly satisfactorily between the Minister and his Department and the health authority.  I am glad that that waiting list was considerably <Col N="638" /> reduced as a result of discussions between the Department and the county council but I know that, because the accommodation is not available within the county, it is necessary, and it will be necessary for a good few years ahead, to send patients to voluntary hospitals in Dublin and to hospitals in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this which worries me is the fact that some doctors have a tendency to refer patients to these hospitals without advising them as to how they stand under the Health Acts; without advising them as to whether they will have to pay; without advising them as to whether they come within the ambit of the Health Acts at all. The attention of all doctors should be drawn to the fact that it is vital for patients to know, before going into hospital, how they stand in relation to payment of surgical fees and maintenance charges.  He or she, before going into hospital, should know whether or not the local authority will accept liability for maintenance and treatment in the hospital.  In certain cases and in certain circumstances it is not possible to let the patient have this information but, in over 90 per cent of cases, the patient should know beforehand whether or not the local authority will accept responsibility for his or her maintenance and treatment in the hospital.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the increased cost of drugs and the increased usage of drugs is a very severe burden on the health authority and on the State. The increased usage of drugs is a feature of modern medicine.  As the Minister says, we must balance our dislike of increased costs in this regard with a realisation of the beneficial aspects.  At the same time, I wonder whether, in certain fields, we are not inclined to overuse drugs.  I heard a very interesting discussion recently relating to the benefits in mental health from the usage of drugs and about how modern drugs have been instrumental in reducing the number of patients in institutions.  Nevertheless, the Minister and his Department should bear in mind that, with an ever-increasing use of drugs, we could well become a race of drug addicts on a small scale.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the <Col N="639" /> Minister and to pay tribute to the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, who was at one time Minister for Health, on the expansion of the scheme under which health authorities supply medicines to persons outside the lower income group.  This scheme is intended to benefit persons in the middle and higher income groups on whom the cost of medicines imposes an undue hardship. This is very desirable if handled discreetly by the health authorities and if it is not overdone by the public.  I know of many cases where people have availed of and benefited under this scheme.  On the surface, to judge by their income, such people should not qualify for medicines under this scheme but investigation often reveals that hardship exists.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of the scheme for free drugs for diabetics. This must be a tremendous help to people who suffer from that disease. The fact that the scheme is working satisfactorily can be realised from the figure of 5,000 persons who avail of it at present.  I have no doubt it is a tremendous advantage to them.</P>
    <P>We know the impact the increased infectious diseases maintenance allowances have on the rates and on the State grants towards the cost of health services but this is money well spent and the recipients deserve every shilling they get.  One aspect of this scheme is that, in a number of cases &mdash; owing probably to oversight on the part of the recipients in reporting changes in their circumstances to the investigation officers and to oversight by officials of health authorities &mdash; there is occasionally overpayment of allowances to these persons.  I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to have as much as possible of these overpayments struck off as irrecoverable by the health authorities. It is a great worry to such people, many of whom are still suffering from infectious diseases, if they continue to get bills and reminders from the health authority in regard to overpayments. In all fairness these amounts should be struck off.</P>
    <P>Recipients of disabled persons' maintenance allowances appreciate the <Col N="640" /> increase which they got recently.  The maximum rate is now £3 a week and this represents a substantial increase, especially when we remember that when the scheme was first introduced under the 1953 Act, the allowance was £1 a week.  It is a great consolation to recipients also to know now that the health authority may pay the allowance to them for a period of up to eight weeks when they are receiving hospital treatment.  It imposed hardship in many cases when those receiving hospital treatment were not paid this allowance while in hospital.  They fell into arrears with rent, rates and other commitments such as electricity charges.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Department to impress further on health authorities the advantages of improving the district nursing service which should be extended to the maximum, with the aim of having every townland in every health authority covered by a district nurse within as short a period as possible.  If this could be done I have no doubt that we would reduce the number of elderly persons in institutions and of those seeking admission.  It would be of tremendous benefit to society to have district nurses available to go into the homes, particularly to help mothers of large families to care for elderly persons, particularly elderly persons living alone.  If maximum use were made of the service we would not only reduce admissions of elderly persons to hospitals but also, I believe, the number receiving treatment in mental institutions.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputies saying in this debate that the cost of the health services had gone over the top as far as ratepayers are concerned.  I agree that the cost has a tremendous impact on the rates but, at the same time, we must agree that increased costs impose a heavy burden on taxation and on the tax payable by all who pay income tax, including the workers.  If we increase State grants for health services it is necessary to increase taxation and many workers under PAYE and other systems will have to bear increased charges.  I strongly recommend the Minister and the Department to explore every avenue with a view to relieving <Col N="641" /> the rates, whether by an insurance scheme or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having urged health authorities to set up information offices, identified as such by advertisements in the newspapers.  We find that many people do not realise the benefits to which they are entitled under the Health Acts until the occasion arises to seek these benefits. Health authorities should set up these information offices as quickly as possible and so help themselves also in that many persons seeking institutional treatment would know beforehand how they stood.  Applications would be made in good time and they would not come along afterwards to seek covering certificates and to ask the authorities to accept liability in retrospect.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on getting the health authorities to give more publicity to all the schemes and services available.  Quite often medical card holders complain about the quality of drugs available in dispensaries. Whether this is psychological or not is not for me to say, but the complaints are made and something should be done quickly regarding quality control of drugs.  I do not say that drugs and medicines in dispensary stocks are inferior in any way to the drugs and medicines in chemists' shops but the public complain from time to time and these complaints are worth investigating.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies commented on the report of the consultative council on general hospital services.  By and large, I agree with the report.  I have studied it carefully.  I can see far more advantages than disadvantages in it.  It should be our aim to ensure that all our people get the best possible treatment administered by the best qualified personnel in the quickest possible time.  The only way to ensure economic operation is by re-organising our hospital services in the manner outlined in the report.  In that way we will have regard to the burden imposed on the taxpayer.  It is clear from the report that in only a few areas will patients be more than 60 miles from a first-class general hospital with all the facilities and specialist services necessary.  That is very commendable. There will always be a place for <Col N="642" /> the local district hospital to deal with emergencies and the kinds of cases that are normally treated in such hospitals. I think we would be very foolish not to accept the report.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that the population in our mental hospitals fell by over 16 per cent in the period 1958 to 1967 and that further decreases are anticipated.  Apparently the greatest proportion of mentally ill now are elderly persons.  By using district nursing services to the maximum and with a proper liasion between county medical officers and resident medical superintendents and staffs of mental hospitals it should be possible to reduce rapidly the number of persons, particularly the number of elderly persons, in mental hospitals.  They could be rehabilitated in their own homes.  By discouraging people from seeking admission to mental hospitals for psychiatric treatment we would ensure their not becoming in-patients in these institutions for the rest of their life, as has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I am worried about one aspect of the present system of treatment for the mentally ill.  Some mental authorities employ social workers to give out drugs to patients at clinics.  This is a dangerous practice.  I doubt if there is any great control over the quantity of drugs being distributed.  I doubt if there is any great control over the drugs once they are handed out to the patient attending the clinic.  The system is wide open to abuse.  I can visualise a situation in which another person, without going near a doctor or a clinic, might obtain drugs from a neighbour who had got them from the social worker at a clinic.  That could happen.  The scheme is wide open to abuse.  I should like the Minister to investigate the position to see whether some control could be exercised over the distribution of drugs in these places.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the great strides made in the provision of accommodation for mentally retarded children.  Up to recently this section of our community was grossly neglected.  It is very sad to see children and young persons under 17 years of age in mental hospitals.  I think the Government could not move fast enough in providing additional <Col N="643" /> accommodation for the mentally retarded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dental services, more use should be made of the wholetime dentist employed by the local health authority.  He should get additional work on a fee basis.  Dentists in private practice should be encouraged to do clinics, also on a fee basis.  There have been many complaints from parents that dentists have not attended rural schools for a considerable period. They seem to concentrate on the towns. The scheme should be operated on a more uniform basis throughout the particular health authority district.</P>
    <P>As far as general hospital services and particularly out-patient clinics are concerned, I have met a number of cases in which patients were sent up from Kerry as out-patients to Dublin hospitals.  They were charged for X-rays and for tests and in many cases a two-day stay brought a bill of from 12 to 15 guineas.  If these people had been sent as in-patients it would not cost them anything.  I have known this to happen to medical card holders.  Something is wrong and I would like to have the matter examined. I have met half a dozen cases in the last year where these people were charged anything from 12 to 16 guineas, whereas if they had been sent as in-patients they would not be charged one penny.  This is worth examining.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should, by some publicity campaign or other, encourage people to join the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme. Of late great interest seems to be aroused in this scheme and with a little publicity many more people in the middle and upper income groups would join it.  It should have a great appeal to the farming community and to business people in particular.  I would strongly recommend that some publicity campaign should be got under way immediately pointing out the advantages of the scheme to the public.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully, in opening his speech on this Estimate, apologised for the fact that his comments were going to be disjointed.  At this stage it is not easy to find points that have not been covered many times over <Col N="644" /> and I do not envy the Minister his task in having to listen to repetition. I have seen recently the letters in the papers describing the Minister as a heartless man having no regard for unfortunate people suffering from disabilities of one kind or another.  People who write such letters do not know the Minister and are completely unaware of his concern for these people.  I have personal experience of the co-operation of the Minister in these matters and I know what he is doing in an effort to find solutions to these problems.</P>
      <P>The description which I have just quoted would not fit anybody in this House.  There is not a public representative in the country who is not concerned to have the health services improved but the cost of this must be borne in mind.  I was amazed to hear somebody saying here this evening that we cannot have regard to the cost of the services, that the question of costs must be ignored.  We cannot overlook these things.  The costs of the health services have rocketed and many of the people who have to bear these costs are finding the burden unbearable. In this I am referring to the cost of the health services to the rates. These costs appear to be about one-third of the rates in every county and this is such a burden that I was disappointed to see that all the Minister could promise was that his contribution would be not less in the coming year than heretofore.  He made the point that the percentage over 50 per cent was from 4 to 8 per cent, making an average of 56 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not strictly true.  I am sure the Minister did not mean it to be taken that way.  There are many items left out, concealed expenditure, probably described by the Department as unauthorised expenditure.  In the Dublin Health Authority alone there is £200,000 of this type of health expenditure for which there is no contribution from the Department.  There is £70,000 for blind pensions for which there is no contribution and there are many other things which come under the heading of concealed expenditure. Deputies have spoken of the importance of keeping people out of hospitals and of providing domiciliary <Col N="645" /> services.  There is considerable expenditure involved in developing that kind of service.  All these are excluded from the Minister's calculation and do not come into the 56 per cent average. I think it is a great mistake that money spent in this way does not rank in the Departmental contribution.</P>
    <P>Overdraft expenses do not come into the Department's contribution and in a large health authority the overdraft expenses are considerable indeed.  We all know that the Department itself has not a good reputation for early payment of its debts and in this way the Department is responsible for a considerable amount of the overdraft expenses of health authorities.  The cost of building new dispensaries is excluded and so is the cost of new equipment in the expansion of services already there.  A very erroneous image of the Department's contribution is created when one describes it as 56 per cent of the cost.  I am sure the Minister did not mean it in that way or did not mean to mislead but that is the actual fact.  I am also sure that there are many other items that should be included and which do not rank for contributions from the Department.</P>
    <P>I have heard statements made by different people in this House which I do not believe.  I have been closely associated with health authorities in Dublin for a number of years.  I am a member of a number of hospital boards and I visit a large number of hospitals and I have never seen in them the conditions described here today. I have heard the conditions being described as appalling and one would get the impression that some of the hospitals in the Dublin region are nothing better than concentration camps.  This would be a completely wrong picture for people to get of our hospitals in the Dublin region.  I know that some of these hospitals have inadequate accommodation, that conditions are perhaps less than ideal and that equipment for various purposes may not be the best, but they are doing an excellent job in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The position cannot be transformed overnight and the main problem all goes back to the question of money.  The whole problem of the health services will not be solved and <Col N="646" /> we will not have a rapid improvement in them until another way is found of obtaining the necessary money to finance these services.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider this situation seriously.  I heard his predecessor saying in this House that he was prepared to consider any alternative way of finding the money for the health services and he said he would even consider the Fine Gael proposal and that, if he found it workable and feasible to adopt, he would not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that.  Perhaps my predecessor also said it but I said it.  I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this would be the attitude of the Minister because concern for the health services for the people does not belong to any side of this House.  We are all trying to find ways and means of improving the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This should be the attitude and there should be no small thinking about it.  It does not matter from whom the thought comes.  As I say, I heard these conditions being described as appalling but I know that they do not exist.  On the whole an excellent service is provided for patients in all the Dublin institutions of which I am aware and I visit many of them. For years consideration has been given to the building of new hospitals and the improvement of existing hospitals and it is also true to say that considerable sums of money have been wasted on consultants' fees and the drawing up of plans which are never used.  This happened in certain cases in the Dublin region, of which the Minister is aware, quite a few years ago and there has been no improvement in that regard since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set up a committee to investigate the whole question of the future of hospital services and various Deputies have referred to this book on the hospital services which is known as the FitzGerald Report.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Leary saying that, on the whole, he considered this report a sensible report.  I know that Deputies have complained that it would not suit <Col N="647" /> their areas.  I cannot speak for any area other than the one I know pretty well and I would say that, generally, for the Dublin region it is a fairly sensible approach to the problem that exists here.  There is a need in this part of the country, which is the largest health authority area in the country, for at least one large fully equipped medical centre, a medical centre in which the skilled resources and the expensive resources of professional people and expensive equipment could be justified.  This is something we lack in this country and something we will have to get pretty soon.  I know there are arguments about where this centre should be provided, whether it should be provided on one site or another. This is something that needs careful examination but I often feel that there is quite an element of jealousy associated with this.  Certain people want it in a certain position just for selfish reasons.  The view that is being taken is neither broad enough nor generous enough.  There are a lot of institutions which have been in existence for a long number of years, call them hospital boards or whatever you like, but all want to be separate little republics on their own.  This status has been guarded and is going to be guarded in the future.  This is all wrong.</P>
    <P>The one thing that must be considered all the time is what is going to result in the best service being given to patients.  This is not a question of who provides it or where it is provided as long as it is in the most accessible position and the position regarded as being most convenient for all concerned. For far too long we have had the situation in which everybody looked at a section of the problem and at their own institution and could not care less about other institutions in the area.  If it is the intention of the Minister and the Department to proceed along the lines of this report, and if they can find the ways and means for starting to build the necessary institutions, people should give up dragging their feet and should co-operate in every way possible to make this a reality.</P>
    <P>If we build houses we spread the cost of those houses over perhaps 35 or 40 years, but for some reason we <Col N="648" /> feel that if we want to build a hospital we must pay for it when we build it. If we are going to approach the problem in this way we will have to wait for far too long for the necessary hospitals.  I do not see why, when the fabric of a hospital is going to last 100 years or perhaps 200 years, it should have to be paid for by one generation. This is all wrong and the cost will have to be spread out if we are going to get down to the job which needs to be done within a reasonable time. Another point which strikes me is that we have the Hospitals Trust Fund and, while the purpose of that Fund is to provide money for hospital services, yet about £1 million is taken from the Sweep proceeds through stamp duty. Why should this amount be taken out and not used for the purpose for which it was intended?  It is taken away from the health services and put into the Exchequer.  This is all wrong and money collected for this purpose should be used for this purpose.  Certainly there is a great need for a number of new hospitals and for improving other hospitals.</P>
    <P>Again there is considerable comment about the way in which a general hospital should be set up.  Some people advocate a psychiatric unit attached to a general hospital and I think there should be a geriatric unit attached to a general hospital.  Some people have the idea that the only way to provide geriatrics is to have a geriatric unit doing nothing but geriatrics.  For various reasons this is a wrong approach.  Here you have nothing but heavy uninteresting nursing and it is almost an impossibility to keep staff in such an institution, whereas, if you have a general hospital, nursing staff and medical staff get a good deal of consolation from seeing people recover from an illness.  There is no such consolation to be got from old people. As well at that, it is all heavy nursing.</P>
    <P>In relation to the psychiatric unit I think this is the right approach because there is still a stigma attached to sending people to a mental hospital.  If there is a small psychiatric unit attached to a general hospital it ensures that there will be active treatment of these patients.  For far too long we had institutions with 16,000 and <Col N="649" /> 18,000 patients and quite a small medical staff.  It was not possible to single out or sort out these patients and give them any sort of treatment. They were just thrown in and practically forgotten about.  I saw those conditions some years ago in the Dublin area but thanks be to God that day is gone.</P>
    <P>There is no use in coming in here and saying that there has been no improvement in the health services.  There have been considerable improvements but we all want to see these services improving more rapidly and we would all like to see a way to find the necessary money to give the ideal health service which everybody wants to see. The whole basis at present is wrong and the most important job any Minister could do at present is to find a different and more equitable way to get this money.  Why should a person, simply because he owns a house, contribute more to the cost of the health service, that in some cases he may never use, than the wage or salary earner who does not happen to be a householder?  There is something all wrong about that.  Sometimes you may find very poor people with such houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry drew attention today to something which is not unimportant. He certainly enlightened me when he said that in calculating whether or not a farmer is eligible for treatment under the health service the valuation of his dwellinghouse is taken into the picture.  I must say I was labouring under the impression that it was not taken into the picture and when I had cases where the valuation exceeded by a small margin the £60 limit I assumed that I was being given the land valuation and, perhaps, the valuation of outoffices.  It is hard to see where a man's house comes into this.  The house of the man whose income is calculated simply on the salary he receives is not taken into consideration.  I am sure, if Deputy Corry is right in this, that there is no reason why the Minister should not make an order or give a direction to the various health authorities to ignore the valuation of the residence in calculating whether or not a farmer is <Col N="650" /> eligible for this service.  It would be quite wrong and inequitable if this distinction were to be made between the salary earner and the landowner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said his remarks were disjointed.  Mine will be more disjointed because I am going to speak as things come to me.  With regard to the mentally handicapped the Minister has outlined the progress that has been made.  One criticism I want to make is that efforts are being made by certain health authorities and by certain local authorities in the country and other local authorities are simply sitting on their heels and doing nothing. This is deplorable and I feel they are neglecting their duties in these areas. In most areas there must be accommodation becoming available &mdash; small sanatoria or other similar institutions &mdash; where a small unit could be set up to care for local children suffering from this type of disability.  Because of the fact that most health authorities in the country have done little or nothing about this; everybody is aware of the fact that there is hardly any Deputy who has not one, two or three families after him to try to find accommodation in the Dublin region for mentally retarded children.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask the local authorities and the health authorities throughout the country to make a small contribution to this because it probably could be done cheaply.  The old yarn that very specially trained people were required to take charge of mentally retarded children is all nonsense.  All of us, as public representatives, have seen a harassed mother with a mentally retarded child or, perhaps, two mentally retarded children and five or six other children as well.  It is easy to see that anybody with nursing experience, and it does not have to be specialised nursing experience, could look after those children better than she could.  There is no point in making it a specialised job and putting these things up as excuses for doing nothing.  It is the easiest thing in the world to find excuses for doing nothing.  Certainly, considerable progress has been made but there is an immense amount to be done and if the various local authorities and <Col N="651" /> health authorities throughout the country made a small contribution the problem could be very much relieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister made mention in his speech of industrial therapy units and of the fact that the Department now had plans for these units and for some hospital units as well that would be acceptable.  I think this is a very good idea.  We had this sort of thing in Local Government for a long time where we could get housing plans that we knew would be automatically acceptable to the Department.  This would save a lot of delay.  I do not think it should be imperative on all occasions to accept these plans but certainly they could be used in many cases and they could be used as guidelines for the type of building the Department would be prepared to accept.  This would overcome many of the delays that we have between consultants and the Department. It is unbelievable, unless you know something about it, how long it takes from the time the Minister agrees in principle to the putting up of a building for this or any other hospital purpose until it is finally built.  Delays occur between consultants having discussions with the Department and getting it all agreed.  It is worse in my view than it used to be with the housing section of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the mentally handicapped there is one thing I can never understand.  If a family with an income in excess of £1,200 or a farmer with a valuation of over £60 happen to have a mentally retarded child they have to pay for that child until it is 16 years of age.  It is free from that on. I could never understand why this has not changed.  There is no payment in the case of infectious diseases.  In fact, allowances are paid to people with infectious diseases but the full cost of the mentally retarded child has to be borne by its family.  This is all wrong. The Minister should take a serious look at this because it can be a practically unbearable burden on a family where there may be five, six or seven other children.</P>
    <P>The question of the training of nurses was also discussed.  It is hard to believe that such a scarcity of nurses as now <Col N="652" /> exists could arise so quickly.  It would seem to indicate that there is considerable emigration of nurses from this country.  The shortage of nurses has become acute in the last year or two. While the number of places for training nurses has increased it certainly has not increased sufficiently.  I do not know what can be done about this.  Action has been taken to enable hospitals that individually do not qualify as training centres to form a group and thus become jointly a training school.  I hope that when this plan is carried to full effect a considerable extra number of places for the training of nurses will be provided.  There is no shortage of girls who are anxious to train as nurses but there is a scarcity of nurses.  This is a matter that requires considerable attention and consideration by the Department with a view to an improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>We were dealing earlier on with the question of health card patients and the way they are regarded.  I was appalled to hear a Deputy saying this evening that because a patient is a health card patient he is met with a grunt and a growl.  I do not believe this.  You may get an individual doctor whose attitude to people is wrong.  You will get such people in every profession. But, by and large, the poor people get at least as good treatment and are as well received as those who are paying heavily for treatment.</P>
    <P>I happen to be attached to an institution where nobody pays anything and I want to say publicly that the patient comes before everybody and everything regardless of income or how he happens to come to the hospital.  It would be a shocking suggestion to come from this House that we believe that the poor people are badly treated by the doctors and nursing staff because they are poor. That is a most exceptional thing.  I agree that there are exceptions but I should like to feel that they are very rare.</P>
    <P>The development of out-patient services with a view to keeping people out of hospital is very desirable.  For a variety of reasons far too many people are finding themselves in institutions, either because there is nobody at home to look after them or because <Col N="653" /> their housing is inadequate.  I cannot list the number of reasons why people have to go into institutions who should not go in.  The more concentration there is on out-patient department services and domiciliary nursing services and home help services and even on the payment of rent in certain cases to enable people to stay in their homes, the better.  All these contributions should be recognised by the Department for the 50 per cent grant, approximately, and should be encouraged and not discouraged as they are at the moment.  I mean that the Department say that they are anxious to see us developing these services but will give nothing towards the cost of developing them and in that way is discouraging the development.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat too many things that have been discussed over and over again.  I did intend to say a word about industrial therapy that the Minister referred to.  One thing that I should like to do is to thank publicly the firms who co-operate in providing suitable types of work for mentally retarded patients.  There are many firms who are very anxious to make the maximum contribution to this type of occupational therapy.  I find a number of firms most co-operative in this regard.  It is very essential that any organisation setting up this type of workshop should have the co-operation of people in a position to provide suitable work.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, members of the Opposition feel that they have to be critical and there is a good deal to criticise but I do not think there is any point in adopting the attitude that there have been no improvements in the health services.  There have been improvements. There is no point in saying that we do not have to consider the cost.  We do have to consider the cost. There are many problems and the Minister has immense headaches but the problem to which he should and must give most consideration very soon is of finding ways and means of getting the necessary money for the health services other than through the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we got from the Minister an Estimate which represents very hard work and is a record <Col N="654" /> of progress in the perfection of our health services.  One hears in this House every year emotional speeches mostly criticising the Estimate because, no matter what Estimate is introduced, there is always plenty of scope for criticism and suggestions for improvement. I should like to make one suggestion as regards hospitalisation of people and to recall the 1950s when European health authorities told the Department here that the days of sanatoria were practically over, that drugs would be the cure for TB.  I recall at least five sanatoria in the city here being closed as a result of the introduction of drugs for the treatment of TB.  Admittedly these institutions &mdash; Rialto Hospital, Ballyowen, Crooksling, the Pigeon House and the TB section of St. Kevin's &mdash; are being used for other purposes today, but the lesson should be learned.  Science advances at a tremendous rate and the production of new drugs and medicines points to the possibility of treating more and more people at home for diseases which even ten years ago would have meant a long spell of hospital treatment.  The Minister gave figures showing what has been done in the last two or three years and what will be done in the matter of new hospital building and the extension of existing hospitals.  It is a very proud record and I compliment the Minister on getting the necessary finances for this great programme.  A rough tot that I have made indicates that about £14 million will be spent on building new hospitals and repairing and extending existing hospitals.  I want to suggest that we should examine our whole approach to hospitalisation. In the maternity service, mobile squads can carry out most important functions in the patient's home.  In this city many thousands of babies are delivered in the home each year without the mother having to be brought to the maternity hospital, where the treatment is much more costly, and where she will probably undergo some mental anguish at being separated from her family.  We could expand this mobile squad principle to fairly minor ailments for which people at present are taken to hospital. In the last 20 years the housing situation in this city has improved tremendously <Col N="655" /> so that a mobile squad could go to practically any of the homes of our people and be sure of clean surroundings, ample supplies of hot water, plenty of proper bedding and so on, to carry out these minor operations. Speaking from memory, I think the cost of maintaining a patient in hospital is £20 a week.  I am sure we could halve the cost at least if patients were treated at home.  While we can compliment the Minister on the magnificent record in the building of new hospitals and extensions and repairs to existing ones, we should take a good look at this question and see if we cannot provide this service in people's homes.</P>
      <P>Some of the hospitals in this city were built in the late 18th century.  I serve on the board of one of them.  It may be a gem of architecture from the outside but going through the hospital one sees it is full of dry rot and woodworm.  Every year we must go to the Minister for more money to preserve this building, to repair the roof and so on.  This is throwing good money after bad.  The Minister will recall that recently part of the building was declared to be dangerous, and I am thankful to him for the prompt action he took to avert a possible tragedy.</P>
      <P>Why can we not clear these old buildings out of the way and put up temporary buildings?  We are putting up modern temporary school buildings and adding on extra classrooms.  These old buildings cannot be converted into modern hospitals for use in the 20th century.  There is not much space for building in the city here, but the hospital with which I am connected has an acre of ground at the back.  I heard a doctor make an excellent suggestion, that if we were to build a 14-storey hospital, each floor being an acre, there would be a 14-acre hospital available.  Such a building would cost a lot less over a period of ten years than trying to keep this old building we have standing up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, which has had rather a chequered career.  When the Minister was a boy this building was started.  The war intervened and it was allowed to lie <Col N="656" /> there for a few years.  It is a most majestic building.  Could the Minister tell us when he will be able to use part of the hospital?  When it opens will it mean we shall have two general hospitals, St. Vincent's on Merrion Road and St. Kevin's in James's Street? What will happen to Sir Patrick Dun's, Baggot Street, Mercer's and the other older hospitals?  These older hospitals have played a great part in the history of our city.  They have given Dublin a great tradition in the world of medicine. While I regret the passing of these buildings we should try to preserve the tradition of the hospitals through which the name of Dublin has been made known in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>When we see the terrible road toll in the city here, may I again resurrect a suggestion made before, that is, that Dublin should have an accident hospital? Where there is a car crash or some other accident the patient is brought to a certain hospital and then very often has to be removed to places like St. Laurence's Hospital for brain surgery.  Could we not have in the city, as there are in other cities, an accident hospital where victims of road accidents or even industrial accidents in factories could be brought right away, where, in a modern building, there would be the most up-to-date apparatus and appliances to carry out the most intricate surgical operation on the brain or on the mutilated body of some person.</P>
    <P>The system which operates at the moment is that the fire brigade or some other ambulance service is informed where to take the patient after the accident occurs.  It depends on where there is a vacant bed.  By having a special accident hospital we could possibly prevent a patient dying because he was not brought to the right hospital in the first place.  I know there will be difficulties as to the best place to site such a hospital.  It it were placed in the very centre of the city, it would be difficult for an ambulance to reach it in heavy traffic, say, at 6 o'clock in the evening.  However, I am sure the planners and the hospital authorities could overcome that difficulty.  I would commend that suggestion to the Minister's attention.  I cannot claim it is <Col N="657" /> my idea; it has been put to me by an eminent surgeon in this city.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by men and women who devote their time, their services and sometimes their own resources in helping to run the voluntary hospitals.  The cost of running a hospital is great, but how much greater would it be if these good people did not raise thousands of pounds each year to carry out improvements to hospitals?  In the hospital of whose board I am a member they have fitted out the children's ward and done a thousand and one things in the hospital without asking the State for a penny towards them.  It is nothing to them to raise £3,000 on one function, and all that money is raised to bring some kind of comfort to the patients.  If anybody ever suggested the abolition of the voluntary hospitals we would oppose that with all the strength we have, because it is very inspiring, in a world which is becoming more materialistic every day, to have these fine people not alone in this city but throughout the country who are prepared to give their time and services to this noble work.  The House should record its appreciation and urge others to participate in this work also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke of handicapped children and, while I feel that we have a good health service, I also feel that this is one instance in which we are not doing all we should to ease the burden on the parents and on the children whom God has marked. People will come to public representatives looking for a disability allowance for such children and they are turned down because the income of the family is too great.  We pay children's allowances to any parents for any children and many of these families do not need the allowance.  Quite a lot of them do not even use the allowance; they do not return the cheques.  In the case of the handicapped child the State must recognise the burden that has been placed on the parents and on the children and must say to them that in order to ease their lot the State will assure the parents that as long as the child lives it will be looked after by the State through the parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> It must be a great mental worry to parents to think of what will happen to the child when they pass on.  The State must recognise its duty in this regard and must be determined to ensure that the handicapped child will not suffer any more than it is suffering from its handicap.  The State must look after the handicapped children and every new science must be used to the utmost to help the children.  Where it is not possible to help them the State must also ensure that they will not want for anything during their lifetime.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is not a wealthy country.  We know that we cannot spend all that we would like to on our health services but this makes it all the more important that every penny we do spend should be used to the best possible advantage.  There are very few better ways of spending money than on mentally handicapped or physically handicapped children.  I should like to see the day when every retarded child could be sent to a special school to be trained so that, as far as possible, it would become a useful member of society.  We know that there is a waiting list in most of these schools.  It is understandable that this is so but it should not lull us into any false sense of acceptance.  We should press on until we can say to each parent that there is a place for his child in a school where he will be kept, returned to the parent during the holidays, and from which he will emerge an improved person.  Many parents do not like letting their children go to an institution for the handicapped but if they knew that the brains and limbs of the child would be treated to the utmost extent it would relieve the parents of a great burden. We must do our utmost for the least of them and, perhaps, the way we treat our handicapped people is the real hallmark of our civilisation.</P>
    <P>I am mindful of what the Minister has done for our people in this city and in the country generally and also of the tremendous interest people are now taking in the care of the aged.  In my part of the city we have what is probably the best equipped and most extensive senior citizens' club.  We have changed completely the outlook towards <Col N="659" /> old age.  The voluntary workers are bringing the old people together; they are operating the meals-on-wheels scheme and a thousand and one other services.  This is proof of the care with which the better off physically are looking after our old people.</P>
    <P>In some countries the old people have a great deal to worry about and they would also have to worry here if we accepted the pagan outlook and asked what good are the old.  Not so far away and not so long ago the old people had to wear a badge on their forehead.  I do not want to adopt a holier than thou attitude to other people but I am glad to applaud what is being done here.  The Minister makes things easier for the old by giving grants to those caring for them.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that we must keep the cost of the health services as low as possible consistent with giving efficient and proper service. Until such time as we become a wealthy country we must have regard to the cost.  However, I should like to see more of the health expenditure coming from the Exchequer.  In London they have no health charge on the rates and at the same time they are seeking to double every industrial and commercial valuation.  As far as I know in the system in London there is no health impost on the rates.  I make this point for those people who say that if the health charges were out of the rates we would have very low rates.  It would lower the rates considerably but would not ease the burden so much that people would not mind paying rates.  At the same time, members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and myself went to the Minister last week to ask him on behalf of the people of the city if he could see his way to giving a larger subvention towards the astronomical cost of our health services.  I am still optimistic that something may come of this. I realise the great task the Minister has.  He has done a very good job in giving us the health services we have. Our health services are quite good. This may not be the popular thing to say, but a huge number of people do not know what they are entitled to by way of health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> The much-abused public representatives are very often the people who must find out for those requiring services what they are and are not entitled to.  We do not say, as we are accused of saying, that we get them health services.  We do not do such a thing.  The politicians&mdash;and I speak for all politicians irrespective of Party &mdash;are no more hard-hearted than any other member of the community and if a constituent comes for help or advice he will get that advice and help.  He will be told that he will qualify for this but not for that, as the case may be.  I do not believe that we shall ever have a free-for-all health service or a free-for-all education service, knowing that nothing is quite free and that we must pay for it in some way.</P>
    <P>There are certain classes of our people who through no fault of their own cannot provide health services for themselves and must be helped by the State.  Some day I hope somebody will come forward with a better system than the present medical card system.  Somebody said tonight that when it was known that a person had a medical card he was less well treated in a hospital than a paying patient.  I do not think this is true.  Perhaps the opposite is true in some cases, that a person with a medical card has the full backing of the local authority and the State and no matter what the treatment costs the hospital is bound to be paid for it, whereas people without medical cards may find it difficult to get the money to pay for the treatment.</P>
    <P>Many years ago this Government introduced domiciliary care or paid aid for people suffering from tuberculosis. We then felt, as we do now, that this was a great step forward.  If you think of a man leaving his family to enter a sanatorium you realise it would be hard for him to get better if he had to think of his wife and children at home worrying about where to get money to pay rent or grocers' bills or anything else.  The Government brought in this payment to meet such cases and this greatly helped to overcome the scourge. With the use of preventive drugs schemes such as this finished and listening to figures for tuberculosis tonight we realise how they have dropped <Col N="661" /> over the years.  Thank God for that.  It gives us great heart to tackle other diseases afflicting our people.</P>
    <P>I come back to the cost of these services. I hate to use the word &ldquo;drugs&rdquo; which is becoming a dirtier word every day of the week.  Perhaps it will go out of fashion and somebody will invent a new name.  People once called tuberculosis &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; and, earlier, &ldquo;decline&rdquo;.  The nature of the drug problem will not change as easily as we may change the name of it.  If it is any consolation, the whole world seems to be suffering in the same way, other countries perhaps to a greater extent than ourselves.  If we live in an insane society, where it is in fashion to be caught taking drugs, we can only wonder if educational systems outside our country give real education or if people's sense of values has become so depraved that drug-taking is a status symbol.  If that happens here we shall perhaps have to look not at our health services but at our education services.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has acted quickly and ably in the matter of drug abuse, but what makes one wonder is that practically every week some thieves or vandals break into dispensaries in this city to steal drugs.  The Minister might consider storing these drugs at a heavily guarded central depot.  This type of thing may increase until we can show our teenagers, who seem to be the worst offenders, and other people, that this is all wrong and that the better way is not to take these drugs.  We must also check on people coming back from England with these habits.  We may be in for a trying time but we should make it very difficult to steal drugs.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when TB was a real problem here, the British health authorities often referred to our debt to England in that many of our people went to work in Britain having tuberculosis. Some of us felt that perhaps they contracted it over there, particularly in the industrial cities, but the point was to cure them.  Today, we have a sort of return traffic, particularly of people suffering from drug addiction.  We do not blame the English authorities but we say that such persons, whether Irish or English, <Col N="662" /> are here and are suffering from this addiction.  We do not want to pillory them or the country from which they came.  We simply want to cure them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we are taking all the necessary steps to give the best possible treatment for drug addiction. Today it is in its early stages and, unless we win the battle today, we lose it.  I have the greatest confidence that the Minister will tackle this problem. It is one that perhaps should not be given such great publicity.  Last week a doctor complained that the more publicity it was given, perhaps by big headlines, the less it helped.  I am sure the people who published these reports were trying to help and doing their very best but perhaps we should take the advice of the experts and realise that the best way to help is by keeping silent or by availing of the publicity to tell the people what they should do.  The point is that we must do the right thing because, if we do not, we may pay a heavier price ultimately. The hospitals have, as I said, a great record.  Dublin has three renowned medical schools.  I welcome the decision of the College of Surgeons to build a new centre in York Street. This is a very old college.  I am glad to say Dublin Corporation have cooperated with the college authorities by giving them the space for the new centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise is one which will have a very forcible impact, I believe, in the not too distant future.  Any Deputy representing a Border constituency is more familiar with the problem created than are Deputies representing constituencies removed from the Border.  The fact is that people who emigrate and who are absent for more than five years must on their return here undergo a <Col N="663" /> driving test despite their having done a driving test here originally or in the country to which they emigrated.  The situation is ludicrous, the more so when one relates this requirement to someone who works in Lifford by day and sleeps in Strabane by night.  There is a young married man who cannot get a house in Lifford and because he sleeps in Strabane in County Tyrone he cannot hold a driving licence in Donegal. If this position continues and he spends five years passing from Donegal into Tyrone, he will at the end of that period have to undergo a driving test to requalify if he comes back to live in Donegal.  On 11th March last, in reply to a question by Deputy Clinton, the Minister refused to take any action whatsoever to resolve the difficulties that exist and, in reply to a supplementary question by me, he said at column 11 of Volume 239 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I am prepared to conclude reciprocal arrangements with any countries that are prepared to make them with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on he said he saw no good reason for entering into negotiations because they would be futile.  I told the Minister Irish driving licences were recognised in other countries while we did not recognise these countries' licences. Had I been permitted to develop the point, I could have told the Minister that both Luxembourg and the Netherlands will issue valid driving licences to Irish nationals within 12 months of those nationals going to reside in these countries.  In Belgium one is required to do a test in the theory of road traffic regulations, but the Irish licence is recognised and a licence in the country of residence is issued without any practical test.  But the Minister will not recognise that an Irish national who lives for more than five years in the Six Counties is entitled to a driving licence without a driving test if and when he returns. It is a ludicrous situation.  It is typical of the Minister's attitude.  He will not admit an injustice which could be remedied by reaching for the telephone and informing his counterpart in Belfast or London that he is prepared to <Col N="664" /> recognise a British or Northern Ireland driving licence irrespective of whether or not the counterpart recognises our driving licence.</P>
    <P>The World Touring Automobile Organisation went to a great deal of trouble to encourage member countries to recognise driving licences.  Licences are controlled by the 1926 Convention. Most European countries, except Germany, subscribed to that Convention. West Germany subscribed to the Convention when it was brought up to date in 1949.  A foreigner in West Germany can obtain a driving licence by undergoing a test in the theory within one year of taking up residence there.  West Germany will recognise the validity of an Irish driving licence and the only test is one of theory.  I cannot understand why the Minister should persist in refusing to recognise a Northern Ireland or British driving licence.  If we can recognise road tax and the highway codes of Britain and Northern Ireland, if we can co-operate in the supply of electricity, if local authorities can co-operate with each other in the supplying of water, if fishery rights can be held under joint control, I see no good reason why the Minister should refuse to do anything in this matter of driving licences.  It is a stupid situation.  Sooner or later someone will have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now from the European Commission which issued its report in Brussels in May, 1968. In Italy, Belgium, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Netherlands the foreign driver who goes to live there has to have a driving licence from his country of residence and he can obtain a licence in any of these countries without a further test on presentation of the licence issued by his country of origin.  There may be some additional formalities such as medical examination, the payment of tax, and so on, before the new licence is issued.  There is no red tape whatsoever in these regulations.</P>
    <P>In spite of this, the Minister says, in effect &ldquo;I have no information that there are any such agreements&rdquo;.  A Minister of State is saddled with the responsibility of trying to give the people the service they want.  That is the essence of good government.  That <Col N="665" /> is why governments are elected&mdash;to serve the people and to change laws that are outdated.  Here is a commission asking for the co-operation of all member States of EEC.  We want to be in EEC.  The commission recommends to all the member nations of the 1949 Convention that they should co-operate and bring into line highway codes.  Now that highway codes have been brought much closer to recognition by everyone concerned, there is no reason why the driving licence should not be recognised.</P>
    <P>The kernel of my argument does not stop at that.  In 1949 the Geneva Convention relating to highway codes advanced to the stage that they would recognise the driving licence of a traveller crossing the border of another country.  I remember that, as a youth, I used an Irish licence and a British licence if I wished to drive into the Six Counties.  From memory, I think it was about 1949.  I now know that this Convention changed all that &mdash; that the Northern authorities would recognise an Irish driving licence and that we, in the South, would recognise the driving licence of the North if you came in as a <i>bona fide</i> traveller.</P>
    <P>The question I want to ask is this. The 1949 Convention advanced to the stage that they would recognise the driving licence of any visitor who stayed less than or up to 12 months as a visitor in a foreign country, but there is nothing in the Convention to say that the Irish Government or any other member State cannot go further. There is nothing in the Convention to say that you had to have residence or that you were deprived if you came in to take a job.  In actual fact, some civil servant interpreted the rules to mean that the Convention dealt only with travellers crossing the border of another country.  However, if read otherwise, the Convention can mean that the Minister for Local Government, if he so desires, can make an Order saying, in effect: &ldquo;I am prepared to recognise a British driver's licence provided there is parity in the driving tests and provided the driving licence is valid.&rdquo;  He does not have to enter into reciprocal agreements.  He can make an Order himself saying, in effect: &ldquo;I am prepared to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> There are many points which I should like to make but I feel that the strongest one I can make is that we here in the Republic of Ireland should try to indicate, particularly to the people living in the North of Ireland, that we are prepared to recognise certain standards that they have set.  Nobody can dispute the fact that the highway code in the North of Ireland is much more rigid than it is in the South.  No one can dispute the fact that the standard of driving in the North of Ireland is equally as good as, if not a small bit better than, the standard here in the South.  Nobody can dispute, indeed, that their road manners are equally as good as, if, again, not better than, those of ours in the South.  There is no reason why the Minister for Local Government cannot now say, in effect: &ldquo;I appreciate this and I accept that the highway code in the North of Ireland is not substandard to the highway code in the Twenty-six Counties of the Republic.&rdquo; Therefore, if we agree on the road tax, if we agree on all the other codes, why can we not agree on the recognition of a driving licence? It seems a very simple thing.</P>
    <P>For example, this position could arise.  It is a hypothetical one.  You know, a Cheann Comhairle, that the county of Donegal is controlled &mdash; it does not matter what the denomination &mdash; by a Bishop.  The Catholic Bishop, residing in Derry, controls the north of Donegal.  The Church of Ireland Bishop controls the entire county of Donegal because it is a joint diocese of Derry and Raphoe.  If a young Donegal boy does a test and becomes a licensed driver and then is ordained to the Church &mdash; it does not matter what denomination &mdash; and goes to live in Derry he has then to do a test in Derry and, if he stays there for five years and is transferred within the same diocese across the Border, he has to do a driving test again.  If he is promoted to parish priest or rector and goes back to the North he has to do the test in the North again after five years.  The whole thing is so ridiculous that I should not have to emphasise the case.</P>
    <P>I want to approach this matter in a rational way.  There are no politics in <Col N="667" /> it.  The number of votes per constituency could be counted possibly on the fingers of both hands &mdash; but there must be hundreds over the entire country.  The situation is so ridiculous that the Minister for Local Government cannot ignore it.  The Minister boasts of the people who emigrated and for whom Fianna Fáil can now provide a living here.  Yet he insists, if they come back to their native land after an absence of five years, that they must do a driving test in order to get back on the road again.  This is a stupid situation and I hope the Minister will do something about it.</P>

      <P>This, I think, is the second occasion on which Deputy Harte has raised this question on the Adjournment. We had it before on 11th June, 1968.

I did not appreciate until just now that, in fact, that was what Deputy Harte was suggesting.
