      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of his expressed favour for a federal solution to the problem of reuniting the country, which was repeated by An Tánaiste in America recently, he has any plans to meet the Prime Minister of the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how successful the efforts of the Government Information Bureau have been with the new specially appointed publicity officers in counteracting false impressions about the Republic of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the special public relations team recruited into the Government Information Bureau has been officially wound up; and what this operation has cost the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff concerned, having completed the work to which they were assigned, were released by the 15th <Col N="1224" /> November.  I am satisfied that the Government Information Bureau, augmented by this additional staff, were extremely successful in providing accurate information on Irish affairs, with particular reference to the situation in the Six Counties. I am not yet in a position to estimate the cost of the special news service.</P>

      <P>Why is it important to convince other people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because every country has an influence, to some extent, on every other country's affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has said these people will not be coerced, it cannot make any difference if outsiders are convinced about the need for unity if they are not convinced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting these are the first people we ought to convince, but I think the Deputy will agree that we cannot be indifferent to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a danger of such propaganda being counterproductive and a danger that the resentment and resistance against it in Northern Ireland among the people we are trying to convince could postpone rather than accelerate the process of ending Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I am not aware of any evidence which suggests that the use of monosodium <Col N="1225" /> glutamate in this country constitutes a hazard to health.</P>
      <P>I have, however, seen some recent press reports of experiments in the United States of America which indicated that this substance had produced deleterious effects in certain small animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has heard of a certain danger of meat-eaters building up a resistance to penicillin and similar drugs; and, if so, if he will discuss with the agricultural authorities the advisability of limiting at source the amount of antibiotics that can be used in feedingstuffs and the introduction of new safety limits for the injection of animals with penicillin and allied drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of certain reports suggesting that the consumption of food containing residues of penicillin or other antibiotics may possibly give rise to antibiotic resistance in man.</P>
      <P>Last September I asked my food advisory committee to consider as a matter of priority the problem of antibiotic residues in food, including meat.  When I receive the committee's report I shall decide&mdash;after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;what steps, if any, are necessary in the public health interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the dates of the deaths from <Col N="1226" /> Weil's disease in 1966, 1967 and 1968; and whether these deaths have any relationship at all with bathing in rat infested waters in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The dates of the deaths from Weil's disease in this country in 1966, 1967 and 1968 were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1966 &mdash; two deaths &mdash; one in May, one in November;</P>
      <P>1967 &mdash; four deaths &mdash; one each in January, February, May and September;</P>
      <P>1968 &mdash; no deaths.</P>
      <P>Although one of these deaths occurred in a Dublin hospital&mdash;in 1967&mdash; the disease in all cases was contracted outside the Dublin area.  Consequently the disease cannot have been contracted through bathing in rat infested waters in Dublin city.  Incidentally, none of the deceased was under the age of 50 and all but one was aged 60 or over.</P>
      <P>In the reply given to the Deputy on 12th November, 1969, about the incidence of Weil's disease, the figures given related to the country as a whole. The incidence in the Dublin area was as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Weil's disease is a form of Leptospirosis and there are arrangements under which specimens from suspected cases of such disease can be sent to a laboratory in London for diagnosis.  Medical laboratories throughout the country were notified of these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider setting up diagnostic facilities in the Republic for this disease considering that recently a young 17 year old girl in County Kerry died from this disease, that the diagnosis was not made until after she had died, and that diagnosis of this disease is not made until after the patient has died?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of this rare disease I would not dream of charging either the ratepayers or the State with the amount required to pay for expensive laboratory facilities when we receive the utmost co-operation from laboratories in Great Britain and other countries if required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of reports referring to the possible association between air pollution and respiratory deaths in Britain.  Perhaps the Deputy could indicate the specific report to which the question relates so that I can consider it particularly in regard to the point raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can point out to the Minister one particular report which indicates that one day's fog or one day's severe air pollution in the Manchester-Birmingham area results indirectly in 10,000 deaths.  In view of the severity of this would the Minister not like to make a statement regarding the association between air pollution and respiratory deaths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of different reports on this matter. Although it has been established that there are associations between air pollution <Col N="1228" /> and the instances of respiratory disease a number of experts say other factors have to be taken into account when making this study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think it necessary to make a study comparing air pollution levels in Dublin with the number of deaths from respiratory diseases to see whether or not there is a relationship between these two factors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>The vast bulk of cases will have received their refund before Christmas.  I hope nearly 100 per cent refund will be made.  Except in some cases where we are trying to get information <Col N="1231" /> from the Grain Board as to the addresses of some of those entitled to a refund, there will be no doubt that the refunds will be received before Christmas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state if it is intended to pay interest on the sum which is being withheld at the moment?  The fact that this money is being withheld has meant that a number of farmers have had to seek credit from the bank to tide them over.  It would be only fair that interest be paid on the money withheld.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of interest accruing will not be very substantial. Due note of what interest this money may have earned will be taken and no doubt it will be agreed that some part of that interest at least, if not all of it, will be required to operate the scheme of holding a levy at the Grain Board and paying it out to the individuals.  I can assure the House that no part of the benefit of this passes beyond the Grain Board who in turn, from their funds, will reflect any benefit accruing, if there is any, in grain prices to the compounders and consequently to the farmers over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to know that a statement was issued last night in this regard but in view of the ministerial statements that have been made in this House lately involving the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, indeed, the Minister for Local Government, bringing local authorities into it, would the Minister say if any serious attempt is being made to tackle this serious problem in an urgent way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that if we go back seven, eight or nine years we find that long before there were any instances of mortality, such as that which we have experienced in the Blackwater this year, the Department of Local Government were having studies initiated.  These reflected themselves in the structure of An Foras Forbartha as they were later set up An Foras Forbartha are now under the Minister for Local Government, and they are taking what steps they can to try to clarify for all of us concerned what we should do and how it should be done.  But, as my statement which is available indicates and as everybody who has an interest in this matter is, I think, well aware, this is not a simple matter to deal with nor will it be a matter that can be dealt with without quite a large input of capital whether to cure existing pollution or to prevent pollution in future.  There is no ready answer to it.  If in the future season we get a combination of circumstances on any river or water such as we got on the Blackwater this year, these things will not be easily got over and will not be got over cheaply in whatever time we get over them, if we ever do get over them.</P>

      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister is he aware that many tenants are not aware of the fact that extra rent is due by them? They are given very short notice, court orders and evictions.  This has happened in many cases without tenants being aware of the fact that they are liable for arrears of rent under this scheme.  Is he aware of this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in the tenancy agreement that the tenants will notify changes in their income to the local authority and any tenant who adheres to the terms of his agreement will not have these substantial arrears accumulating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that tenants are not quite aware of their agreements under this scheme, are not aware of their obligations, and would he make these facts known to the tenants or would he instruct the commissioner of Dublin Corporation to do this work?  It all boils down to one thing&mdash;lack of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is concerned with the type of case where land which was purchased at a price based on its agricultural use subsequently becomes available for housing development because of the provision or extension of public water supply and sewerage services, and changes hands at an enhanced price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been considering for some time whether it would be possible to devise a workable system whereby speculation in scarce serviced land would be discouraged and the increase in the value of land attributable to the provision of services and the designation by local planning authorities of land for development to meet the needs of the community would be recouped to the benefit of the community and not be turned to private profit.  The matter is extremely complex and difficult and the problem involved does not lend itself to any easy solution.  I have pointed out on a number of occasions that while it might appear that the obvious solution to the problem would be to bring all building land into public ownership, this would entail the most serious constitutional, legal financial and administrative problems.  Examination of the matter is continuing.  Meanwhile, in order to increase the supply of building land at reasonable prices, I have encouraged local authorities to acquire land suitable for development <Col N="1239" /> and to facilitate the opening up of further lands by the provision of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say nationalisation was the only solution: I said it was the obvious solution and the one which presented itself to my mind at first, but to deal with the problem in this way presents very serious constitutional difficulties which I have not been able to overcome.  That does not mean I have given up all hope of being able to deal with this very serious social problem.</P>

    <P>Detailed information regarding the number of dwellings which will be completed by each housing authority before the end of the 1969-70 financial year is not available in my Department. Column 7 of the statement gives the number of dwellings provided by each in the first six months of the current financial year.  It is estimated that the total number of dwellings to be completed in 1969-70 will be of the order of 4,500.</P>

The submission of house plans and an estimate of cost for the 54 local authority houses is awaited in my Department.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such proposal before my Department at present. Last September, however, I informed the housing authority that the cost of the 20 local authority houses in the scheme would be excessive on the basis of the tender which they proposed to accept and that I was not prepared to approve their proposal.  They now intend to re-advertise the scheme.  It is for the authority themselves to decide whether or not to accept the tender for the nine purchase-type houses.  My approval to this would not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have asked the Minister a question.  Does the Minister know that two years ago these people were refused water, even though it is within 150 yards of their front doors, and will he see to it that these people are rehoused immediately and not left there forever and a day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that persons are squatting in Dublin Corporation houses.  As, however, housing authorities are not required to notify me of details, I am not aware of the numbers involved.  In so far as legislation is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which provides that where there is no tenancy in a house and the occupier refuses to give up possession, the housing authority may apply to the district court for a warrant for possession. The section provides that the court, on being satisfied that demand for the house has been duly made, shall issue the warrant.  When the corporation learn that a person is squatting in one of their dwellings, they immediately institute proceedings under these or other provisions.  However, a period of time inevitably elapses in some cases before squatters are dispossessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses are allocated by local authorities under a carefully established and democratically decided order of priorities.  While I recognise the human factors involved in the problem, I must add that it would be most unfair to families to whom houses have properly been allocated by local authorities to allow these priorities to be set aside by agitators and publicists exploiting <Col N="1250" /> genuine housing difficulties for their own disruptive ends, who encourage families awaiting rehousing to jump the queue by breaking the law, by illegal entry, and by violence.  Any concession to these methods could only result in chaos and the gravest injustice in that houses would go to those who could exercise the greatest force rather than to those in greatest need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the answer is to provide more houses and that the problem lies with the Fianna Fáil Government who are not providing enough houses? Over 10,000 families are on the waiting list.  The Minister's Government's record is the worst in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is not to support this campaign by people outside this House who mainly, as far as I know, are trying to disrupt the housing programme in this manner and are trying to deprive people of houses which have been allocated to them on the basis of need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

The reconstruction of this bridge is primarily a matter for Waterford County Council who are the responsible road authority.  In October, 1968, my Department approved of a proposal to have trial borings carried out in connection with the replacement of the bridge.  I understand that the results of these borings are being examined by the county council.  There is no proposal before me in regard to the bridge at present.</P>

As regards the position in Loughrea a proposal for the construction of a mart on a site near the railway station was refused planning permission by Galway County Council and was referred to me on appeal.  The proposers in their submissions adverted to the difficulty of obtaining a suitable site in the town. Having carefully considered all aspects of the proposal I was reluctantly obliged to refuse permission for the development.  I considered that the location of the site in relation to the main street of the town and the inadequate access available to it would have given rise to traffic congestion and traffic hazard.  The proposal would also have given rise to injury to residential amenity.  The developers were advised that they should consult with the planning authority with a view to locating the mart on a more suitable site.</P>

Other members assist as required.  The members of the force who are engaged whole time on the work have made a special study of the problems of drug addiction in so far as they relate to the discharge of their police duties and have, in addition, acquired considerable practical experience in the detection of offences involving drugs.  They are not concerned with any other aspects of the problems of drug addiction, and I must again emphasise to the House that the problems of drug addiction are not primarily the concern of the Garda Síochána.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the disturbing evidence disclosed by the television programme, <i>Seven Days</i>, of unfettered unlicensed moneylending in Dublin city and of the strong arm methods used by some of the illegal money-lenders to recover their money; and what measures the Government propose to take to ensure that the underprivileged and others who use these illegal services are protected, that these money lenders are brought to justice along with those whom they use to injure and intimidate people and that every possible protection will be afforded to those who seek to expose these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, wellknown that some unlicensed money-lending goes on, not only in Dublin but in other urban areas.  It is also well-known to charitable organisations and social workers as well as to the Garda Síochána that it is invariably <Col N="1264" /> difficult and usually almost impossible to get evidence to support a prosecution.  The difficulty is not the threat of violence or other reprisals, which is not a factor as far as the Garda Síochána are aware, but the fact that those who borrow money in this way very often do so without the knowledge of other members of the family, especially husband or wife, and they are not willing to do anything that would reveal the transactions to their families, not to mention having them made public Accordingly, it is widely acknowledged that the problem should be approached as a social and educational one rather than a police problem.</P>
      <P>To say that the problem exists is not to say that it exists on anything like the scale suggested by the RTE programme referred to in the question The programme mentioned a figure of 500 unlicensed money-lenders&mdash; meaning people carrying on a business of money-lending.  As far as the Garda Síochána are aware, this figure is grossly exaggerated.  However, the gardaí decided to investigate the allegations made in the programme and two Garda superintendents have had an interview with a senior officer of RTE whose position is such that he must be taken as speaking for that organisation.  As far as the Garda Síochána are concerned, his general attitude to the question of disclosing evidence was a negative one, though the Garda officers were given an undertaking that all film and other records relating to the programme will be kept safely by RTE in case they are later required by a court order to produce them.  The Garda officers were given the address of the producer of the programme but were told that he was on holidays and probably was not available for interview by the Garda Further Garda attempts to contact the producer have not succeeded so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda have themselves, however, been able to identify and interview all or practically all the people who appeared in the programme, whether as alleged money-lenders, agents, strong-arm men or victims of a money-lending racket, including <Col N="1265" /> those who were supposed to be disguised. All have made statements to the Garda, most of them written statements. All explained their appearance on the programme in much the same way, namely, that they were offered money if they would take part in this programme and were in fact paid fees of varying amounts, the usual one being £20.  In at least one case, an extra fee is alleged to have been paid to a participant for bringing along another person willing to take part in the show.  Statements given to the Garda set out details of the way the people concerned were approached and of how they were told that they would be paid to say these things. Incidentally, the ease with which all these people were identified by those who knew them is a sufficient comment on the claim that they had to be disguised for fear of reprisals.</P>
    <P>A matter of particular concern to many viewers was the appearance on the programme of a man, with his back to the camera, purporting to be disclosing that he was a moneylender and that he employed others to beat-up and injure defaulting borrowers. He also referred, on the programme, to a car owned by a defaulting borrower having been burnt.  The more sceptical viewers no doubt asked themselves why a man such as this should agree to appear on a TV programme if indeed his story was genuine, and I now want to say specifically that this man, like the others, has told the Garda that his statements on the programme were without foundation of any kind and were made solely because he was paid for making them and because he badly needed the money.</P>
    <P>Some of the people concerned have, I understand, criminal records.  That some of them may, some time, have had something to do with money-lending is a possibility.  What is a certainty, however, is that if people like this are paid fees for making statements on television, these statements are, at best, quite valueless as evidence and, as I have explained, are according to themselves now, nothing more than a tissue of lies.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that drink was <Col N="1266" /> supplied to some of those who took part in the programme, as well as money payments.</P>
    <P>I am informed that a further interview between gardaí and RTE representatives has been arranged for today. I trust that the authorities there will appreciate that, by putting on a programme of this kind, they have incurred certain obligations, including the obligation to disclose honestly whether the programme was deliberately contrived for television.</P>

The question raised about uncontrolled invasion of privacy and the use of hidden microphones by persons answerable to nobody and carrying on this type of trial by television is a matter that I know is giving some concern to some people.</P>

The gardaí, as I said, went to Telefís Éireann to try to get their assistance in ascertaining whether the allegations in this programme were true.  They met with non-co-operation there.  That is the position up to this point in time.  I have no doubt that in the course of a week or so we will have further information on these issues.

      <P>I wish to refer specifically to section 12 (9) of the Bill.  I wish to support the amendment which would take specifically from the Minister for Health the power which he now gives himself in this Bill, namely, the right to appoint the first chief executive officer of each of the regional health boards.  Such an innovation is open to very serious objection and our party also support the amendment put down by the Fine Gael Party on this matter.</P>
      <P>The dilution by the Minister of the functions of the Local Appointments Commission in this matter is certainly open to grave concern.  There should be some transitional arrangement whereby the existing chief executive officers will be installed in their new positions as chief executive officers on the regional health boards.  Certainly there should not be power given directly to the Minister to make a temporary appointment of a chief executive officer on his own volition. This would mean in effect that in the event of the new regional health boards coming into being he would appoint the alleged temporary chief executive officer.  We know what happens in terms of temporary appointments generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to two different matters.  Subsection (9) applies to a temporary appointment of a CEO where the previous CEO has retired, is being removed from office or has died.  It does not apply to the first appointment of a CEO.  I will examine subsection (5) to ensure that the Deputy need have no fear on this matter and I can come back on Report Stage and tell the Deputy so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of other amendments in relation to the officers of the eastern health board, I am prepared not to press this amendment. The Minister now states that temporary appointments would apply only in cases of retirements, deaths or removals from office.  On that basis, and on receiving that assurance of the Minister, I withdraw my objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some information on this subsection. Where the Minister makes a temporary appointment on death or retirement is there any limitation of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will learn if he looks at the two amendments, 17 and 17a, through which Deputy O'Connell quite naturally would like to restrict the time to a period of two months, we have the difficulty that to fix a rigid limit would be undesirable because in certain circumstances it might be desirable to <Col N="1273" /> leave the office vacant.  For example, we might be reorganising the country on the question of health boards after we have had some experience of the operation of this Act; or we might be reviewing the qualifications of the officers.  As the Deputy and the House know, there are difficulties which arise in convening the board.  As well, some candidates might not reply to correspondence. I am afraid this is quite possible even from very good candidates. A competition might not throw up a suitable candidate and equally a candidate could refuse an appointment. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to fix the length of time during which a temporary appointment can be made pending the appointment of a new CEO.</P>
      <P>As I have said, these temporary appointments will be made on the death, the retirement or the removal from office of a CEO.  No officer of my Department in the ordinary way is appointed to such a post.  The person concerned must have the right kind of qualification.  The kind of temporary appointment to which Deputies have been referring takes place now and has taken place without much difficulty, without creating opposition or criticism in the past.  The purpose of subsection (9) is inevitable in relation to these appointments.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister not state here the optimum time for a temporary appointment?  In exceptional circumstances it would be necessary to make a temporary appointment but in relation to such appointments amendment 17a puts a limit of two months on such appointments.  In view of the importance of the post&mdash;we hope it will be one of the most important posts in the health boards&mdash;it should not be too <Col N="1274" /> difficult to find suitable candidates for the permanent appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I did not have very much experience of the work of the Local Appointments Commission, I have made inquiries in this matter.  I have consulted the officers of my Department and I have found that there have been occasions where there have been delays for one reason or another.  I would hope that when it became known that a CEO was due for retirement, action would be taken in advance and I would hope that we would be able to arrange for the filling of the appointment in that way.  The Local Appointments Commission procedure is inevitably a long one.  I have given particulars of the kind of delays that can be caused and I can add another one&mdash;the finding of a date and a time on which the appointments board would be available.</P>
      <P>Take the case of county managers and assistant county managers.  I have inquired into the procedure here and I do not think that in general much damage has been done to local administration because of delays that have taken place in the appointment of county managers or assistant county managers.  I do not recall there having been any serious complaints of maladministration or of difficulties because of delays.  The process seems to have been fairly satisfactory and we are applying exactly that process here in relation to CEOs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, only the appointment of a CEO pending the appointment of a permanent officer.  Obviously if a CEO were dismissed the Local Appointments Commission would have to wait until his dismissal was formally and legally made known to him.  There would be bound to be a delay because of that.  There might not be such delay if it was a case of his impending retirement. In the case of the dismissal of a CEO, it would be essential to have a temporary appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial amendment which I tabled was caused by our objection to the Minister having power to make any temporary appointment, particularly without going through the process of consulting with the health board concerned.  We were re-assured when the Minister gave an indication that subsection (6) of section 12 is to be amended so that it will be mandatory on the Minister to process the first appointment through the Local Appointments Commission.  That certainly avoids the deplorable possibility that the Minister would appoint his own particular favourite which would give that person a greatly enhanced prospect of being appointed later by the Local Appointments Commission, whereas the Minister says the first appointment will be through the Commission and for that we are grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always willing to do what is reasonable.  There are certain amendments I cannot accept in this Bill.  If the Deputy wishes I shall put down the amendment for Report Stage to the effect that the Minister will consult the chairman of the health board before making a temporary appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would certainly help greatly and I should be most grateful to the Minister.  There should be consultation but I suggest, with respect to the Minister that the consultation should be with the health board, not just with the chairman.  The chairman might, in fact, be the best person but there should be some process of consultation.  I realise the Minister would still be free, having received advice, to exercise his judgment and appoint somebody else.  It would greatly improve the position if we had this process of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not entirely agree with the Minister's view that local government administration has not been impaired because of delays which have arisen in making appointments in the past. Quite recently the Minister and some of his colleagues in reply to some parliamentary questions of mine acknowledged that in Government Departments as well as in local government there are appointments in critical <Col N="1276" /> positions, particularly on the professional side, unfilled not for a matter of months but for years.  There is a great deal to be said for endeavouring in legislation to impose a mandatory obligation to have steps taken to fill these positions.  I certainly appreciate all the difficulties the Minister mentions but we must get away from the practice which frequently arises whereby as much as six, nine or 12 months or even two years elapse from the time a vacancy arises before the Minister concerned asks the Local Appointments Commission to take the necessary steps to fill the vacancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to county managers in particular and I have not heard much complaint in respect of the appointment of county managers or the performance of temporary county managers or, indeed, any allegations that pets were appointed by the Minister as temporary county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the Minister not to go too far back or it might be interpreted as an argument for the abolition, of the managerial system an argument for which much could be said including what the Minister has just said.  If these posts are necessary, if it is desirable to have competent people in them, then the various Departments of State and public authorities concerned ought to move with much greater speed than they have been moving in the past to fill these vacancies in order that the most highly qualified people can be appointed and also to relieve the burden on the people who are frequently asked to perform the duties of officers for which they are not being remunerated.  This is grossly unfair.  It is wrong that an assistant manager or some other officer should be asked to perform the duties of his senior's office for many months or years at a lower rate of pay and at the end of it find that some stranger is appointed to the position.  I am grateful to the Minister for the two amendments he says he will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should try to appreciate the concern of Members of the House about introducing legislation where we have provision for <Col N="1277" /> a temporary appointment with no limit to the temporary aspect of it.  The Minister says he does not know of any case of complaint and that he has not so much previous experience.  I can give him a case of a very responsible position, the position of county engineer in Dublin County where development was taking place faster, I think, than in any other county.  That was vacant for eight years: it was a temporary appointment for eight years because of squabbles that were going on.  Because this sort of thing can happen I can appreciate the Minister's difficulties in setting limits.  There can be considerable difficulties in finding the right man and the right, when appointed, may find he has got a better job somewhere else and takes it up.  All this sort of thing can arise.  It could be reasonable, perhaps, for a year to elapse and nobody could regard the Minister as unreasonable for not having made the permanent appointment for a year but it is terribly dangerous to leave the situation wide open and to have no limit on a temporary appointment.</P>

      <P>I have not had very much experience of these appointments but I understand that if you have a <Col N="1278" /> large regional health board covering a number of counties it is more than likely that you would appoint whoever was deputy to the chief executive officer or you might appoint the deputy to another chief executive officer.  That would be the kind of appointment you would make.  I would hope that such an appointment would be satisfactory to the House.  Meantime, I can only give an assurance that as long as I am Minister for Health and after this Bill is passed, I shall take particular care to ensure that first, the regional health boards do their homework in requesting the Local Appointments Commission to appoint the CEO and, secondly, I shall do all I can with the Local Appointments Commission to see that there is no delay in the appointment of such a key person as the CEO to what would be a comparatively new health board.  I can only give that assurance.  The Deputy knows that I like to do things efficiently. I shall certainly make it my duty between now and the next general election to ensure that if the post of CEO in any regional health board becomes vacant, the machinery will operate as rapidly as possible.</P>

We are trying to take precautions for a later stage when he has ceased to be Minister for Health. He implies that he will be Minister for Health until the next general election but we can never be sure of that.  I can see a difficulty arising in the case of a dismissal.  The Minister for Health will have the right to appoint a temporary CEO.  In my opinion, we would not know for how long this would go on: we could have a temporary CEO in office indefinitely without any limitation.  This is where the difficulty arises and I regard it as a very serious one.</P>

No married man with children will take up a temporary appointment in say, County Kerry where he can be on a temporary basis for many years.  What has been sought in the amendment is the deletion of the section providing that a temporary appointment can be made by the Minister or that if it is necessary to make a temporary appointment that it should not last for any longer than two months.  The efficiency of the organisation being set up should be such as to ensure sufficient applicants of quality high enough to fill these posts on an appointment basis.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee to alter the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission to ensure a speedy appointment in, shall we say, two months.  It would be very difficult to state any particular time in such a difficult matter.  Sometimes there may be a considerable number of applicants for a high position such as this.  At other times a number of important posts will be vacant and no suitable person may be found.  I think that in the ordinary way it would be more than likely that I would appoint the deputy chief of the health board but I could not even put into the Bill that in the event of the retirement, death or dismissal of a CEO the deputy officer would be automatically appointed because there might not be one deputy officer, but two.  So, I cannot do that. I cannot help the House over this.  I do not see how I can go any further.  Perhaps, Deputy Clinton who has knowledge of this can help me or, perhaps, someone from any side of the House. Does he know of any case in which it took five years to fill a county manager's position, because I do not know of one?  I honestly think that in connection with this particular kind of very high executive position there have not been excessive delays.</P>

I asked him why and he said: &ldquo;Because we have different procedures which we must go through.&rdquo; Is it not high time that public administration got away from procedures which they believe they must go through?  Why must public administration continue to suffer the inefficiencies which would soon bankrupt private industries, private operations or private commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of our anxiety to assist the Minister in streamlining the whole process that we are pressing for a new approach and, while we appreciate that the great value of the Local Appointments Commission is that they prevent the operation of graft and corruption, we should still emphasise here in the Dáil that we are dissatisfied with the <Col N="1281" /> long procedural delays which have tended to arise in many cases.  I think those delays arise not because of the Local Appointments Commission but primarily because of the processing, the silly processing, of rates of pay and conditions of service between the Department concerned, the local authority concerned and the Department of Finance sticking their dead and rather soiled hand into the works.  We should get away from that.  I think the Minister has been kind enough to convey to those responsible that we want to see more expendition in making these appointments.  I believe the debate we have had on the amendments has been worthwhile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (3), page 9, line 34, <Col N="1282" /> before &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;appropriate to his office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>An officer or servant of a health board appointed under this section shall hold his office or employment on such terms and conditions and shall perform such duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>My amendment suggests the insertion there of the words &ldquo;appropriate to his office&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as the chief executive officer from time to time determines.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to include this amendment.  It is terribly important to the officer or servant of a health board to have his duties defined.  It should not be left to the chief executive officer to determine the type of duties he carries out.  I think the Minister will agree that it would be a very important amendment to this subsection to insert these words because the medical officers might be asked to perform duties not appropriate to their office, and servants and other workers in a health board might be asked, under the subsection as it stands, to perform duties not appropriate to their office. This could create some difficulties. Perhaps, their duties could be defined by means of some regulations.  I think the Minister will agree that this would provide a safeguard for the officers and servants of the health boards.</P>

The legal advisers inform me that the subsection as it stands, just as in the case of section 10 subsection (1) (b) of the Local Government Act, 1941, would not permit inappropriate duties to be assigned to any officer.  Appropriateness to the office is implicit in the legal power to assign duties.  An assurance of this will surely satisfy the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The amendment is an important one.  The Minister, in giving <Col N="1283" /> his assurance has quoted local government law.  I found myself in a position one time of being directed by the county council to do work which I did not consider was mine; in fact, I considered it home assistance officer work.  I found it convenient to do the work but had I not found it convenient to do so, this section could have been quoted to me and I would have been compelled to do it.  This is the danger I see in the section as it stands in the Bill.  The Act the Minister quoted obtained at the time I was asked to perform this duty, and down through the years the use that is made of this Act has been one of the matters of contention between the State and the medical profession.</P>

Recently I was asked to enter into a very dangerous environment to treat a sick child and was informed by representatives of the chief executive officer that it was my duty to endanger my life to this extent, to enter in among a crowd of thugs to treat a sick child.  I do not think it appropriate to my office or to the office of any medical officer to put one's life in danger in the pursuit of duties like these.  I do not think the chief executive officer should have this power.  As has been said on the far side of the House, he can quote section 3 of this Act and has the right to determine whose duty it is to do what.  We feel that this should be negotiated from time to time and that the duties performed by officers should be appropriate to their office.</P>

I am not <Col N="1284" /> aware of any experience in the past that would lead me to think that circumstances could arise where people would be asked to do things that were not appropriate.

We have a situation at the moment where doctors are asked not only to prescribe but also to dispense, and I do not think that is a doctor's duty.  My colleague on my right will agree with me; I must confess I have never been a dispensary doctor but I know of many complaints by them on this point.  A doctor should not be asked to do duties that are not appropriate to his office, and that should be spelled out in this amendment. If that is done there will be no need for appeals to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can understand the motives behind Deputy Dr. O'Connell's remarks here, I can fully sympathise with the Minister's attitude. I do not see how it would be possible in any use of the English language to define what are duties appropriate to an office.  If you start making provisions of that kind in this Bill, you <Col N="1285" /> are just creating a situation in which the whole administration and the provision of services will be totally cluttered up.  One can well imagine some officer or employee being given a direction, and he says: &ldquo;That is not appropriate to my office&rdquo;.  What will happen?  Everything stops and you count ten or somebody explodes.  There may be, as Deputy Dr. Byrne mentioned, occasions on which a medical officer or somebody else may feel that what he is being asked to do is a bit extreme, harsh or unjust.  At the same time, the duty has to be done, but the position can be rectified if there is a provision for appeal to the Minister subsequently in order to keep the score right.</P>
      <P>Surely in relation to medical officers the important thing is to have the efficient and quick dispatch of the medical service where the need arises. Deputy Dr. Byrne mentioned a sick child.  It would be incongruous, to my mind, if you had an even balancing of whether duties were appropriate to a particular office of a medical officer while a child was sick and, perhaps, dying.  Obviously, this service has to be provided.  I can sympathise with any medical officer or, indeed, any officer or employee who may get on the wrong side of some person superior to him and may feel he is being hard done by.  Human society, unfortunately, is not and never can be perfect, and that situation must arise from time to time.  The best that can be done is to provide a means for ventilating that grievance and the machinery is there. As I say, while I can sympathise with what has been said here, I do not see how you can possibly define in legislation here what are the duties, in the variety of changing circumstances, which are appropriate to a particular office.  If you leave it as wide as &ldquo;duties appropriate to the office&rdquo; then you provide that the decide will be the person upon whom the provision of service depends and that is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to anarchy in the provision of essential services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to medical officers who will be appointed under the new Health Act it is not the <Col N="1286" /> position of the chief executive officer to dictate to the doctor how he should treat his patients as is the practice in certain instances in the dispensary services at the moment.  Medical skills are being utilised for the prescription and provision of such domestic items as hair shampoo, suntan lotion and toothpaste. Under the present regulations if a medical officer objects to the directives issued to him he is told that it is part of his duty, and unless we have an amendment in this measure stipulating appropriate to his office, or appropriate to the office of all medical officers appointed, this situation will continue. It is far from satisfactory to have a medical officer's time taken up with petty jobs which bear no resemblance to his ability or his professional skills.</P>

      <P>Section 6 makes it clear that medical officers make their own decisions about the treatment they will accord to patients for whom they provide services.  Deputy O'Higgins stated the position quite correctly; somebody has got to define &ldquo;appropriateness&rdquo; in relation to an office.  One could write volumes on the subject.  The officer has a right of appeal to the Minister and a good many classes of officers and servants have at their aid trade unions or other organisations to enable them to make their case.  They can compare their positions with others in the same grade in the service in regard to the character of their duties. There are trade unions and medical associations fully equipped to give them this information.  I do not think the House need have any fears that people will be asked to do jobs that they are not supposed to do and have no method, without recourse, to appeal because it is clearly available.</P>

      <P>I should like to appeal, as Deputy O'Higgins has appealed, to Deputy O'Connell to withdraw this amendment.  Certainly in relation to servants it could not work in many institutions and I am saying this from some considerable experience.  There is not room for a full-time specialist at most things in certain institutions. It is understood that a man drops a hammer and takes up something else when an emergency arises.  There are many people qualified, and if they were <Col N="1287" /> outside and whole-time occupied in their particular craft or trade, they would not do anything else except that, but in an institution they are quite pleased to take up a maintenance appointment, for instance, which includes a number of things outside their normal work and their normal craft. This is understood and accepted by the unions and it could create a lot of trouble if it was written into legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17c:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 9, lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;from time to time determines&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;negotiates from time to time with the organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of officers and servants employed in the functional area of a health board or are representative of a particular grade or category on a national basis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House regard this amendment as being of major importance in the health services.  It opens up the whole question of what might be called the Victorian administrative structure of our health services. It was amazing to me, coming from a trade union setting into this House, to find written into legislation that the remuneration and the allowances of workers employed in the health services are determined without any reference to the trade union organisations. This amendment is designed to give recognition to the trade unions and the staff organisations which are already in existence in the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strenuously object to any chief executive officer, appointed by a health board, being given unilateral right to determine the remuneration and allowances of officers and staff even where he may have to obtain Departmental sanctions.  In order to democratise our health services it is essential that recognition of trade <Col N="1288" /> unions be written into legislation.  There are 15 trade union organisations representing many thousands of workers employed by the health authorities throughout the country, and these unions negotiate and resolve a whole range of grievances, disputes and conditions of employment directly with the senior executive officers of these authorities day in and day out in all areas of the health services.  All we are asking here is the insertion of the reality of industrial collective bargaining in the health services.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of authoritarian hangover in our health services, in our hospitals, in our dispensary administrative system, in our ambulance system and in the system of running local authority health clerical and administrative structures themselves, with very little internal democracy and this is what we want to see brought about. We are proposing this amendment to give recognition to trade union organisations and we seek the support of this House for it.  We ask for the deletion of the words &ldquo;from time to time determines&rdquo; and the substitution of the words</P>
    <P>negotiates from time to time with the organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of officers and servants employed in the functional area of a health board or are representative of a particular grade or category on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I feel somewhat upset that one should have to come into the House and plead for trade union recognition. Frankly, I am not interested in the Minister saying that it is there already, that they can have it, that they can go into the Department any time they like, meet an executive officer and that he will direct the executive officer to meet the trade unions direct and negotiate rates of pay with, say, an ambulance driver, subject to his sanction.  My argument is that there must be negotiation recognised by the State.  This is, perhaps, an innovation which the Minister himself, with his very considerable interest in joint consultation, which is quite separate from trade union recognition, and his general interest when Minister for Transport and <Col N="1289" /> Power in trade union relations, would find well worthy of his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree that as far as possible conditions of employment and the arrangements made for the employment of people should be conducted on a basis where there is an assured form of machinery but at the moment we are in the position that the chief executive officer has, under this Bill, the ultimate decision in regard to these matters.  As the Deputy knows, there is a conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authorities which was organised through the County Managers' Association and the trade unions. This deals only with remuneration and not with conditions of employment. The Deputy is right in saying that with regard to conditions of employment there is continuously discussion between the county managers and staff through their trade union organisation where matters relating to conditions of employment arise, even although it is not built-in to fundamental local government legislation.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to say that there is a revision of the present conciliation and arbitration agreement being considered at present.  Under this, I understand, the arbitration body would be more widely based.  It might take in representatives of the Labour Court. The terms of reference of this new body which is under examination would be widened to cover conditions of employment. I was very glad to hear of this because I felt, even although I might not be able to accept these two amendments, that while it is desirable to have a situation whereby <i>de facto</i> trade unions and other organisations can discuss informally with county managers matters pertaining to conditions of employment, the county manager's decision being final in the long run and with, under an amendment to this section, appeal to the Minister, nevertheless, it would be better if we had proper complete conciliation and arbitration machinery for both the local government system and the health system.</P>

    <P>I think it would be entirely unreasonable for me to anticipate the result of this examination by building into this <Col N="1290" /> Bill the two amendments suggested by the Deputy and I hope he will be reasonable about this.  I understand that this machinery when it is completed and agreed will be provided for in a separate Bill and will probably be handled by the Minister for Local Government and whatever machinery is devised there will be applied by law and that, as the Deputy knows, can be done to the employees of the health boards.  That is all I can say about it but I do think it would be quite wrong to place those who are negotiating for this new type of machinery in a very difficult position by pre-empting what they were going to do by accepting the amendment.  I hope the Deputy will accept my sincerity in stating that.</P>
    <P>As I have said, already there is an informal arrangement that, as the Deputy knows, can operate if somebody regards his conditions of employment as being entirely wrong or whereby, if he has a complaint to make, he can make a complaint but it is an informal arrangement at the moment and let us keep it that way until this new conciliation and arbitration machinery, which I am sure will include the kind of arrangements the Deputy wishes to cover&mdash;conditions of employment&mdash;will come before the House.</P>

      <P>I have heard what the Minister has to say but at the present time he is, directly or indirectly, involved in a dispute which is taking place between the Medical Union and the County Managers' Association on conditions of employment of DMOs. The Medical Union find this body an intransigent body, downright offensive to them and not prepared to discuss conditions of employment.  I would not like to see this continue.  I appreciate what the Minister has said.  I would like him to elaborate a little further as to what exactly is proposed in substitution so that the amendment will not be necessary.  I should like him to spell it out a little more.  Will it be brought in as separate legislation and will it cover all employees?  I should like to have more information on these points before we could make a decision.  Certainly, the present situation with the Medical Union and the County <Col N="1291" /> Managers' Association emphasises the need for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot give any further details because these negotiations are continuing and I could not say how far they have advanced.  From what I know of the improvement in industrial relations, it is hardly conceivable that the final conciliation and arbitration machinery, if it can be agreed between all the parties concerned, will not embrace conditions of employment since, in fact, these conditions of employment can already be discussed informally.  Quite evidently, whatever machinery is devised, some one person will have to have the ultimate authority.  How that will be arranged, I could not say.  All I can say is that I know very definitely that these negotiations are continuing. They are being conducted under the auspices of the Department of Local Government, I understand.</P>

      <P>We are still discussing the question whether we could not make certain arrangements in relation to off-time for medical officers.  I should like to put it this way to the Deputy: the Medical Union and the Medical Association would themselves have to agree to any particular form of conciliation and arbitration machinery. This is something new.  It need not be assumed that they will necessarily accept without long negotiation what part they would play in this.  They will have to give agreement to a form of machinery which will cover many classes of officers and servants in the whole of the local authority and health administration.  So, I should not like to commit the Medical Association or the Medical Union as to what their views would be in relation to either the amendments prepared by the Deputy or to the final machinery.  That will have to be negotiated.</P>

      <P>May I, perhaps, to short-circuit it, seek some assurance from the Minister that on Report <Col N="1292" /> Stage he would consider an amendment something along these lines: &ldquo;the conditions of employment being determined in accordance with the conciliation and arbitration schemes which may from time to time be agreed between the parties concerned&rdquo;? This would take out of the Bill the unilateral smack it has at the moment of a CEO arrogating to himself the right to determine such conditions. Once there would be elementary recognition that there was a negotiating function in this matter we could advance very considerably because I am conscious that conciliation and arbitration schemes are agreed without necessarily being embodied in any legislation.  There are <i>ad hoc</i> agreements that never formally come before the House in pure legislation. I am anxious that conciliation and arbitration in the public service should be incorporated in the Bill.  I do not think that would present any insurmountable difficulty.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its purpose is to prevent the chief executive officer from acting freely in any matter not covered by the directions of the Minister.  Apparently, under the Bill as <Col N="1293" /> originally drafted, the chief executive officer would be free to create any type or number of offices and to determine any rates of remuneration he might consider appropriate, subject only to such direction as the Minister may have given in the matter.

    <P>In regard to any modification the Minister might think of making under this section, it is only right, I think, that the Minister should tell the Oireachtas what he has in mind and give his reasons for the modification.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most complex matter.  It relates to one of the most important and valuable recommendations of the FitzGerald commission, namely, the essential interplay between voluntary hospitals and local authority hospitals.  Already this is beginning to take place inasmuch as local authority hospitals are paying sessional fees to consultants who come from voluntary hospitals.  They are going to appoint regional hospital boards within a fairly wide area.  They will be making recommendations for <Col N="1296" /> the growing integration of the voluntary and local authority hospitals because of the growth in specialities and of the complexities in modern medicine &mdash;the growth in paramedical services and expensive laboratory equipment.</P>
      <P>In section 40, it is proposed that functions relating to the selection of consultants and senior medical staff &mdash;only those&mdash;for appointments controlled by Comhairle na nOspidéal will be delegated to the Comhairle.  We hope to get the agreement of all the parties concerned to a specialist selection procedure which will apply to all senior consultants and senior medical appointments and which will incorporate the best features of the Local Appointments Commission machinery which has been found very satisfactory up to now.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, already the Local Appointments Commission do not operate the normal machinery if they appoint a consultant to a local authority hospital which is a teaching hospital because they make arrangements to consult the university concerned and the procedures are different. Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell will be aware of that.  It was quite obvious that, even before the very complicated regulations to be provided in connection with Comhairle na nOspidéal were formulated, those kinds of appointments are likely to grow in extent.  Instead of merely appointing a consultant from a voluntary hospital to do sessional work in a local authority hospital, one might want to do the alternative or even more.  One would like to appoint a consultant&mdash;for example a haematologist&mdash;who would have specific duties in relation to a number of hospitals in the whole of the regional hospital board area, quite apart from a health board area where you would have to consider the position of the voluntary hospitals involved which, up to now, made their own appointments, and the local authority hospitals involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the appointment is being made by the Local Appointments Commission and where there was a voluntary hospital which was also the teaching hospital, or a local authority one which was also a teaching hospital, the university would be concerned if <Col N="1297" /> the person so appointed would have to give clinical teaching in the course of his many duties.  That was the object in framing section 14.  I thought it would be sufficient, if we could not make any modifications under the section without the consent of the Local Appointments Commission.  If the House feels that the consent of the Local Appointments Commission is not sufficient; that, with all their prolonged experience, they would be likely to permit a form of selection of this kind that I have mentioned that was undesirable, likely to lead to nepotism or to the appointment of unsuitable persons or to be unfair to any of the candidates, then I shall have to accept the amendment and I should do so quite willingly.  However, I would ask any Deputy whether he thinks the Local Appointments Commission would be likely to consent to undesirable modifications.</P>

What I said is that the Local Appointments Commission will have to agree to a departure from the usual method of appointing, for example, an orthopaedic consultant who was working solely for a regional health board: that, if he is to teach in a voluntary hospital and also work with a voluntary hospital, they would agree to a special type of selection procedure to which they would give accord and in which the university and the voluntary hospital would be involved as well as the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do it in one of two ways.  The Deputy will accept that the Local Appointments Commission certainly would not agree to any change in the machinery for the appointment of ordinary officers, the kind normally appointed by the Local Appointments Commission to the regional health boards.  If the Deputy wishes, I could put another subsection into this on Report Stage to ensure that we would not even ask the Local Appointments Commission to decide whether or not there should be a change in the method of appointment of officers other than these consultants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 10, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;subject to any <Col N="1299" /> directions in that respect which may be given by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are moving this amendment because we feel that the chief executive officer of a health board should not be excessively inhibited by directions that may be anticipated from the Minister from time to time.  We submit that it is far better that the executive officer of a health board should have authority to exercise his imagination and exercise his own initiative and delegate, internally, in the authority, functions performable by him to another officer, subject to approval by the Minister, rather than waiting for a direction to come from on high from the Department.</P>
    <P>It may appear to be an amendment of no great substance.  We think it changes considerably the tone of administration in a health board.  Quite bluntly, if the chief executive officer and the regional boards are waiting for directions from a Government Department they will never exercise any delegation or initiative in the work they do.  If they are to be perpetually subjected to directions&mdash;and we are all familiar with the kind of omnibus directions which tend to come out to the effect that nothing shall be done until one receives a direction to do so &mdash;it will mean that they do absolutely nothing for the remainder of their term of office.  We feel the onus should be put on the chief executive officer to act in a normal manner and to seek approval.  He should use his initiative and get approval for doing it but should not be subject to this odious phrase &ldquo;ministerial direction&rdquo; because this becomes the cloak for ineffective bureaucracy and ineffective administration where nobody will do anything without such ministerial direction.  Officers will not show their initiative and seek approval for what they intend to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that the Minister will issue a general direction specifying the kind of function which can be delegated and the conditions for delegation.  Under subsection (7) it will be noted that the Minister <Col N="1300" /> will be kept informed of delegations so that he may revise his general directions if experience shows revision is required.  The Minister can send to the chief executive officer a note of the kind of functions which can normally be delegated.  It can be taken for granted that such functions will be comprehensive, such as the grant, but not the refusal, of services under the health Acts.  Such functions could be delegated to the county secretary or to some of the staff officers of the health section.</P>
      <P>Other functions which could be delegated would include the grant, but not the refusal, of the disabled persons maintenance allowance, and the registration of food premises.  These functions could be delegated to the county secretary or to a staff officer, as could the grant of sick or annual leave and the certification of increments.  Such functions could be delegated to the county secretary or staff officer in some cases.  The appointment of servants&mdash; a peculiar phrase which I have never understood but which we have in the legislation&mdash;could be delegated to the county secretary or to some of the staff officers.  If we make a bulk delegation proposal to the chief executive officer in advance it will surely meet the suggestion of the Deputy for avoiding unnecessary red tape.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of subsection (5) was not very clear to me.  It was in anticipation of the possibility of somebody being held responsible for a wrong he did not commit that I made the amendments which I did.  If the Minister would be good enough to explain why it is that the chief executive officer is to be held responsible for an act done by an officer and that even if the delegated officer does something contrary to previous instructions the chief executive <Col N="1301" /> officer is responsible, I will not press the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection as it stands follows the lines of section 17 (5) of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  I think the first amendment would be unnecessary as section 15 (2) (a) of the Bill makes it clear that delegated functions are performed under the general direction and control of the chief executive officer.  Paragraph (b) of the subsection is designed to cover the case where the chief executive officer authorised a payment arising from a decision by another officer to whom he had delegated function. Obviously, where that officer was at fault in his decision he should have been liable to a surcharge as well as the chief executive officer.  If the chief executive officer delegates a function and authorises a payment of a particular kind and the officer to whom he delegates the authority to make that payment makes a mistake he should bear a joint liability with the chief executive officer.  This is a point arising from all the legislation concerned with the levying of surcharges.  Some people in the House may have had prolonged experience of this but I do not think it has caused any great difficulty up to now.  It is incorporated in a similar way in the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  I am sure the Deputy would not want me to read this long document.  It has a very long series of paragraphs relating to surcharging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation.  He does not remove my fears.  It seems that even if it follows the 1955 Act this section could lead to a situation in which an officer acting under a delegation and, perhaps, acting improperly would do a wrong and the chief executive officer would be held responsible.  It does not appear to be right.  I know the general principle in law is that a principal is responsible for the acts of an agent. That should not necessarily apply in the public service.  While certainly I appreciate that under section 15 where delegations are made the officer shall perform the delegated functions under the general direction and control <Col N="1302" /> of the chief executive officer, it is possible that through mistake or deliberate malice or acting quite improperly, and knowingly so, an officer could do wrong and the subsection, as drafted, means that, notwithstanding the fact that the officer was acting contrary to the orders of the chief executive officer, the chief executive officer could be held to be responsible and could be surcharged.  That does not appear to be right as a matter of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Ryan in this.  This is a classic case of Victorian Parliamentary drafting.  I feel that any administrative or chief executive officer inevitably will suffer from permanent schizophrenia if he has to spend the rest of his life wondering if some minor officer of the board has made a mistake.  These boards will cater for over one million people in the eastern region, for instance.  It would be a physical impossibility for the chief executive officer to be given responsibility for a budget of, perhaps, £10 million.  I have no doubt that that figure will increase to £15 million in the eastern regional board.</P>
      <P>Therefore I feel that the Minister is faced with the kind of situation with which one would be faced if, for the sake of argument and I use this purely as an illustration&mdash;it has no other connotation&mdash;a member of the Garda goes berserk and shoots somebody.  One cannot hold the superintendent automatically responsible for the wrong done by the individual.  While there must be delegated responsibility, this is a Victorian, nineteenth century concept of administration, what I would call financial crucifixion by the imposition on people of this kind of concept.  The Minister should seriously reconsider it.  I do not know where we will chase a chief executive officer if somebody walks off into the night with a half million pounds.  The courts of law are there for that kind of thing.</P>

      <P>I hope we will not get into a long argument about surcharge legislation because my experience is that there is an appeal to the Minister in regard to a surcharge. It is made by an auditor and the auditor can exercise his discretion to <Col N="1303" /> some extent.

      <P>Before I express a view in relation to this amendment I should like to say that I was amused by what the Minister said about appeals to the Minister in the case of surcharge.  I recently met an ex-member of a local authority who told me that six months after being a member of the local authority he was amused to get a letter from the Minister for Local Government saying that he had decided in a certain case not to surcharge him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21a.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 11, line 13, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, other than the Eastern Health Board,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to say before I speak on this that, on rechecking, I found that amendment No. 21(b) could stand without reference to section 18 of the Health Authorities Act.  The last lines of the amendment read &ldquo;...in the same way as they applied to the Chief Executive Officer under section 18 of the Health Authorities Act, 1960, and shall not apply otherwise&rdquo;.  When I rechecked I found that this really applies to the delegation by the city and county managers of certain responsibilities to the CEO of the health authority and it does not really arise here.  The amendment is better without it.</P>
      <P>My reasons for moving this amendment are twofold.  In the first place the members of the Dublin Health Authority are perfectly satisfied and happy with the present system and feel that this type of administration should remain.  I am asking that it be continued in the amendment I have tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as far as the Eastern Health Board are concerned, the system proposed in the Bill would be altogether inappropriate.  It unnecessarily complicates the administration <Col N="1305" /> of services which are already complicated enough.  I believe too that the proposed system would impede the progress rather than foster the development of the services and it is the object of this Bill to promote the services.</P>
    <P>I have considerable experience of the present system because I had the honour of being elected the first chairman of the Dublin Health Authority in 1960.  I was there for all the teething troubles.  I greatly fear that this legislation is framed in such a way that it would be quite impossible for the members to carry the responsibilities, give the directions and make the decisions that would be required of them in a very large administrative area such as we have proposed in the eastern region.  It would be utterly impossible unless the CEO continued to have the responsibilities he has at present.  Because of the volume of work, the population and area to be covered, the number of employees involved&mdash;about 6,000&mdash;and the vast number of decisions to be made daily, I do not think it would be possible for elected representatives to carry out these responsibilities and to give the directions and make the decisions that are indicated here.  I do not know what is the reason for this type of dual administration. It is not spelt out at all in the same way as it was under the County Management Acts.  It is very difficult to decide what in fact are the responsibilities, under this, of the CEO and what are the responsibilities of the elected representatives.  I am concerned only with the Eastern Health Board.  At the moment Dublin Health Authority cater for approximately a quarter of the population and under the changes whereby Kildare and Wicklow will be added we will be catering for approximately one-third of the population. This is an enormous area and there are an enormous number of decisions to be made every day.  I know there is provision in this for sub-committees to be set up and for certain responsibilities to be delegated to these sub-committees. But no matter how it is fragmented there will still be an enormous problem.  Before anyone can make a decision there will have to be <Col N="1306" /> a meeting and endless discussion and endless controversy unless the CEO gets powers similar to those given to him under the Health Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons mainly, and from the experience we have had, that I move this amendment.  This Bill proposes fundamental changes in the health services.  Surely this is not the time for bringing in an untried administrative system and replacing something which has stood the test of time and which has worked extremely well since 1960.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann favours the establishment of a comprehensive national pensions scheme, based upon insurance contributions by all persons with income, to create an adequate system of social security to provide for people in old age, sickness, disability, unemployment and for dependants on death.</P>
      <P>I am introducing this motion because I believe it would be a very good thing for the whole country.  I believe at the moment we have employers and unions who are very much in favour of this.  A worker who has worked all his life at whatever trade he is in, who has given good service to his employer&mdash;although admittedly he has worked for himself and has provided for his family by doing so&mdash;should be rewarded when he retires and should not have to beg for money.  At the moment when a person reaches retiring age and there is no pension for him from his employer he has to depend on the Government to give him the old age pension or some social welfare benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the people who are retiring now started their working careers in the 1930s or late 1920s.  At the time they began work there were very few pension schemes.  Those people when they have to depend on a pension from the Government&mdash;I am not speaking specifically about the present <Col N="1307" /> Government&mdash;feel very aggrieved about it.  In many cases they are too proud to collect this money.  Any person who has worked 30 or 40 years has a right to a pension and should not have to beg for it but that is what it comes to at present.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has been asked to make representations to the Government or the Minister for Social Welfare to see if an extra 5/- or 2/6d, can be given to a particular person.  If there was a regulation that person would know what he was entitled to and would not have to come to a Deputy or anybody else to get this money. Take a worker who is paying PAYE. He is paying that, in actual fact, for people who are now drawing social welfare benefits.  Eventually when he comes to retiring age he will be paid social welfare benefits by the Government from money collected from people who are then working.  A citizen is more independent and makes a better citizen if he can get a pension to which he is entitled rather than having to feel he is living on charity, even though he had paid in that money beforehand.</P>
    <P>I know many of those people may have been able to put money aside during their working years and may be able to provide for themselves, but there are many others who have not been able to do so.  Many workers have not been in good health during their working life and they have also had large families to take care of. When they come to retiring age they have no money laid aside and if they do not get a pension from their employers they have to depend on the Government.  Sometimes the Government's priorities can be motivated by a general election.  At that time they will announce an increase for social welfare recipients but those people often have to wait many months before they get that money.</P>
    <P>In England recently there was an announcement that a person who received a retirement pension would get a rise every year, not necessarily when there was an increase in the cost of living.  This means the pension there will go up gradually.  In this country <Col N="1308" /> at the moment there are many people living in poverty because their old age pension is too small.  Their families are not able to help them because they have their own families to look after and they have their own commitments. One may ask why did those old people not save while they were young?  It is practically impossible for workers to save while rearing their families. Very often those people have to contend with illness or strikes and this eats into any small amount they may have laid aside.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour are involved in this matter too.  For the last few years we have had leapfrogging in wages.  We have had one group getting an extra 10/-, the next getting an extra £1 and so it goes on from that.  I said when speaking on the Labour Estimate that I felt all increases should occur in one or two months in the year and there should be freedom from increases for the rest of the year.  We also had the unions bringing in a productivity clause whereby a worker was given a productivity bonus.  This also caused leapfrogging as some workers received a bigger bonus than others.</P>
    <P>We should bring in a national pension scheme at this stage.  If this is not done we will have one employer or group of employers giving a pension and then another group giving a better pension and leapfrogging will also occur here.  If a national pension scheme was brought in by the Government it would prevent this leapfrogging. I can tell the House that most employers are pro pension schemes and so also are the unions, but the trouble is that no-one wants to start off because when a pension scheme is granted it means the cost has to be paid for in some way and it must be tied in to a wage increase.  The Government should say: &ldquo;We will have a national pension scheme.&rdquo;  The employers and the unions would then accept this.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it happens that a man is not willing to put anything aside for his family for an emergency, perhaps because of ill-health.  In a case like this, if there was a national pension scheme, he would be subscribing to it as well as his employer and he would then leave something to his wife and family. <Col N="1309" /> I advocate that the widow should be able to take over the pension if he died when he was young.</P>
    <P>Recently I because aware of the case of a man who worked for a firm which had a pension scheme.  He left that firm to take up a better position in another firm which did not have a pension scheme.  Later, he went back to the original firm but by the time he died, at the age of 38, he had only two years participation in the pension scheme.  He left his wife and seven children without anything.  Because of the big family, he could not save during his lifetime. There should be something on a national scale to cover cases like that.</P>
    <P>Of course, private pension schemes tend to put up costs in the industries concerned.  It is vital for a worker to have a pension to look forward to.  It is not as important as owning his own house but is it more important than owning a block of shares which can go up or down in value.  A man must provide that when he reaches old age there will be something of which he can be sure, something that will not disappear.  It may be devalued by inflation, but it is something certain.</P>
    <P>Many small firms cannot afford pension schemes.  It is too expensive for them to go to insurance companies. The big firms who have a bigger number of workers have a great advantage in this respect.  They can even attract workers from the smaller firms and in the process put these firms out of business.  It has been pointed out that we require larger units in industry because of the imminence of EEC entry but the breaking up of our smaller industrial units would not do any good to the country.</P>
    <P>If a worker participates in a pension scheme he has less worry, apart from the rearing and educating of his children, and he is therefore able to work better.  Many of us occasionally get a pain in our left side and think we are about to get a heart attack.  If a working man continually has to think of his old age and worries about it he is more likely to get a heart attack than if he had a pension to look forward to in his old age.</P>
    <P>Most salary earners in this country have pension schemes but many wage <Col N="1310" /> earners have not.  Latterly, the latter type of worker has been participating gradually in pension schemes but there is nothing definite or comprehensive about them.  Trade unions have so much work to do otherwise that they cannot be expected to go around to every individual in an effort to organise pension schemes.  Therefore, the institution of a comprehensive national scheme devolves on the Government. One of the first things that should be done in such a national scheme would be to bring salary earners and wage earners closer together in the matter of benefits and payments.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word at this point about secondary teachers.  It is only after 40 years of service that secondary teachers are entitled to get the equivalent of half their salaries by way of pension.  Forty years is a long time to have to wait to get a pension of half one's salary.  It should be possible to have a shorter period.  Some people prefer pensions for workers along the lines of percentage profit sharing.  It means that a man can earn a bigger amount initially and taper off as he grows older and as he works less.  I prefer this method of compensating people as they grow older&mdash;a simple tapering off of the amount of their wages or salaries.  I know this is not feasible at the moment and therefore the alternative is a State pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the scheme I have in mind is a comprehensive one based on contributions from employers and employees.  The contributions should be on a fixed percentage of salaries or wages, not on a flat rate.  In this respect it is interesting to note that the only countries in Western Europe which believe in a flat rate are Ireland and England.  The comprehensive scheme of which I speak, from the contribution point of view, could be based on the PAYE system.  It should embrace all workers and it should supersede present State pension schemes.  There should be special provisions for unemployable people, people who are unable to work for physical or mental reasons.  There should be provision to enable the wife to take over the pension.  Usually there are three or four children and <Col N="1311" /> the widow has to provide for them after the husband's death.  If she goes to work the children are out on the road, which causes the State quite a lot of money either in prosecuting them, or prosecuting the mother for neglecting them.  I feel she should get the whole pension.  If necessary, at this stage portion of the money required should be found by the Government because if she had not the full pension she would have to get a widow's pension including a sum for the children.  Otherwise, the fund would operate itself.  We are not like England where there is full employment and they have not much emigration.  We should provide, too, for broken periods of employment&mdash;where there is emigration and subsequent return, for example.  In a local government scheme if you work 200 days it counts as a year and again this should come into it.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise my belief that a national pension scheme must coincide with wages.  Something which happened here has been rectified in the Finance Act: men who went out on pensions 20 years ago were still getting the same pensions even though the spending power of their money had decreased by between 50 and 100 per cent.  There should be an increase every two years or so in the pension.  In England, it was suggested that instead of a 50 per cent pension, a 36 per cent pension on the average of the years worked should be given and this is what they have done.  When you are two years retired they take the next two years as if you worked, add it to the total, and take the average again.  In this way the pension is gradually going up.  You are not fully covering inflation but you are doing so to some extent.  There may be some reluctance to reduce the figure from 50 per cent to 36 per cent but when a man retires he usually gets a lump sum, or has something saved, and he can manage for a couple of years.  His big trouble occurs ten or 12 years later because of inflation throughout the world and here in particular.  If he got some increase in his pension over a period of years it would be worth sacrificing the first few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> Female employees should have the right to a refund of contributions on marriage and I would favour that being tied to a clause whereby this money would be paid to them if they are putting it into a house with a view to getting married.  This might save a lot of money in loans and so on.  They should be allowed to do this provided the money is not just taken out and blown.  No income tax should be levied on pension payments because, as I shall show later, most of this money can be used by the Government for expansion, at the cost of paying interest on it, of course.</P>
    <P>One result of this which most people would favour would be that it would take spending power away from people in their teens, from 18 to 22, and would transfer it to an older group. Very often much of the money spent when we are young is wasted while money is badly needed for older people.  This money should be invested in national production.  The Minister for Finance said that by 1980 we wanted full employment and that to this end we wanted profits and savings re-invested.  This would be a case of savings and it could do a great deal for the country.</P>
    <P>I should also like sickness and unemployment benefits to be in some way tied to this pension scheme.  At present a person who is earning pays income tax which is collected by the Government and then paid out to old people who may be taken as retired people. All I seek to do is to ensure that people at present working provide for their future and that they should now have a pension scheme.  The Government would gain by this through having less need for social services in the future for retired people who will be covered by their pension.  There will be some, perhaps, in dire circumstances who will need assistance but generally they will be able to provide for themselves by means of their pensions.</P>
    <P>If a girl were allowed to withdraw her payments on marriage and put them towards her house, fewer local authority houses would be required. If a girl and her fiancé were buying a small dwelling they would have a bigger deposit to put down and smaller <Col N="1313" /> repayments to meet later.  Meantime, the Government could use this money, pay interest on it, or put it into a national loan which would provide badly needed capital.  If one reads the papers this evening and sees the wage increases that are being demanded one cannot imagine how it will end, but a pension scheme of this kind will, I believe, prevent much of the inflation that the Ministers for Finance and Labour have been speaking about.  It would comply with the exhortation of the Minister for Finance in that this money in conjunction with profits and investment from abroad, would help to provide more jobs which are needed if we are to reach full employment by 1980.</P>
    <P>In future years when this pension scheme would be in operation and the new workers would be paying towards it, the money that is now collected under PAYE to pay for social welfare benefits or old age pensions would be available for some other use.  If today every old person had 50 per cent of his salary as a pension we would not require the same Government subsidies for houses for old people or free turf or other free services.  They would have sufficient money for their needs if they had that pension.  This would also save the Government money and it would also save the cost of administration which is tremendous.</P>
    <P>Much bureaucracy would go if this pension scheme were introduced and it would tend to make better citizens when people could get something by right and not have to beg for it.  We would need fewer homes for old people and county homes and other such institutions would disappear if these people had pensions.  Today they must go to such places because they are destitute. It is terrible that we should have people destitute because whatever they get in old age pensions is absorbed to the extent of about half or two-thirds by the hospital or institution which houses them.  If they had a proper pension the Government would not have the problem of the upkeep of these homes where the cost is about £20 per patient.  Perhaps that figure might not apply to homes.  In a hospital the cost <Col N="1314" /> would be £20 and in a home it might be £14 or £15.  They should be able to keep themselves and have a sufficiently large pension to manage on.  Some of the patients in these homes have to have hospitalisation of some sort.  In years to come we will not have the same numbers in the religious communities to maintain these homes because there are fewer vocations nowadays and fewer people going into convents.</P>
    <P>We should have a national pension scheme.  Men should now provide for the future rather than having to beg&mdash; perhaps, that is a strong word&mdash;from the Government for something to exist on rather than starving.  Some of them depend on their sons and daughters but, at times, their sons and daughters cannot afford to give them anything. They should have this pension as of right and not have to beg me and other Deputies: &ldquo;Get me another 2/-.  I need it.  If I do not get it I will have to do without a piece of meat this week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the long run it would cost the Government less.  It may raise costs slightly, but only minimally.  Very often it could be tied in with wage agreements.  A worker at 20 years of age is not interested in a pension because he does not think he will ever be old, but a married man of 34 years certainly thinks of a pension scheme.  A pension scheme like this would help us in industrial relations and would help us to feel reasonably happy with ourselves.</P>

      <P>That in view of the present housing crisis where thousands of families cannot anticipate being housed for many years, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to declare a national housing emergency with the objective of directing the necessary men, money and materials to the building of houses in order that the fundamental right to normal family life can be assured for all our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this motion on behalf of the Labour Party because <Col N="1316" /> we feel that the Fianna Fáil Government have paid little or no attention to the housing needs of our people.  In fact, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the housing record of the Government is the worst in Europe. The Minister has attempted by devious means to deprive us of the necessary information so that we can assess the national housing needs.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister if he would spell out in regard to Dublin city alone the number of people on the housing list, and if he would state the number of families with one child, two children, three children, four children and more on the housing list.  I asked that question last week and the Minister tried to hoodwink me.  He said that the latest figures available to him were given &ldquo;in reply to a question by the Deputy on 19th February, 1969&rdquo;.  I want to know who does the Minister think he is fooling when he gives that reply in the middle of November?  This is the Minister in charge of housing and he says this is the only information he can supply to the Deputy.  He can play around with all sorts of devious methods.  He can say that is not the function of his Department but the function of Dublin Corporation.  Let us not be hoodwinked by him any longer.</P>
      <P>We know he dissolved Dublin Corporation and appointed a commissioner. We know that the commissioner takes orders from the Minister and is fully responsible to him, and must make all this information available to him.  I now suggest that the Minister refused to give this information because he realises we have a housing crisis on our hands and does not want that fact to be known to the public.  Deputies of the Minister's own party in Dublin city are inundated with requests for housing, from people coming to them with their problems. Husbands and wives are separated through no fault of their own.  I could go into so many details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have actually written to the Arch-bishop of Dublin explaining the situation to him in which we have mixed adult families living in one room.  I brought this to the attention of the Archbishop of Dublin because of the fact that on moral grounds alone it <Col N="1317" /> should be forbidden.  The Archbishop's secretary replied to me stating that he has often tried to bring this fact to the attention of Dublin Corporation and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is no housing crisis but I maintain that there is a housing crisis, and a very, very serious crisis.  It is a damning indictment of the Government that they permit money to be spent on office blocks and luxury dwellings while people are in real need of housing.  I heard a question asked today about squatting in Dublin.  I do not condone squatting; people jumping the queue like that could create chaos and anarchy, However, one man said to me: &ldquo;The first law is for me to provide a roof for my wife and children.  I will not listen to you or to anyone when I find myself homeless.  I am not going to walk the streets with three children, when Dublin Corporation are unable to house me.&rdquo;  I do not judge what he felt was right.  I cannot do so.  I am saying we must divert money from office blocks and direct this money, men and materials, into a crash housing programme.</P>
    <P>I maintain there are 10,000 families on our Dublin Corporation housing list. This is the priority waiting list and excludes couples with no families who are not even considered for inclusion on the waiting list of Dublin Corporation. Not only will the Minister not help these people but he penalises them when they must become sub-tenants in Dublin Corporation houses.  A year or two ago he imposed an extra penalty on the tenants of these houses for having these people as sub-tenants, and his excuse is: &ldquo;We do not want to make slums of the Dublin Corporation houses.&rdquo;  This was a farce.  People are not living in over-crowded conditions because they want to.  Everyone knows that in-laws cannot agree and no girl will move into the house of her mother-in-law of her own volition.  She wants a place of her own where she can rear her family.  This is being denied to her at the present time.</P>
    <P>When she cannot be considered by Dublin Corporation she tries to find the deposit for a house.  I looked into this <Col N="1318" /> question and I found that you need £1,000 deposit before you can get a house in or around Dublin city.  The normal wage is £13 to £15 a week. How could a person save £1,000 deposit for a house from that?  £1,000 deposit is being asked because this same Minister for Local Government has allowed speculation to occur in land and this has been responsible for the rise in the cost of houses.  Not only can people not raise the deposit but their incomes will not suffice to permit them to obtain a loan from building societies.</P>
    <P>I had a letter yesterday from a man who tried to obtain a loan from Dublin Corporation for the purchase of a house.  He said it seemed as if he was looking for charity from all the difficulties and obstacles that were put in his way.  No building society will accept anyone for a loan unless he has £25 to £30 a week.  Most people cannot provide evidence of having £25 to £30 a week, and in any case the exorbitant rate of interest would make it impossible for them to make the repayments on a house.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation had a draw recently for 500 purchase houses.  They had thousands of applicants, people who thought they might be lucky enough in this draw to buy their own house.  They were told, and I read this myself, that the deposit would be £175 to £200.  When the draw takes place we find that the initial deposit is to be £495 for a semi-detached house and the interest rate is to be very much higher. This makes it absolutely impossible, because, as I worked it out, the repayments on this house, including rates and ground rent, would be from £8 to £9 a week.  A person with £15 a week could not pay half his earnings in the form of repayments for his house.  It shows how anxious these people are to buy their own houses, but they are deprived of this means to do so.  They must depend on Dublin Corporation, and they are getting no encouragement. There is nothing to replace the Ballymun scheme, the one scheme that did help by providing 3,000 flats.  The only big housing project in Dublin city at the moment is at Emmet Road, Inchicore, and this will provide 300 flats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> I am challenging the Minister to say exactly how soon the present housing list will be cleared.  Let us not talk about grandiose schemes that never seem to come to fruition.  Let us talk about a major crash programme that will ensure that people are housed within the next six to 12 months.  I read quite recently that our public housing programme is the worst of any country in Europe, so the Minister cannot say that the local authorities are doing this or doing that.  The Fianna Fáil Government's record in housing is deplorable.  The Fianna Fáil Government do not want the people housed.  They are permitting the money to be directed into office blocks.</P>

      <P>The sooner the Minister realises that the people will not tolerate this situation any longer the better, allowing money to be diverted into office blocks and luxury buildings while people are homeless.  Years ago there were tenement houses with rooms to spare for these people.  Even these are not available today and people are expected to pay £7 a week for furnished flats with no fixity of tenure and no rent control.  When my colleague, the late Deputy Seán Dunne, asked the Minister to consider some form of rent control, he laughed at the idea and said no, he would not.  Sometimes people cannot remain in a furnished <Col N="1320" /> room because once a baby is born they get notice of eviction.  I am only explaining what is happening in Dublin city, but this exists also in other towns throughout the country, and the Minister knows this.</P>
      <P>Are we going to allow this situation to continue?  Are we going to allow land speculation?  Are we going to create a situation in which we shall have more and more emigration, because this is the only answer to these people's problems?  I talk about them as the homeless people, because they are constantly moving from one inlaw's place to another.  They have no opportunity of buying their own house and they get no consideration from Dublin Corporation.  When I asked Dublin Corporation would they supply copies of a booklet explaining the scheme of letting priorities I was told, first of all, that this little booklet was available in every public library in Dublin for the benefit and information of people.  When I phoned every public library I found that none of them had heard of it.  I was finally told that it was too costly to provide this and when I questioned further I was told if the book was made available to the people they would come down demanding their rights.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister for Local Government to appoint an information officer to provide regular information on the housing situation in Dublin, but it has been put on the long finger, and no information is available.  We have no direct access to Dublin Corporation which provides the housing.  There are no proper details about what the housing plans are and how soon the present housing list will be completed because the Minister has appointed a commissioner, responsible to him alone, with no responsibility to the public or to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to declare a housing emergency and to nationalise land in order that we may have serviced land available just outside the city.  There are a lot of derelict sites around the city and I do not know what is going to happen to them.  We see houses being demolished&mdash;we were very late in bringing in an amendment to prevent the unnecessary demolition <Col N="1321" /> of houses&mdash;and office blocks being built in their place.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider some form of subsidisation to enable people to buy a house by providing loans at a low rate of interest. I would ask the Minister for flats to be provided in the centre of the city, and to stop the building of office blocks until our housing problem has been solved.  I do not think that is too much to ask.  The Minister for Labour spoke recently about our emigrants coming home but I would ask, &ldquo;How could they possibly do this if we cannot house the people who are at present in the country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure my colleagues in the Labour Party, who come from the rural areas, will have a few words to say about the situation which exists around the country, I am speaking for Dublin alone.  I see it twice weekly, I hear the problems and I feel frustrated that nothing can be done.  When I am asked if there is any hope I have to tell these people that they have a better chance of winning the sweep twice than they have of getting a Dublin Corporation house at the present time. That is not a nice thing to have to say to people who find themselves homeless. I have tried to think of how they could raise the deposit or obtain a loan but it is impossible with their incomes. We cannot go on telling people that they cannot get a house or a flat in their own country.  When they say, &ldquo;We will have to emigrate&rdquo; I have to say, &ldquo;Well, there is nothing else for you to do because there is nothing we can do for you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister is sincere and anxious to do something about the housing situation he should declare a housing emergency and divert the money being spent on new office blocks into new houses.  He should stand up and say, &ldquo;We will tackle this problem and have it cleared up within one year&rdquo; so that the people on the present Dublin Corporation list can be assured that something will be done for them and will have some hope that they will get a house in the near future.</P>

      <P>When discussing the housing problems of the country one would think Deputies would make themselves aware of the facts.  A lot of unnecessary suffering has been caused to people in need of proper housing by people inside and outside this House play-acting, and it makes no contribution at all towards a housing solution. The last speaker showed a total ignorance of the facts.  On this motion the Labour Party are seeking the direction of labour and this is a new departure on their part.  This has always gone on, to my mind, in totalitarian countries or in democratic countries during wartime, but here we have the Labour Party wanting to direct labour, wanting to tell men where they will work and what they will work at.  I wonder what the reactions of the trade unions will be when they see this.  I am speaking as a city Deputy and to suggest that a Dublin building worker, who is doing a very fine job indeed in helping to ease the situation, could be told where he is going to work means that people in here are playing politics.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the fact that people have said they would have to emigrate if they did not have houses.  Our main problem today is not the people who are emigrating but the people who are coming back in great numbers because of the improvements in the economy.  Many of these people emigrated as far back as 1956 during a time when Dublin had no housing problem at all.  Dublin Corporation had 1,500 vacant dwellings that year because the building workers had emigrated as there was no employment for them.  That may be the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party solution to a housing problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to dwell too much on the last Government because if the wages of sin is death the wages of a coalition Government is a big housing shortage.  They made such a terrible blunder in office that they drove the building workers out of the country, as Deputy Ryan knows. The rot set in in 1956; our people <Col N="1323" /> started to move out and when the Fianna Fáil Government came back in 1957 they had to take measures to put the economy back on an even keel in an effort to keep our workers here and bring others back from across the channel.  The year 1959 was not the best for housing, but it took more than two years to repair the almost irreparable damage which Fine Gael and Labour had done to the country.  I have since heard Fine Gael Deputies boast that when they left office we had too many houses but we have had to correct them on that point and remind them that they had too few people, because that was the case.  It has been said before by wiser men than me that a growing city will always have a housing problem and that only a dying city has no problem.  I would remind Deputy Ryan that in 1957 we had no housing problem because we had a dying city but that is all changed now.  Thanks to the success of the Government's policy in keeping our workers here, emigration has fallen and the population of the city continues to rise. Therefore, there will be trouble in regard to housing every family that needs housing. Dublin Corporation, either under a city council or a commissioner, press ahead all the time, with the full backing of the Ministers, and take all possible measures to provide a dwelling for every person who needs one and who qualifies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk here about the waiting list.  The approved waiting list of Dublin Corporation is about 4,500.  I do not accept this list. In my view there are many more than that number in need of housing. According to the bye-laws and the priority scheme drawn up by Members of this House who were members of Dublin Corporation, that is the approved list.  I would say that at the moment we need about 8,000 dwellings in order to end the immediate problem but even if we could get this number, the problem would be by no means solved because the population grows all the time and our people, thank God, are coming back from abroad <Col N="1324" /> because we can give the vast majority good employment and eventually, we hope, good housing.</P>
    <P>In order to have a proper housing drive, money must be available.  One may talk about nationalising land, as the Labour Party do in this motion. What would they do?  Change the name on the top of the notepaper, or something?  The fact is that the building industry at the moment is building to its full capacity.  If the Labour Party want penal measures taken against workers in the building trade, to direct them as to what work they should do, they will meet with great opposition from building operatives, carpenters, plumbers, builders and the rest.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to office building.  Part of the housing problem involves the accommodation of persons at their place of employment.  We must try to get a balance, first by ensuring that the money is there for house building and, secondly, by giving housing top priority.  The Deputy will recall that in the last Budget the Minister for Finance put a levy on office building.  That is a much better approach than trying to regiment labour and directing them as to where they should work&mdash;or else.  That is a horrible approach.  Any man, whether he is in public life or not, will agree that a family that needs housing accommodation must be helped every inch of the way.</P>
    <P>While I do not think we will ever solve the problem of housing in Dublin, because in a growing city it is impossible to do so, we can be quite sure from reading the Government's White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> that the problem will be reduced to the minimum in the next few years.  Having regard to the fact that Dublin Corporation have under construction or in course of preparation roughly 4,000 dwellings&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;and that the housing waiting list is just over 4,000, it would seem as if the problem is solved but we do not accept the approved waiting list; there are other people who must be housed. Therefore, in the next five years Dublin Corporation will build or help to provide by way of loans and otherwise roughly 19,000 dwellings.  Therefore, <Col N="1325" /> we are catering for those on the waiting list, both approved and unapproved and taking into account the natural increase in the population and the fact that emigrants are returning.  There is no need to be downhearted about our programme.</P>
    <P>We all deplore the fact that we cannot proceed more rapidly.  At the moment there is over-employment in the building industry and even if we had all the money and all the land required it would be impossible to get one extra house built unless more building operatives could be enticed back, principally from England, to play their part in the housing drive.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party seem to be under the influence of certain groups in this city who call continuously for a crash programme.  I often wish that they would explain what they mean by a crash programme.  The programme that Fine Gael and Labour introduced certinly crashed down on housing and brought the economy crashing down also.  Silly platitudes and shibboleths are used but the only way to solve the housing problem is by a serious study of needs and by having a viable economy so that money can be provided to pay the workers, to acquire the land and otherwise to ensure a steady rate of building.  This cry of &ldquo;crash programme&rdquo; is utterly ridiculous. It was thought up by people outside this House and repeated on every platform by agitators and, eventually, in this House.</P>
    <P>This is the Parliament of the nation. We expect that Deputies returned here would give some serious thought to such a serious problem.  It may look well in print or sound well on television to call for a crash programme and just leave it at that.  This is completely dishonest.  Unless a party like the Labour Party give serious thought to this whole matter they should leave it alone.  Housing is far too important a matter for Labour Party gimmicks. This motion is only a gimmick.  It will not increase by one room the housing stock in this city.  I do not mind a family who are seeking a house agitating for one.  I do not mind a father who sees his children living in cramped conditions badgering his <Col N="1326" /> Deputy, here or outside, to try to get a house for him.  This is understandable. One has to understand the feelings of these people before one can help them.</P>
    <P>A few months ago, when the Dublin City Council was in being, when the members of that housing authority went to attend meetings to discuss housing and allied matters, some of us were beaten up by some of the thugs outside.  It was not alone the Fianna Fáil members, but members of the Labour Party, who were beaten up by those people and but for the guards there would have been serious injury inflicted on the members of Dublin City Council.  This should make people think.  The members of the council were voluntary members.  I would say that the Labour Party members played as big a part as we or Fine Gael did on the council.  They were assaulted outside the City Hall in the name of a housing drive and a call for a crash programme.  As I have said, it is understandable if a man who sees his family in bad housing conditions should agitate.  I am all for his agitating.  However, I want to tell those well-educated people, the do-gooders of this city, who want to be on the bandwagon and who make silly speeches on housing, and all the new intellectuals we have in the groups agitating for housing, that I welcome their late recognition of the fact that this city needs more dwellings. One man who sounds off very often now on the need for more housing stated at one time, when asked what he had done, that he had once written a letter to Dublin Corporation on behalf of an applicant for housing.  I am sure they got that letter in the corporation, a letter showing his deep concern for these people.</P>
    <P>Housing should not be any part of politics.  It is wrong, immoral, unethical &mdash;any word you like&mdash;to try to make political capital out of a housing shortage.  There are experienced Deputies in the Labour Party, some of whom have helped in the housing drive.  It is difficult to associate these more experienced members with this gibberish about nationalisation of land.  The corporation has full power to acquire any land they want for building.  All they <Col N="1327" /> need do is slap on a compulsory purchase order.  There has been talk about directing people where they should work.  Now we are coming to confiscation of property.  This sort of approach shows the paucity of interest the party has in this problem.  I believe this motion will do more harm to the Labour Party than any words of mine. We could tomorrow nationalise land and direct labour, but that would not result in increasing the housing stock by even one dwelling.  Housing is largely a matter of tears and toil and sweat.  The only way one can solve the problem is by providing more houses. That may be a truism, but it is something we must get over to those in the Labour Party who are trying to make political capital, for their own fell purposes, out of the housing situation.</P>
    <P>Never before in our history have so many houses been built.  Never before was there such a demand for houses.  I heard Deputy Dr. O'Connell bewailing the fact that the Dublin tenements have disappeared.  I say: &ldquo;Thank God they have disappeared.&rdquo;  It was Fianna Fáil who decided to sweep away the hovels in this city and give the people proper housing accommodation.  If Deputy Dr. O'Connell had his way, he would have men living with their wives and families in a tenement room.  It was to get rid of tenements that successive Fianna Fáil Governments pressed forward with the housing drive. Despite the fact that the population is increasing naturally and by the return of emigrants the housing situation is not getting worse.  All the time there is material improvement.  Had the Government not built up the economy we would not have had the money to build houses.  We would be in the position the country was in in 1956 when the Government at the time had no housing problem because the people had left the country.  We will not accept emigration as a solution to our housing problem. That is not the way we will solve the problem.  We will solve it by intelligently planning our resources in both men and material.  We want to eradicate the evil of bad housing.  I would put housing at the top of the list of priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Later in this debate we may get some rational suggestions from the Labour Party on the housing problem, but I must take Deputy Dr. O'Connell to task for his statement that we have the worst building record in Europe. Comparisons are odious; in this particular instance they are worse than odious.  Nowhere in Europe in a country of comparable size will you get such a splendid building record as we have here.  Grants are provided by the Government, not alone for new dwellings but for the repair and renovation of existing dwellings.  I think this motion was tabled at the instigation of some outside groups because some of the wording is reminiscent of what one sees on placards or hears shouted from platforms.  I do not care how often and how long people agitate but would these groups follow the example of the Catholic Housing Aid Society and the Methodist Church?  In Gardiner Street you have an example of the work of the Catholic Housing Aid Society and in Sandymount you have an example of the work of the Methodist Church.  These are voluntary bodies with a Christian approach. Instead of belabouring the Government and the corporation they set themselves the task of collecting money to provide housing for the aged.  In the usual way the people of Dublin responded generously to their appeals. This is the headline the agitators should follow.  These voluntary groups supplement the efforts of the corporation. The Minister provides a grant of £600 to anyone prepared to house an old person.  These agitators should become involved personally in a positive way in the housing drive.  I believe that Dublin will one day have the name of having the best housing of any country of comparable size.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that people said they would emigrate if they did not get a house.  I do not suggest he was not telling the truth, but why emigrate?  There is a rude awakening awaiting those who emigrate in the belief that they will find a house waiting for them elsewhere.  The citizens of London are sleeping in public service vehicles because they have no homes.  I am not criticising the <Col N="1329" /> authorities there&mdash;they have a problem&mdash;but I am suggesting emigration is not a solution to the housing shortage here and it is not a solution a Fianna Fáil Government would accept.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan is rather good at speaking on housing but not at putting any practical suggestions into effect.  As I said a moment ago, apart from building new dwellings we want to conserve present dwellings.  We also want to involve all we possibly can in the housing drive.  That is why the Government provide financial assistance to a local authority.  I think they pay two-thirds of the capital cost in the case of Dublin Corporation.  In addition, last year, the Minister gave Dublin Corporation an extra £1 million to acquire land so that the land problem would not hold up the building drive.  We can well see now that it is not holding it up.  It is very obvious that this Government are making a big effort to reduce to minimum proportions the Dublin housing problem.</P>
      <P>Resolutions or motions in this House will not solve the housing problem and are just empty platitudes.  It is not sufficient for the Labour Party to say that they proposed a resolution in this House in relation to the housing problem. The proposing and opposing of resolutions here can be something of a national pastime.  It is too serious a problem to debate in the abstract.  Discussion alone will not end the housing problem.  Only hard work from the Government and going down right through all the various sectors in the building industry and trade in the country will bring us to the point where we can say we have reduced the housing problem to its lowest degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was criticised for saying that a growing city will always have a housing problem.  So long as our people marry younger&mdash;we are glad of this&mdash; and demand higher standards of housing <Col N="1330" /> which we welcome, we shall have a housing problem.  We want to ensure that every family will have adequate shelter: I am not interested in luxurious homes and that sort of thing. A family is entitled to live in proper conditions.  I hope to live to see the day when people seeking houses will not have to approach a Deputy or a councillor to inquire about their chances.  I hope to live to see the day when we can say: &ldquo;The housing list is now at this figure and we shall build that many dwellings this year.&rdquo;</P>

The appalling thing, of course, is the discrimination in their allocation.  Bad and all as we are, we do not discriminate so far as the distribution of houses is concerned.  The fact is, however, that we are building one-quarter of the number of houses they are building in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>At no time in the history of this State have there been fewer than 5,000 families on the waiting list. In 1956 there were 5,000 families on the waiting list.  The experts' advice to the Government of the day was that the housing problem was solved.  This appeared on the White Paper published by Fianna Fáil when they got back into office.  They said the housing problem had been solved&mdash;and that <Col N="1333" /> has been their attitude for the past 12 years.  They considered that the problem had solved itself and, therefore, the output of houses was reduced to one-tenth of what it had been in the days when the housing of the people was considered to be more important by the inter-Party Government than lining the pockets of the wealthy people of this country.  Only a few weeks before the last general election, a member of Taca said to me that he hoped that, if Fine Gael got back into power, they would not go crazy on housing because, if they did, it would upset the economy and many people would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Deputy Clinton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break for Private Members' Time I was making the case that the system of administration which I was urging to have continued had stood the test of time both in health and local government matters and that, if anything was wrong with this system, it was made more democratic by the Local Government Act, 1955, which gave the members the power to have recourse to section 4 and intervene in what was normally regarded as the manager's business and responsibility.  We know that system has worked well.  Nobody has complained about it.  Every member of the Dublin Health Authority was, in the main, satisfied with this. The Dublin Health Authority is a very large health authority.  It administers no less than 12 large-scale institutions, <Col N="1334" /> one of these being the largest general hospital in the State.  It also administers two psychiatric hospitals, St. Kevin's and St. Ita's.  When the area is enlarged there will be at least six more such institutions brought under the direct control of the eastern board.  There is no doubt but that the system of direct control by the members, where all the decisions have to be made and day-to-day directions given, will become unworkable.  I know this responsibility can be delegated to sub-committees, but I believe the Minister is against this sort of thing.  The Maud Report in England advocates a system of administration which follows very closely the system we are advocating in this amendment and which has been acceptable, in the main, in the County Management Acts over the years.  The Devlin Report separates very clearly the functions of the executive side and the functions of the elected representatives. It makes a clear distinction between policy-making and administration. Here is what the Minister himself said about this on the 30th October, 1969, at column 2193 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I think if one looks back at the experience of very large boards one finds that the boards end up effectively in the hands of the chief executive officer who is appointed for the general administration of the service.  It becomes impossible to do business effectively.  That can be mitigated, to some extent, by the appointment of committees for certain purposes but those committees cannot make important or vital decisions.</P>
      <P>These are the Minister's own words and his decision on the matter.  I do not want to see the affairs of the eastern health board end up effectively in the hands of any chief executive officer.  I want to see the day-to-day administration being put squarely on the shoulders of the chief executive officer. I want to see the limited amount of time available to the elected representatives and other members of the board being spent in policy-making and not in detailed day-to-day decisions which must be made in a large administration of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have probably made most of the <Col N="1335" /> points I want to make at this stage. When we went to see the Minister we raised this point and either the Minister or some of the people supporting him said, when this question of plural control was raised, &ldquo;After all, we know in other bodies that this works well.&rdquo; We were given the example of vocational education committees and harbour boards.  I was a member of one of the largest vocational education committees for at least ten years.  I know the volume of business which was transacted.  We could meet once a month and make all the decisions necessary in two hours.  No analogy whatever can be drawn between the volume of work that will have to be done in the eastern region board and that done by the vocational education committees or harbour boards.  Unless the members of this new board can be full-time members, meeting every day and making every decision and giving every direction, if anything goes wrong, I wonder who will be surcharged?  If we give directions will they lead to surcharge on either the full board or on a sub-committee of the board?  Will we be liable to surcharge?  These are matters which arise.  The Minister should look very seriously at this.  I suggest to him that it is the wrong time to try out a new form of administration when such enormous and profound changes are being proposed in our health legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a board of a health authority for nearly nine years.  I was chairman one year.  I feel that the present system of administration of the Dublin Health Authority is second to none.  It is an excellent system.  I may be conservative but I do not like to see anything that is functioning well disturbed. We discussed these matters at great length in a committee of Dublin County Council, Dublin Health Authority and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  We thought that the amendment we agreed to here was in the Tánaiste's interest and in the interests of good administration. Responsibility should not be taken from the chief executive officer. I am not being personal.  Hundreds of hours were spent on the various boards <Col N="1336" /> trying to perfect the regional hospital board.  I found my experience in attending the Dublin Health Authority meetings for nine years very helpful. At the beginning it was like all other boards, having the usual growing pains.  As the administration developed we had the present chief executive officer and his staff.  The secretary at that time was Mr. Nolan who worked when this board was set up in 1960 until he fell out of his standing on a few occasions from overwork.  We saw that and we advised the Minister that it was time to give more authority to the CEO to do the job that we wanted him to do.  We wanted each Department of the health authority to work under the direction of the CEO and to be a separate branch of the authority. Speaking with that experience, I support this amendment.  We have only one such man in Ireland and that is the CEO of the Dublin Health Authority.  County secretaries and county managers do it all over the country.  I want to support this amendment. I am giving my opinions for what they are worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very interested to hear what Deputy Paddy Burke and Deputy Clinton have said in connection with this amendment. Knowing the complexity of this Bill&mdash; I found it very complex when I started to study it&mdash;and knowing the history of local government, I do not blame either of them for having some fears in regard to disturbances that might occur in the administration of the Dublin Health Authority.  While I am quite willing to accept the statements of the two Deputies that the health authority has operated efficiently, I suppose it is true to say that one can always do better.  Perhaps, I have not made the position sufficiently clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only difference between section 16 and the corresponding regulations under the county management system are that we have given, generally speaking, the powers to those health boards that health authorities and county councils have at present, taking into account the County Management Acts and the Act of 1955, which the Deputies know well.  There is not any <Col N="1337" /> other real change.  My predecessor felt that because public opinion varies throughout the country as to the desirability of the management system he should limit the powers of the chief executive officer in a certain definite way as prescribed in subsection (3) a, b, c and d.  I take it from hearing those two Deputies speak that they would not want the eastern health board to have any of those powers.  It would place them in an impossible position. There is also subsection (e) which would give me the power to add some other functions to those of the chief executive officer if I felt that the machine was creaking or inefficient or, equally, if I received from a health board some suggestion that they would like in a definite way to have some function specifically transferred to the CEO.  I can assure the two Deputies that when the eastern health board comes into operation because the Dublin Health Authority will be far the biggest part of it once the new chief executive officer and the other officers are appointed I do not envisage any change in the manner of administration. In regard to any powers or functions in respect of day to day management that the Dublin Health Authority have already given their chief officer, which may in turn have been delegated to his deputy officer, they only have to pass the necessary resolutions in order to ensure that the same kind of administration will continue, subject to whatever changes are required because of the addition of Wicklow and Kildare.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, there will have to be some officers whose particular duty will be to co-ordinate Wicklow and Kildare with Dublin.  The addition of Wicklow and Kildare will make a material difference and, as the Deputies have remarked, the great bulk of the work is done in Dublin city and county. I can assure the Deputies that under section 16 (1) there is nothing to prevent the new eastern health board from, at least in the first instance, saying: &ldquo;We want to carry on the same method of general direction, the same delegation of functions as has been the case up to now&rdquo; subject to Wicklow and Kildare being added in with a proper <Col N="1338" /> co-ordination and integration of these counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be nobody on the new regional health board in a position to say that.  There could be a complete change of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not imagine that the health board would have changed its complexion to that degree.  As far as the people appointed from the profession are concerned, it would be to their immense interest that the machinery would continue to move smoothly.  I am sure that if there was to be any change and if the health board wished to take on any further executive function, of the kind Deputy Clinton suggested they might have to do, that at least they would examine it before they attempted to give themselves the overwhelming burden of activity which has been indicated by the two Deputies who quite rightly do not want to sit every day going through a massive agenda if there can be a proper delegation to the chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>That is how I see the position.  I might add that I will be responsible for the operation of this measure and if by any chance something creaks in relation to the operation of section 16 I will be the first person to be responsible for it and I will have to come to the Dáil with an amending measure but I do not see the necessity.  Subsection (1) enables the board to delegate executive functions to the chief executive officer.  There are certain specifically reserved functions and I can add such other functions as may be prescribed. It seems to me that the machinery will move smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that the Maud Report did propose the enlargement of local government areas but the main purpose of the report presented to the British House of Commons in relation to the health services was to co-ordinate the hospital administration, the public health administration and the medical service administration, which is what we are doing in this Bill.  However, Britain is a very different country from our own particularly because of the enormous density of population.  I do not think it would be possible for the eastern health board to operate successfully <Col N="1339" /> if the very able person who holds the position of city manager automatically remained the chairman of the eastern health board.  I feel that it is possible to arrange co-ordinating functions between the health and local government services either by administrative co-ordination at a lower level, between the local authorities within the health board and the other local authorities in the Dublin area.  It is essential to have a chief executive officer who will hold that position for the eastern health board, and such Deputies as may be required.  I want to assure the two Deputies again that I do not see a tremendous revolutionary change in the character of the administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton caught me out, and I accepted it in my speech on the 30th October, when I referred to the kind of functions which sub-committees could exercise within the eastern health board.  I was really thinking of functions which involved the spending of money that had not been budgeted for. The sort of thing I can see being possible for a sub-committee of the eastern health board would be that the sub-committee would be told by the health board how much there was to spend in the year 1970-71 for child health services. A committee could be formed which could have the power of saying how that money would be spent, what child health services could be expanded within an area, whether a site could be obtained for a new child health centre, how the service for the examination of children under six could be performed in certain areas where there was no child health centre, or how it could be performed in the dispensary of a practitioner.  Provided the sub-committee understands that if it is to spend money it must be part of a budgetary process, Deputies can think of other functions which could be given to a sub-committee.</P>
    <P>I am not aware at the moment of how Dublin Health Authority operate in relation to committees but I am sure there are some operating.  Between these, and the delegation of authority to the chief executive officer to the extent which the eastern health board may think wise, the whole organisation <Col N="1340" /> will be enabled to proceed smoothly. I would imagine, if the other members of the eastern health board share the feelings of the two Deputies&mdash;and I am quite sure the majority of them together with the professionals will&mdash;they will, in order not to have any difficulties arising immediately transfer such functions as the Deputies think are over and above those clearly reserved to the chief executive officer, at least for the time being.  Then they can examine how this board will operate with the addition of Meath and Kildare, particularly in relation to some of the new services which will be established at the time the Bill comes into operation.  I hope I have been helpful to the two Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press the Minister to accept these amendments which have been brought to the House from a meeting of the Dublin Health Authority where it was unanimously decided to ask the Minister to accept them.  It was not from this side of the House or that side of the House, it was unanimous.  Therefore, I would press the Minister on this.  I am not satisfied with what the Minister says about the new eastern health board. When it meets it will have very little in common with the old health authority. There will be very few members who have been on the health board. So far as I am concerned, like the other two speakers, I have been on the Dublin Health Authority since it was brought into being and I consider it has worked well.  Therefore, I would press the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>I do not quite follow this section.  On the one hand in subsection (3) the chief executive officer is vested with the control and supervision of officers and on the other hand subsection (1) says the officers of the board shall perform their functions in accordance with the decisions and directions of the board.  Those two subsections appear to me to be inconsistent.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I have been on the health authority since its inception.  It has worked well and I would press the Minister to continue the system under which we worked on the health authority. As time goes on, it is getting more and more difficult to find people who <Col N="1341" /> can devote time to public duties. Under this Bill the position will be quite impossible in respect of the amount of time members of the eastern regional health board will have to devote to day-to-day administration and it is because of that aspect of it that we are asking the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister prefaced his remarks in relation to this amendment by saying that one of the reasons why he made a change in the administrative system in this Bill was because in the country some people had reservations about whether or not the present Management Act worked well.  I agree with this.  This is quite true.  In many of the counties one comes across members of local authorities who would love to be in a position to hold the gun to the manager's head all the time.  This is often the attitude of people where there is not a very large volume of work to be done.  They like to have that power.  I hold they have been given that power through section 4 of the 1955 Act.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that we in this area are not concerned with what system is operated down the country.  Deputy Percy Dockrell, Deputy Paddy Burke and I are very concerned about what happens in the eastern region because, as the Minister said, the major portion of it is the Dublin Health Authority area.  We are asking that a system that has been tried and found to work efficiently and effectively should be continued.  This is all we are asking in this legislation.  I wonder does the Minister appreciate that there should be a distinction between the system proposed for the eastern health board and the system proposed for the smaller boards?  Does he bear in mind that the eastern health board will be catering for approximately half the population the other seven boards will be catering for and one-third the total population of the country?  It does not necessarily follow that a system which might satisfy the people on the smaller boards would be satisfactory for the eastern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not have been listening fully when Deputy Dockrell <Col N="1342" /> was drawing his attention to something which he would have liked the Minister to refer to.  The Bill states at section 16 (3) that the chief executive officer is vested with the control and the supervision of other officers.  Subsection (1) states that the chief executive officer and other officers shall perform their duties and functions in accordance with the decisions and directions of the board.  I cannot see how the two can be reconciled.  Clearly, that would inevitably lead to a conflict of loyalty by the officers in their relations with the board and the CEO.  I should like to hear from the Minister on this point.  Deputy Dockrell tried to draw the Minister's attention to this but the Minister at the time was concerning himself with something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine this before Report Stage.  Under section 16, the functions reserved to the CEO in subsection (3) cannot be taken away by any decision the board make under subsection (1).  However, I agree to examine it before Report Stage to make certain that this is clearly the case.  I agree with the Deputies that it should be clearly the case.  I understand the difficulties expressed by Deputies Burke and Clinton about this.  If they feel doubtful about the attitude the eastern regional health board may take when the new members are elected, although the Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the professional people at least would fall in with what the Deputy suggests, I will agree that before this Bill comes into operation I will meet the old Dublin Health Authority and have a period, shall we say of six months, during which the functions prescribed in paragraph (e) of the subsection can be quite clearly demarcated in respect of the eastern health board, functions which Deputies Clinton and Burke think should be additional functions of the eastern health board.  This could be done for a period until the board get under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I could do it perpetually, because Wicklow and Kildare are added, but I can meet the old Dublin Health Authority in the interests of efficiency and so as not to disturb the <Col N="1343" /> officers.  The object of this would be a demarcation of functions which would ensure the kind of continuity of administration that the two Deputies and Deputy Dockrell require.  That would preserve democracy because I do not want to have inconsistency as between the eastern health board and the others throughout the country.  For a period of 12 months I could prescribe the functions and after that I am certain the newly constituted eastern health board will realise the immense amount of administrative work they will have to do if they are not to delegate functions other than those referred to in paragraph (c).  Will that suit the Deputy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be making a very generous offer, but I do not believe he is.  One of the greatest curses in this country is uniformity&mdash;uniformity of an area that has no uniformity about it.  I have already said that this board will be catering for half as many as the other seven put together.  Why, then, should we have a uniform system of administration?  I do not follow the Minister in this. Earlier the Minister said that the eastern board, when set up, could in effect pass a resolution in respect of the functions in relation to the eastern board as they apply to the chief executive officer.  Is that not what the Minister has said?  I want to confirm that what the Minister said is that if the new board, meeting for the first time, want to pass a resolution to continue what is in existence at the present time, and if they give these functions to the CEO and leave in existence the functions the Dublin Health Authority already have, he will be prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would nearly accept that, although I say that it is doubtful.  I still say it should be written into the legislation because half of the members of the new board will not have any experience whatsoever of the administration of health services and will not have the knowledge of the problems that are met with in the administration of health services in that large area.  The existing members of the Dublin Health Authority know it but the professional people and the Minister's appointees <Col N="1344" /> will not have that experience.  They will be likely to vote in any direction because they will not have that experience which the members of the health authority had&mdash;and they were members of every party, plus some independents. I appeal to the Minister not to say: &ldquo;Because there are reservations about this in the country, we will have uniformity&rdquo;.  Uniformity in this context is not worthwhile when you are not applying it to the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the remarks of my one-time colleagues of the Dublin Health Authority and I am concerned that what the Minister considers to be certain to happen may not, in fact, happen.  Although I appreciate the Minister's desire in the distribution of the personnel of the new eastern health board, on the figures already submitted by the Minister the position is that there will be only four members out of 32 on the new eastern health board who have had previous service in the Dublin Health Authority, because the inadequate number of six proposed to be given to the Dublin Corporation will not be in a position to take up their membership unless there is legislation to enable Dublin Corporation to be reinstated.</P>
      <P>Therefore, out of 32 members there will be only four, at most four, who have had the privilege of being members of the Dublin Health Authority.  I should like to say at this stage that I consider myself, though the Minister and some of his colleagues do not, still to be a member of that authority.  Because the Dublin Health Authority have not been able to do their work, we have been asked to take on some of the duties that should be carried out by members of the health authority because they are not able to carry them out.  We are asked, unpaid and unhonoured, to work on hospital visiting committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know something from past experience of the work of the Dublin Health Authority and I can say without reservation that they worked extremely well, as did the system. There were some members of the authority who had reservations when the authority was being reconstituted <Col N="1345" /> nine years ago.  But the Minister said it worked so well, why not make it larger?  You cannot have the optimum: you can just have the perfect organisation and to make it bigger may destroy it.  I believe that is the real danger now and I appeal to the Minister to leave well enough alone and, if he can, to allow the Dublin Health Authority to remain more or less the same size as it is and not to have the acquisitions he is suggesting.  If he cannot do that, let him at least allow the existing system to operate, as it is. That is the purpose of the amendment of Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell which Deputy Burke has supported. When there is such unanimity among people not noted for their agreement the Minister should be swayed to accept the amendment and write it into the Bill.  Why is there this resistance sometimes on the part of Ministers to writing into Bills what they say they are prepared to do so long as it is not written into the Bill? The Minister has been very good at many stages when listening to what he has accepted as reasoned argument. I hope in this connection also he will recognise the sincerity of those arguing in favour of the inclusion of this provision in the Bill so as to make certain that what we know has worked we will be the situation in future.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister comments on this again I should like to ask him does he know that the commissioner appointed by the Government to administer the affairs of Dublin Corporation, Mr. Garvin, a man of very long experience of local government administration, agrees with us on this?  He agrees absolutely that the system we are advocating in this amendment is the best system possible. Does the Minister realise that he is now proposing to introduce for the seventies a system found inadequate for the thirties?  I appeal to the Minister to think very hard and long before he refuses to accept this amendment.</P>

I had forgotten that the commissioner, Mr. <Col N="1346" /> Garvin, the former secretary of the Department of Local Government, was also present at the health authority meeting when we came to this decision. I, also, appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment on the grounds that this is not a decision of any section of the health authority but a unanimous decision backed up by the commissioner, Mr. Garvin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of correction, I stood up and divorced from the amendment the latter part of it where it says: &ldquo;In the same way as they applied to the Chief Executive Officer under section 18 of the Health Authorities Act, 1960 and shall not apply otherwise&rdquo;.  I asked that that should be deleted at the start because when I checked my references I found that was one that applied to delegation by the city manager of certain authority to the CEO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving out that, I do not want to continue disputing what the Deputy said because I am very anxious to proceed with this Bill or we shall never get it into operation.  I wonder whether the new representatives from Wicklow and Kildare, with at least the majority of the professions, meeting together for the first time, months before they have statutory powers&mdash;because I propose that these health boards shall be appointed first and given their statutory functions or power to operate some months afterwards&mdash;would really want to disturb the executive administration of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire part of the <Col N="1347" /> health administration by taking on an enormous burden of executive work, if that is the case the Deputy states. But if the Deputies have a fear about this I shall make use of subsection (e) by meeting the old Dublin Health Authority before the eastern health board is set up and I shall get a list of the kinds of functions which the Deputies say should be left with the CEO in addition to those under subsection (3) and I shall consider whether these should not be actually determined for a period of six or 12 months after which, I am certain, once the health board has seen how Dublin city health services operate, they would agree to the continuation of these arrangements and that I would remove my authority for these functions and leave it to the eastern health board&mdash;I hope the Deputy understands this.</P>

My only reservation is that I do not know whether I really ought to transfer these functions permanently.  It would be quite sufficient to do so for six or 12 months.  I do not know what the functions are.  I have not got long enough experience of the detail of the operation of the health services.  Will that satisfy the two Deputies?  The City Manager will bring a list of the functions which he thinks should be prescribed in some way on the basis that section 16 as a whole is not sufficiently definite for the Dublin Health Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 11, lines 46 and 47, to <Col N="1350" /> delete &ldquo;or for continuing as an officer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My purpose in moving this amendment is to point out to the House and the Minister that this section could be seriously misconstrued in terms of conditions of employment of officers of authorities.  I am sure the Minister will give us the required clarification and the required assurance in this matter as the section specifically states:</P>
    <P>The qualifications for appointment as an officer, or for continuing as an officer, under a health board shall be approved of or directed by the Minister....</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to ensure that no qualifications will be introduced which would have retrospective effect on existing officers in any health authority or any board.  I have no objection to any new appointee being informed: &ldquo;These are the new qualifications for the job and you have to have them if you want to be appointed to the position.&rdquo;  The retention of an existing post by an officer should not be in any way held up to what I might call transitional ransom in terms of qualifications.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would hope that section is intended to cover exigencies only such as an officer continuing to be in good health or continuing to be of sound mind.  I have no objection if that is the specific construction put on it.  I assure the Minister that we would not be prepared to accept a situation in which retrospective qualification application would apply under that section. I would be grateful if the Minister would assure us that the section will not in any way operate to disqualify the holder of office from continuing in that office as and from the introduction of the Bill.</P>

    <P>The subsection deals with the suspension and removal of a chief executive officer.  It is proposed in the amendment that this power of suspension <Col N="1352" /> will operate only after the Minister has held a public local inquiry. The purpose of the amendment is clear. It is to prevent any abuse or any hasty action on the part of the Minister and would enable the chief executive officer to state his case for his conduct&mdash;the conduct which, presumably, would cause the Minister to contemplate the suspension.  The effect of amendment No. 23a would be to oblige the Minister to have an inquiry held before suspending an officer on the grounds that he is incapable of performing his duties or has misconducted himself. The amendments are simply for the protection of chief executive officers and to ensure that if justice is being done it is also being seen to be done.</P>

I must be in a position to suspend the chief executive officer immediately; there must be some ultimate discipline in this situation.  Equally, it is true that a chief executive officer might not wish to have a public inquiry into his suspension either because he accepted that he should be suspended or had reasonable hope on grounds which he would not want to make public that the suspension would be lifted.  There is that human circumstance that enters into it but, again in order to maintain a full understanding with all the Deputies on both sides of the House who wish to take a sort of human attitude towards all this, it does so happen that in this Bill the chief executive officer can be removed without an inquiry, and I shall put in an amendment on Report Stage providing that the chief executive officer cannot be removed as distinct from being suspended until after a local inquiry.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 12, line 14, to delete &ldquo;two-thirds&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a simple majority&rdquo; and after &ldquo;board&rdquo; in the same line to insert &ldquo;who were present and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where a health board wishes to suspend a chief executive officer it may do so on a simple majority vote of those present and voting at a meeting of the authority.  The Bill as submitted by the Minister would require that the suspension may not take place unless two-thirds of the members voted for the suspension.  One can have a situation in which people could stay away from a meeting in order to prevent a suspension taking place, because the Bill does not even confine the two-thirds to members who are present and voting but to two-thirds of the total membership.  Therefore, on a health board with 30 people you would need 20 votes in favour of the suspension before suspension could take place.  If a majority of the members who take the trouble to attend a meeting are in favour of suspension, then they should be able to suspend. There is no question of a surprise or vexatious suspension taking place, because the subsection provides that the intention to propose a motion of suspension <Col N="1354" /> will have at least seven days prior notice which has to be given to every person who is a member of a board.  If after notice goes out, people attend a meeting and consider that on the information before them suspension should take place, then that should be sufficient without requiring that there be a two-thirds majority of the total membership.</P>
    <P>There could be a variety of reasons for a person's absence.  It could be due to the fact that some of the members are also Members of the Dáil, or there may be other good reasons why they are necessarily absent elsewhere.  The Minister has power to nullify a suspension and there is ample protection against vexatious use of this.  As I say, I do not believe it could be vexatiously used because ample notice would have to be given, and a simple majority ought to be sufficient in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I think I have already shown my willingness not to be compulsively uniform in my approach to this Bill, although I do have to take into account the local government code, and it would be very wrong to depart too far from it unless I had the agreement of the Minister for Local Government and also all the people in the House who are concerned with local government.  I think there should be some uniformity in this matter.  At this moment county managers can only be suspended by the council of a county by the passing of a resolution on which not less than two-thirds of the members have voted, there being the usual seven days notice.  It would be wrong not to give the chief executive officer the same status in that regard. All this is being a little hypothetical because I am very glad to say I remember only one county manager being suspended in the last ten or 20 years. There may have been more but certainly very few.</P>

      <P>One can argue about this but I think a limitation period of three months might be to the disadvantage of the suspended officer in some cases.  If the suspension arose from the misappropriation of funds, for example, it might continue for a longer period to give the officer an opportunity to make a repayment.  I can think of a number of instances in which it might actually help the officer to have a longer period than three months in which to have the matter determined. I think the Deputy should withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1941, the Minister has the function of removal from office in all cases of misconduct. In the case of the health board this function will be given to the committee set up under section 23 except as respects absence from duty without leave or without reasonable cause.  The reason is that it is not thought necessary to convene the rather elaborate machinery under section 23 in the simple case of an officer who gives up the job and absents himself.  The issue in such a case is normally clear-cut and it is desirable to have a simple procedure for declaring the office vacant so that his successor can be appointed.  I think that is a reasonable statement.</P>

      <P>In page 13, to delete subsection (2) (b), lines 25 to 32, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) an even number of other persons of whom&mdash;</P>

    <P>(i) half shall be selected by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by such organisation (or organisations) as is (or are), in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the class of officers to which the person belongs or where, in the opinion of the Minister, there is no such organisation or <Col N="1359" /> where nominations under this subparagraph have not been made, from such persons as he considers appropriate, and</P>
    <P>(ii) half shall be selected by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by the chief executive officer of the health board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the membership of a disciplinary committee in a case where there is no representative organ for the officer concerned or where the representative organ has not made any nomination for membership.  As the section stands, there would be no authority to set up a committee in such circumstances and as a consequence no power to carry through a proposal for removal.  It is quite evident that it provides a flexible system for the setting up of a disciplinary committee to judge the case where there is no representative organ, in other words, where the trade union or official organisation is lacking in substance and authority.</P>

      <P>In the first and second lines of subparagraph (b) (i), to delete &ldquo;selected by the Minister from a panel of persons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the organisation which represents the person to have the right of direct nomination rather than what is proposed in the Bill which would require such organisation to nominate a panel of persons from which the Minister would select the people to sit on the committee of inquiry.  It is difficult to see why the Minister wants to make a selection from a panel and why he is not prepared to accept the direct nominations of the organisations themselves. I think it would be desirable to allow the organisations to say who they want rather than have a situation where a Minister could have any say in the determination of the personnel.  Again, not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done.  I think it is better for the Minister as well as for the person under inquiry that the Minister <Col N="1360" /> should have no say in the selection of a person to represent the worker involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the good fortune in my career not to have to set up many disciplinary committees. As a result, when I looked at this amendment put down by Deputy Ryan I thought it seemed all right until I began to think about it again.  When I began to think about it it became quite evident that the revision of these committees should be such that the Minister can be certain that a close colleague of the person being considered for removal should not be chosen for the committee.  That is obvious. You want to make a quite certain that out of the persons nominated you will not have a situation where you might nominate people who were already prejudiced in favour of the person.  I think that is quite reasonable.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment. I think the amendment I have provided is adequate under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Against what the Minister said, it is equally possible to get somebody prejudiced in favour of the Minister by the method that the Minister is selecting.  I think it is most unlikely that a trade union or other organisation representing the workers would select somebody who was personally or closely involved with the accused.  It would be contrary to wise practice.  I think the experience of people who work with trade unions and trade union representatives in disciplinary matters is that the trade unions are just as anxious as anybody else to maintain good standards of conduct on the part of employees and, in fact, it is known that there are cases in which trade unions are even more severe on the workers than are the employers who sometimes might be disposed to forgive and forget but trade unions, very properly, are concerned with maintaining high standards because the misconduct of one of their number could be interpreted as reflecting on the others.  I would urge upon the Minister not to seek this power of selection from a panel which he is looking for.  I do not think it is necessary <Col N="1361" /> and even if what the Minister fears were to come about, there is still the position in which the chairman would be selected by the Minister and there would also be half the composition of the committee from a panel of persons nominated by the chief executive officer of the health board, so that the Minister has a majority who at least are independent of any particular inclination to sympathise with the person involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking specifically to the amendment.  I may, therefore, point out to the Minister that when any committee of any organisation or body, more particularly, when a regional health board, is meeting to act in a quasi-judicial manner on the question of misconduct of an officer, it is inconceivable, publicly undesirable and, in fact, quite reprehensible, that any such committee should meet and act unless it has a full and total presence of all members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may give a case in point to the Minister.  Supposing a member is not present at a meeting, supposing a vacancy of a casual nature occurs on a committee designed to question the matter of misconduct and supposing the Minister knows that he has a sympathetic majority on a committee, 70 <Col N="1364" /> per cent of whom would be in attendance, I frankly suggest to the Minister that justice would not necessarily be seen to be done fully and effectively unless all members of a disciplinary committee are present.  That is an elementary aspect of normal justice.  This is like permitting a juror, for instance, to be absent at a key point in court proceedings. Where a permanent official of a health board is likely to be removed from office because of misconduct or unfitness of some kind then the entire disciplinary committee should be present to adjudicate.  There should be no casual absences in such a case.  If my suggestion is not accepted then, in time, the committee could dwindle from a membership of possibly ten down to three or four.  The whole thing would become an administrative farce.  This sort of thing has happened in some parts of the country in certain areas of local government.  It is not to be recommended.</P>

The section seems somewhat ambiguous in relation to the assignment of duties from the local authority and the health board points of view.  The Minister could assist the House by dwelling on the precise functions of some of the officers of local authorities and health boards&mdash;the designation of these functions.  I get the impression that social welfare officers and health inspectors may find themselves being allocated functions which perhaps they have not bargained for&mdash;to give but two examples.  This point has been put to me in relation to section 24.  There does appear to be some drafting ambiguity in this section. I should like to be proved wrong.</P>

      <P>The section does require some explanation.  It is the section which enables a medical officer of a health board to spend part of his time doing housing inspection if it is more economic for the housing inspection to be done in an area by the person who is also the medical officer.  It simply enables some transfer of functions to be made between local authorities and health boards.  There will not be many cases of this kind.  I think the principal one would be that, in quite a number of areas, medical officers undertake some inspection of housing and also health inspection.  In order not to have to duplicate these officers, they could remain officers of the health board and have the payment of salary divided as between the amount of time they spend doing work for the health board and the amount of time they spend doing work for the local authority.  It is quite simple.  There is no complication about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 14, line 42, after &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(which may include provision for superannuation)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is rather an interesting amendment. It is to permit arrangements with doctors for the provision of services under the revised general medical services proposed in section 56 of the Bill to include provisions for a superannuation scheme.  As the House knows, we propose to have choice of doctor for those with medical cards. Everybody approves of this course. The ordinary provisions referred to in section 19, in relation to officers of health boards, would not be applicable to superannuation of doctors who provide service on a fee basis. We are negotiating with the Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union for a form of superannuation which will be included in the fee for service.  Therefore, we have to get away from the formal superannuation code of the local authority as this is something entirely new.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In layman's language, it boils down to this.  You might have a situation where a doctor was within the scheme, providing services under the scheme.  On reaching a certain age, he would receive a lump sum or pension if he then withdrew from the scheme.  Is that the position?  Could he withdraw from the scheme and continue in private practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary way, he would not be retiring until 70.  In the case of a doctor taking part in the general practitioner scheme, as distinct from a dispensary doctor, payment for superannuation would be by way of addition to the fees.  The only way to work it seems to be to add a certain sum to the fee which would represent the superannuation payments he would otherwise get if he were a permanent officer.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this amendment was not ruled out of order. Its purpose is to save the Minister the trouble of having his officials running to some officials in the Department of Finance to say what cash books they ought to keep.  This is the kind of ridiculous bureaucratic waste of time which leads the public service to think it cannot be as efficient as people in the private sector.  If the Department of Health and local health boards cannot work out a proper system of keeping accounts we may as well pack up.

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Ryan about this.  I think it is right that the Minister for Finance should be involved in the preparation and presentation of budgets kept by the health boards.  It could even redound to the advantage of the health boards if the Minister for Finance had approved of the method of presentation. It might enable the Minister for Health of the day to persuade the Minister for Finance that more money was needed for certain purposes if the accounts were as clearly presented as possible.  This also relates to the local accounts as they are presented to the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think there is any harm in the section.  I could not accept Deputy Ryan's amendment.  I do not think it is going to make it more difficult for the Minister for Health or the local authorities to secure the largest amount possible from the Minister for Finance if he is satisfied that the method of preparing and presenting the budget <Col N="1370" /> from each health board is good and proper and the accounting procedure as soundly conceived as possible and that the health boards are able to judge what their expenditure and receipts are.

      <P>One of the worst reasons for continuing to do a bad thing is to be doing so because it was always done.  There are hunks of stuff in this Bill which should be cut out with a scissors.  This is one of them.  A local government auditor will be appointed by the Minister for Health after consultation with the Minister for Local Government.  What is his purpose?  Is it just to check the figures after someone has prepared them?  If it is, this is just a peculiar way of employing a local government auditor, who should be concerned with all sorts of things like the preparation of accounts.  The whole thing is simply wasting time and money.  It is wasted effort, duplication, multiplication and quadruplication, of one official chasing after another, consulting each other about the type of books which should be prepared and the type of accounts to be kept.  The Minister says this is justified because somebody in the Department of Finance will be impressed by the excellent way in which someone is doing his bookkeeping.  It is unmitigated hogwash. It is wholly unnecessary.  You may as well say that a private company should insist that their auditor consult every year with the Department of Finance, and the Department of <Col N="1371" /> Local Government, and the Department of Industry and Commerce regarding the preparation of the accounts. Already they have to consult with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say we should not hold up this Health Bill on points like this and that this could be discussed on another occasion.  I feel this is one of the occasions when Parliament can do something about this.  It is outrageous that stuff like this should be written into a Bill.  If the Minister wants to do it as a matter of practice, let it be done as a matter of practice, but do not write it into the Bill in this day and age as a statutory obligation so that some junior official in the Department of Finance can rush up to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;We have caught the boys in the Department of Health. They did not submit the accounts as required by section 26 of the Health Act, 1970,&rdquo; as it probably will be.</P>

A number have been ruled out because they imposed a charge on the Exchequer, it apparently being the notion that a Minister for Health goes wild and misspends public money unless the Minister for Finance puts a brake on him.  It is not considered that money will be wasted in this regard.  This is the kind of verbiage which brings the draftsman, the parliamentarians and the legislators into well-deserved disrepute.  I urge on the Minister to remove it or to agree at this stage to our amendment.  If he is rapped on the knuckles by the Minister for Finance he can put it back again on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not recommend that course of action to the Minister.  It is a tragedy that Fine Gael have advanced in social legislation good causes for quite the wrong reasons. This is a classic example.  Fine Gael have repeatedly advocated to this House the principle of public accountability. We have crucified every State-sponsored body in Ireland with the need for uniformity of accountability and the need for general supervision and overall national supervision of the strategy of national expenditure. It would be inconsistent to advocate that the Minister for Finance, at Cabinet level, should not have a fairly substantial finger in this pie.  I would draw attention to an elementary aspect which I would hope to see in the near future.  It is necessary that the whole accounting system of health services should, in the not too distant future, be completely computerised.  I would not like to see the Department of Health or the Department of Local Government or any other section of the Government having a series of <i>ad hoc</i> administrative areas and financial accounting.  On that basis it is necessary to have common budgetary systems in operation in any Government Department.  I would remind the Fine Gael Party, as the advocates of some of our strongest reports of the Committee of Public Accounts, that all Government Departments are responsible on a common basis to the Committee of Public Accounts of this House.  All State-sponsored bodies should be equally accountable.  The Minister for Finance cannot be denied what we demand for ourselves in this House.  So long as this House is to have a Budget every year&mdash;and we have the bad situation in Health of having annual budgets instead of budgeting on a five-year basis as an absolute minimum&mdash;we must regard ourselves as being accountable nationally. The only person who, in the long term, is utterly responsible is the Minister for Finance.  On that basis, much as one abhors bureaucracy in a small island such as this and much as one deplores Departmental inefficiency&mdash; and I do not believe that Departments are as inefficient as some public representatives think&mdash;much as one would <Col N="1373" /> wish to see greater effectiveness, I do not think this is the way to go about it, by knocking out &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  It rather reminds me of some of the statements made by the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley who took decisions first and the Minister for Finance had subsequently to find the money.</P>

For example, if it stated: &ldquo;with the consent of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo; I could not see any objection on the part of the Deputy but simply because the Minister for Finance is mentioned we all seem to go berserk.

I am sure he feels with all of us that it would be a good exercise to standardise the accounts and the form in which they are presented because this would enable the Minister for Health to compare the expenditure of different boards and different institutions and of the various departments of the various boards and institutions Anybody can see why it would be very desirable to have this standardised form of accounting.  That is not what Deputy Ryan is objecting to.  Deputy Ryan is objecting to the fact that the Minister for Health would not be in control of his own Department, that he will have the Minister for Finance breathing down his neck and telling him what he should do, when he should do it and the particular method he should adopt.  The only concern the Minister for Finance should have is how much money is spent.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the discussion and I like most of all Deputy Desmond's talk about the computer and the idea that the Minister for Finance should be terrified of the supreme programmer of the computer. I would like to have some part in the decision about how the computer should be programmed.  That is not a bad idea at all.</P>
      <P>In regard to this section, first of all it does not relate to the question of how the health boards raise their money.  That comes later in the Bill. I can look back to the last three Ministers for Finance, during the period when health expenditure was absolutely booming.  May I remind the House again that, eliminating all inflationary costs of wages, salaries and costs of material, the total cost of the health services is twice what it was in 1958 as against an increase in the volume of production of 1958 values of 50 per cent.  In other words, my Government, no doubt pushed by the Opposition who always want to spend more than we can afford, have enormously increased the cost of the health services.  Nobody can say that there has not been a great increase, far beyond the maintenance of what is supposed to be the golden rule, that you increase the cost of social services as far as you can in relation to the amount by which production has gone up.  We have far exceeded that and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say now something that is absolutely true.  I have studied this question enough to know.  If one reads the World Health Organisation's annual report which I got yesterday <Col N="1376" /> one will see that health services are a bottomless financial pit to every Minister of every country, including those that up to now had a far greater income per head than we have.  It is an absolutely bottomless pit.  Even in the United States they do not know how they will find the money to do all they are supposed to do.  Looking back on the last three Ministers for Finance I do not think it will hurt my interests if the health boards keep accounts in a form which is satisfactory to the Minister for Finance.  I would like to feel that the Minister for Finance understood the methods of budgeting, understood the classifications of expenditure, accepted fully how we divide the cost of contributions to voluntary hospitals, the relationship of those to the deficits paid from the Hospitals Trust, the cost of the medical services, the cost of operating different district hospitals and different schemes.</P>
    <P>I would like to be satisfied that the Minister for Finance felt that this method of budgeting was, first of all, uniform throughout the country and that he did not think there was anything bogus about it, that he did not think that in some way we were getting away with financial statements that were not entirely acceptable to him. When I think of the increase in health expenditure in the last ten years, paid for partly by the ratepayers, partly by the taxpayers and partly by the Hospitals Trust Fund, I do not think Members of the House can say that the Minister for Finance will use this section to increase the amount of purely bureaucratic work that has to be done by the health boards or to prevent me from getting funds.</P>
    <P>I have only been Minister for Health for a short time but I am considering, with the officers of the Department, whether we need some kind of consultancy body to help the health boards to be as efficient as possible.  Whether that would take the form of a work study unit within my Department or a work study unit recruited in some other way I do not know.  I do think it would be a good thing if more local authorities engaged in this kind of work.  I realise that it is most important that anybody who does this work <Col N="1377" /> should have had considerable experience of a local authority as distinct from a commercial company.  It is also absolutely important to assure the staff that any saving should be effected by retirement or wastage.  In the case of local authorities where people have very special responsibilities, one could not do it any other way unless there was some system of retirement at an early age where certain people wanted to receive satisfactory superannuation terms.  Therefore, I think we need a great deal of study with management over a period with those people so that that can be done with the consent of the whole board in an agreeable way.  For that purpose it is good to have the Minister for Finance approve some of the accounts and I think in the long run we will gain the confidence of the Minister for Finance as far as we can to provide the necessary amount of money.  That is my sincere belief about it.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister and the House have misunderstood the purpose of my amendment.  I do not believe anything worthwhile will be achieved by the Minister for Health submitting a draft of the proposed accounts to the Minister for Finance other than to give statutory sanction to the operation of Parkinson's Law. Here we are saying to a group of people that it is a waste of time writing letters to another group of people who will waste time examining what they have drafted and will waste time writing memoranda and so forth to them. No private company, no trade union, nobody in the sane world would operate their business like Departments of State.  Instead of getting away from this farcical situation, which the Minister thinks we might cure by bringing in outside consultants, we propose once again to bring it into legislation.  I am disappointed to hear Deputy Desmond's reaction to this.  It is entirely at variance with the reaction of his colleague, Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, who enthusiastically supported similar amendments by us.</P>

      <P>Maybe it is the good company which he at one time kept, I do not mean in the Department of Finance but in Fine Gael.  He was in the Department of Finance and can speak from his own personal experience of the stupidity of exercises of this kind. It is quite ridiculous and you may as well say that no function shall be exercised by the Minister for Health under this Bill save with the consent of the Government.  Nobody likes that because nobody assumes the Minister for Health in this or any other Government will go berserk and act contrary to the wishes of his colleagues in the Government.</P>
      <P>I would also say that it is unnecessary to insert into a Bill this particular section only to do something with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There is an assumption at law that Ministers act reasonably.  Mind you, I would say it is a legal assumption and there are many people who doubt it.  It is there and I am prepared to assume the Minister for Health, his successors, the Department of Health, the officials in local government and the local health boards will act reasonably. It does not need this type of stupid restriction on the exercise of their colleagues' wisdom in order to ensure that public money is not wasted. It is quite the reverse.  This will waste time and effort and will lead to delays which could be avoided if you trusted those men.  In the Department of Local Government there are financial experts, there is to be a local government auditor to audit the accounts and there will be qualified officers and accountants in the various health boards but apparently this legislature is being asked not to trust those people but to say that some junior clerk in the Department of Finance must be consulted before those people in their collective wisdom can say this is the way it should be done.  This is ludicrous, it is Gilbertian and it would need a Jonathan Swift to do credit to it.  Again, apparently I am unable to persuade the Minister to see my thinking in the matter.</P>

Sections 29 and 30 clearly give full authority <Col N="1379" /> to the Minister for Health in the preparation of estimates for expenditure and section 26 simply says the accounts are to be kept in such a form.

I refuse to believe the Minister for Finance would insist on changing it the whole time.  The normal practice would be for a single set of regulations covering the whole accounts of all the health boards in the same way to be in operation for a period of years, perhaps, unless it was found right, not only for the purpose of correct budgetary procedure but for making comparisons of a social kind in relation to social examination or examination of total social expenditure.  The Minister for Finance might ask to have this document slightly amended so as to differentiate between certain expenditures in order that the whole of the social health expenditure and social welfare expenditure could be analysed in a certain way.  In the ordinary way there will be one book of regulations and it will not be changed every year.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on what the Minister said about budgeting. The greatest upsetters are budgets. Those upsets were caused on many occasions by the Minister for Finance followed by the Minister for Health.  I would say in the last three years in succession we got out our estimates, got them sanctioned and all the rest of it.  Two weeks later the Minister gave an enormous increase in the capitation rates to voluntary hospitals. Our accounts went up some hundreds of thousands and that had to be carried on into the next year.  I assume the Minister for Health sanctioned that with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  That upset the budget.  The Minister cannot make a case in relation to budgets being upset because if there is an election budgets are upset <Col N="1380" /> and the Minister for Finance can go on living.</P>

      <P>Section 26 deals with accounts and section 29 deals with estimates which are hypothetical.  They are a matter of prophecy.  Accounts are concerned with facts.  These are estimates of future receipts and expenditure. Apparently we have no prophets in the Department of Finance and there is no point in consulting the Minister in that regard.  It is good to see apparently that somebody's mind was not overcome with the conservative ideas that what our grandfathers did was good enough for us when we came to section 29.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as drafted, proposes to remove from health boards the tremendous scope which they had in relation to the preparation of estimates and the improvement of the health schemes which they could suggest. Section 29 is surrendering a great deal of the freedom, a great deal of the authority, a great deal of the responsibility which health authorities previously had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives to health boards an obligation to prepare and to notify estimates to the Department, but under section 29 let them be aware of the <Col N="1381" /> fact that it sounds the death knell of the responsibility which health authorities had up to now and which was responsible for having health schemes trimmed to the needs of their respective localities.  From now on the health authorities will not have any say in the determination of the services in relation to their own communities.</P>

In cases where the health authority exercise that discretion they may well have to pay for the services so provided entirely out of the rates and they may do so in the knowledge that they will have to face the full bill themselves.

      <P>The Ryans are on lean times, but the same cannot be said of the Burkes.  This immense responsibility which was exercised by health authorities, particularly that of Dublin, is going.  I can recall one case in recent times when the Dublin Health Authority became aware that a hostel was about to be put on the open market for sale by a charitable organisation who were abandoning it. The health authority wanted to acquire it so that it could be made available as a halfway house, so to speak, for people who had been in mental institutions, had been cured and were on the way back into society but who had not homes of their own to go to. It was recommended by the authority's chief psychiatrist that such a halfway <Col N="1383" /> house should be established as an intermediate stage in the final treatment and rehabilitation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened was that the Dublin Health Authority were unable at the critical time to get sanction for that proposal.  Had they not had the discretion to say that not-withstanding the failure of the Minister for Health to approve the scheme they would go ahead anyway, they would have lost the opportunity to buy this building at an attractive price and they would have lost the opportunity of providing at a fair cost this most desirable accommodation for those unfortunate people.  Ministerial sanction came only after the health authority had decided to pay the sum necessary out of their own funds to provide this vital need.  That freedom is going because section 30 sets out clearly:</P>
      <P>A health board shall not, save with the Minister's consent, incur expenditure for any service or purpose within any period in excess of such sums as may be specified by the Minister in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>What will happen in the financial year 1971-72 is that the Minister shall say: &ldquo;You shall spend £X and no more.&rdquo; It will be no longer open to the health authority to have supplementary estimates.  They must keep within targets already set by the Minister.</P>
      <P>This is an undesirable development, and Deputy Burke knows it because I can see tears falling down his kindly face when he thinks of what will happen to the Joneses and the Burkes who will have to wait until the following year before the health authority can come to their aid.</P>

Anybody with any experience of a health authority knows that it deals with a multitude of unpredictable human problems, and if a health authority has not in the future the discretion it enjoyed in the past, a great deal of the humanitarian work and financial saving which health authorities were able to effect in the past, will be prevented.  That is a retrograde step and something nobody with a progressive outlook and an understanding of the problems of health authorities would welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy because my interpretation of section 30 is that it is intended to deal with something bigger than the ordinary everyday running of affairs. While I made a hypothetical case, jokingly, a few moments ago, I did not take it seriously because the discretionary clause in the old Health Act was a great boon to all concerned. It gave every councillor or member of a board and the executive officer and the Minister the right to apply discretion when it came to a deserving case. We had cases of people in receipt of £1,000 or £2,000 a year who lived up to it and then became ill and went to hospital.  We found in a short time we had to look after their wives and <Col N="1385" /> families.  Without the discretionary clause in the Health Act we could not do that.  It was a great humanitarian clause.  We do not want to see anybody in our society hungry or in want no matter what it will cost the State. For that reason I imagine section 30 is intended to deal with bigger things involving the spending of thousands of pounds on hospital buildings.  However, the Minister will no doubt interpret it later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister anything to say?  Am I right in believing that this discretionary power which health authorities had hithterto to bring in supplementary estimates and provide for certain expenditure entirely out of their own resources is going under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If the health board propose some supplementary expenditure during the year and are willing to raise it purely from the rates it will be up to me to see they get the money one way or another and, if necessary, that the rates for the ensuing year will be raised to cover the deficiency.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, expenditure for people with medical cards and the middle income groups is to a very considerable degree open ended.  That is one of the difficulties the Minister for Finance faces.  Unemployment benefit and social welfare assistance are open ended and money has to be found either by supplementary estimate or in some other way.  The House is fully aware that these two services I have mentioned, the medical card payments and middle income payments, are open ended and if the number of people with medical cards happened to increase over what was reasonably estimated when the health board sent their estimates of health expenditure forward, there is nothing the Minister for Finance or I could do about it.  If there happened to be a very severe epidemic of 'flu or any other malady in the community, however, as this section reads I cannot say to the health board: &ldquo;You cannot spend any more even though people are having 'flu with complications.&rdquo;  It is open ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I do not think Deputies need worry about this.  The strictness provided for in these sections is at least basically reasonable.  It is not a good thing to have a loose form of budgeting in advance in which there is not full understanding between the health board, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  I do not think that would encourage the Minister for Finance to provide more funds but I can see an inevitable and reasonable flexibility in this, as I have described. As the House is aware, there are new services which must come out of funds provided by the Minister and not from the rates.  When the Health Bill passes and the various sections are put intc operation there will be expanding health services.  I shall not go into them now; that has been done already: these must be met out of taxation if we are ever to find a satisfactory solution to the contribution problem by a combination of both rates and taxes I cannot concede in the future that health expenditure will be limited frozen or cut down through any fell plot arising out of some dreadful interpretation of a section of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The functions which Deputy Ryan states Dublin Health Authority now have would, I believe, be functions of the local authorities throughout the country.  No doubt those local authorities would repay on those cards.  In other words, Dublin Corporation or the county council, if they so wished, could buy a hospital with their own funds and the Department of Health would have no say about it.</P>
      <P>Arising from something Deputy Burke said, suppose the local health board write off hospital accounts which at the end of the year amount to say £5,000, will they have to get sanction from the Department for this or does this function lie with the executive officer?  In fact this would be an extra expenditure by the health board and I expect the CEO could make his decision without referring back to the Minister or the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Gibbons, Dublin Corporation could not at present buy a hospital for use for health purposes because under the legislation establishing that health authority this is a function of the health authority, which is a separate statutory body.  In any area where there is a separate health authority as distinct from the local authority, which in many regions is the health authority, the health authority has the health function and the local authority does not come into it except that at present the local authority receive a demand from the health authority to produce the money to pay for the services which the health authority have decided should be provided. Dublin Corporation, for instance, cannot say to Dublin Health Authority: &ldquo;You may not render such a service&rdquo; or &ldquo;You may not make a certain purchase.&rdquo;  All the corporation may say is: &ldquo;We do not think you should do it&rdquo; or &ldquo;We think you should do it&rdquo; but they may not say: &ldquo;You shall not do it.&rdquo;  They must provide the money.  This legislation proposes that what has hitherto operated in the Dublin Health Authority area and in other areas where there are health authorities like Limerick, Cork and Waterford, will apply all over the country.  So Roscommon County Council, for example, as a county council will no longer be the body which will decide what should be done but it will be the health board for the region in which Roscommon is situated that will make such decisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes light of my worries and, while I know he is an optimist&mdash;I am too&mdash;I think we must look at the realities.  A chief executive officer is in the situation that if, at any time, he is of opinion that a decision, or a proposed decision, of the board would incur expenditure by the board in contravention of the section, he shall so inform the board and the Minister.  A chief executive officer may not do anything which would add one halfpenny beyond that which had previously been authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that, with the best will in the world, and with the most expeditious system of administration, there will be gaps between the time <Col N="1388" /> that members of health boards decide that a certain expenditure is desirable and the receipt of approval from the Minister.  This is a mandatory section which absolutely prohibits the incurring of any expenditure beyond that which is already prescribed.  There is no room for manoeuvre.  There is no opportunity available to anybody to exercise discretion.  No one may even take a chance that consent will be forthcoming because something is such an obvious need.  No one can even say that there is a mandatory obligation on us, in other sections and regulations made by the Minister, to offer service to particular people.</P>
    <P>That obligation may be there but we are not in a position to carry it out because section 30 says we cannot go beyond the money already prescribed for us, and that is that.  Knowing many of the good public officials that I do, and other Members of the House know, it is certain that they will not go beyond what they are permitted to expend under section 30, no matter how desirable the object or how humanitarian it may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that social welfare assistance is open-ended.  It is so open-ended, and the Minister is so aware that it is open-ended, that he has transferred the assistance activities from the health authorities and handed them back to the local authorities. This is something with which people in urban areas with health authority as distinct from local authorities are familiar.  Dublin Health Authority operate home assistance. Under the home assistance service they operate &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; and other ancillary aids to give domiciliary care particularly to elderly people, all of which has had a dramatic effect in reducing the cost of maintaining elderly and disabled people in institutions.</P>
    <P>This, of course, has been quite a considerable burden and, in fact, is one of the main reasons for increases in rates, because the State has not carried any share of this increased assistance burden.  While it was the responsibility of the health authority it was open to deputations to urge the Minister to persuade the Minister for Finance to treat them as health matters.  I am sure <Col N="1389" /> my colleagues on the Dublin Health Authority, Deputy Burke and Deputy Clinton and our present distinguished chairman, Deputy Dockrell, and others, will verify that this has often been urged and that we have gone on deputations to the Minister for Health in the Custom House and have received from successive Ministers every encouragement that the day would come when these assistance services would be treated as proper health matters and receive, as a consequence, assistance under the Health Vote.</P>
    <P>What is proposed here is to take these open-ended services away from the health boards lest they should cause difficulty in relation to section 30. This is an alarming section.  We are entirely justified in saying we oppose section 30 because it is so repugnant to the kind of activity which health authorities should be free to engage in. It will cause difficulties.  I do not like being a prophet of gloom, and it will be no consolation to any member of the Fine Gael Party to say whenever difficulties arise: &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo; We do not want to be in a position to say that, or even be tempted to say it.  That is why we urge the Minister between now and Report Stage to endeavour to provide some degree of flexibility for the health boards, even if the price of exercising that discretion is that the total cost of exercising it has to be recovered out of the local rates.</P>
    <P>That is an immense break.  I have known of desirable schemes which members of the Dublin Health Authority wanted to adopt but the fact that they had to pay for them entirely out of the rates without any assistance from central Government caused them no little anguish in deciding whether they should be provided.  Even that measure of discretion, if left, would provide room for manoeuvre so that consultations could continue after the expenditure arose, if it was necessary to do so in the absence of the consent of the Minister.  That is the way to get around this difficulty and avoid the pitfalls which we believe are inevitable otherwise.</P>

      <P>You have to read section 30 as following on section 29.  I am open to correction, but my reading is this: The health authority prepare their estimates.  They are sent to the Minister.  The Minister gives a global OK.  They are specified under various headings.  There is an open-ended element in this and that is the element of the health cards.  That is as open-ended as social welfare.  The health authority make their estimate based on their experience during the year.  That goes to the Minister and under section 30 he gives a global OK. We do it every year in the county council.  We strike a rate and we say that we will produce no proposal during the year which would mean the spending of another penny.  That is what the Minister is telling the health authority under section 30, they having produced the figure under section 29. That is the way I read it.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Lenihan is overlooking the fact that at the moment the local authority have discretion to bring in a supplementary estimate for additional expenditure which becomes necessary.  That power will not be available to a health board. It is stuck to a figure, and may not go beyond it.  It may go back to the Minister and the Minister may consider whether he will give it to the health authority.  He may say we can be certain that it will always be given in relation to medical cards particularly under this Act as they will become a statutory right for certain classes of people in any event; but there are other forms of expenditure and they will not be tolerated because the power which a local authority has to bring in a supplementary estimate will not be available to the new health boards.</P>
      <P>I am assured&mdash;and I do not believe I am breaking any confidence in saying this&mdash;by a number of people who work in local government that with section 30 as it stands at the moment they would not spend one penny beyond the figure permitted even if it meant that some person had to wait for necessary medical attention.  It just could not be done and they would not do it because, if they did, they could be surcharged.</P>

      <P>I have been at a meeting which the Minister attended and the three counties concerned were fully represented. To my amazement they came to absolute agreement in about one-tenth of the time I thought it would take to come to agreement, and I am sure there was no man more amazed than the Minister when it happened. I should like to point out to Deputy Ryan that no matter how bad the service may be under this new scheme it cannot be any worse than it is at the moment.  It is for that reason we are backing it.  If Deputy Ryan feels that the public representatives in Dublin are justified in keeping somebody out of hospital or without medical attention simply because money was not passed before the 31st of the previous March, that is not a proper approach.  These health boards will be legally bound to provide this service and whether they be paid in that year or in the next year there should be no serious problem involved. I certainly hope that there will be no law case over this as there was over the fluoridation of the water some time ago.</P>

      <P>The amendments which I tabled on behalf of Fine Gael were for the purpose of getting a change which is most desired in Ireland in relation to our health services, that is, a change in the method of financing them.  We believe it is wrong that we should continue to operate a system whereby the State accepts responsibility for only one half of the cost of health services, and that is the only statutory obligation which the Fianna Fáil Party are accepting under this much vaunted piece of legislation.  It was introduced at the end of a decade of long debates on the issue of whether or not the health services should be paid for out of the rates.  The Government's own White Paper which was produced after many agonising years of inactivity acknowledged that rates were not a proper form for the financing of health services and undertook that the contribution to the cost of health services as of 1966 would be maintained at that figure and that any increase would be paid for by the State.  If the Government had honoured their obligation in that regard the Government would now be defraying 70 per cent of the cost of health services.  On the Government's own figures they are defraying only 56 per cent of the cost of the health services so that on their own undertaking in their own White Paper three years ago the Government are defaulting to the extent of 14 per cent of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged on all sides of the House that the Bill is taking many powers from local authorities.  It is taking away discretion which local authorities previously had to provide services beyond those sanctioned by the Minister.  There is hardly anything which health boards may do in future which has not received the prior <Col N="1393" /> sanction of the Minister for Health. There is hardly anything which can be done save in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Minister for Health.  More and more power is taken away from the local authorities, from those who represent the people who are being called upon through the rates to pay for half the cost of the health services.  Then at the end of it all, after the Government's own acknowledgment that rates should not be used to finance health services, the Government are proposing to crystallise in this legislation the thing which they admit is wrong.</P>
    <P>This is a deplorable admission of failure.  It is a confidence trick.  They paraded themselves as the great reformers who were going to clean up the in justice of making rates pay so much for health services, and then this Bill which is still being vaunted as a piece of social progress, which is still being paraded as providing relief, will do no more than maintain the thing which is accepted as the most glaring injustice of our present health services.</P>
    <P>This section 31 will also take away from local authorities the power which is now a reserved function of a local authority, a power which is conferred on the local authority and not on the manager, that is, the power to strike the rate.  As far as the health services are concerned, it is the Minister for Local Government who will strike the rate in future and the Minister for Local Government will send the bill, for the health services for which the Government will not pay, to the local authorities.  Then it will have to be paid, and the reason for doing this is quite clearly to prevent any other local authority taking the courageous stand which was taken earlier this year by Dublin Corporation and by the Bray Urban District Council.  In future it will not even be open to a local authority to refuse to be a party to a system which it knows to be unjust; it will no longer be open to a local authority to say to the Government: &ldquo;You acknowledged in the White Paper your policy was wrong and we insist, now that you have admitted you were wrong, that you live up to what you have undertaken to do,&rdquo; because in future <Col N="1394" /> the bill will go to the local authority who will receive it from the Minister for Health who will have processed it through the hands of the Department of Finance.  This is one of the most objectionable sections of this very disappointing Bill because it is only maintaining what has been admitted to being so unjust.</P>

      <P>At the outset I hope we can discuss this matter amicably and objectively.  In the course of the questions on this subject there have been many exchanges across the House and a certain amount of heat.  I bear my share of the blame for this because in trying to get information which the Minister does not always want to give, and in trying to get it against a certain amount of legitimate opposition from the other side, one sometimes gets more heated than one should.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister in this.  He is, I know, doing his best with a difficult problem.  He did not create the problem, he inherited it.  I am not even convinced the origin of the problem lies with the previous Minister.  It might lie outside politics to some degree.  I think the Minister will approach this with an open mind; he has claimed he will approach it objectively and I am sure he will.  I should like to pay tribute also to Deputy Herbert who has done his best in this matter, although some of his interjections directed at me have suggested that he was not entirely in sympathy with my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to make clear the policy of the Fine Gael Party and also my own personal policy on the subject of small schools.  When the question of small schools came up as a result of the Investment in Education report this party adopted a clear-cut policy and it has adhered to that policy ever since.  The Government also adopted a similar policy although it may now appear that they are departing somewhat from it.  Our policy was that one-teacher schools ought to <Col N="1395" /> go, that the case against them was overwhelming. There might be some rare exceptions such as a school on an island, but subject to these rare exceptions one-teacher schools should go.  We also felt that the case made in the Investment in Education report on two-teacher schools was very strong, not as overwhelming, but very strong, and in most cases two-teacher schools should be closed.  They should be examined as individual cases and in some cases it would be found&mdash;and this was stated in our policy&mdash;that the continuance of some such schools could be justified.</P>
    <P>The most powerful case of all is where a school is in the process of qualifying to become a three-teacher school.  Indeed, the evidence in the Investment in Education report between one- and two-teacher schools on the one hand and three-, four-, five- and six-teacher schools on the other is very clear and very cogent.  In table 9 (13) it is made clear that there has been a problem about children in one- and two-teacher schools getting scholarships and that in three-teacher schools the problem is not of the same magnitude at all.  In table 9 (17) it is shown that the proportion of three-teacher schools which are old is not alone less than in the case of the smaller schools but less than in the case of the larger schools, 35 against 40 per cent being pre-1900.  In table 9 (18) it shows the proportion with drinking water and flush toilets in three-teacher schools is twice the proportion in two-teacher schools.  In table 9 (11) it is shown that the cost per pupil place is less in three-teacher schools than in any other size, bigger or smaller.  In table 9 (10) it is shown that non-teacher current costs are 2½ times in a one-teacher school what they are in a two-teacher school, whereas as the schools get bigger the difference is not very great.  Having examined these figures the Government rightly decided&mdash;and the Opposition rightly decided&mdash;that one-teacher schools should be closed with the exception of the rare cases I have mentioned of schools on islands, that two-teacher schools should be generally closed, subject to special exceptions, each case being reviewed on <Col N="1396" /> its merits, but that there should not be a policy of closing three-teacher schools.  No such policy was at any stage announced, no such policy was endorsed by the Opposition, and as far as I am aware, no such policy was endorsed by the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants my own views on the subject they are set out in two articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 23rd and 24th February, 1966.  Throughout those articles there was a clear distinction made between one- and two-teacher schools and three-teacher schools.  The Minister has made clear the general policy of his Department. He has told us that there were 22 cases to date out of over 600 where three-teacher schools have been closed. He was actually asked how many schools with over 80 pupils have been closed, but he did not answer that question.  I should like to know how many schools with more than 85 pupils have been closed.  At the time when this school was closed the average attendance in the quarter ended June, 1969 was 85.5, this is the Minister's own figure, and it was on this figure that the decision to close the school was taken.</P>

      <P>The closure of schools with three or more teachers and over 80 pupils is rare.  The Minister said that in one case out of these 22 schools which were closed some opposition was voiced.  It is clear, therefore, that the case of Mountpelier is unique in that it is the only place where there has been serious opposition. My party would agree that if there are three-teacher schools and the parents agree, they should be closed and as the Minister has told us, the great majority of cases of closure of three-teacher schools has involved the merger of boys and girls schools side by side, and the parents were whole-heartedly in favour of it.  The closure, however, of a school with 85.5 pupils, <Col N="1397" /> according to the figure here, is something which runs outside the Government's policy and for that reason we oppose it; it is also contrary to our policy.  The Minister said, in reply to a question as to when the Government decided to close three-teacher schools and I quote:</P>
      <P>It was originally accepted by all sides but as usual when the Fine Gael Party found themselves in difficulties they did an about turn with regard to this particular matter.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have never proposed the closure of three-teacher schools against the wishes of the parents and neither have the Government. There is some confusion here.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the other side of the House do not consider their Minister capable of replying.  I am quite sure he is capable of replying. According to the Minister's reply to my Question No. 114 of the 13th November, 1969, the number of pupils increased in this school by 30.1 per cent in the four years ended September, 1969.  We have a school with a population expanding at a remarkably rapid rate over this period.  The Minister told us that this school was entitled to three teachers, in reply to Question No. 109 of the 30th October, because there was an average enrolment of 80 pupils for two consecutive quarters and that he says is what is required for a third teacher.  There seems to be some confusion here as to the interpretation of this because in reply to Question No. 118 of the 13th November the Minister gave the following figures for the following period of two successive quarters.  The two quarters ended 30th September, 1967, 80.1; the two quarters ended 30th March, 1968, 80.8; the two quarters ended 30th June, 1968, 81.6; the two quarters ended 30th September, 1968, 80.8.  In the following two quarters the <Col N="1398" /> average for the two successive quarters fell below 80; in the third quarter after that, ended 30th June, 1969, the average for the two preceding quarters was 81.25 and in the quarter ended 30th September, 1969, the last quarter the school was officially opened, 84.1.  For six of the eight last periods of two consecutive quarters, therefore, the average enrolment exceeded 80.</P>
      <P>The Minister, interpreting this more narrowly, originally said this was true of one quarter, then amended his reply and when I expressed surprise that he should say in relation to the annual averages he had given that there was only one period of two consecutive quarters of over 80, asked me was I suggesting that the teacher had falsified the rolls.  I said I was merely suggesting that statistically his statement was improbable.  Next week I was proved right.  The Minister came in and very properly stated that he had made a mistake and stated that in two periods of two consecutive quarters this figure had applied.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that his interpretation is a narrow one because, as I have stated, both in the two quarters immediately preceding and immediately following, the average of those two quarters is over 80 and my reading of an average enrolment of 80 for two consecutive quarters required is that, if you get two consecutive quarters and average the figures for the two consecutive quarters and get over 80, entitlement is fulfilled.  The Minister interprets if differently for reasons that I do not understand and he then omitted any reference to the last period of two quarters ended 30th September, 1969, and he did not give the figure of 81.25 for the two quarters ended 30th June.  As I say, for six of the eight last periods of two consecutive quarters, the average for the two quarters was over 80.  That is the position as regards this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then said that prospective enrolment figures would not have warranted a third teacher in Mountpelier in the future if the school were retained.  I do not understand the relevance of this remark because he has told us that the rule under which the entitlement arises relates to the <Col N="1399" /> actual enrolment over two preceding quarters.  His view of the prospects at the school is, therefore, not relevant and, in any event, in view of the upward trend of attendances and in view of the number of children under school age&mdash;which I shall come back to&mdash;I do not think that his opinion is warranted by the facts.</P>
    <P>What then of the future of the school?  The Minister says that 31 children were born within the area who have not attended school.  I pressed him for the meaning of &ldquo;born within the area&rdquo;.  He denied that this excluded children born in a Limerick nursing home and then redefined &ldquo;born in the area&rdquo;&mdash;a very interesting definition of the word &ldquo;born&rdquo;&mdash;as meaning all children who were eligible to go to the school from the particular area of that school.  Therefore, those are eligible who are eligible.  This seems to me an inadequate definition, certainly a new definition of being born. Who are eligible?  I understand that all children are eligible under the national school system to attend any national school and it was ruled in the Supreme Court in 1942 or 1943 that the State could not direct them to attend a particular national school.  I should like to ask the source of the figure of 31.  My understanding is that this figure was arrived at by a survey by a teacher not familiar with the area, asking children at the school to assist him to get the figures.  If not, what is the source of the figure and how was the survey carried out?</P>

      <P>The Minister can reply.  The Minister has told us that he twice verified the figure.  How did he verify it?  Who counted the children in the area?  I can tell him that my information, which I shall submit to him, name for name, address for address, is that there are at the present time 44 children under school age.  Of these, almost all&mdash;I think 40&mdash;are, in fact, aged under five and three or four are just five&mdash;a month or so above that.  The great majority are under three.  I would ask him, therefore, to <Col N="1400" /> accept the information I shall submit to him and objectively&mdash;because I believe he will treat this objectively&mdash;examine it to see whether a mistake has not been made.  A mistake can occur.  People can make mistakes and, whoever is to blame, it is not the Minister.  He was not the Minister when the mistake was made.  I would ask him to be prepared to examine the information I have given him.</P>
      <P>Other facts about the present position that I should like to put forward are: The parents are in occupation of the school.  The teacher who is now teaching is a graduate of Queen's University. We have been told that a number of parents bought tickets for their children &mdash;&ldquo;purchased&rdquo; was the word, subsequently changed to &ldquo;got tickets for their children,&rdquo; to go elsewhere.  The fact is that the eleven children in respect of whom tickets were bought are now remaining in the school and attending it because there is now a teacher teaching there.  So that particular point is no longer valid.  We were also told, I think by Deputy Herbert, that none of those who had gone to Castleconnell school would return.  In the case of at least six there is a firm statement that if the Minister reverses the position they will return.  My personal belief is that others will follow.</P>

      <P>I will submit the names to the Minister privately.  I am certainly not going to name them in this House.  There is, I think, a mystery about this as to how this thing came about.  Why was the question of replacement raised?  This school, which I have seen myself, is in better condition than a very high proportion of national schools in Ireland.  We all know in this House the pressure there is to replace schools in the condition they are in.  Why was this school brought up for replacement at this stage?  Why was it necessary to act precipitately by sending the children on 1st October to the new school where the improved accommodation was not available? The Minister has said the reason was to give the benefit of improved accommodation from the earliest possible date.  But, in fact, improved <Col N="1401" /> accommodation is not yet available. That does not hold water.  Why was there no real consultation with the parents?  They were not consulted by the manager.  There was no real consultation by the Department.  An official went down and spoke to them. Six of the seven people who spoke said they were representatives at the meeting.  That was accepted by those present.  They spoke against.  One spoke for, and he was a county councillor of the Minister's Party.  A show of hands showed virtual unanimity against.  How could an inspector report back from such a meeting that the parents were in favour of the change, as he appears to have done, or did he do so?  Could we be informed what the inspector did report back?  What does the Minister mean by saying, &ldquo;I consulted all the relevant people&rdquo;&mdash;I quote&mdash;before making his decision?  He did not consult the parents.  Are they not relevant?  Under our Constitution, they are not only relevant but the only relevant people who have the primary right and duty in respect of educating their children.</P>
      <P>We have to accept that this is not just a State problem.  The Church is also involved.  The managers are the parents' representatives.  The Church's teaching is absolutely unqualified on this point.  The parents have all the rights.  They may delegate them to managers but the managers in that event have the absolute right to act on behalf of the parents and there will be found in no part of any teaching of the Catholic Church anything that deviates from that.  Similarly, the State has under the Constitution the absolute obligation to respect parents' rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that parents' rights are absolute.  Of course, in certain circumstances the community as a whole may decide that parents must send their children to school or must have them educated.  We have decided that in this country.  If that is applied uniformly and fairly, parents must accept it.  The community may decide that all one-teacher schools must be closed and some parents may resist that because they do not know what is best for their children and that decision, applied uniformly and fairly, is one that has to be accepted.  It is <Col N="1402" /> quite a different matter if particular schools are selected for particular treatment, different from others, particularly a school of this size.  In these circumstances, the parents' rights do apply because you cannot pick on some parents and treat them separately and the Constitution will not permit you to do so.</P>
    <P>If the State and the Church at any stage join together against the parents to arrange things against their wishes, behind their back, this would be a double betrayal of basic rights.  It would discredit the whole system of the primary schools and would raise the question of a total review of the system.  The only justification of a system which does not give formal rights to parents is that in practice it ensures these rights prevail.  Should it fail to do so, then we have a duty as Christians and as citizens to review it.  If this kind of situation occurs we will have to consider our duty from that respect.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in conclusion that it is sad that parents in defence of their natural rights should have fallen foul of the law and the editorial in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> under the heading &ldquo;This is not the way to solve it&rdquo; makes that point very clear. The last quotation I want to give the House to end on&mdash;and I think it is the kind of note I should end on&mdash;is from the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>The fact that we see two views in this dispute means something, that there is room for calm discussion and hope for real co-operation.  Both sides seem to have taken a hard line. Why not try reasonable discussion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now time, I think, for us to discuss education and educational facilities.  When I, as Minister for Education, come to examine the educational facilities to be provided in any area I am guided in my decision, after the fullest consideration, only by what appears to be the best in the interests of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy is that, when a one- or a two-teacher school comes up for replacement or when a teacher, in such a school, retires and it is not likely the <Col N="1403" /> average will be maintained, we examine the whole educational structure in the area with a view to providing the best possible facilities for the children in the area.  Each case is examined on its merits.  When we decide on amalgamation we consult with the manager and, through the manager, with the parents and also with the teachers.  On some occasions &mdash;when the necessity arises which is rare enough&mdash;we send down an inspector to explain to the parents the advantages of the amalgamation and we endeavour to get the greatest possible co-operation between all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have on occasion here heard Opposition Deputies comment adversely on the public relations between the Department of Education and the parents.  In a relatively short number of years we have closed 614 schools. Of this 614 we have not had any real difficulty except in about a dozen schools.  In the light of that experience, it seems ridiculous to suggest that the public relations of the Department of Education should be judged on the basis of the small number in which we have had difficulty while the 600, or so, cases in which we had relatively no trouble at all are ignored.</P>
    <P>We, in the Fianna Fáil Party, have provided free education for our children.  We have provided it in primary, post-primary and, to a certain extent, in higher education as well.  All our activities have been geared to equal educational opportunity for all our children.  It must, however, be admitted that there can be no real equality of opportunity unless it begins at the primary school level.  Through our amalgamation policy we are providing extra teachers in our primary schools in order to give, as far as possible, equal opportunity to all our children.  It would, I think, be very wrong of me, if an opportunity presented itself to help a greater number of children by way of improved facilities, to choose to have undue regard to a smaller number&mdash; provided, of course, I was not doing an injustice to anybody.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mountpelier, we had <Col N="1404" /> a school in particularly bad condition. One of the rooms was too small; sanitation was almost non-existent; the playground was far too small for the number attending the school.  It was obvious the school was in line for replacement.</P>
    <P>In support of an argument that this could be, or should be, a three-teacher school we have had various figures bandied about.  For quite a considerable time now one particular figure&mdash; 86&mdash;has been tossed around.  Of this figure of 86, three were children who came from Limerick and for a short period attended the school, but they were never placed on the roll and have returned to Limerick.  One child was enrolled who should never have been enrolled because of a physical defect. Four children, who had come from England, were temporarily enrolled; three of these have now left the locality.  The actual figure at the end of September was 79.</P>
    <P>I want now to make it clear that this school was not, either on the date of closure, or on the date on which the decision to close it was taken, entitled to be a three-teacher school.  Not only that but, even if it had been, it was very obvious from the figures that it would in a very short time have on the roll a number very much below the retention figure.  The fact is that 54 children were due to leave that school in the next five years and that there were only 31 children to replace them.  This means that, in five years time, there would be only 56 on the roll.  There are peak and valley periods in enrolment in practically all rural schools.  There is nothing abnormal about this.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke here of the very rapid rise in the number in the school and referred to the high percentage increase between 1965 and 1969.  Deputy FitzGerald knows perfectly well that, had he asked me the percentage reduction from 1959 to 1963, he would have had an equally steep decline.</P>

      <P>I am merely pointing out that there are peak and valley <Col N="1405" /> periods.  The peak had been reached and a valley period was setting in once more.  Not only that but, in five years time, the number would be lower than it has been for a very long time.  I do not accept the figure of 43 given by Deputy FitzGerald.  I know that to make up this number&mdash;incidentally, it has now become 44&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the only way in which it could be done would be by including a number of children coming from families who did not traditionally send their children to Mountpelier. My figure is one I got on three different occasions and it was compiled by people born and reared in the district.</P>
      <P>I could not consider Mountpelier in isolation.  I had to take into consideration the whole area including Bridgetown and Castleconnell as well as Mountpelier.  If children from Killaloe parish attending Mountpelier school went to Bridgetown which is in that parish we would have a viable three-teacher school in Bridgetown; and if the children from Castleconnell parish, who had been attending Mountpelier, went to Castleconnell school, its future as a six-teacher school would be assured.  In that case, the children from Mountpelier going to Bridgetown would have a viable three-teacher school, instead of a two-teacher school, and the children going to Castleconnell would have a six-teacher school instead of a two-teacher school.  On top of that, we would be giving to the children already in Bridgetown the benefit of a three-teacher school.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is reported as having attended a meeting in Mountpelier and as having stated there that the people in Mountpelier had a good case.  What Deputy FitzGerald would, in fact, succeed in doing would be to condemn the children in Mountpelier and Bridgetown to two-teacher schools for a very, very long time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> There has been a great deal of talk about parents' rights.  I fully accept that parents have rights but I also believe that children have rights, particularly in relation to education.  It is interesting to note that, if some of the children who are living in Mountpelier walked to Bridgetown, they would not be any further away from school than some of the children from a neighbouring parish who attended Mountpelier. Surely it is not suggested that the people in that particular parish have been denied civil rights all down through the years.</P>
    <P>When Deputy FitzGerald refers to parents and parents' rights he is referring only to those parents who attended his meetings.  What about the parents who sent their children to the schools in Castleconnell and Bridgetown or the parents who have been issued with tickets?</P>
    <P>I repeat that there are few Deputies in this House who have as clear an insight into the feeling of people in rural Ireland for their own particular locality as I have.  I appreciate and have sympathy with their fear that the closure of their school may lower the status of their area, but the education of their children is far more important than any such feeling and that has been accepted by the majority of the parents in those areas in which schools have been closed.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the parents in Mountpelier to send their children back to school in either Castleconnell or Bridgetown because the educational foundation laid now is of vital importance to their children.  No makeshift arrangement can compensate for the loss of a proper education.  I appeal to them not to allow themselves to be deluded by those with ulterior motives or duped into thinking that there is anything to be gained by keeping their children from school.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20th November, 1969.</P>
