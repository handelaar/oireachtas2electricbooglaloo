      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if negotiations have been resumed with other applicant countries regarding Ireland's entry to the EEC; and if negotiations will be conducted in conjunction with other countries or separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has yet been reached by the Council of Ministers of the European Communities on the question of the opening of negotiations with Ireland and the other applicant countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate if it is necessary for the Council to say to Ireland: &ldquo;we will open negotiations&rdquo; or can we not seek negotiations now when the situation seems slightly more favourable than heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our application is still before the Council of Ministers and there is no question of looking for a reopening of negotiations.  Our application is there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach says but surely it is a question of Ireland taking the initiative to open negotiations?  There is no use sitting down doing nothing. The matter has been going on now for years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of sitting down doing nothing.  It is <Col N="974" /> easy for the Deputy to come in here and make noises about doing something. We are doing something.  We are keeping in touch with the Community and the other applicant countries and as soon as the opportunity is appropriate we could put on whatever extra pressure is necessary, but it is just not appropriate at the moment.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach noted the disagreement of his Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the agriculture policy of the EEC?  Would this have any bearing on our eventual entry?  He will have noted that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries left the subject of Partition last week and is now concentrating on the Mansholt agricultural policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the agricultural policy of the EEC.  It is what is known as the Mansholt Plan and the Deputy also knows that that has not been adopted here or by the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the continuing conflict within the Nigerian territory between the Biafran and Federal forces with all the suffering imposed on this unhappy country, he will even at this late stage consider intervention at political level by an Irish delegation to endeavour to secure peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never been asked by either side to act as mediators in the Nigerian conflict and as I have repeatedly stated since my first reply to the Deputy on the matter in April last year, I do not think our offering to mediate would serve any useful purpose. Greatly as we all deplore the continuation of the civil war, we must face the fact that a stable solution cannot be imposed from outside and that futile attempts to do so may well prolong or intensity the conflict with all the suffering and destruction entailed for all sections of the Nigerian people. Indeed we are more than ever convinced that a peaceful and lasting solution can only be found through direct contact and agreement between the representatives of the Federal Government and the secessionist leaders.</P>
      <P>As I have often told the Deputy we did everything open to us to prevent the war and since it started to urge both sides towards conciliation and negotiation.  Only a few weeks ago I saw in my Department Mr. Ignatius Kogbara, a representative of Lieutenant Colonel Ojukwu, and I strongly urged him to make an all out effort at the meeting of the OAU Committee, which was then due to take place in Monrovia, to reach an agreement to end the war in the interests of all the people of Nigeria.  On the same day this plea was repeated to the Federal Government through our Embassy in Lagos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the meeting in Monrovia unfortunately failed to reach agreement upon the commencement of negotiations and hostilities have since intensified.  In all the circumstances, I feel that all friends of the Nigerian people should concentrate <Col N="978" /> their efforts on urging the parties concerned to establish direct contact with a view to the resumption of negotiations for a stable peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister ever made a direct attempt to bring the two sides together or to act himself as a possible negotiator at any time?  Or to appoint somebody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Ambassador here from Lagos and Ministers of the Federal Government on numberous occasions.  Our Ambassador in Lagos has seen members of the Federal Government.  On a number of occasions also I have seen representatives of Colonel Ojukwu.  On all these occasions we have pressed as strongly as possible the idea that direct contact should be established between the two sides in order to lay down the principles upon which negotiations could begin with a view to agreeing finally on a stable peace settlement acceptable to both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The indications from seed sales are that the wheat acreage this year may be about 10 per cent lower, and the feeding barley acreage about 8 per cent higher, than last year.  The Deputy will appreciate that the official figures of acreage, prepared by the Central Statistics Office, will not be available for a couple of months.</P>
      <P>I am unable to give a reliable estimate in regard to winter wheat or oats at this stage but I am advised that there has been a significant increase in sowings of winter wheat.</P>
      <P>Even with a 10 per cent decline in the wheat acreage, on the basis of yields in recent years production would exceed the 240,000 tons required for flour milling and a levy would accordingly be necessary if the surplus was of milling quality.  I do not, therefore, propose to take the action suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister knows that there is a ten per cent decrease in seed sales could he decide not to do what he has said he will do, namely, pay the farmers only two-thirds of their wheat cheque at harvest time and the balance some time later, when the levy has been decided and deducted?  Surely, there should be a broad approach to it?  Seeing that we now know there is a huge decrease in the amount sown, the Minister could produce a provisional levy on the basis of which the farmers would be paid the entire cheque.  The farmer has to pay for various things on 1st November&mdash;seeds, fertilisers and all the rest of the things that he pays for at harvest time.  If the Minister gives him only two-thirds of his proper cheque, the farmer will be seriously discommoded. We should now do as before&mdash;estimate the levy, carry on until the following year, and adjust the amount, either plus or minus.</P>

      <P>The grant at that stage was £8 per cow and calf unit under the scheme.  It was then decided by the Government that this grant should be increased by 50 per cent, that is, from £8 to £12 and because of this, and for this reason solely, people who might not have been attracted by the £8 grant would, perhaps, have been attracted by the higher grant and it was decided accordingly to extend the closing date for first applications.  This we did up to 18th April.  Subsequent to the 18th April there were some officers throughout the country who had difficulties with their consciences about accepting those applications that had come in by post and which were posted on Friday and Saturday and did not arrive until the day afterwards.  All these cases were solved by indicating that they could be accepted if they were suitable and qualified.  To propose a further extension at this stage would be rather upsetting in so far as the administration of the scheme requires that the numbers in all cases should be clearly identified, that staff would be deployed for this job and we will have to take staff from many other endeavours for a very short period in order to have a quick run of inspections so that they will not be spread out too long in the summer. An extension at this stage would be upsetting to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say, in addition, that any farmer who is to qualify under this scheme must not have supplied milk for <Col N="987" /> sale since 1st April last.  There may be some people now thinking about applying who in the meantime have been supplying milk and, even if their applications were taken up, they would not be qualified for grants in this first year of operation.  Finally, even if they are people who have not been supplying milk, they have had two opportunities which were well publicised and they did not take them and they are now open to participate as from next September-October.  They do not really miss a year; they miss the first inspection and can come in on the second inspection if they apply now and come to be considered suitable at a later date but not on the first run.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Bainne is already responsible for most exports of dairy products, the exceptions being certain special exports by manufacturing firms here to associated firms abroad.  With regard to quality control this is more appropriately carried out by the State than by an organisation engaged in commercial trading.</P>
      <P>As regards the home market, I would point out that the board was established primarily to deal with exports of dairy products.  However, an extension of the board's functions to include particular functions in relation to the home market may be considered where appropriate, but the need for such an extension would have to be clearly demonstrated before these functions could be taken away from the co-operative or private interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the longer established marketing agencies that we have, where quality is a very essential ingredient, is in relation to the seed potato industry and nobody has ever suggested&mdash;not even in the Coalition's time, and God knows they suggested some queer ones&mdash;that the quality control should be handed over to the Potato Marketing Board.  It is being done by the departmental inspectors over the years very successfully and we are maintaining a very high quality product which is being sold by the marketing board.  Why should we make these changes to bring about a situation of which we have no experience when we are well satisfied with the experience we have got in those two cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that there has been endless criticism of the Potato Marketing Board and of its failure to sell more and more potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I criticised the Potato Marketing Board before ever I came to where I am now, but I cannot do so to the same extent now because I would be taken up on it and the same applies to the Deputy.  The board have been criticised because they do not sell more, but where is the analogy between criticising the board because they do not sell more and making the criticism that Bord Bainne who are responsible <Col N="990" /> for selling should also be responsible for quality inspection at home?  These two things are completely opposite.</P>

      <P>If any person feels that he has suffered loss or damage as a result of works it is open to him to claim compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  In the assessment of compensation regard must be had to the benefit brought by the drainage works to the property of the claimant.  Compensation claims may be determined by arbitration in default of agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the case the Deputy has in mind is that in which he has been in correspondence with my Department recently. In that case the husband was domiciled in England and obtained a divorce there.  In dealing with the question of widowhood the deciding officer took into account the fact that under our law the divorce in England of a person domiciled in England is effective to dissolve the marriage and that this dissolution is recognised as being so effective in this country.  He, accordingly, disallowed the claim to widow's pension on the grounds that the claimant had not established that she was a widow and his decision was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we now in the absurd position that, so long as the deceased gentleman was alive, the lady was deemed under our law to be a married woman who would commit bigamy if she married a second time and the moment the man died we declared she is not a widow because she was divorced from the man?

This case is governed by legal advice, as established in this country and as recognised by the courts.  Mark you, I can quote <Col N="1009" /> instances where it has reacted to the benefit of people, because we held the view that they were really married despite the charge of bigamy and ultimately became widows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe that to maintain a legal fiction that a woman would commit bigamy, certainly in the eyes of the Church to which she belongs, throughout the long life of the man who had divorced her, that divorce not being valid in the eyes of the Church to which she belongs, means that she is not entitled to be looked on as a widow when the man dies?

If such people are not getting the benefits to which they are entitled they can go into the office and ask the official to fill up application <Col N="1012" /> forms for them.  Sometimes such applicants are not able to write.  The officer may be able to find out what is troubling an applicant.

      <P>The question refers to the agency system which was taken over from the former National Health Insurance.  These officers still continue to perform services.  For the past ten years or so there has been a regulation that, when such an officer retires or dies, no further appointment shall be made.  These officers act as agents for our Department.  I have mentioned in the House before that they do some useful work.  Some of them are much better than others; but it may be taken that, on the whole, they do not expedite payments in any way, nor do they console people as the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>No assessment of subsidies and support in Britain, France and elsewhere for the ship-repairing industry in so far as they affect the Irish ship-repairing industry has been made by my Department.  Only one firm in the ship-repairing business has experienced difficulties in recent years. This firm has proposals for re-equipment and reorganisation which are under discussion with the Industrial Development Authority.  It would be premature at this stage to say whether any special assistance to the Irish ship-repairing industry will be necessary.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 6th February last, facilities for the importation of built-up vehicles, at reduced duty rates, are being afforded in return for assurances by the firms concerned as to the maintenance of the assembly industry on a long-term basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in reply to a question on 28th November last, the selective employment tax in Britain amounts to a subsidy which, though small, could be countervailed if, <Col N="1017" /> in a particular instance, it caused or threatened material injury to an Irish industry.</P>

      <P>Having heard Deputy Dillon referring to the cameraman in the hall, I am not surprised having read and heard the many comments over the weekend that this was an election Budget brought in by Fianna Fáil because of a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered, as the Taoiseach said last Saturday night, that in 1965, immediately after the general election of that year, Fianna Fáil, in their Budget, increased old age pensions by 10s a week.  It is nothing new for Fianna Fáil to look after the poorer sections of the community. Compare this with 10 years of Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael Government from 1922 to 1932 and six years of Coalition Government made up of Labour and Fine Gael.  In those 16 years the total increase was approximately five shillings and I do not think I am making allowance for deductions. Divide that up and it would take the Coalition Parties approximately 32 years to give the same benefits that Fianna Fáil have given in this Budget. <Col N="1025" /> Much reference has been made to the fact that, this being an election year and Fianna Fáil wanting to get back to power&mdash;which they must; there is not anybody else to take over from them &mdash;there will be a mini- or a maxiBudget again.</P>
    <P>We had two mini-Budgets or maxi-Budgets&mdash;whichever you like to call them: the proper word, of course, is &ldquo;autumn&rdquo; Budget&mdash;in the past four years.  There were good reasons why we had those autumn Budgets.  One was that in 1965 there was a demand from the creamery milk suppliers for an increase in the price of milk.  At that time the Minister put 2d on cigarettes to give 2d a gallon on milk.  We had an autumn Budget last year due to the big round of salary and wage increases which had been agreed to and which had to be paid to those in the public service.</P>
    <P>If some people say there will be an autumn Budget this year, they must say why.  In this Budget the money to provide the services and to provide the increases in social welfare and health is marked in black and white in the Budget Statement and the records of the House and, therefore, I want the people who say there will be an autumn Budget to say why.  For what purpose? Is it to give an increase in the price of milk?  Is it to increase social welfare benefits further?  If they say that, we may believe there is something in what they are talking about.  Unless they are able to tell us why we need an autumn Budget, there can be no autumn Budget.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday I referred to the beef and cattle incentive bonus scheme.  This was one of the best incentive schemes ever introduced to keep people away from milk.  In my own constituency&mdash; and particularly in the Carlow end of it where there is mixed farming: some of them are in milk, some of them are in beef, and some of them are in tillage to a great extent as compared with other counties&mdash;there was a very strong trend for people to go out of sheep and go into milk because it was plainly said that this was the profitable end of farming.  This beef and cattle incentive scheme put a halt to that.</P>
    <P>There is one little snag which I <Col N="1026" /> should like the Minister to mention to his colleagues.  It has been traditional for the woman down the road to go to the farmer for three or four pints of milk a day and, under the conditions laid down in this incentive scheme, if this person goes to the farm and buys four pints of milk a day, the farmer cannot qualify for the £12 grant.  I can see that you could call this being in commercial milk.  I agree that no man who ties a trailer to his car and goes down the road selling milk from house to house should qualify.  He is selling commercially.  He might as well be selling to the creamery.  I would ask that the regulation would be waived slightly to allow the farmer who traditionally supplied milk to the woman down the road to continue to do that. I cannot see that there would be a big problem to be got over.  As I say, I would not include people who are selling milk here and there.  My reason for saying this is that in some areas, even in my own county which is not very remote, there are small crossroad shops where bottled milk is not available, and where it might be a hardship if people had to go two miles to the nearest village to collect bottled milk.  I would ask the Minister to see his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in that connection.</P>
    <P>We all know that many increases and many incentive schemes for farmers have been introduced from time to time, but there is one section of the farming community which is now suffering a little, if not much, that is, the small farmers who have got additions to their holdings from the Land Commission.  The rent per acre in certain cases where the price of land has rocketed is now approximately £12, Take the man who has 21 acres and gets an additional 20 acres from the Land Commission.  He has to pay £10 per acre for it and that is £200.  That is a far greater hardship than the rates. I sincerely hope we will soon revert to the practice whereby the annuity will be halved in these cases.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, one of the reasons why we do not hear too much about this is that we have not got sufficient numbers to join in normal protests.  This is an <Col N="1027" /> era of protests, be they by the young, the old, farmers, businessmen or trade unions.  There are not sufficient of those small farmers who are paying £200 per annum for 20 acres of land, apart from their rates or anything else.  This should be considered by the Department of Lands.  I do not think the amount of money involved would be great.  Judging by some of the questions asked in the Dáil at various times. the amount of money would not be great, but it would relieve those farmers who are hit hard by this penal taxation.</P>
    <P>We all know that the small farmer who had 21 acres and got an additional 20 acres, is trying to build up capital and stock to make his farm economic, and it is very rough on him to have to look forward, for the rest of his life, to paying this £200 per year.</P>
    <P>I referred generally to social welfare last Thursday.  Deputy Tully was on television with Senator Garret Fitz-Gerald and the Minister for Education last Friday night.  He said that the contribution from the worker and the employer will be increased next January and that there was nothing about this in the Budget Statement. The very fact that it is a contributory scheme means that people who will benefit will contribute something towards it, whether it is 1s or 1s 2d. A worker said to me last Sunday after Mass: &ldquo;I am prepared to pay 2s to get benefit for myself and my wife if I become ill, or am injured at work, or when I am getting the old age pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By contributing this 1s per week a worker will get for himself and his wife&mdash;we will assume there is no family &mdash;£1 per week in additional benefit. Surely that is a good refund for a contribution of 1s per week.  It is not commonly known&mdash;actually I heard a parliamentarian saying it at one time&mdash; that the contribution from the worker and the employer pays the total cost of the contributory fund.  From the statistics which the Minister for Social Welfare has given us, we know that one-third of the contributory pension is paid by the State, one-third by the <Col N="1028" /> employer and approximately one-third by the employee.  In the case of the non-contributory pension 100 per cent is borne by the State.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Social Welfare is in the House, I should like to mention something to him in connection with the free television and free electricity scheme.  I am referring to a case where the old age pensioner is 73 and his wife is 68.  They are living alone. He has got free electricity and a free television licence.  He dies and, on his death, his wife must again pay for electricity.  I know it can be said: &ldquo;Where is it to end?  The wife could be 40 years of age and she could remarry and where would it end?&rdquo;  In the case where the widow is over 60 and her husband had been getting free electricity and a free television licence, she should continue to get them, provided she is living alone and complies with the regulations as laid down at present.  I would ask the Minister to consider cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>The cost of administration was referred to in general by the Minister in his Budget Statement.  Indeed, the increase in the cost of the administration of the various schemes must worry any parliamentarian and anyone who is associated with public life.  Last year in his Budget Statement the Minister said he was considering the introduction of a means test for children's allowances.  I would say that if you introduced a means test for children's allowances, by the time a social welfare officer would go down the country and count the chickens, the cattle and the cows, find out how many children were in the house, allow for, say, five children and then allow for only four when one reaches 16 and so on, what the Minister would save by way of a means test would be lost in administration. The income tax provision in respect of children's allowances will save about £400,000 in one year.  This is a very well devised scheme which does credit to the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the social welfare code which was mentioned in the Budget and which did not get a great deal of publicity was the legislation the Minister for Social Welfare introduced <Col N="1029" /> some time ago in respect of a scheme of retirement pensions for insured workers at 65 and a pension for the worker who has an illness of long duration. This is a desirable feature in the social welfare code and we welcome it.</P>
    <P>Tourism will, we hope, pass the £100 million mark this year.  Over the weekend tourism got a great boost with the arrival in Ireland of General de Gaulle, that great French soldier and statesman.  We must compliment the press and the public who have honoured his wish for a quiet and peaceful holiday.  I wonder would you, a Cheann Comhairle, when he returns to France, send him a good wish on behalf of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;on behalf of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  The Minister announced an income tax allowance of £15 for a single person and £30 for a married man, and this has been referred to as a small allowance.  At the same time, it will cost £3.5 million, which gives an indication of the amount of money it would cost to give a big relief in income tax.  Had the Minister not given those allowances of £15 and £30, he need not have put 2d on cigarettes and 3d on petrol.  As I say, the cost of the income tax allowance is £3.5 million, while the tax on cigarettes brings in £1.5 million and on petrol, £2 million; they are exactly balanced.  I shall not refer at length to the other items referred to in the Budget speech, but when the first mother qualifies for the £100 for the triplets perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare, who is in the House, would send her a telegram of good wishes.</P>

      <P>Another telegram.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in this Budget for quadruplets.  There is no use disguising that we are all in favour, as far as our resources allow, of the increases in social welfare benefits. <Col N="1030" /> We like to see the old age pensioners and the sick having more liberal provision made for them.  There is very little difference in the House about the desirability of doing so.</P>
      <P>I want to speak to the House now about certain more fundamental aspects of this Budget.  Amongst the documentation preparatory to this Budget the House is presented with Current Budget Tables, and on page 5 of this publication, in Table II, Deputies will be well advised to read the Estimate of Current Government Expenditure as a percentage of Gross National Product.  In 1963 it was 22.3 per cent; in 1964 it was 23.5 per cent; in 1965 it was 24.5 per cent; in 1966 it was 25.5 per cent; in 1967 it was 26.9 per cent; in 1968 it was 28.1 per cent; and though no estimate is provided for 1969, I do not think my estimate of 30 per cent will be far wrong.  Deputies should take a very careful note of that trend because it will bring problems which are extremely difficult of solution for whatever Government takes over after the general election.</P>
      <P>It might also be well if Deputies would take notice of the fact that while capital expenditure annually is a very agreeable exercise it has inevitable consequences.  The service of the national debt in the coming year now closely approximates to the total cost of running the country in 1954 and exceeds the total cost in 1948.  These are figures of which responsible Deputies in this House should be aware and should try to understand.</P>
      <P>We have the two documents, one to which I have already referred.  Now I refer the House to the other document, the Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure for the year ended 31st March, 1970, and Part I of that paper deals with the Estimates of Receipts: tax revenue, £315 million; motor vehicle duties £13,100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the House to pause there.  The case is being made by Fianna Fáil that there is no raid being made on the Road Fund.  But the fact is that from motor vehicle duties, it is estimated that in this year the Exchequer will receive £13,100,000 and <Col N="1031" /> in the estimate of expenditure paid into the Road Fund the figure is set at £11,500,000, which means that in this year the general revenue is being supplemented to the tune of £1,600,000 at the expense of the Road Fund.  I have heard the Fianna Fáil Party scream in indignation at a Minister for Finance who took £250,000 from the Road Fund to meet a situation of exceptional emergency.  I warned the House, when this new departure was introduced of increasing taxes on road vehicles without transferring the proceeds at once to the Road Fund in one particular year, that this would become a permanent feature of Fianna Fáil practice. And it has.  These taxes, which normally were used for the purpose of the Road Fund, have now become a permanent source of revenue upon which the Exchequer depends and, this year, we are raiding the Road Fund to the tune of £1,600,000 and, in so far as we are, we are increasing the burdens which will fall upon the backs of the already overtaxed ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Going down through these figures we come to the next figure of non-tax revenue of £58,902,000; the repayment of capital and other issues, £1,581,000; capital raised under the Telephone Capital Act, £17½ million; capital raised under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957, £190,000; additional amount to be found by borrowing or otherwise, £91,035,000.  Now it is not altogether easy to reconcile those figures with the figure provided in the Capital Budget, 1969, where at Table III on page 8 public capital expenditure, estimated resources and requirements are dealt with; the requirements are set out there as being £186.7 million and it is estimated that the resources of local authorities and State bodies, other than the Exchequer, will provide £66 million: from the Exchequer Loan Repayment £7.3 million; investment resources on departmental funds £25.6 million; small savings and prize bonds £6 million; miscellaneous £2.8 million.  The balance is to be found by a national loan of £26 million and, note this, banks and other borrowing £53 million.  Total to be raised by the Exchequer £120.7 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> Now I want to ask the Minister for Finance a perfectly simple question: why did he not mention the date on which the national loan referred to in that document is to be floated?  Is it true that at this moment the Government of Ireland owes the Joint Stock Banks of this country over £50 million on short-term Exchequer Bills that the Government is unable to redeem and that the Central Bank refuses to discount? Is it true&mdash;I think I have a right to a categorical answer&mdash;that in order to solve the economic dilemma in which they find themselves at this time all the requisite documents were prepared for issue to raise an Electricity Supply Board loan with an interest rate in excess of 8 per cent, at a discount, and that the financial advisers of the Electricity Supply Board told them not to issue the loan, that it would not be taken up?  And is it true that the purpose of that loan was to get money for the Electricity Supply Board which the board were to lend to the Government in order to help them out of the present acute economic crisis in which they find themselves?  I believe these facts to be as stated.  I believe them to be facts full of menace for this country. I believe they are facts that ought to be made known to our people by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Now, amongst the literature furnished to us by the Minister for Finance and his Department preparatory to the Budget, there is the <i>Review of 1968 and Outlook for 1969.</i> This document contains a good deal of material which, I fear, the vast majority of Deputies have not looked at at all.  They ought to, because they will see that on page 19, on the authority of the Department of Finance, in paragraph 44, speaking of 1968, this document says:</P>
    <P>The capital budget envisaged that, after taking account of normal Exchequer resources (such as capital repayments, small savings and investment resources of Departmental funds), the resources available to State bodies... residual borrowing would be of the order of £33 million.  Small savings and public subscriptions to the National Loan, at £30½ million, were in line with the <Col N="1033" /> budget estimate of £31½ million.  The residual borrowing requirements, at £52 million, exceeded the budget estimate of £33 million mainly because of the deficit on current account, a shortfall in the investment resources of Departmental funds and disinvestment by the public in Exchequer Bills.</P>
    <P>There will not be much disinvestment by the public in Exchequer Bills this year because there is nobody to do the disinvesting for them: the Government cannot redeem them and the Central Bank will not discount them.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 47 of the <i>Review of 1968 and Outlook for 1969</i> says:</P>
    <P>Bank credit (as defined in the Central Bank's advice) increased by £70 million (almost 15 per cent) between end-March, 1968, and end-December, 1968.  The corresponding increase in the same period of 1967 was £36 million (almost 9 per cent). In the calendar year 1968 credit increased by £103 million (23¼ per cent) compared with an increase of £32½ million (8 per cent) in 1967. The increase in the total of current and deposit accounts within the State (adjusted for cheques in course of collection) in 1968 was £93 million (16 per cent) compared with an increase of £61 million (11½ per cent) in 1967.</P>
    <P>Now these figures have little meaning for many Deputies in this House, but they really lie at the root of the gargantuan problem that will face the next Government of this country.  They lie at the root of the inflation which is raging in our community at the present time, the steady increase in the money supply, for which the Government is primarily responsible as a result of its own activities and its own stratagems.</P>
    <P>Sir, these references I have made to the review of 1968, while very significant to those who understand them, are not nearly as important as the part of this report which refers to 1969&mdash;<i>Review of 1968 and Outlook for 1969</i> as presented to Dáil Éireann by the Department of Finance.  Paragraph 57, page 23, says:</P>
    <P>The likely trend of consumer spending in 1969 is not easy to <Col N="1034" /> predict since it will depend largely on the trend of money incomes.  On the basis of the expansionary effects of the Eleventh Round increases and assuming no general extension of the increases granted in the maintenance craftsmen's settlement, consumer spending is likely to rise at a faster rate than in 1968.  The volume increase may exceed the anticipated rise in the volume of total national production of goods and services for the year.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 61 goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The interaction of the various trends outlined in the preceding paragraphs, together with a further rise in net invisible receipts mainly from tourism, is likely to result in a balance of payments deficit of the order of £55 million as compared with an estimated deficit of £20 million in 1968.  Excluding purchases of aircraft which will have no immediate impact on the external reserves, the deficit in the balance of payments will be of the order of £40 to £45 million.  If the net voluntary capital inflow continues to be of the order of £25 million, as in recent years, this would mean a balance of £15 to £20 million to be found from external borrowing or from external reserves.</P>
    <P>These prognostications are extremely grave.  The best complexion that can be put upon it is that we are going to have a trade deficit in our balance of payments of £50 million to £55 million in the coming year and that is going, the Minister for Finance hopes, to be mitigated as to the extent of £25 million, by selling a further chunk of this country to foreigners who are prepared to introduce capital in order to buy it.</P>

      <P>We have already sold a large part of the country.  How far are we going to be pushed along that road of continuing deficits in our balance of payments, how much more are we going to sell?  There is a remarkable parallel between our position and the position of Canada.  Canada has been selling large parts of her economy to the United States of America by the <Col N="1035" /> importation of American capital.  I think the operation of economic laws on that continent will result in the disappearance of Canadian independence. Canada is going to be merged in the United States&mdash;and that may be, for her, an honourable course to pursue&mdash; several Provinces of Canada electing to become additional States of the United States of North America.</P>
      <P>Is it the intention of the representatives of the people of Ireland to ignore the lessons of the conquest of this country which was initiated by violence seven centuries ago and which was undone by seven centuries of sacrifice of varying degrees in every generation? Countless forgotten men and women died that this country should be free.  Do we intend to sell for money what they purchased with blood?  That is what we are doing, and we ought to think.  I want to tell this to the House. You are falling into an appalling illusion if you make the attempt because, though this generation is corrupt enough to sell for gold what was bought with blood, in generation after generation efforts will be made to undo that bargain.  I think the British know that.  I think you will find that, having successfully extricated themselves from the Irish dilemma, the British will be desperately anxious to avoid getting involved in it again.</P>
      <P>I do not care whether the independence of this country is sold to Great Britain or to Germany or to anybody else: it is a bargain that will not stick. Those who are participating in it are selling their souls for an illusory advantage. You cannot sell this country for it will not stay sold.</P>
      <P>I now allege that it is the studied policy of the new generation of the Fianna Fáil Party to sell this country for gold&mdash;oblivious of the fact that its sovereignty was purchased with blood. It looks to me at the present time&mdash;I am happy to think I shall not live to see it&mdash;that, in one generation, a cheque book would have achieved what seven centuries of bloodshed, fire and rapine failed to achieve.</P>

      <P>It is an egregious reflection <Col N="1036" /> on the whole outlook of the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party and, in so far as our people approve it, it would be a tragedy for the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 66 of this report reads:</P>
      <P>The prospective outturn in the balance of payments of a deficit of £55 million in 1969, including purchases of aircraft, is based, as already indicated, on certain assumptions regarding the trend of incomes. If incomes were to rise much faster than assumed in paragraph 57 the consequences for the economy would be extremely serious.  The additional pressure of internal demand would drive up domestic prices, make exports less competitive and at the same time increase the import bill. This would inevitably lead to so large a deficit on external account as to require drastic corrective measures which would have serious adverse repercussions on growth, employment and living standards.</P>
      <P>That is couched in the jingle of the Department of Finance and it is largely incomprehensible to the bulk of our people.  What the advisers of the Minister for Finance are saying there is that if the situation is allowed to continue which creates a deficit of £55 million in our balance of payments this year, the consequences will be that the cost of living will go up and, as the cost of living goes up, wages will go up because the trade unions representing working people will demand that their wages at least keep abreast of the cost of living, and as the cost of production rises and tariffs fall in pursuance of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and the general reduction of tariffs throughout the world, the output of Irish industry will become progressively more difficult to sell in world markets, and that will mean unemployment, and that will mean emigration, and that will mean a running down of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Department of Finance were perfectly right when they gave that warning.  The fascinating thing is that, in the whole course of the Minister's speech when bringing in the Budget, I do not think he made a single reference to that <i>Review for 1968 <Col N="1037" /> and Outlook for 1969.</i>  I wish to emphasise now that a deficit in the balance of payments, when it reaches the level of £55 million, has in it a far greater danger to the fundamental economic position of the country than many people understand.  It is estimated that our total external reserves are between £250 million and £300 million.  A deficit of £55 million represents, approximately a balance of payments deficit that we could afford for a period of six years if we were prepared to exhaust our entire external reserves.</P>
    <P>But do you imagine that the gentlemen who are exporting capital to this country at this time will sit silently by while we proceed to run down our external reserves during a period of six years?  Do you imagine that they will not smell the rat four or five years before that operation is consumated? You know what rats do when they sense that a ship is sinking.  They jump off.  These boys will collect as much as they can and jump off and you will suddenly discover that your prudently regulated annual deficit in the balance of payments has become £70 million, £80 million, £90 million.  The fascinating thing to me is that we have seen it happen within the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>The President of the French Republic was standing like a rock in the middle of the world and saying: &ldquo;There is one person in the world against whom the forces of speculation cannot operate.  I have thousands of millions of dollars in reserve in the form of gold bars.&rdquo;  Come the four corners of the earth against him, the Bank of France would stand.  Suddenly, in a week, nearly half his total gold reserves disappeared and he was obliged to put on the most stringent currency restrictions and controls, but in spite of them the outflux still continued until eventually France, who regarded herself as the unconquerable rock, is floundering around looking for credits wherever she can get them, because the rats jumped from the sinking ship and they are all jumping now on to the Deutschemark.  Why are they jumping on to the Deutschemark?</P>
    <P>The Germans did not make a practice of collecting huge reserves.  They did not want them.  During the past 12 <Col N="1038" /> months, they have been trying to keep them out.  If you want to store reserves in a Swiss bank today, instead of them paying interest on your money, you have to pay the bank a rent for keeping your money.  What is the fundamental difference between Germany and Switzerland on one hand and France and Britain on the other?  The fundamental difference is that Switzerland and Germany are spending less than they are earning and have been doing so for several years.  But France and Great Britain traditionally have been spending substantially more than they were earning.  This is less true of France than of Great Britain, but nemesis has come on the countries that habitually have spent more than they earned, and stability, even beyond their own desires, has come to Germany and Switzerland who avoided the very temptation in which I suggest to the House we are at present luxuriating.</P>
    <P>We spend more than we earn every year.  We are trying to pretend that we do not.  I was amused one day to hear the present Minister for Finance say, when somebody asked him about the proportion of the national debt and the annual cost of service: &ldquo;Do not be talking like that.  Look at the roads we have, look at the hotels we have, look at the office blocks we have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I heard that I remembered the poor, petty landlord near Ballaghadereen, Captain Costello.  Captain Costello had a small estate with a modest income, as his forebears had before him, and he was not a very bad landlord. Captain Costello was the last of his line and he took it into his head to get married in middle age.  This so intoxicated him that he determined he must have a suitable house in which to receive his bride.  Plans were laid and his friends came to have a look and when they saw the foundations dug they said: &ldquo;In the name of God, how will you pay for it?&rdquo;  Captain Costello said to them: &ldquo;Do not worry.  Look at the size of that drawingroom, it will be lovely; and look at the dining room, it will seat 40 people.&rdquo;  However, the walls went up and the friends came back.  They said: &ldquo;What do you want spires on it for?  You have three floors and now you want spires on it.&rdquo;  Captain Costello told them: &ldquo;Do not <Col N="1039" /> worry.  There will be spires on all four corners of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The end of it was that the creditors moved in and Captain Costello never reached the stage of putting a roof on the house because the creditors sold his estate, they sold his possessions and put him on the roads long before the house was finished.  It was finished subsequently, without the tower, without the spires, but with a good deal too much acreage within its four walls.</P>
    <P>When I was listening to Deputy Haughey, I thought of Captain Costello. He used to say: &ldquo;Look at the house, is it not lovely, is it not becoming more beautiful every day&rdquo;, but the end was that Captain Costello was a tramp on the roads of Ireland and the person who bought his house converted it to another purpose.  I wonder, when we have finished building the office blocks and left the people who have not got houses to live in to reside in tents and caravans, when we build the hotels and multiply their numbers so that we can entertain tourists in greater luxury than heretofore, shall we find the day dawning when we will be faced with the dilemma of Captain Costello?</P>
    <P>Remember the consequences are somewhat different.  Captain Costello had the bankruptcy court to have recourse to, where he could compose his debts and go, but we have not.  That is not our option.  If we fail to meet our liabilities it is not our financial affairs that will be thrown into confusion, it is the very fundamental institutions of the State which will be shaken.  When problems become insoluble for constitutional Government you will hear the weaklings in every community beginning to say: &ldquo;This is all the fault of Parliament.  What we want is someone who will take control, a strong man who will grasp this nettle and resolve this problem&rdquo;, and you will have meetings of Taca in the Intercontinental Hotel exhorting Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Finance, to be the strong man and you will have assemblies of gentlemen with whiskers and dirty shirts and queer pants on them and they will be exhorting Deputy O'Leary to be the <Col N="1040" /> strong man and to grow a beard like Cuba's Castro and that we all rally around him.  I do not give a damn whether it is Deputy O'Leary representing himself as an Irish Castro or Deputy Haughey representing himself as an Irish Hitler who starts running the country because so far as I am concerned both are equally unwelcome and I would regard our people as being morally justified in resisting their attempt to overthrow the constitutional institutions by whatever means were requisite to do so.  Mark you, that situation is the kind of situation that can arise.  Bill Norton smiles at me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I voted for him once&mdash;the just man falls seven times a day&mdash;the difference being that I only fell once in 32 years.  Every dog is entitled to one bite.  I had mine and the taste of it finished me forever.  I did not go permanently into the dog kennel and with God's help I never will.  Some people, Sir, may imagine that I am so <Col N="1041" /> obsessed with the inevitable consequences of Fianna Fáil's economic folly that I am content to wander in a whole maze of economic theory which can mean little to the average Deputy, but I want to tell you what is going to happen.  In the autumn of this year the Government will have to borrow money.  They will not be able to float a national loan because the insurance companies will not subscribe to it. Over and above that, in order to offer it the Government would have to fix a rate of interest for a public loan which would wreck the gilt edge market as it exists at present.  The Government will then go to the joint stock banks and they will tell them that they require them to discount Exchequer Bills and to do what they made the joint stock banks do before, to liquidate the Exchequer Bills they had in their hands by accepting a long term Government loan and to take the stock of that Government loan as liquidation of the Exchequer Bills they then had and deposit that loan with the Central Bank as part of the statutory deposit they were required to make and then issue new Exchequer Bills to bridge the Government's economic necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this is no theory.  The joint stock banks have now been reduced substantially to two: I do not include the Westminster Bank which masquerades as the Ulster Bank, or the Midlands Bank which masquerades as the Northern Bank.  These are two English banks.  Not only will the joint stock banks take counsel together but they will say: &ldquo;They will nationalise us if we do not toe the line.  How are we going to toe the line?&rdquo;  They will come back to the Minister for Finance and he will tell them: &ldquo;There is a very simple way of toeing the line.  Get the money from your depositors.&rdquo;  Now, that sounds very happy&mdash;get it from your depositors&mdash;but you know what it really means.  It means &ldquo;call in every businessman who is vulnerable and who has an overdraft and if he owes you £100 tell him to bring it down to £90, and if he owes you £1,000 tell him within one month he must bring it down to £900, and if he owes £10,000 tell him he must bring it down to £9,000 and if that exercise does not produce the necessary resources to meet <Col N="1042" /> the Government's requirements call them back again and tell them to repeat the exercise.  If there are those amongst them who have to close their doors and wind up their businesses because they cannot meet your demand let them close their doors, there is no alternative to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I am thinking of those individuals. I know some of them already who are liquidating their stocks under the warning of their bank manager that their overdraft must come down or he will put in a receiver.  I should like the House to reflect for a moment on what a credit squeeze means.  There are lots of proud, decent, independent men who are still earning their living and rearing their families and do you know I am slowly coming to the conclusion that any man who earns his own living and is not on the salary list of the Government is coming to be regarded as a public enemy.  If he is not getting a dole or a subsidy or a salary from the Government but wants nothing but to earn his own living, rear his own family and pay his own way he is becoming the object of general suspicion.</P>
    <P>Why is he able to stay independent of everyone?  Why can he kick the bank door or why can he say to the Revenue Commissioners to go and take a running jump at themselves, that he owes them nothing?  It has almost become an impertinence in this country to be the provider for your own family any more, but there are such people and many of them conduct their business with their own capital supplemented by the credit that they were entitled to expect from the banker they have been dealing with for four or five generations.  There are many among them who, as a result of the credit squeeze that Fianna Fáil are going to bring on this country next autumn, are going to get the loathsome intimation that the bank is putting in a receiver on Tuesday.  That means that on Tuesday morning a fellow comes in and says: &ldquo;I represent the mortgagee. I have been this day appointed receiver for this business.&rdquo;  Turning his back on the proprietor of the business he says to the employees: &ldquo;I warn you that as from now you must carry <Col N="1043" /> out my orders and disregard any directions you may get from the proprietor of the premises who has been your employer up to this moment.  You will proceed in the knowledge that everything on this premises not only the stocks but everything, his furniture and the food in his larder and the clothes he wears belong to me as receiver for the mortgagee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is pretty far away from that.  That can happen in Kilkenny, Tralee, Ballybay, or Raphoe and we may hear little of it but it means the ruin of a family.  It means that a father who has always rested on the confidence of his wife and the respect of his children is suddenly charged with the obligation of telling them that he can no longer maintain them.  That is the practical consequence of the line of country we are following and it is terribly difficult to make people see that in time to prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>I spoke in the Budget debate on April 25th, 1968, and I direct the attention of the house to the warnings I then gave as reported in volume 234, column 446 of the Official Report.  I warned the House and the Minister for Finance that I smelled 1929 in the air.  There was an acute economic crisis rapidly developing not only in Britain but in the United States of America and I went on to say:</P>
    <P>People may ask: &ldquo;What has this got to do with us?&rdquo;  We are caught between two great powers like a nut between a nutcracker.  If devaluation has become the current feature of the two reserve currencies in the world, the dollar and sterling, there will develop a trade recession in the world such as the majority of you have never seen in your lives.  If such a trade recession were to transpire, this country has never been in a more vulnerable position than it is at this particular moment.</P>
    <P>I want to recall to Deputies the fact that in 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 the world was smitten with a great trade recession and one of the miracles of modern economic history was that as that tornado swept across the world when it came to Ireland the winds were duly parted and passed us by and devastated the United States.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> While that devastation was proceeding in the United States of America itself in 1931 and 1932, when men in thousands were in the streets of all the great cities of America shaking tincans and asking: &ldquo;Brother, can you spare a dime?&rdquo;  we actually had the means to start an economic war with our own best customer and out of the accumulated reserves that we had gathered in the previous decade to initiate a vast building campaign which largely absorbed the displaced labour from the small farms of Ireland and diverted the utter collapse of the country which would have taken place if those reserves had not been available to us.</P>
    <P>That was the position in which we were.  I want to warn you today: you have no reserves of credit.  You could not borrow sixpence except by compulsion and that compulsion can only work itself through to the surviving individuals who are earning their own living as I have described.  I do not want to overpaint the picture.  I am conscious of the fact, quite deliberately and with some relief, that this is the last Budget I shall ever discuss in this House or any other.  I am very conscious of the difficulty of the task of any Deputy who takes on the assignment which I have set myself. The root problem of our perplexity is the fact that we have refused to recognise that inflation is the curse of the modern world.</P>
    <P>Inflation was presented to the world under a cloak of respectability by the late Lord Keynes and was eagerly grasped by every democratic politician in the world, this lovely concept of controlled inflation.  There is no such thing. Unless we can restore to the minds of men belief in the stability of money it is not the collapse of our economic institutions that will matter; it is the disappearance of freedom from the world. Remember that so soon as the people at large become convinced that their money is steadily deteriorating in value they will not rest until they pass it on in exchange for tangible assets that they can store.</P>
    <P>As that situation develops ordered government in any community will break down.  We are living in a world where the science of anarchy has become <Col N="1045" /> a carefully organised thing.  We have an example before us of what it can bring about.  Let us not forget that it was the collapse of the value of money that started Germany on the road that led to Hitler, that led to Belsen, that led to all the horrors of Nazi control of one of the most highly civilised peoples in the world.  It was the appalling belief that the Weimar Republic could not prevent a recrudescence of what happened after the First World War.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that we have at our disposal today a whole armamentarium of devices and machinery which would prevent the crude development in the economic sphere of the post-World War One period but we have deployed them all in the world in the course of the last few years.  We have met in Basle, in Zurich, in Bonn, in London, in Washington.  In fact, we have reached the stage now when the aeroplanes are passing one another in the air, the Governor of the Bank of England travelling in one direction the Chancellor of the Exchequer travelling in the opposite direction, and we postpone one catastrophe after another.  We vow that a currency will never be devalued and devalue it the following morning.  We swear by all the traditions of the German nation that we will never revalue the Deutschemark and as sure as there is an eye in a goat the Deutschemark is going up, whether it is by five, seven or ten per cent, does not matter.  The rats are on the road. Whether they are French rats or British rats or American rats or Irish rats, they are all boring away in their subterranean tunnels, all of which are illegal, but does that trouble the rats? &mdash;Not a bit of it.  The currency rats will find a road around any law.  The only people who obey the law are the poor simple residue of citizens going about their lawful occasion earning their living and they will never get their pictures on television.  But, in the case of the rats who will grow rich from their currency speculation, the newspapers and the television will grow weary of recording for us, the humble poor, their scintillating extravagances financed by the proceeds of their illegal activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> People can ask today if money is pouring into the German Reich or into Switzerland, why cannot they channel it out again?  There would not be any difficulty if the Government of Germany or the Government of Switzerland did not themselves fear the dollar would be devalued or the £ would be devalued again.  We could correct the activities of the international speculators if, but only if, we could banish from the minds of men the belief that the dollar and sterling were not themselves in danger of devaluation.</P>
    <P>So far as this country is concerned, inflation means for us the danger of the loss of an independence.  It may be the loss of independence to a domestic tyrant or to some external power that intervenes to rescue us from the consequences of economic chaos.  I do not care whence that intervention comes, I do not want it.  But, the consequence of inflation to the world is far graver and we may perish in the wreck.  As I said before&mdash;and let this be my valedictory message on this subject in this Parliament&mdash;it would not be the first time we showed the world a good example.  We could do it now by demonstrating that we were determined that so far as our currency was concerned we would repay what we borrowed and we would not borrow more than we were fit to pay.  That is the lesson and it is the only lesson the world really needs to learn.  I admit that we cannot control the ebb and flow of inflation in the world at large but if we have got to sink in an international catastrophe, at least let us sink with our flags flying and as we look on them sink with others, let us glory in the fact that ours are clean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely regret that we have heard the valedictory speech on a Budget of Deputy Dillon.  In saying that I am expressing the opinion of every other Member of the House, on both sides.  Deputy Dillon's speech on the Budget, like all his other speeches, was not devoid of histrionics, was eloquent. When I came into this House some 18 years ago, Deputy Dillon's speeches were most impressive and they still are. For that reason, nobody will like to think that Deputy Dillon will not be <Col N="1047" /> with us for future Budgets.  Of course, none of us has any guarantee that he will be here, unless Providence ordains.</P>
      <P>Without meaning to be uncomplimentary, I cannot help thinking of the years when I listened to and was impressed and intrigued by Deputy Dillon's many speeches on Budgets and enjoyed them.  It would make a very interesting collection if the speeches Deputy Dillon has made here were compiled in a special volume of Dáil Debates.  One thing for which they would be most notable would be their predictions and prophecies.  Indeed, in that regard they could compete in rank with Moore's Almanack.  Perhaps some of the predictions were true but mostly they were not and very often they were contradictory.  If we were in office there were predictions of gloom, despair and disaster and if he were in the Government the speeches held out the brightest hope for the greatest future for this country.  However, his speeches were important, interesting and very colourful.  His valedictory speech&mdash;if it is his valedictory speech I regret that that is so&mdash;was no less colourful in its predictions of gloom and disaster, not merely for Ireland but for the world as a whole, because of the tendency of inflation to dispose of and to create dictatorships of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us in public life who are charged with certain responsibility have to do something more than indulge in pipe-dreaming and daydreaming. We must get down to realities at times and face the situation as we find it and carry out to the best of our ability a job of work calculated to improve the lot of society generally. Foreign investment may have, and I am sure has, some influence on inflationary tendencies but it is fairly orthodox economics to accept that the greatest inflationary factor is the rising of income of more and more people as an economy develops.  Indeed, in an expanding economy, in a developing country, it is inevitable that certain problems have to be faced.  It is problems of a type such as I and my Department have to cope with that are most pronounced and magnified in an expanding economy.  It is easy to criticise and say that this Budget is one to <Col N="1048" /> rob Peter to pay Paul, or Polly as the case may be, but when Peter gets too far ahead of Paul he must give him some assistance on the way.  That is simply what this Budget is seeking to do and nothing more.</P>
    <P>Taking all these factors into consideration I am reasonably happy with the provisions of this Budget.  I know that one does not expect the Opposition to laud it and say that it was motivated by the highest motives of altruism.  We naturally expect them to find the weaker points and, if I am to make an assessment of the Opposition's attacks to date, the only attack that they have made on what I consider to be a reasonably good Budget is to say that it is an election Budget.  In other words, they are saying that we were motivated by political reasons alone.</P>
    <P>I will seek, in the few minutes for which I speak here, to try to counter that argument and to defend what I consider to be an honest and honourable attempt to close the gap between the more affluent section of our society and the more unfortunate sections.  This gap has been brought about as the result of an expanding growth rate.  This Budget has been designed to help the less fortunate, who are unable to take part in the race for better living standards. It is not very difficult for one to see that what we have set out to do in this Budget is in conformity with what has always been Fianna Fáil policy since they first introduced the great social revolutionary programme of 1932.</P>
    <P>If anybody looks back on the history of this Party they will not have any difficulty in appreciating that the present Budget is in keeping with the policy we have always pursued with progressive improvement down through the years.  This will become even more pronounced because the affluent society produced by the expanding economy has aroused in the public conscience a greater awareness of the requirements of the weaker sections of our society.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Dillon was speaking I was scribbling down some of the milestones along the road of progress since Fianna Fáil first became a Government in this country, and I shall enumerate but a few in chronological order.  First, we had unemployment <Col N="1049" /> assistance in 1932, giving, for the first time, a means by which the downtrodden could find some sustenance. Then in 1934, there was national health insurance, which replaced the various agencies which up to then had operated some semblance of national health insurance.  Then, in 1936, there was the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme; in 1942, wet time insurance, better known as the intermittent unemployment scheme, was introduced. Children's allowances came in 1944. In 1947, we had the establishment of the Department of Social Welfare and the integration of all the various schemes and offices in operation at that time.  In 1961, the contributory old age pension scheme was introduced.  Then we had the Occupational Injuries Act of 1967 and the free electricity and television schemes of 1967-68.  The widows' and orphans' pension scheme of 1936 incorporated, I think, both contributory and non-contributory. These are some of the milestones in our advancement down through the years.  These are only some of the events which mark economic expansion in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not claiming any such thing.  I am enumerating some of the milestones in the history of this Party with regard to social welfare services.  I will go further and ask any interested person to consider not only Fianna Fáil policy down through the years but to consider the <i>Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</i>  What we have done in this Budget is merely in complete accord with what is laid down in that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all these things into consideration, I do not think that anybody could accuse the Government of acting only politically in introducing this Budget.  The fact that the last speaker dismissed the provisions of the Budget <Col N="1050" /> and talked instead about world inflationary tendencies and so on is in itself a demonstration that the provisions of the Budget are acceptable and, I regret to say, perhaps uncomfortably acceptable to some people.  Not alone is this not a social welfare Budget for election purposes but it takes a further definite step forward in accordance with past performances, bringing us nearer the goals yet to be attained in the field of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I have had the pleasure recently of examining, in some order of priority, the requirements in the field of future social welfare expansion.  What remains to be done would be sufficient for several &ldquo;election Budgets&rdquo;.  We have many projects on hand for the removal of anomalies in the social welfare code. Only last autumn the Government authorised me to examine these matters and deal with them in order of priority.  I am confident that, as time goes on and as the rate of economic growth justifies it, we will have many more Budgets of this type until we reach that stage where nobody for ulterior or other purposes in the Opposition will be using our social services on a comparative basis to denigrate the efforts of this Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other State or Government in Europe or in the world.</P>
    <P>We have very many obvious improvements. Recently I have got the approval of the Government for the preparation of a scheme of pay-related benefits.  Like all other schemes enumerated in that list it will not be comprehensive at the start but it will cover most of the essentials and is capable of immediate expansion.  Take any other of the schemes which I have just read out and you will note that they started on a rather limited basis.  The tendency was to expand and extend both in scope and in rate down through the years.  I have in course of preparation for circulation a Bill which will take the first step towards pensions at 65. It has already been introduced and will shortly be available for circulation. There, again, it is only a limited scheme but will admit and no doubt will create a demand for improvements in that direction.  It will also provide for invalid pensions in respect of <Col N="1051" /> those who are chronic invalids and will make provision for death grants in respect of insured persons at the time of death.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the matters in the immediate future and they are only some of many things which I hope our continued economic expansion will justify as we seek year by year to distribute the fruits of economic expansion to the less fortunate sections of our community as is pointed out in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion. I do not regard this as an election Budget.  I regard it as being a definite step forward in accordance with Fianna Fáil policy and in accordance with our past performance in the field of social welfare and as an assurance of our continued progress in that respect in the years to come given the factors available to us today, namely, a consistently expanding economy of at least four per cent per year as we have had in the past and the retention in office of stable Government by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I consider these are essential factors to assure progress in this direction.  It is popular nowadays to capitalise politically on the weaker sections of our people.  I suppose this is made more obvious and more pronounced by the fact that all those who are unable to take part in the business and commercial life of this country are today succeeding tremendously.  I suppose it is also due for the same reason to the public's conscience being awakened and aroused with regard to a responsibility towards the aged, the retired, the sick, the infirm, the widows and those people who are unable to assist themselves for the time being. Instead of indulging in talk for pure propaganda purposes at least we on this side of the House, those in Government, have got to do something concrete, to do something definite and be prepared to accept our responsibility in respect of those people.  I think we are doing nothing more than that.</P>
    <P>It has been said we have provided nothing for important sections of the community.  There will be those who feel other people have been neglected, irrespective of whether they <Col N="1052" /> come within the scope of the welfare code or not.  While much provision is made for some sections of those people, I should like to point out that practically everything one looks at in the Book of Estimates, every increase certainly, is for the other sections who may feel they are not mentioned in the benefits provided in the Budget.  We provide millions for those engaged in industry, in agriculture, in sheltered employment, in the public service and in various other sections of the community right down through the year.  If some of those sections are not specifically mentioned in Budget proposals the very fertile field in which they are successfully developing their business or commerce today is in no small measure due to the action taken by the Government at various times, particularly in the provision of moneys in the capital Budget to ensure the economy is progressing and that they are assisted in whatever manner they are involved in productive development.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in our whole capital expenditure is on assistance for those taking part in industry, in commercial life and, indeed, in the distributive services which are allied to our commercial life generally and productive development in particular.  Very generous provisions are made for those people right down the line and if at some stage they are asked to make a little contribution towards those whose standard of living is not keeping pace with theirs, then I am sure they will very readily, and without any complaint whatever, subscribe to that same purpose.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if you were in an hotel lounge and somebody came in collecting for an unfortunate neighbour pointing out that so-and-so had fallen on hard times, as used to be done so frequently in the past when there were no social services, on such a rare occasion nowadays one readily parts with a very generous subscription.  This Budget is doing nothing more than asking those people to pay at certain times a few pennies which is purely voluntary towards improving the lot of not merely one individual but of some thousands and when that is brought home to them I am sure they will gladly subscribe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The children's allowance scheme was mentioned in last year's Budget when the Minister pointed out he was having the question examined as to what selectivity might be introduced in improving those payments.  This naturally has been examined in some depth since then.  While the present substantial increases will extend the cost from some £10½ million to £15¾ million they are partially on a selective basis, I would be happier to see it on a still more selective basis.  The amount paid in children's allowances is not so excessive as to demand a very strict selective basis in its payment.  An effort has been made to ensure that some of it is recovered in income tax and that nobody suffers as a result.  It is a very laudable step and we are glad that the position will improve considerably. There is plenty of scope for the introduction of more selectivity in the future in so far as further development of the scheme is concerned.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been improvements in the social welfare code. Many new schemes have been introduced. These schemes are a very definite step in the right direction.  I refer particularly to the free electricity scheme for old age pensioners who live alone, or for those who are invalids requiring some member of the family to look after them.  I refer also to the free travel concessions and to the free radio and television licences for these people.  These schemes have been extended to British pensioners who, in most cases, are our own people who have returned home having qualified for retirement pensions abroad.  This movement towards assistance in kind is one which I can state is being carefully charted for future consideration. Much can be done in this field.  The &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; and various other schemes which are genuinely&mdash;and I say &ldquo;genuinely&rdquo; with deliberation&mdash; organised to assist certain sections who are already receiving assistance from the Department of Social Welfare are excellent ones.  The voluntary organisations are doing a tremendous job for no motive other than to help the aged. I would hope they would continue their good work and that we would be able to give them some direct assistance in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I would also hope that any assistance which may be given by the Government to the less fortunate sections of our people, and particularly to the aged, would never supplant or in any way supersede the responsibility which relatives should have for their people. There is a growing tendency for some families to regard their aged parents as the total responsibility of the State.  I should not like to see that attitude growing to the point at which people would feel that they could place all responsibility for their aged parents on the State.  Parents who have been responsible for rearing a family should not be regarded as the total responsibility of the State.  Their immediate families, and even their nephews and nieces, should have a sense of responsibility towards them.  I would hope that anything we do, no matter how generous, would not sever the link of affection between relatives and their aged dependants.  Relatives should continue to look after the aged with care and affection.  They should accept full responsibility for them while they are alive.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations can often render certain services to the aged. They can do things for them which no Department of State can really do.  Such organisations have intimate contact with the aged and can help them greatly.</P>
    <P>We are frequently accused of not employing sociologists and persons who are suitably qualified to work in this field of expanding care for the aged and infirm.  Voluntary organisations have contact with aged people and sometimes with their relatives.  The immediate needs of the aged are not always evident.  It can be foreseen that either my Department or the Department of Health must employ a number of these sociologists to supervise the various schemes necessary for the welfare of such people.  I hope that these schemes will be pursued with greater interest by my Department in the time to come.</P>
    <P>I am naturally concerned with the approval of the welfare benefits set out in the Budget.  Nobody can establish that it is an election Budget or that we have been motivated by political <Col N="1055" /> reasons alone.  Our record in the field of social welfare in the past is excellent. There have been progressive improvements year by year.  Our policy as laid down in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion shows our concern for those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  It shows our hopes of expansion in the social welfare field in the years immediately ahead.  While I have not the Fine Gael social welfare programme in front of me now, I have looked through it carefully.</P>
    <P>It would be safe to say that last week we spent almost as much on social services as was projected in that policy for their five-year programme. I am glad the Leader of the Fine Gael Party is in the House because he will be confronted immediately with the task of formulating a new policy.  Every time the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party promulgate a new policy the action of the Fianna Fáil Party in that field of endeavour immediately improved on that policy and the Fine Gael and Labour Parties had to prepare another policy in order to keep in step with the performance of Fianna Fáil.  I am afraid they will have to submit themselves again to this very interesting exercise and produce still another policy.  Good luck to them.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably happy with the Budget.  I have a reservoir of projections in the social welfare field from which I could supply several election Budgets for many years to come but I feel our rate of progress is very well in keeping with the best expectations of the most sanguine prophets in the matter of social welfare.  For that reason one must be reasonably satisfied with the progress made.  I am certain that nobody will begrudge the few pennies they will have to pay here and there which will amount to millions in the aggregate to give succour to thousands of people who very much deserve it.</P>

    <Col N="1056" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme 1969, prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938 and laid before the House on the 25th day of February, 1969 be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide improved retirement benefit for a former member of the survey company, Corps of Engineers, and gratuities for other members of that company who were discharged or transferred to the reserve after the 1st August, 1940 for the purpose of taking up civilian employment in the Ordnance Survey.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the circumstances are that in August, 1940, a number of long-service members of the survey company, Corps of Engineers, were transferred to the reserve to enable them to work as civilians in the Ordnance Survey. They were recalled to Army service in 1941 and were subsequently re-transferred to the reserve and later discharged from the Defence Forces.  Provision was made in the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1956 to give each of them a modified pension in respect of his full-time Army service prior to the date on which his reckonable service under the Superannuation Acts commenced.  The pension would be payable only when he retired from his civilian post in circumstances entitling him to an award under these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four of them, as it happened, had more than 21 years' Army service, and as it would be more beneficial in their cases to reckon 21 years' service for Army pension purposes and the balance under the Superannuation Acts, it was decided to alter the reckonable dates of commencement of their civilian service.  Three of them, therefore, have now been awarded and paid <Col N="1057" /> pensions based on 21 years' Army service with effect from the dates of their discharge.  There is a slight complication in the fourth case.  The person concerned was appointed to temporary commissioned rank in April, 1941 and it is necessary to amend the schemes so that his commissioned service can be reckoned as non-commissioned in order that he may receive a pension based on 21 years' Army service.  This is being done in Article 5 of the present scheme.  A similar provision had been made for him in the 1956 scheme for the purposes of a modified pension.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the long-service soldiers about whom I have been speaking, a number of short-service soldiers were appointed to civilian posts in the Ordnance Survey.  In the circumstances of the termination of their Army service, they were not eligible for gratuities under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes as they then stood.  Article 6 of the present scheme now provides that gratuities may be paid to them.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the purpose of this scheme is to provide improved benefits for this particular group of people.  It is necessary for the scheme to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas as it is not simply a matter of benefits arising from service pay increases or general increases in public service pensions, the schemes governing which, as Deputies are aware, no longer require specific parliamentary approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-contentious pensions amendment scheme designed, as the Minister said, to provide increased pension benefits and gratuities for a number of ex-Army personnel in the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work which the Ordnance Survey has done and is doing is of considerable benefit to the country.  The mapping and checking of the various changes in localities represented in the maps involves a great deal of work which is of considerable value.  Its value is realised not only by individuals but by local authorities and planning groups.  The work assists land reclamation and, indeed, quite a lot of it has been of value in excavation work carried <Col N="1058" /> on by those who undertake it from a university point of view or from a professional or academic point of view.  The skill, education and capacity of the personnel involved in this work is appreciated by many people and it is right that their contribution to this type of work should be fully known and appreciated.</P>
    <P>This amendment scheme covers a limited number of personnel.  I think the Minister might consider the need for providing a gratuity for long service non-commissioned personnel in general.  This is a matter that has been the subject of representation by NCOs and men for many years.  It is a matter on which they feel strongly.  Compared with commissioned officers, NCOs and men get no gratuities and I think there is a strong case for giving them one. The actual cost per annum could not be very great.  There is no doubt they feel strongly that they have a case.  I should like to urge, therefore, that this matter be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>So far as the present scheme is concerned we certainly agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the House has accepted the scheme in the manner in which it has.  I know, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, that it is applicable to a very limited number of ex-Army personnel only.</P>
      <P>I join with him in commending the work of the Ordnance Survey.  It is a tribute to Army personnel that they can contribute so much to the important work done in Ordnance Survey. Their work is of considerable value to the country.  As Deputy Cosgrave and Members of the House know, the Ordnance Survey is under the care of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a plea that a gratuity should be provided for long service non-commissioned personnel. That matter is under constant review. It has been raised on the Estimate for Defence for a number of years and very careful consideration has been given to it.  It is not easy, however, to effect change.  I have no objection to the House pressing me to have a further look at this matter.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to provide for the making by the Minister for Transport and Power of grants towards capital expenditure incurred in providing certain new ships or parts or equipment therefor, and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Money Resolution is the easiest place to raise the point I want to raise.  I was a little surprised on Second Reading when the Minister indicated that this shipping investment grant would be available whether the ship was built in Ireland or outside Ireland.  In Britain, for example, a shipping investment grant is payable only for ships built in Britain.  I do not understand&mdash;unless it is because a certain type of ship building cannot be done here&mdash;why we should give a grant on the same ratio for work done outside the country as for work done within the country which provides employment for our own people and, therefore, in respect of which the money comes back to the Exchequer through PAYE and comes back again into the community as a whole and into national production as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be our intention that in the ordinary way the ships that would be subject to this grant would be built in this country but, as the Deputy knows, this Bill is to some extent retrospective because it covers the building of car ferry ships by the B and I.  The B and I was bought in 1965.  Naturally, it took a year for an entirely new board even to get themselves acquainted with the position of the B and I.  By the time they had done that, the explosion in car ferry ship and container development had taken place.  If they were to have any hope of operating successfully and making a <Col N="1060" /> profit, they had to build three car ferry ships very rapidly.  The Verolme Shipyard had not been accustomed to building car ferry passenger vessels, so it was agreed that the Verolme Dockyard would build one ship and the other two would be built in Germany.  That made available some of the plans to Verolme, which made possible the task of building an entirely new type of ship.  In future I would expect that the ships would be built in this country.  That might not always be the case.  Sometimes the Verolme Dockyard is fully occupied.  I intend to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is in charge of ship building, on any occasion I seek a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Liffey Dockyard will also be considered if it is suitable. That is the position.  In the ordinary way, in future grants will naturally be given to Irish-built ships.  It is impossible to say at this stage how rapidly the car ferry business will develop, and whether the B and I is likely to need some further vessels very rapidly which might not work in with whatever Verolme are doing.  Verolme now know how to build car ferry vessels.  They have nearly completed the <i>Leinster</i> and so I do not imagine that situation will arise very normally.  With one exception, Irish Shipping Ltd. have had all their ships built in Ireland for the past few years since I became Minister. As I say, I do not think that situation is likely to arise very often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Britain my information is actually back-dated about six months.  They were giving grants for ships built outside Great Britain simply because of the fact that the shipping business is, as the Deputy knows, fiercely competitive.  It may be that on certain occasions, if you require some specialised type of vessel, or some vessel has to be built very rapidly that, in order to preserve employment for crews and officers, and in <Col N="1061" /> order to develop new employment, you may have to consider buying a foreign ship in the same way as machinery for new industry is imported more often than not in cases where industries receive grants from Foras Tionscal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget expresses in concrete terms the Government's desire to assist the lower-paid workers. In a stable and expanding economy the Government have decided it is possible to make the concessions that have been provided in this Budget.  We have in the Minister for Finance a far-sighted and forward-thinking Minister <Col N="1063" /> who is ever-conscious of the problems and needs of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The Third Programme indicates that the Department of Labour will carry out a detailed investigation to identify lower-paid workers by occupation, area, sex, age group, and try to discover the main reasons for such low pay.  The fact that the Minister is arranging for the survey is a clear indication that the Third Programme is getting under way.  The items outlined will be fully explored and every effort will be made to ensure that the targets set are achieved.</P>
      <P>There was a very favourable reaction throughout the country to the various increases given in the Budget.  There was a great appreciation of the broad basis on which the Minister granted the benefits.  The Federation of Irish Industries stated they regarded the Budget as a responsible one in which emphasis was placed on social welfare. The <i>Irish Times</i> in its leader stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance decided that &ldquo;the Budget this year must play an important part in establishing a sensible policy for incomes by coming to the aid, in a very positive way, of the lower-paid worker section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on giving assistance where assistance is most needed.  The Budget should not in itself mean an increase in prices.  However, it is noticeable that one or two newspapers and one or two individuals have mentioned that prices will increase in some sectors.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, together with the Minister for Finance, should keep a strict eye on price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our price structure for consumer goods is very unrealistic.  Prices should be brought down so that housewives of the weaker sections that we have assisted will be able to gain some advantage.  We see every day in the press gimmicks like caravans, teddy bears, holidays in Spain, cash prizes and so on being given away by various manufacturers.  Some of these prizes are distributed in a very unfair way. They can be directed into areas where sales are weak.  That is a very dishonest <Col N="1064" /> and unsatisfactory system whereby the price structure of goods is affected and the housewife can be fooled into buying the products in the belief that there will be a prize around the corner.  In the tea trade, for instance, we see a variety of gimmicks. It is unfortunate that one company has to follow another and force up the price of goods to pay for the offers that have been made.  A full investigation must be made into these lotteries in order to ensure that housewives in the weaker sections of the community have not to pay for the offers that can be and are directed into certain areas in order to boost sales.  An offer from a cigarette company says: &ldquo;A cash bonus for smokers.  Despite the tax increase the price remains at 4s 6d for 20. Come over to this particular brand and do not give 4d to the taxman.&rdquo; Either this is an honest advertisement or it is an indication that there has been overcharging.  If this manufacturer is absorbing the Budget increase then he deserves great credit, but to my way of thinking there must have been overcharging if a manufacturer is able to absorb the increase.  It can also mean that other manufacturers are overcharging because they are not absorbing the increase.  It is either one or the other.  We should have a careful look into this question of advertising.  Consumers all over the country should pay the same price for the same product.</P>
    <P>A recent tour of supermarkets over the weekend showed detergents priced at 3s 1d offered at 2s 3d, 10d off.  To my mind, there is something phony in that; cornflakes, 10d off a product priced at 2s 3d; cakes, 8d off a 2s 3d product; hairdressing, 9d and 1s off a 2s 6d product; toothpaste, 11d off a 3s 6d product.  No retailer could afford to sell products at these prices unless the profit margin is so great that it allows him to do so.  I believe there must be overcharging in the manufacturers' suggested retail prices.  Prices should be brought down to a realistic level and machinery should be put in motion to ensure that gimmicks designed to tempt the housewife will be prohibited.  All commodities should be available to all consumers at fair and reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>These are not the only items noted <Col N="1065" /> over the weekend.  There is something very strange in the biscuit situation. How could any manufacturer afford to give the substantial concessions offered in regard to biscuits?  The amount of money pumped into advertising is out of all proportion.  This money should be utilised for the purpose of reducing the price of biscuits.  We saw the large amount of advertising spent on the Jim Figgerty campaign.  It would appear to me that, while Jacobs may have the know-how&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I think biscuits are a racket because of the enormous amount of advertising in relation to certain products.  They are able to get certain commodities into certain types of biscuits and they are also able to extract out of the house-wife's purse substantial amounts which should not be extracted from her.  The time has come when we must have a look at this advertising of products and the cost of the products advertised. We see the wrappers with 2d, 4d and 6d off.  Off what?  This is a dishonest effort to push up prices to the detriment of stability of prices.  I would ask the Minister to investigate these items in which these reductions are offered.  There must be dishonesty somewhere.  We have the giant sized packets with the dwarf sized tubes. There must be a realistic price structure and prices must not be based on gimmicks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some brands of petrol are selling at 3½d and 5d a gallon less than other brands with the same octane rating. There must be something wrong here. Petrol companies with smaller sales have cheaper petrol.  It should be the other way round.  There should be an investigation into the price of petrol. Tyres, remoulds and new, 15 to 20 per cent less in some garages; the position is the same with regard to batteries. The motorist should be assured that <Col N="1066" /> no undue increases are being passed on to him and he should be assured of the justification for every increase.  I believe the petrol companies could absorb some of the increase now passed on to the consumer.  A garage grading scheme should be introduced in order to ensure reasonable service and a reasonable standard of service.</P>
    <P>A review of the situation in regard to fruit and vegetables should result in a decrease in prices.  That would help the lower income group.  Somewhere between the producer and the consumer there are a great many highwaymen extracting large sums.  It is the weaker sections who are hit the hardest, the very sections we are trying to help in this Budget.  It is only right that the responsible Minister should take immediate action in regard to prices for the benefit of those weaker sections of our community.  One can buy apples and pears for 4d each outside any football pitch.  The same apples and pears in a shop beside the pitch cost 8d or 10d.  The quality may not be identical, but I believe the margin of profit is out of all proportion. I would ask the House to have a look at this.</P>
    <P>I come now to the extensive television coverage by way of advertisement for lager, spirits of one type or another, detergents and, in the past, cigarettes.  These represent expenses for the housewife.  I challenge some of the outrageous claims by detergent manufacturers in their television advertisements.  They have reached the stage where, by an examination, prices could be reduced and this would further assist the section of our community which we have so ably assisted in the Budget.</P>
    <P>We should make a very special plea to our people on this occasion to buy Irish goods: it is necessary and desirable. To maintain employment at home and, indeed, to extend employment at home, each and every person within the State should help by purchasing more Irish goods.  Not only would this ensure more people in employment here but it would put more money into circulation.  Then, when some future Minister for Finance would call upon any particular section of the community to make money available, we <Col N="1067" /> would have a greater yield because of our own efforts.</P>
    <P>I noted, the other day, that some 30 million Christmas cards were sold here last year&mdash;90 per cent of which were imported.  The average family spends approximately 18s on Christmas cards. If they spent an extra 5s on Irish-made Christmas cards it would mean an extra 300 people employed in the industry here.  We should impress upon the public the necessity to purchase goods of Irish manufacture.  As far as possible, we should get away from the outlets that are both producers and retailers because, at the moment, some of the products they are selling are questionable.  I hope this matter will be followed up to ensure that whatever advantages can be passed on will be passed on by way of price reduction and that, through the purchase of Irish-made goods, we shall have an increase in the volume of employment, thereby making available more money for the Minister for Finance when he calls upon sections to &ldquo;produce the goods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about incomes. I congratulate the Minister on making available a tax relief.  Small as it is, it will be of assistance.  Following the Third Programme for Economic Expansion, the Minister for Labour has already set the machinery in motion. The Minister for Finance has done his part to assist the lower-paid worker: I have a deep interest in and the greatest sympathy for that section of our community. At all times, they are the victims. Every single sixpence or shilling increase they receive is taken into account in this city in the assessment of rents and in other ways.  On the other hand, people in the upper income bracket, who have fantastic salaries, are cushioned so far as expenses are concerned.  I read in one of yesterday's papers about a man with an income of £9,000 per annum who cribbed because he was losing £11 on the increased children's allowances.  I do not know how that poor fellow manages to exist at all with his income of £9,000 per annum in view of that reduction of £11.  As I say, that particular type of individual, and others in a slightly lower income bracket, is cushioned against overheads through expense <Col N="1068" /> accounts, business holidays, transport allowances, meal allowances and many other benefits.</P>
    <P>May be we should have a very severe look at this particular section of the community to ensure that the benefits that are passed on from the development of our prosperity reach the lower-paid worker in the same proportion as those people in the upper income brackets. Possibly the bulk of the income of some of those persons is not taxable at all.  Therefore, we should have a very severe look at the higher-paid income groups.  I do not begrudge a man having a yacht, a race-horse, an interest in a golf club, and so on.  He can have all these things but he must realise his responsibility to the other sections of the community and share out with the people who are really doing the work&mdash; the man on the floor who is doing the dirty work.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome the small allowances given to the man who has no expense account, to the man whose every rise is syphoned-off by the local authority, if he lives in Dublin in a Corporation house, for example.  Incomes and prices are two important factors in this community.  Every effort should be made to ensure a square deal for the lower-paid worker&mdash;some-thing he has not been getting in the past.  I am speaking now not merely for unskilled and the semi-skilled worker but also for the clerical worker and, in some cases, the craftsman.  For too long, many of them have been receiving too little.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the benefits the Minister is giving, the children's allowances will certainly make up in some way for the backward situation in which many people have found themselves over the years.  A person with a very high income who may have to pay some money now as a result of the new framework of the children's allowances system really has nothing to crib about so far as the small reduction he will sustain is concerned.  It is indeed remarkable that a man with a high income should have a grievance such as that of the man I mentioned who is getting somewhere around £9,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that it was <Col N="1069" /> Fianna Fáil who introduced the children's allowances and that, down through the years, Fianna Fáil have always tried to ensure the provision of a satisfactory welfare policy.  We have always been to the forefront with increases and improvements of one kind or another in social welfare benefits. On this occasion, the increases were substantial and that is in keeping with Fianna Fáil social welfare history.  In the expanding and stable economy which we now enjoy, and with the various programmes outlined by Fianna Fáil, I trust our social welfare benefits will increase as the years go by to the level where the lower-paid worker will have no reason to complain.</P>
    <P>The pension increases for non-contributory old age pensioners have been reasonable and we hope they will be still greater, according as our economy expands and our productive efforts enable us to do so.  I am positive that this progressively improving assistance to the weaker sections of the community will continue for a long time.  It has been happening since 1957, particularly in the case of the social welfare groups.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read the comment of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins after he had welcomed the improvements in children's allowances.  He said: &ldquo;They broke their heart with the 10s increase to old age pensioners.&rdquo;  A lot of old age pensioners had broken hearts when they got tenpence a week when Deputy O'Higgins and his Coalition colleagues were in power.  Many of them died bordering on starvation because of the increases these gentlemen gave them. On two occasions they gave average increases of tenpence to old age pensioners only, disregarding all other social welfare groups.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish welcomed the increase in the old age pensions but he said he could not imagine the lower-paid workers going wild.  How wild did they go on tenpence a week?  He was Minister for Social Welfare when the old age pensioners got that increase.  Is this to be their socialism of the future, tenpence a week?  Old age pensioners will not go wild if they get into power. When they had a majority here, the <Col N="1070" /> best Coalition groups could do was to increase old age pensions by tenpence a week and to disregard children's allowances and allowances to other social welfare groups.</P>
    <P>On television, Deputy James Tully said that contributory pensions must be paid for.  Of course, they must be paid for&mdash;everything must be paid for. I am glad to note that Fine Gael and Labour Members in the Dáil acted more responsibly than their members in the Dublin City Council.  Here, at least, for the first time in ten years they measured up to their responsibilities in regard to the Budget provisions. They learned a lesson from their city council colleagues who refused to make money available to provide services for the weaker sections, for the people who not alone required additional income to purchase the necessaries of life, but who also required drugs and medical services of one kind or another and of which these gentlemen in the city council tried to deprive them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which removes the stamp duty from first purchase grant houses.  It is a positive proof that the Government mean business in the matter of assisting young people who wish to purchase their own homes.  It is a desirable step but it has not been referred to very often during the debate.  The duration of the period for the operation of the free fuel scheme for necessitous persons has been extended from October to April and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.  It shows his deep concern for old people in need of warmth during the winter months in Dublin city.  The pressure brought to bear by me and by other Fianna Fáil Deputies in relation to this service has borne fruit and we welcome it heartily.  If we couple this with the various other additional benefits this Budget provides for the old, these people can look forward to more decent standards in the future than have been provided in the past by mere promises.  They can now look forward to improving benefits as prosperity increases in our expanding economy.</P>
    <P>Public service pensioners also have got increases.  Every Member of this Party has spoken about them and has made representations about them in <Col N="1071" /> recent years.  I am particularly glad to notice the increases granted to those among them who are in greatest need, the longest retired.</P>
    <P>Disabled persons have been given a concession in the form of 350 gallons of petrol per year free of the 4s duty in respect of their adapted vehicles.  This was long overdue.  The Minister could not have singled out a more deserving section of the community. This concession will lighten the burden of many disabled persons who had to travel distances on these vehicles.  Most of them do not enjoy high salary or wage rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated on improving old IRA pensions and on giving funeral grants in respect of men in receipt of special allowances. Many of those men who had served their country wisely and well received many knocks during their lives.  Many of them became incapacitated and lost their businesses and their jobs as a result of their efforts during dark and difficult years.  I am glad also that the Minister on this occasion remembered the widows of public servants who died before July, 1968, and who were not eligible under the pension scheme. Deputy Celia Lynch has fought for these people on many occasions and has impressed on us the need to support their justifiable claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not forget the young people.  He has made £100,000 available to promote recreational facilities of a sporting nature.  This was long overdue.  It is widely welcomed in my area, in the surrounding areas and I know that the portion of the amount that will come our way will be spent wisely and well on promoting sporting facilities for young people. Not sufficient emphasis has been placed in the past on the need for promoting recreational facilities.  Much of the vandalism that has developed could be eliminated by a more active participation by each and every one of us in the affairs of young people rather than in an expression of condemnation of young people for what is sometimes termed irresponsible conduct when it is not so.  We should assist these people in the manner in which the Minister <Col N="1072" /> has visualised they should be assisted, keep them out of bad company and assist in developing in them a better outlook towards life.  Not only now but in the past has the Minister displayed an interest in this important section, our young people, and now that the ice has been broken I hope further concessions will be made so that we can eliminate the irresponsible section of our youth and segregate them from those who have no desire to participate in irresponsible activities.</P>
    <P>There is also a very generous gesture from the Minister in regard to assisting employers to provide facilities for their employees by way of swimming pools, halls and tennis courts.  This is a desirable step and it has generally been welcomed by responsible employers who have been making and will continue to make amenities available for their workers. These and the other concessions, which taken together are fairly comprehensive, have received fairly widespread support and I am quite sure that we can largely discount the few groans that we heard in the Dáil about the Budget, and from some people outside, who have vested interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made an attack on office block construction.  I am very glad that the Minister has had due regard to the development of office blocks and has taxed this development. On the other hand, office blocks are desirable and necessary in order to ensure that workers in this city will no longer have to work in dark and dismal dungeons.  We know that far too many employers have unfortunate trade unionists in clerical grades working in such dungeons and in insanitary and foul conditions.  The office blocks which have been erected provide a very useful service and have in no way interfered with the development of the housing programme.  We are aware of that from the assessments given to us by the people who are investing, that the money would be diverted not into the development of houses, but into other developments.  It is necessary that we should have some development and this is a worthy development which is doing something to assist our weaker sections.  We have in the city many employers who are now showing retributor <Col N="1073" /> gard for their workers and giving them the facilities to which they are justly entitled.  If that is the only service they provide it is a very valuable service.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment, too, those Government agencies which have taken over office blocks.  Why should State employees not have the best possible accommodation?  Why should they have to operate in foul and filthy dungeons?  Departments which have taken over office blocks and improved the lot of their workers have done something which is very desirable.  The many employers who have taken over office blocks deserve a vote of thanks for looking after their workers, many of whom have been deprived of proper accommodation for so long.  Recently the Second Stage of the Health Bill was passed in this House and this Bill is a further indication of our desire to assist the weaker sections of the community. The Bill is an expression in concrete terms of our desire to cater in a detailed way for those sections.  The Bill proposes to abolish the dispensary system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to improvements in the health services which must be paid for by taxation&mdash;and we are demanding additional services&mdash; due regard has been taken in this proposed taxation and will be taken in future taxation.  Additional services are being provided in regard to home help, the dispensary system is being abolished and there are other provisions regarding drugs and medicines and the choice of doctor, all of which will have to be paid for at some stage.  We are assuring the people in a very positive way that every section of the community in need of aid is receiving it.  In addition, legislation is to be introduced for a limited scheme for retired workers at 65, to which the Minister for Social Welfare referred earlier today, and there are various other proposals including one for pay related unemployment disability benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> In recent times the Department of Local Government have provided for the payment of rates by instalments and there is a flexible form of rates relief for necessitous persons, so that the emphasis all the time is on the weaker sections.  This Department is examining other recommendations of the inter-departmental committee in conjunction with a review of the structure of local government.  This, again, will assist, by way of housing and the other services that will be developed, the weaker sections.  It was also heartening to note that the Minister said that the Minister for Social Welfare was examining how to provide financial assistance in this year's Social Welfare Bill to assist mothers and families who have been deserted by the fathers.  The emphasis all along in legislation that was brought before the Dáil and which is before the Dáil and in the concessions in the Budget is a clear indication of the Government's desire that every possible effort be made to assist this section of the people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to express my satisfaction to the Minister.  Satisfaction has already been expressed by all responsible sections of the community.  The only dissenting voice came from the few crows flying around this place. When these people had an opportunity to make a substantial contribution towards helping the weaker sections they failed to do so.  They are good at talking but talk is cheap and it is what they do when in power that counts. Again, I congratulate the Minister. The nation needs a forward-thinking socially-minded man such as the Minister. We, in Fianna Fáil, are proud of him.  I hope he will remain long in office and I have no reason to doubt that, when the people have an opportunity to do so, they will endorse the policies that have been put forward by him as Minister and by the Government as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, has just said that he is very proud of the Minister for Finance and that we are lucky to have him.  Personally, I think we should be ashamed of the Minister, particularly on his performance in the past <Col N="1075" /> six weeks.  Fianna Fáil should also feel ashamed of him or any other Minister who would behave in the same way. He went on television and radio, in his responsible position as Minister, to announce to the nation rather less than six weeks ago that the country was in a serious crisis and needed the help of all sections of the community.  I saw and heard him on television and from his expression and the statements he made, which he said were of the utmost importance to every citizen, I felt&mdash;and I still feel&mdash;that the country was in a crisis.  What would happen was the talk of the people in their homes and in the pubs and everywhere they went.</P>
      <P>I spoke to some banking people who accepted the statement, coming as it did from the Minister for Finance, that the country was in a serious position. It is a shocking thing for a Minister for Finance to go on television and warn the people who have elected his Government of a serious crisis and then come into this House less than six weeks afterwards and say that the country is booming and that we have had the best year in our lives.  Surely a man who acts in such an irresponsible fashion is not worthy to hold office? Public confidence in the Minister and the Government has been shaken and I plead with him to go to the Leader of his Party and ask him to dissolve the Dáil and go to the country because nobody in future will pay any attention to the utterances of a man capable of saying and doing what he has said and done.  It is a sad day for the country when we have such people in high office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the majority of citizens, regardless of their political views, have always, since the foundation of the State, listened attentively to the pronouncements of successive Ministers for Finance and Leaders of the Government.  In general they were inclined to believe that people in responsible office should be listened to, even though one might not necessarily agree with their views.  When you have a situation in which a Minister announces a financial crisis and gives it shock treatment in a sort of emergency situation on radio and television <Col N="1076" /> and then goes back on it in five or six weeks, it is a scandalous thing.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the last general election we recall the slogans: &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On to Prosperity.&rdquo;  We were told that prosperity was around the corner and all that was necessary was to elect Deputy Séan Lemass and his Party and everything would be right.  Fianna Fáil got into power at that time and have continued in power until now but the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, used the same tactics as the present Minister for Finance adopted on recent occasions and gave vent to the same type of expression. He told the people before an election that the country was prosperous and everything in the garden was rosy; that there were thousands of new jobs to be created.  It would be impossible for one to repeat all the promises that were made so generously and lavishly.  Only a short time afterwards Deputy Lemass came into the House and announced that the country was in a crisis and instead of &ldquo;leading on&rdquo; he took a back seat and handed over his job to Deputy Lynch, the present Taoiseach. That was a difficult assignment in view of the situation created by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Irish people expect and desire something better than that.  Deputy Dowling paid well-deserved tribute to Old IRA men who served this country in dark and difficult days and served it well.  Many of them laid down their lives; they were not afraid to take risks.  They were not afraid to face the Black and Tans.  As Deputy Dillon said earlier, they did as generations before them did for hundreds of years, but I am sure they never visualised a situation in which people in high places would come into the Parliament of the nation and contradict, word for word, everything they had said six weeks previously.  How can we expect that ordinary investors, big and small, to whom the Government appeal day in and day out to support loans, the prize bond scheme and various enterprises that are absolutely necessary, to invest their money in a country in which there are such people at the top who, not alone are not capable of telling the truth but are telling deliberate falsehoods? <Col N="1077" /> Then we have parades and marches to the graves of our national heroes, who served the country well, and wreaths being laid on the graves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy should impute deliberate falsehood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any other word to use.  I leave it to the Irish people to judge whether the Minister for Finance misled the people or whether he told the truth on both of the occasions that I have referred to.  Certainly, the statements were contradictory. On the second occasion, when he spoke in this House, he contradicted everything he had said on radio and television.  I suggest, with respect, that that is a terrible thing for a Minister for Finance to do.  I repeat, it is hard to expect that Irish people, business people, farmers and others, who, through their own efforts, may have saved small sums of money, would be prepared to invest in loans or other State schemes when appealed to by persons such as the present Minister for Finance.  I do not think that they will be prepared to do it because our people, or the majority of them, expect honesty and integrity in people in high places, and when they are disappointed and let down to the extent to which they have been let down on this occasion they will think twice before investing when Ministers make appeals.</P>
      <P>It is no pleasure to me to have to say these things in this House.  Quite frankly, it hurts me to say them.  The only solution to the problem is for the Taoiseach, in this very week, to dissolve Dáil Éireann and give the people an opportunity of deciding on whom they want to represent them in Government. When the day comes, the people certainly will not decide in favour of the type of action I have described.  It is dishonest, it is wrong, that such a trick should be played on our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Leader of our Party, Deputy Cosgrave, said, this is an election Budget.  I shall not condemn everything that is in the Budget.  Far from it. Some of the things for which we pleaded with Ministers during the past year or two or more, such as social <Col N="1078" /> welfare increases, and so on, have been granted.  I welcome any increase which would benefit the poorer sections of the community, such as the increases in the old age pensions, widows' pension, unemployment benefit for small farmers in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister for Social Welfare this evening that there is one section that stand to gain to a certain extent from this Budget. I refer to Irish citizens who, through no fault of their own, had to go over to England and who spent 20 to 50 years there and who, on their return to this country, were deprived of the little benefits applicable to old age pensioners here in the form of free radio and television licences and free public transport.  These people will now receive these benefits.  In some cases, they do not need the benefits from a financial point of view because the British pension is higher than that payable here.  These people felt, however, that they had contributed in large measure during their years in England in remittances to their fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, and had helped to keep the home fires burning, so to speak, and it was a sad thing that they should be deprived of these small benefits when they returned to this country.  As a matter of principle and fairness, it is a nice gesture that, due to pleadings from this side of the House, these people are now being considered.</P>
    <P>We all know that this is an election year.  I hope the election will come very soon.  An attempt is being made on this occasion, as was made on the occasion of the last general election, to hoodwink the people.  When the Minister made his first announcement on television, he said things were bad. I am sure that further impositions will be found necessary by reason of the social welfare increases in this Budget. The increases in taxation and in the cost of living will not be effective straight away.  The Fianna Fáil Party would not consider increased taxation a good way of getting votes.  Therefore, these increases will not be effective straight away.</P>
    <P>From the far-reaching small benefits &mdash;the Minister has reached out in all directions in order to catch votes&mdash;it is <Col N="1079" /> obvious that this is an election Budget. Newspaper commentators have said that and we can see it for ourselves.  As happened on past occasions, if Fianna Fáil were to get back into office we would know how deeply we had to dip into our pockets to meet the demands of this Budget and the many more demands that would be made consequent on a fall in the value of money and increased costs.  We know that at this very moment the Government are being badgered on all sides for increases for many sections to compensate for increases in living costs.  Taxes are increasing, rates are increasing, the cost of housing loans has increased, the price of beer, cigarettes and little luxuries has increased, the price of motor cars will increase.  Naturally, there will be further demands and more unrest while this Government are in office.</P>
    <P>Anybody who listened to the Minister for Social Welfare here this evening, as I did, would think that everything in the garden was rosy.  There was the usual Fianna Fáil story about how prosperous the country is and how well we are doing.  He was talking in flowery language.  I know the part of the country the Minister for Social Welfare comes from and in many ways it is like my own part of the country. It is made up, in the main, of small farmers and small business people.  It has been the tradition for the local people to go from there to Scotland to work and many thousands of people have also had to leave my part of the country to work in different parts of England.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that everything is not all right in these rural areas.  More people are leaving their small holdings today than ever before.  Homes have been closed by the hundred and whole families have emigrated.  In the past it was usually the case of a father and a son or a father and a couple of sons emigrating to England to supplement their meagre income.  But now the little homes are being closed up.  ESB poles which were put up some years ago to connect these homes with rural electrification have been taken down&mdash;not in all cases but in many cases.  This has happened in <Col N="1080" /> the Minister's constituency, as it has happened in mine.  As I told the Minister on previous occasions, I have seen these poles stacked in my own yard. In fact, I extended an invitation to him to come down and see them for himself. I suggested to him that, if he could not come down himself, he could get in touch with the ESB people at Swinford by telephone and they would verify my story.</P>
    <P>These are the facts.  There is no point in the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for Finance or anybody else in this House trying to make believe that everything is all right in the country while that state of affairs exists.  However, I suppose I am only wasting my time talking.  I feel ashamed of having to say these things on every occasion on which I speak in this House.  It is certainly no pleasure to have to say them.  It is very sad to see one's neighbours having to leave the land, particularly when one considers that many of these people put up new bungalows with all the necessary amenities but, due to the failure of an Irish Government to provide them with a livelihood, they were forced to close their doors.</P>
    <P>These people are now in Birmingham and London.  Some of them are working in places as far away as Brisbane, New York and Chicago.  I meet some of them occasionally when they are home on holidays.  On returning to this country and seeing our luxury hotels they get the impression that we have made a lot of progress, but when they go to the rural areas and see the closed homes they form a different opinion. They know then that everything is not all right in the country and that, despite all the promises that have been made by Fianna Fáil about industrialisation in the west and all the grants that would be given, the situation is very bad.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must know these things because he drives down there very often.  If he does not, then the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health can bear out what I am saying.  Many of these people in the past relied on the local small farmers and even in the days of British rule these towns were prosperous.  There <Col N="1081" /> may not have been a lot of money in circulation but big families were able to live in these homes.  They were prosperous enough to educate their children many of whom went into religious life while others joined the teaching and other professions.  These people distinguished themselves in the different positions in which they found themselves, not alone in this country but in the many other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I know that the standard of living then was not very high and would not be tolerated nowadays, but it can be said at the same time that the people did not find it necessary to close their doors and leave the land.  Generations before them resisted landlords and, as Deputy Dowling said, they served their country well.  But, in compensation for that, they were denied the right to live in their own country.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Dáil Order Paper for any day we will see that there are from 50 to 120 questions down and most of these questions are about delays in the building of houses and about inability of local authorities to go ahead with housing projects because the money is not available in sufficient quantities to go ahead with the various schemes for which proposals are sent to the Department. Similarly, there are questions on the Order Paper every day about water and sewerage schemes in the small towns throughout the country.  Deputy Dunne has a problem with regard to some people living out near the airport for whom he has been pleading for years.  I remember him having to bring the Minister for Local Government here on an Adjournment Debate.  I felt ashamed of the things he had to say about the lack of sewerage facilities with which these people have to contend and of how, in this day and age, they must dispose of sewerage in the dark of night.</P>

In case the Minister is trying to convince the House that what I am saying is not true, I will remind the House that the bishops of the four or five dioceses in my county got together in the town of Charlestown some years ago, and, indeed, in my town of Foxford a short time afterwards, to announce that there was a crisis.  The Minister may call these people banshees if he wishes, but they told the truth.  They said that homes were being closed up and they appealed to the Government to do something about the situation.  Of course, the Government Ministers were not slow in promising that they would do something about it, but nothing worthwhile has been done. I should like to know from the Minister what he intends to do about this, if he is there any longer.  I doubt that he will be there very long in the office he now holds.  I hope he is not because I see no future for the country while he is in that position.</P>
      <P>Are those people telling lies or are they not?  I put down a question about this matter some time ago.  The Government did not seem to know what I was talking about when I spoke about saving the west.  Of course the Minister has no interest in the west.  It is easy for him to say that I am doing the banshee, that I am haunting the House about those things.  I do not mind if I haunt the Minister about those things. It is absolutely necessary for me to do so in the discharge of my duty as a Deputy of the House.  I must state the facts as I know them.  The Minister should go down and see this for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely if the Minister consulted with his colleagues, Deputy Moran, the Minister for Justice, or Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Health, they would tell him what the position is.  It is not the case of doing the banshee or trying to exaggerate the position.  Father McDyer, in fairness to him, had a good try with regard to this.  I had a few tries myself even when I was out of politics.  I made my contribution in giving the small farmers in my area a better price than <Col N="1083" /> they would get from the present Minister for Agriculture.  Those people in that area have become frustrated. They have felt for a long time that there was no hope with the Fianna Fáil Government and I personally feel the same about this.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about Fianna Fáil policies and we have many of them on paper but if you apply the real test to them we can see that there is very little prospect for the country with those policies.  There are thousands of acres of water-logged land all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The point I was making was that if we want to increase national income there is one place where we can do it and that is in regard to the land.  This has been neglected by Fianna Fáil. You could do a great deal for the land of Ireland by arterial drainage and later on by field drainage, by liming and manuring the land and making it fit to carry crops, fit to rear more cattle.  If we did that or if the Fianna Fáil Party had done it many years ago we would have given a boost to the economy.  Instead of that they started an economic crisis.  Later they had to go across to England with their hats in their hands begging for the bargains they had thrown away.  Were it not for Fianna Fáil this country would be much better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil started off on the wrong foot from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  I remember as a young lad listening to Fianna Fáil speakers saying that this country would be industrialised, that the solution to our problems was more and more factories rather than providing employment for young people on the land.  If Fianna Fáil had a proper policy to save the west it would be prosperous now rather than in the declining state it is in.  A famous gentleman, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, who has now gone to his reward, said that it did not make any difference if £3 or <Col N="1084" /> £4 was going out the back door if £10 was coming in the front door.  Those are the famous words of a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Due to the economic war and the fact that we lost our markets in England and for many years had to carry on with a great handicap, we now find ourselves in the position that we are almost worse off than we were 30 years ago.  Many of the people in the west of Ireland have left their homes and are now working in cities in England, the US and even as far away as Australia.</P>
    <P>No doubt when the election is over we will have a worse credit squeeze.  In fact, we have it now with nothing being given to the people in the west.  However, after the election there will be more tightening of belts.  The small traders have a credit squeeze on at the moment.  Bank managers are writing out to their good customers and telling them they must reduce their overdrafts, that they are under pressure to reduce the overdrafts to private borrowers. That in turn creates a very serious situation for the customers of those shopkeepers.  The people are not in a position to pay cash for every item they buy and this in turn has the effect of creating further unemployment. When you have this sort of credit squeeze on small shopkeepers you create a far greater problem for them. I think Deputy Dillon referred to this here this afternoon and said that many of those shopkeepers were now closing their doors.  They are not able to bear their overheads, the high rates and the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have motored to many parts of the country in his tours and he must have seen what is happening in the part of the west I speak of. There was a certain TV man whose name I will not mention, who put on a film show in County Sligo.  He showed bridges and roads all over that area.  He also showed the homes the people lived in.  Many of them are situated only six or seven miles from where I live.  Some of them are even nearer.  This man showed the conditions those people were living in. Many people said he exaggerated but in fairness to him I want to say&mdash;I know what it is like because I travel to those places and I visit those homes <Col N="1085" />&mdash;he gave the exact position.  In my opinion he gave a very fair presentation.</P>

      <P>I know that area well and I know what is happening there. I want to give credit to the people who have put their hearts into that work. When that man showed the film some of the people said that he only gave the worst side.  I consider it is necessary to show the bad as well as the good.  Certainly this bears out what I said here on more than one occasion. I believe there are good aspects in regard to the west as well as bad aspects.  I am satisfied when this Government are out of office that something will be done for those people because as long as Fianna Fáil are in office nothing will be done for them. There is no longer employment for those people who still remain in the west of Ireland.  I would, therefore, repeat the plea I made, and which was also made by the Leader of our Party and by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, the sooner Dáil Éireann is dissolved and the sooner we come back into power the better it will be for the people of the country.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the long time discussion on this Budget has gone on after last week when we had the amazing spectacle that we very seldom have here of unanimous agreement. We had unanimous agreement here last week on the Budget.  There was unanimous agreement also about nine or 12 months ago when they were all shaking the hands of the Minister for Finance and congratulating him for their rise in pay.  Last week they congratulated him again on bringing in a Budget which pleased them all.  There was no division on the Budget.  To everyone's amazement the Budget went through without a division. They had to go home afterwards and consider the statements contained in the Budget.  In view of the fact that they will have to face the country between now and next April they felt compelled to raise some objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Hara said one truthful thing.  He said that after the election all the extra things will be <Col N="1086" /> brought out and done again.  Deputy O'Hara realises that after the election, whenever it is held, Fianna Fáil will be back again on these benches.  I was on the Opposition benches in 1927.  I spent five years looking over there at the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That Party left the Government benches in January, 1932, and they never came back to office again.  That is 36 years ago.  They did not come back because they were not able to come back. During their term of office they took one shilling off the poorest section of the community.  They took one shilling off the ten shillings which the old age pensioners received at 70 years of age. People in Ireland have long memories and will remember this terrible deed.</P>
    <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Party state that there were no strikes during their term of office.  Why?  There were no strikes because no one was working. There was no employment at the time. When the Fianna Fáil Party took over the Government benches Mr. de Valera took charge of affairs and appointed Deputy Seán Lemass to build up industry and employment in this country.  The monument to his work is there today to be seen by everyone.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government had no demand for housing because half the houses were unoccupied.  That was the condition of the country until Fianna Fáil took over.  The Deputies should trace the progress of the country from then until 1948 when a conglomeration of Parties took over, consisting of remnants of the Fine Gael Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and various other interests. The Labour Party combined with all these with the sole objective of getting Fianna Fáil out of office.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government took over, and in three short years we had a financial crisis in the country.  They did not knuckle down to getting the country out of such trouble.  They ran. They were there in those benches one day and there was not a trace of them the following day.  Three years after that they asked the people to give them another trial.  The people were gullible enough to give them such a trial, but their reign of office was even shorter then.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local authority <Col N="1087" /> during the term of office of the inter-Party Government.  There was not a county council in the country that was not at their wits' end finding excuses for the grants due from the Government which never arrived in their counties.  The Fianna Fáil Party came back in 1956 and have been in office ever since.  I should like the House to examine the progress which has been made during this time.  Every Deputy in this House bears his own share of responsibility with regard to the unemployment in his particular area.  At one stage I myself found that half the town of Cobh was unoccupied because of the unemployment in the town.  The men of the town had three weeks work per year at Haulbowline breaking up machinery for auction as scrap.  The Cork dockyard was idle. Today there are 650 young men working in Irish Steel in Haulbowline. There are 850 men working in the Verolme dockyard.  Long ago there was three days work per week in a little flour mill in Midleton and seasonal work at the distillery there. Today, one could not find an idle man in that town.  In Youghal one cannot find a labouring man.  The managing director of Youghal Carpets had to establish a new factory at Carrigtwohill. This factory will employ 350 young people.  I want the Deputies to seek employment for their constituents in their own areas.  Most of the Deputies here have more education than I ever pretended to have.  Many of them have university degrees.  I sought employment for the men in my constituency and I would ask the Deputies to do the same.  I got employment for my people.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about small farmers leaving the land and I have heard that farmers find it difficult to make a good living from their farms. Any young farmer under 48 years of age can go into Irish Steel and earn from £18 to £24 per week for a five-day week.  This is a sign of the change which has come about.  This is why small farmers are leaving the land. They are not prepared to do what was done 25 or 30 years ago.  They are not prepared to work a seven-day week when <Col N="1088" /> every other fellow has a five-day week. Why should they?  Who would they do it for?  They will not get any overtime from Friday night until Monday morning even though they have been working the whole time.  That is not allowed in the prices that are fixed for farm produce.</P>
    <P>The West is the problem.  Anywhere west is a problem and my friend Deputy Seán Collins knows that very well.  General Costello went up to Tuam and put up a beet factory.  They could never get enough beet to keep it going, even to the extent of 50 per cent.  He said to me in conversation later: &ldquo;Surely to God, Martin, they will grow spuds&rdquo; and he went and put up a potato factory there.  By Jove, the spuds had to come in from the County Louth.  I am speaking frankly of what I know.  I heard Deputy O'Hara talking about the Mayomen.  We sent two men up to Deputy O'Hara's constituency every year to employ 250 of them and bring them down to single beet in County Cork.  They singled beet there for from 30/- to 50/- a day and were quite happy.  If they are there this year they are getting more.  They freely admitted that with the hospitality of the Cork people and the way they were treated they were far better off than they would be digging spuds for the English farmer.  I am giving a fair description of what I know from my personal knowledge.  I do not honestly know what is wrong with the West.  We are up against it there.</P>
    <P>Five years ago General Costello came down, at the special invitation of Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork, and got a vegetable factory going in Skibbereen in West Cork.  In the same month he started one in Midleton.  For the last season's work in Midleton we paid out £210,000 in wages and £300,000 more to the farmers for their crops.  I suppose Deputy Seán Collins will let us know how Skibbereen is placed.</P>

      <P>What is the present position? Are the farmers and workers in West Cork getting a half million pounds a year out of the processing factory?  That is a question I should like to hear answered.  What are they doing?</P>
      <P>I could continue in that strain for a week and give instance after instance like that but I want to devote myself to something which I want the Minister to do.  We devoted ourselves to the job of finding employment for our young boys and girls in their own country so that when a father saw his sons and daughters growing up he would not say: &ldquo;You might have to go on the emigrant ship next year&rdquo;. We wanted to end that.  Anywhere that Deputies are doing their work it is ended.  Anywhere they are not doing their work it goes on.  The moment one of those young lads finds himself with a permanent job and a decent wage he looks around and picks out a good looking lassie and he says: &ldquo;I think I will get married&rdquo;.  The next thing he looks for is a house. Out of East Cork Foods alone I had to put a scheme going to build bungalows for 25 young men who have got married.  I am doing that.  We had to take over 17½ acres of land there for housing.  I want the Minister to see to it&mdash;God knows I will be quite honest with this House and with the Minister, my heart is scalded from it&mdash;that sufficient money is placed in the hands of the Minister for Local Government for housing, water and sewerage schemes.  Surely there is more benefit for our people in Ireland from a half million pounds spent that way than from reading in the pages of a newspaper of the £500,000 hotel that we are building for the supposed tourist who comes in and when he is here a week some bank is robbed and the tourist is gone with the dough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to see that the first claim on this Budget will be to satisfy the urgent needs of our young people for housing, water and sewerage supplies.  That should be the Minister's <Col N="1090" /> first job.  I consider it a bounden duty. If one is giving a lad a decent job in God's name give him a decent home to come to with his wife and little kids.  They are the people who made this country.  Not too many on the benches here today can remember the days when young men went out and risked their lives to give us the freedom this country enjoys today.  Not many.  I think if you said Deputy Tierney over on those benches, and I do not know who Deputy Collins has, and a few here, those are all who are left.  When you look at them in that light, and when you remember that those young lads of today deserve to be kept here, instead of letting them leave home and go to the London slums, for heaven's sake let us devote our minds to providing decent homes for them, and the ordinary amenities of a decent home.</P>
    <P>That is the first thing to which I am asking the Minister to devote his mind.  There is no use in talking. Every time I see in the newspapers a £500,000 hotel going up here, and realise that between Bord Fáilte and one of those other boards money is flowing out like water, and that people, foreigners mostly, are getting pretty considerable grants, I think of what could be done with that money towards providing decent homes for our people here.  That is one of the areas in which I disagree with the division of the spoil, as I call it.  It is wrong.</P>
    <P>Then I think of all the noises made in connection with the Health Act. When the local authorities took over the burden of the Health Act and the health authorities were formed, advances were made.  There have been considerable advances every month and every year in hospital science, to put it in plain language.  I wanted to find out how far it had gone, and I put down a question to the Minister for Health asking him the increase in the number of jobs that had been created by the Cork Health Authority from 1964 to 1968.  The answer was 320 new posts at a cost of £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of the architects of the Health Act intended that that burden should be borne by the rate-payers in full.  After all, many of the <Col N="1091" /> people who are gaining under our social services and our Health Act, pay no rates at all, and they have fairly fat pay cheques coming in every week or every fortnight.  I would nearly say all, but I will say most of the burden of the Health Act and the social services should be a State charge and borne by the State.  I make no bones about that.  I am looking the thing in the face as I see it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, as my brother-in-arms Deputy Tierney did, for what he has done so far as our old comrades are concerned.  In five years more this country will not be asked to do anything for them because they will all be gone except someone like myself who will be left to torture you here.  You must remember those days, and that this Dáil would not be here but for what those men did.  I appeal to the Minister to take away that abominable means test.  I had occasion about three months ago to have some dealings with the means test.  There is a poor man who lost his eye in the Troubles, living in a labourer's cottage in Castletownroche.  He played his part for Ireland as one man.</P>
    <P>I applied for a special allowance for him but they made out that he had a little profit out of his one acre.  He has one son who is paying £3 a week to his mother for his keep, for his board, and lodging, and laundry, and everything else.  Did not some hangman of a civil servant come down and have a look around and say out in bold plain language that the unfortunate woman had a profit of 15/- a week out of the £3.  I am sure the Minister knows how these people feel, who went out and did their bit and suffered in the ditches and in the jails, when the Government they succeeded in establishing here instead of John Bull say to them: &ldquo;Oh, well, you have Jackie and he is paying you £3 a week and you have a profit of 15/- a week out of the bread and butter and meat you give him&rdquo;.  When I think of that I also think of the swell hotels which we are paying grants to build.  When I think of going into one of these pubs and paying 33/- for a steak, I wonder how may steaks poor Jackie gets from his mother in the week, and how <Col N="1092" /> many steaks the civil servant gets who put down that return.</P>

It was not&mdash;and they admitted it&mdash;money but status that was involved.  There was no status when those people were in office last, when, as I told them, in the whole of east Cork you would not find 50 people working, when a regulation had to be made by the Department of Local Government that in order to get a job raking stones on the road you had to be an ex-member of the National Army.  Take your minds back to those days.  Unfortunately, I am so old that I remember.  That was the condition of affairs when we took office in 1932, and I think we can be very proud of the job we have done, and we can be very proud of our Taoiseach also.</P>
      <P>When it comes to within a year and a half or two years of the five years for which a Dáil is elected, the Opposition are screeching and shouting for an election.  The people elected to the Dáil are elected for a definite period of years, five years, the same as a man is elected to a county council for five years.  He continues in office until the period has expired and whether the weather is snowy or the sun is shining he goes back to the electorate and gives an account of what he has done for the previous five years.  In spite of all this noise and shouting about another election, the people do not want an election.  The people are the happiest people in the world.

      <P>We must view the Budget as what it has now become, the instrument of guidance and of stimulation to the country's economy.

Between them and some of the supposed political know-alls of certain media of news distribution, they assume they have the prerogative of guiding us all in what to do and of directing the people on what they should do.  It is time they came down out of the clouds, too, and realised there is a lot of serious thinking and work to be done by this Government and by the Government that will succeed it to try to ensure a future for the economy.  The fundamental duty of any Government is to rule for the benefit of the people and to cherish them equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance cannot be accused of not being an adroit politician, and whether his Budget is an election Budget or not, it certainly is designed to spread a veneer of benefit over the widest possible area.  One is a bit sceptical, knowing the cynicism of <Col N="1095" /> the Minister last year, when he gave us at this time of the year what appeared to be a reasonably effective Budget, and then, as soon as the shock of the referendum defeat had eased, came in with a mini-Budget that became a killer.  Here we start to come to grips with the lack of initiative and the continued atrophy of the Government. Their approach to the tax structure is pathetically inept.  It is easy for the Minister for Finance to tax beer and tobacco and petrol since, with his well-known cynicism, he knows that the victims of these impositions will come up smiling, offering themselves as a target for still further impositions. But that cynical approach connotes dangerously unsound thinking because we must ultimately reach the point of diminishing returns and we must ultimately reach the point at which the consumers of these commodities will be forced out of the consumer market with regard to these items.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the Government are playing in the modern development of our economy a bigger and bigger role.  State expenditure and capital expenditure have become a very vital and integral part of each year's endeavour.  It is most disquieting to see the amazing increase in the cost of servicing the national debt.  It is most disquieting to observe the economy being bolstered by repeated borrowing. It is most disquieting to see the country running into difficulties particularly in the private sector in regard to credit.  It is most disquieting to see that the Government have completely overdrawn their credit in the public sector. I charge the Minister with deliberately concealing the fact that we are building up to one of the biggest credit squeezes we have ever known in this country, and that within the next few months. The Minister and his advisers are well aware of the fact that the commercial banks are experiencing extreme difficulty in the field of borrowing.  The squeeze is coming back inexorably.</P>
    <P>We have all this airy-fairy nonsense, this spreading of certain reliefs, as thinly as possible over as wide an area as possible.  I do not want to be sentimental about the heroes of yesteryear, but the Minister should give worthwhile <Col N="1096" /> benefits to this section of our community.  He should be generous in what is described as the funeral grant. There should be no means test where the special allowance is concerned.  I do not think any of us would begrudge anybody the full special allowance. The means test should never have been applied to this allowance.  I am trying now to encourage the Minister to do what he did on behalf of the Old IRA in the recent past.  In the limited time that is left to them we cannot do too much for them.  Let us not be niggardly where they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at the stimulus this Budget provides to our greatest and most precarious industry, agriculture. The Minister knows, as well as I do, that the farmer has been ignored in this Budget.  The incentives essential to gear us for entry to the Common Market, to gear us to meet the kind of competition we will experience in that market, are not there. Added to that is the Minister for Agriculture's latest plan about the diversification of milk.  This could have a salutary impact on the cost of living.  We know that Fianna Fáil have tried to browbeat and bully the farmer.  We know they are trying to make him pay for his self-respect and independence.  We cannot get away from the fact that the really vital industry from the point of view of exports and the foundation of our whole economy is the agricultural industry. No matter what grandiose picture Deputy Corry tries to paint about East Cork the rural areas are being denuded of population.  The young people are going.  They are going, going, going and we cannot bid them stay.  They are going because, despite all the talk, the agricultural units are not viable.  No matter what lip-service is paid to the farmers the fact is that the kind of credit they really need for development is not readily available to them.  Added to that is the fact that they are not getting a proper return for their labour and their effort <i>visà-vis</i> other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry is right in one thing. The skilled worker in Irish Steel, in Verolme, in the factories in Cork can bring home a pay packet of £18, £20 <Col N="1097" /> or £25 a week, but no farmer's son and no farmer himself gets anything like the same return at the end of any week.  That is one of the fundamental problems.  It is one of the things that is playing havoc with labour in rural Ireland.  I do not think I am trespassing on Deputy James Tully's territory when I say that the basic rate of pay of the farmer and his labour <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sections of the community is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>State organisations concerned with the land will want to do something about stepping up the basic wages paid to keep people working in our forests.  I say that in the full consciousness of the fact that money will have to be found to do this.  In all my period here since 1948 I have never opposed the raising of money to provide proper social amenities and benefits for the poorer sections of our community. I feel we have gone completely cockeyed, with certain facets of development and over-expertise at one end and lack of appreciation at the other end.  The agricultural worker and the forestry worker and lower paid workers in general are not getting the benefits they should get.  As I said earlier, we must welcome any conscious alleviation of distress at the penury, social welfare level.  We must admit that the aged, the widow, the blind, the orphan, the person receiving a contagious disease allowance, the handicapped person &mdash;all&mdash;are a first charge on our conscience and we are glad this Budget has, in part, tackled that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was talk about unanimity on taxation for named reliefs.  It would be churlish of us not to accept that taxation must be increased so that these people may be relieved.  Where is the new thinking on petrol, beer, tobacco, cigarettes and the bit more added to the wholesale tax?  Where is there an incentive in this Budget for greater production of cattle, pigs, sheep, lambs or anything else?  Where is there the extra profit so essential to raise the income of the average small farmer to something commensurate with the national standing?  Where in this Budget is there the hope that we shall have proper <Col N="1098" /> industrial peace and proper labour relationships in the future?  Consider the audacious statement by the Minister, only a couple of months ago, about peril and danger and aggravated crisis and then, on the morning of his Budget speech, the sun was shining again and, if you please, we have had the greatest year in our economy.  If that is not playacting, I do not know what is.  It is giving the country an immense sense of uneasiness.</P>
    <P>I have always had the feeling that there are two sections of the community always ready to respond to Government appeal.  The first section are the farmers.  Whenever they were pressed for greater efforts, for greater production, to step into the breach, they responded.  I have always believed that the Labour movement in this country had the responsibility to give support and help to keep the economy going once they got reasonable conditions and fair terms from the Government.  I think the cause of our industrial unrest should have been tackled in this Budget.  We should have recognised that it was a tripartite effort: not only were the unions and the Government deeply involved but the employers were involved as well. A formula could have been hammered out.  We should be talking about a new impetus in our economy which would give a charter for the future, for the development of our exports, for the consolidation of our home output and for the preservation and consolidation of agriculture in its important and vital role in our economy.  There is nothing in this Budget only a few more gimmicks.  It has come too late for me, unfortunately, to accept the challenge of the triplets or the quads. It does seem a bit gimmicky in a Budget like this where many issues of far greater purport to the country might have been discussed in a realistic way and where we might have come to grips with what is to be done with these problems.  Take the ICMSA, the NFA, the various rural organisations crying in vain for some recognition of their claims, for some injection into their economy to ensure that they get a reasonable standard and that they can do something to keep the people together and to keep them at home. <Col N="1099" /> This is the quarrel I have with the Budget.</P>
    <P>There are certain facets of our economy that can stand very substantial development&mdash;and we know it. There has been a great step-up over recent years in afforestation.  It can be maintained and increased.  There is no doubt at all but that there is still a tremendous pool for development in that area and that there is tremendous scope for rural employment.  As well as that, the time has come for the development of an industry to cope with the increasing output of the now maturing forests.  In places such as West Cork there is room for the development of a pulping or chipboard industry. The thinnings are becoming more numerous and their haulage to local centres would be infinitely less costly than hauling them up the country to Clare and elsewhere as is the case at present.  However, no such analysis and no such guidelines are given to us. There is no indication of where the diversification should go and where the future of the industry should go.</P>
    <P>We hear revived talk about the Common Market.  We hear that our agricultural community can do well in certain facets but we know that in one particular facet there can be extreme difficulty.  We know perfectly well that there needs to be a bold, co-operative plan between agriculture and the Government on diversification.  Unless we are completely inept and not prepared to look at the reality of a European situation, we must know that there has been a tremendous over-production of butter and that its disposal is a headache not only to this country but to many other countries.  We know that that huge problem can be tackled and solved but only by a bold plan of belief in the basis of the industry and encouragement to invest in its future so as to project it to its fullest economic potenital.</P>
    <P>My complaint against the Budget is that it does not show any guidelines. It is but a dull repetition of the maxi-Budget of last November when the hurricane of the referendum had died down and the Government were in such a position of stunned amazement that <Col N="1100" /> they had to bludgeon the economy. Now we had a repetition of that bludgeoning and it is not for the purpose of development.</P>
    <P>I do not regard this Budget as having been designed exclusively to give necessary reliefs to necessitous sections of the community, and I do not think that pious platitudes about rates of growth are enough.  We want these rates of growth to be forced up into reality, and above all something will have to be done to stop the spiral in the cost of living.  This Budget will spark off another rise in the cost of living and by next November, if a question is put down, we will be given the answer that there has been a 0.1, a 0.2 or a 0.3 per cent rise in the cost of living.  The tragedy of these budgets is that what is meant to be relief is in the main dissipated on the people who so badly need real help.  In this Budget we are up against the simple fact that it is the product of a tired, inept, atrophied, useless conglomeration of Ministers, some of them young enough to have vigour enough.  I do not know what has happened.  They have out-done the most conservative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has been called many things and having regard <Col N="1101" /> to the fact that we face a general election which must take place before next spring, it is understandable that this Budget panders to as many sections of the people as possible.  When one considers the desperate gamble which the Government made to rivet themselves to power by way of the referendum issues last October, one can understand how desperate they are at this time to hang on to power, and they have utilised this Budget for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the contention that this Budget is essentially a general election Budget is true and there is nothing the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or anyone else can do to gainsay it.  This Party have been trembling with fear during the past number of years about the prospect of facing the Irish people in the next general election and it is obvious to us that all the stops were pulled out in the compilation of this Budget.  They scraped the bottom of the barrel in order to allocate the sops, left, right and centre.  This is the medium through which they hoped to secure the votes that will lead them back to power next month or the month after, whenever the Taoiseach decides to go to the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is fair to say that there is nothing statesmanlike, authentic or sincere about this Budget.  Those of us who have analysed it know that it has scant regard for the economic state of affairs of this country.  It is not concerned about rectifying the shocking economic malaise which undoubtedly exists.  It does not do anything to guarantee our people a more secure future.  There is nothing in it to provide the thousands of additional jobs so badly required or to indicate better standards of living for our people in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essentially a political Budget, designed for the shabby purpose of catching votes to win seats for Fianna Fáil in the next general election.  It is rather a pity we do not have a general election every year because then at least we could be assured that some regard would be had for the welfare of the Irish people, certainly certain sections of them, because an effort would have to be made to improve their standards.  The insincerity, the <Col N="1102" /> hypocrisy of this Budget is also amply illustrated by the fact that the Minister for Finance, on 18th March last, went on Telefís Éireann and caused a certain amount of panic throughout the country by inferring that all was not well with our economy, that there was something in the nature of an economic crisis.</P>
    <P>Now, in introducing hand-outs in this Budget to certain sections of the community, the Minister paints an altogether different picture, to the effect that everything in the garden is rosy, that there is nothing to worry about, that everything will be well if Fianna Fáil are left at the helm.  Any sensible person will see through this shabby pretence, this saying one thing today and a different thing tomorrow. This does not make for the kind of responsibility necessary for the welfare of our people.  It undermines the people's concept of statesmen and politicians that we can be so utterly hypocritical in our approach to national affairs that within weeks we can express opposite views to those we have already expressed. We have had examples of this kind of gimmick in the past.</P>
    <P>We had the Budget of this time 12 months ago which was also a relatively &ldquo;cushy&rdquo; Budget and was designed to have a popular appeal to large sections of our people; it was clearly designed to secure votes for the Government in the referendum of last October.  When the referendum was over, and despite all the gimmicks of the Government and the low depths to which they sank to win this last desperate gamble to remain in office by abolishing PR and our recognised democratic way of political life, we had the Minister bringing in a Budget in November which was a most savage Budget.  It was called a mini-Budget but essentially it was a maxi-Budget, a hairshirt Budget of a particularly vicious type.  This was done to ease the position of the Minister for Finance, to ensure that he would have a surplus on his current account and would be able to give certain concessions in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>This is all good politics, perhaps, but we cannot be blamed for pointing out <Col N="1103" /> the hypocrisy of this whole matter. This is the first Budget in the Government's Third Programme for Economic Expansion.  Those of us who have seen the Government's various programmes for economic expansion in operation cannot be blamed for being pretty sceptical and suspicious about this programme also.  The first programme was designed to provide 100,000 jobs and instead of providing that number some 270,000 people were forced to emigrate in the five year period.  The second programme was an acknowledged disastrous failure.  It never got off the ground at all.  Therefore, we have scant hope for this third programme.  Speaking from the Labour Benches on behalf of a Party which has a deep, ingrained regard for all those against whom the winds of adversity blow hardest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the aged, the sick, the infirm, the unemployed and the potential emigrant, we are not unmindful of or ungrateful for certain concessions made in this Budget.  The increase in the contributory and noncontributory pensions of 10/- is to be welcomed but I do not think any politician can make much play out of an increase of 10/- nowadays having regard to the exceptionally high cost of living.  Can one buy anything of consequence today with 10/-?  Two packet of cigarettes, perhaps, or 2 lbs. of butter, but certainly it will not go far.  It is also to be regretted that people must wait so long for this increase&mdash;until August for the non-contributory sections and January for the contributory sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While welcoming these meagre increases, which will do little to maintain living standards let alone improve them, we wonder why pensions were not granted on this occasion at the age of 65.  We in the Labour Party have been advocating this for many years. Having regard to the propaganda of the Government Party, and in particular to the statement made recently by the Minister for Social Welfare, it was rather expected that in this general election year Budget pensions would be granted at 65.  Will the Minister <Col N="1104" /> say if the Minister for Social Welfare or the Government were sincere in their indications that serious consideration was being given to granting pensions at 65 and, if so, when is it intended to apply this principle?  Having regard to the exactitudes of life in this age it has long been the ambition of large sections of our people that they should be permitted to retire at 65 with an appropriate pension.  This is long overdue and the Minister was very remiss when he omitted to make any reference to this principle of granting pensions at 65.</P>
    <P>We deplore the fact that this concession was not granted at this juncture because if it was not promised specifically certainly spokesmen for the Fianna Fáil Party hinted strongly that this was something that could be looked forward to on this occasion. Despite the statement of a previous Taoiseach that the hardy annuals of taxation, cigarettes, beer, spirits and petrol, had reached saturation point as a means of raising revenue we find that these commodities have been taxed again this year.  He says: &ldquo;As long as they come up smiling they must expect to be taxed all the more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a pity that a little more imagination is not brought to bear on budgetary matters.  While I am not making a case for cigarette smoking as such many people enjoy a smoke and resent cigarettes being taxed year after year and used as a revenue raising device.  The same applies to the poor man's pint or to the half-one.  I do not think that the pint of stout is any longer the luxury the Minister represents it to be.  It is something to which the workers are entitled after a hard day's work.</P>
    <P>It is to be deplored that in raising revenue we must increase the price of the pint and the &ldquo;half-one&rdquo; and the gallon of petrol.  Nowadays an increase in the price of petrol will have very considerable effect on the prices of commodities generally because of the importance of petrol in transportation. We are also concerned about the many people who are obliged to use cars for their everyday work to whom this threepence increase is a very serious impost.  They receive no relief for this increase in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I am pleased that some recognition has been given to the Old IRA as regards the means test for special allowances but there is a further concession which could quite easily be granted to the Old IRA who are dwindling rapidly.  The Old IRA man enjoys free travel now if he is within a certain income bracket and it has been put to me very forcefully and correctly that we should also consider granting free travel to the wives of Old IRA men.  We should ensure that where free travel is granted it is granted in such a way that it will not embarrass or humiliate those concerned. Presentation of an old age pension book in a public transport vehicle is humiliating for an old age pensioner.  There should be some kind of voucher or ticket which would serve in these circumstances.  I am making a special plea for free travel for the wives of Old IRA men.  Recipients of old age contributory pensions are granted free travel but not wives of Old IRA men.  I believe this concession should be given to permit these people to travel together, as they may want to do from time to time.</P>
    <P>We regret very much that greater concessions were not granted in this Budget in regard to the payment of income tax.  We have always contended that liability to income tax on £6 10s a week for single persons and on £10 a week for married couples is unfair, inequitable and unjust and a serious disincentive to higher productivity. These allowances have been static since the inauguration of PAYE and it is high time to adopt a more realistic approach and increase both single and married allowances proportionately to the increased cost of living. It means rifling the pockets of the working classes unfairly when you tax them on every £ earned over £6 10s. if they are single, or over £10 approximately per week, if married.  The Government should realise that people are no longer prepared to accept the extraction of income tax so unfairly.  It is no longer the painless exercise it was intended to be under PAYE but it is a source of indignation and anger to workers.  They feel that they are being fleeced week after week unfairly under the present income tax code.  The concessions <Col N="1106" /> given in this Budget are of little consequence to the mass of the workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed concern about lower paid workers and we look forward to seeing what practical steps will be taken to better their lot.  It is gratifying to hear of this alleged concern on the part of the Government for the lower paid workers because we know that State employees, whether in the forests, on the roads, in the Board of Works, or on the bogs or elsewhere are the lowest-paid workers in the country.  The State has the reputation of being the worst employer.  I hope this alleged concern for lower paid workers proves genuine.  That can best be shown by increasing forthwith the meagre wages of State employees.  The State has always been last to increase wages or improve conditions and is never prepared to set a headline or become a pathfinder in the matter of better wages and conditions.</P>
    <P>Many State employees are obliged to exist on something like £10, £11 or £12 a week.  Obviously, a family man trying to live on £12 nowadays is at subsistence level.  This is the poverty fringe: there should be no doubt or ambiguity about that.  It is virtually impossible for a family man to pay rent, rates and taxes and pay for fuel, light and clothing and also meet his day to day commitments in these times of high prices and high cost of living on wages of £12, £13 or £14 a week. It is a precarious existence and the wife who has to go out daily to buy food for her family realises too well how little she can purchase for £1.</P>
    <P>It is fallacious to suggest that the workers have been in any way responsible for the adverse state of the economy. The mass of our working class people are still badly paid and if there is any sign or semblance of industrial unrest in the country there is nothing sinister about it.  It is merely a sincere and genuine endeavour by workers and their respective unions to maintain minimum standards of respectability and decency, nothing more.  The Government will have to accept that fact and we shall watch with interest what is proposed to be done to improve the lot of the lower paid worker.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the amount of money which the Minister has set aside for <Col N="1107" /> this purpose, divided amongst the very many thousands of workers concerned, would provide less than £1 per head per week.  If this is the kind of improvement the Government have in mind for the lower paid worker they will certainly have to think again because a sum in the nature of 17/6d. approximately per week is not the kind of increase which we consider would compensate these workers for the steep increase in the cost of living and the lowering of their standards at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to disabuse the Government of the foolish notion that all they have to do is to put across a Budget of this kind, allocate sops here and there amongst the various sections and that all will be well.  They imply that this is a poor man's Budget and that they have maintained standards which they consider fair and just.  Those of us who are close to the working people know full well that there is a very high incidence of abject poverty in this country.  There is evidence of very bad living conditions.  The amount of home assistance paid out by local authorities is an indication of the high incidence of poverty.  The existence of the many charitable organisations, many of which have come into operation only within recent years, is another indication of low standards and of abject need. These things must be considered in the context of bad housing, very high unemployment which constantly stands at nearly 70,000 in recent years, the exodus of emigrants running at between 18,000 and 20,000 in recent years.  All these things are indicative of utter neglect of a people by a Government which have been in power for a long number of years.  The Government are hoping that by gimmickry in this Budget they will be returned to power. They have had the opportunity of solving the problems of our people since they came into office over 30 years ago. I do not know of any Government in Europe which has been in operation for so long and has had control of the destiny of its people for so long as the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

It is rather late in the day to be adopting gimmicks to try to maintain control over people.  It is appreciated that the greatest national gamble Fianna Fáil every tried to perpetrate on our people backfired last October.  The attempt to form a totalitarian regime was rejected by the Irish people last October.  This was the great, last, desperate gamble to rivet themselves in power indefinitely All their resources were thrown into that desperate gamble and it failed miserably.  An ingenious, highly-polished, cynical Budget of this kind will not impress the people.  Their memories are not that short.  They remember last November, after the Budget, when the Government applied the hairshirt policy to them and they know that this sweetener that they are getting now could turn quickly sour next October or November if Fianna Fáil got back into power.</P>
      <P>I want to pose a question.

      <P>There are many aspects of this Budget that one could talk about. Apart from the usual sops one has come to expect in a Budget of this kind, what about the real problem. What is being done in this Budget to accelerate the housing drive, to eliminate the slums and the hovels?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> What is being done in this Budget to provide the necessary millions of pounds for the extension of piped water supplies and sanitary facilities?  What is being done in this Budget for the provision of these modern amenities? I say at this point in time, nothing at all.  I wish to avail of another opportunity of elaborating on the importance of these amenities for our people&mdash;the matter of a decent home and the matter of water readily available and of decent sewerage facilities.  It is a serious indictment of the Government that we have the problem of slums and hovels.  So many thousands of people are in dire need and less than half our population have flush toilets and water laid on in their homes.</P>
    <P>These are the things we wish to talk about in this Budget from the Labour Party's point of view.  We shall get an opportunity of elaborating on them in greater detail in the morning, please God.  The Irish people will not be taken in by this Budget.  Already, even the Minister's own Party supporters are smirking at the notion of what it contains. It had been expected that a special endeavour would be made to palaver the Irish people by bending backwards to regain popularity with them.  This is evident from the increases that have been given in children's allowances and other welfare benefits and the Budget has shown a tendency to do something about our archaic and outmoded income tax code.  However, it is significant that whoever designed this Budget forgot entirely about the welfare of our farming community. This Budget could not be said to be a &ldquo;farmer's Budget&rdquo;.  There is nothing in it to improve the welfare of any section of our agricultural community. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has indicated that he intends to do something about this matter, but it would have been far more tangible if something were included in this regard in the Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House unduly on this occasion but I merely wish to say that the absence of any concrete policy by the Government, the tendency for them to drift from one ridiculous situation to another, the hopes that they had placed on joining the Common Market and the absence <Col N="1110" /> of a positive policy is evident for all to see.  Their condoning of virtual free trade between ourselves and Great Britain is having disastrous consequences and there is no use in Government spokesmen trying to cover up the situation.  Inroads are being made into many important industries.  As the barriers of protection go down the icy blasts of free trade are gradually eliminating competition and manufacture at home; jobs are being jeopardised and we have evidence, too, of the gradual take-over of the whole of the distributive trade of the country. To enter any of the modern stores in this city or in any other city or town in the country is to receive a shock, because the vast majority of the goods available in any of these stores, especially the supermarkets, are clearly foreign produced.  Our distributive trade would seem to have been taken over or is about to be taken over.  This constitutes a most serious threat to home manufacture.  It is a situation which we cannot afford to ignore.  There is clearly a tendency towards merger and monopoly, and this is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>We opposed the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and we make no apologies for having done so.  We saw then&mdash;and we have been proved right&mdash;that the free trade battle we entered into with Britain, particularly in the industrial field, was a battle we simply could not win and the alleged benefits that were to have accrued to us from the agricultural side have not materialised to any appreciable extent. Instead, serious inroads are being made in very many important native industries. It is time for the Government to pocket their pride, go back to the British and amend this Free Trade Agreement before it is too late.  We know that, as the tariff barriers go down, industrial graveyards will result and thousands more Irish men and women will be thrown out of employment.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Finance to indicate what he is doing to provide additional resources for certain sectors of our economy that have been sorely depleted in recent years.  I mentioned briefly the matter of housing and the matter of the inadequacy of money for piped water.  It is to be deplored <Col N="1111" /> that the tremendous progress which many of our county councils were making in respect of the provision of piped water for our people has been brought to a grinding halt as a result of the obvious bankruptcy of the Government and their clear inability to provide the necessary capital resources to provide these much needed facilities. In my own county we have been waiting for the past four years for an allocation of money to proceed with regional piped water schemes and, despite all our pleas to the Minister and his Government, the necessary money has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In order to try to provide these amenities for our people, the county council of which I have the honour to be a member was obliged to resort to the borrowing of money from foreign resources, namely, from financial companies in Britain.  But, having secured an allocation of money for this purpose, we realised that these foreign loans, which we secured on our own initiative, were subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister was reluctant to give his approval to the amount of the loan which we could have secured at the time.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of piped water for all our people to eliminate drudgery in the home, to accelerate growth on the land, to facilitate the dairy farmers in particular in respect of high-grade milk.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of proper sanitary facilities.  The Government are failing in their duty in not providing essential money for those purposes.</P>
    <P>In the matter of priorities, when it comes to Budget time, I am making the appeal to the Minister for Finance to see to it that a much bigger allocation of money is made available on this occasion for housing, piped water and the provision of sanitary services.  No longer can those three important amenities be regarded as the Cinderella of the Fianna Fáil Government, to be deliberately run down.  No longer should our county councils be humiliated and degraded by being refused year in and year out a reasonable allocation of money to proceed <Col N="1112" /> with providing those amenities for our people.</P>
    <P>My own council of South Tipperary had the reputation of being the most progressive in all Ireland in respect of the provision of piped water.  We had expended very many millions of pounds in bringing piped water to every cottier, every householder and every farmer in the county but our endeavours to proceed along those lines have been discontinued for the past four years because we have been unable to find the necessary allocation of money to proceed with this work.  Extensive regional schemes, which were approved of over 4½ years ago, are still lying dormant waiting for the allocation of money from the Department of Local Government. In the matter of priorities I hope the Minister for Local Government will insist on getting a fair share of revenue for the purpose of proceeding with those modern amenities for our people.</P>
    <P>With those sentiments, I conclude. As I said earlier, I praise the ingenuity of the Minister and the Government in devising a popular Budget of this kind, designed for purely political motives to copper-fasten them in power with the people of Ireland.  This simply will not work.  The people of Ireland know that this Government, which cannot be trusted in a sincere fashion, if they are returned to power after the next general election will bring in a further Budget in the autumn with the same vindictive impositions as we had in the so-called mini-Budget which was imposed on our people after the debacle of the referendum last October.</P>

      <P>Having listened conscientiously to the contributions made here by the Opposition Parties, one can only feel a certain amount of sympathy for them.  I can understand the dismay and the uncomfortable position they find themselves in now.  Deputy Treacy went on to refer to the referendum.  He made a fine contribution on the referendum.  This might have been appropriate last October but definitely not now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious they <Col N="1113" /> are in such a state because they cannot find anything in this Budget to criticise. Deputy Treacy said there was nothing in the Budget for anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said that, he then thanked God for giving Fianna Fáil the good sense to make those contributions in the Budget to the weaker sections of the community. If Deputy Treacy thinks that with his elastic conscience&mdash;this also applies to the main Opposition Party&mdash;he can fool the people into believing that the Government have not given a lot in this Budget, he is in for a rude awakening. If the Taoiseach decides, which he might, to call a general election this month, next month or next October, we can face the people with confidence, because at all times we have looked after the weak, the poor, those in need, the worker and the agricultural community.  At all times during the reign of the Fianna Fáil Party we have contributed in no small way towards the prosperity of those sections of the community.  That will continue so long as the people give us the mandate to govern this country on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I would advise the Opposition Parties not to be shouting and hollering for a general election.  Judging by the feeling in the country at present, not alone will they find it difficult to choose candidates but they will find it difficult to convince the people whom we have treated honourably for the last ten years, that they can give them better than we have ever given them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism has been made of our social welfare benefits.  Deputy O'Higgins said that he welcomed the increase in children's allowances but he added that Fianna Fáil had not broken their hearts with 10/- a week to the pensioners. The Opposition Parties have very short memories.  When I was a young boy I remember the contributions made by the Opposition Parties to the social welfare recipients.  I well remember the treatment the Opposition Parties gave to the workers. Deputy Treacy spoke about the lower paid workers but in doing so, he cast a reflection on his own Party.  He said the workers in industry and such were <Col N="1114" /> underpaid.  Surely to heavens that is what we have trade unions for.  We know the Labour Party are well aware that they cannot control their own workers, because the workmen of this country realise that their stability is under the Fianna Fáil banner and not under that of the Labour Party at the moment.  No more elaboration is needed to explain that the Labour Party are not only under the banner of the Iron Curtain but they are also accepting its principles when people like Conor Cruise O'Brien and Justin Keating are joining them.</P>

      <P>When we find that people like those I have mentioned are accepted into the Labour Party and that they take part in drafting their agricultural policies, it is no wonder that the ordinary common worker in the agricultural community has turned away from supporting the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the social welfare increases. These increases are a great boost to the old people.  They make them realise that they are no longer the neglected section of the community. Members of the Opposition would like the old people to feel that this Government have neglected them.  I realise that the old age pension is still not sufficient.  We on these benches would like to see the old age pensioners getting more money but we realise that the Exchequer and the economy of the country can bear only so much expense.  We have to give help to each individual according to the demands made on us.  Social welfare benefit recipients did well in this Budget.  Many of them realise this.  They realise that, if they want further increases next year, they must at the next general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have always given agriculture a generous slice of the national cake. On the occasion of this Budget we have given £81 million to agriculture.  I am glad to see that the beef incentive scheme grant has been increased from £8 to £12.  I myself feel that this scheme is not sufficient to increase the numbers of cattle in this country.  I realise that there has been much criticism of the calf-heifer scheme.  However, we must admit that under that scheme the headage of cattle in this country increased considerably.  I do not see the same incentive in this beef incentive scheme.  There is a tendency to encourage people to engage in beef production rather than in the production of more milk.  This is a natural trend because all over Europe we are faced with the problem of having excess milk.  While it is desirable to have milk production at a high level, excessive milk production can create problems from the export point of view. I should like to ask the Minister to consider whether it would be possible to have the calf-heifer scheme introduced again with a considerable number of restrictions.  We realise that some people acted undesirably under the calf-heifer scheme, but the scheme was introduced to increase the numbers of cattle in this country.  Perhaps it could be re-introduced in a different way, having the same principles but with greater restrictions?  Under the beef incentive scheme the numbers of cattle will not increase rapidly, nor will it encourage people to increase the number of their cattle rather than increase their milk production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of grumbling in respect of rates and valuations. It is good to see that only one out of three farmers pays rates.  In Dublin there has been a tremendous amount of criticism.  Many aspersions have been cast on the Minister for Local Government on account of the abolition of the Dublin City Council. The council were abolished because of their failure to carry out their duties as elected representatives of the people <Col N="1116" /> and to strike the rate necessary to keep the working-class people in their jobs and to provide sanitary services, sewerage services, bin collection, lighting, street sweeping and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> What about health services which should not be on the rates at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;health services, which are very essential for the poorer sections of the community in this city. The Government have been criticised for their failure to realise that the rates burden on the people is considerable but in the country we find that only one-third of the farming community are paying rates.  I do not know how the Opposition can explain their failure to strike rates in Dublin, when apparently the leader of the Labour Party in the Corporation, Deputy Seán Dunne, would have liked to be responsible for the unemployment of thousands of men both in the corporation and in subsidiary bodies.  Failure to strike a rate adequate to meet the cost of these services would inevitably cause unemployment amongst such workers.  I do not know how the Opposition can condone such a policy or how they can continue to try to hoodwink the people of Dublin into believing that their attitude is sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the production of milk in County Dublin and adjoining areas.  There was an increase of 2d per gallon for milk produced in the Dublin area.  This is a very acceptable increase and I am pleased to see the farmers getting it.  There was a decrease of 7d a gallon on the surplus milk.  In reality, this does not work right.  A man's milk quota is usually taken in the autumn of the year, and in March, his quota is usually considerably lower. In the dairies here in Dublin I know that fair quotas have not been given to the milk producers. If they are producing 30 gallons of milk a day at twopence a gallon, it is an increase of five shillings a day; but if they produce ten gallons of a surplus they will have 5s 10d deducted.  It is no bother to any farmer in County Dublin who has a quota to produce ten gallons surplus milk a day.  I would <Col N="1117" /> ask the Minister to get in touch with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and to ask him to consider this again.  The whole principle is wrong.  It is not acceptable; it is not even applicable to the area concerned. I would ask the Minister to realise that, instead of these people getting an increase for producing milk, they are actually having their incomes reduced.  I should like to see this matter resolved quickly because very little time is left to consider it and to discuss it with the people concerned.  There should be proper discussion on it and the Minister should give these people the opportunity of expressing their views.  They have a real grievance here and a real reduction in their incomes.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to a section of the community I regard as very important, farm workers.  When will we realise that the farm labourer should be brought up to parity with the industrial worker, if not given a higher rate of pay?  I believe that to work on any productive farm today one must be equally as skilled and equally as intelligent as anybody working in industry. The wages paid to farm workers in this country are ridiculous There is a wages board to which they appeal, but the time that elapses between one increase and another is so long that there is usually an exodus of farm workers&mdash; good men who are capable of keeping agricultural production at a very high level.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at the wages paid to these people.  As a section of the community responsible for such a vast amount of our exports they deserve a better hearing than they are getting at the moment.  As a farmer and an employer of men myself, I realise their capabilities and their capacity.  These people deserve the credit and the concern that I have asked for.  I hope that, if nothing else results from my contribution to this debate, at least this section of the community will be looked after.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has granted extra incentives for farm building schemes, giving assistance for the provision of silos, hay sheds and especially concrete yards.  These are now becoming a common sight.  Most farmers like to have a firm footing, <Col N="1118" /> particularly if they are stall feeding cattle or milking.  The 2/6d per square yard for concrete up to this did not even buy the cement.  I am glad to see that the Minister has taken this into consideration.  It is good to see incentives like this to help keep farmers productive and to help keep them on the land.</P>
    <P>Our educational policy speaks for itself.  Down through the years we have always expressed the hope that we will cherish each and every individual of the nation equally.  The time has come when Fianna Fáil are now capable, in a well run economy, of doing this. We are providing free education for the children of the nation and also free transport.  For this Fianna Fáil not alone deserve credit but deserve the continued support of the people. When, at the time of the first by-election after I came into the House, we expressed the view that free education would soon be provided that was no idle promise.  Not long afterwards one could see the dismay on the faces of the Opposition Members.  The results were obvious at the next four by-elections, when Fianna Fáil were victorious. All that was possible because of the steady progress made in a well guided economy under the honest direction of the Fianna Fáil Party. There are no elastic consciences over here.  We can face the people because all during our reign we faced up to our responsibilities as the elected representatives of the people.  At no time did we run away from our responsibilities, not to appear again until after the next general election.  Fianna Fáil are over here now and we will be over here after the next general election because the people have respect for our ideas and for the guidance we have given this nation.</P>
    <P>It would be advisable for the Opposition to stick at least to the principles of the Budget and not wander around talking about the referendum and other irrelevant matters which are not based on this document before me.  If the Labour Party want to continue their attitude of the State owning everything, the workers are entitled to their views.  It will not take the workers long to realise on what side their bread is buttered and what Party contributed <Col N="1119" /> to their standard of living.  It will not take the workers long to realise this and, not only will the Labour Party suffer a defeat in the next general election, but the shouts of joy of the Opposition after the referendum will become a whisper and will not be heard any more.</P>

Fianna Fáil have fulfilled their responsibility to assist the poorer sections of the community.  The Minister, and the Government as a whole, are to be commended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Budget which we are debating here has at least a threefold duty to the community.  First, it should raise sufficient finances by taxation or otherwise to run the necessary services for the next 12 months.  Secondly, it should make a fair distribution of the national wealth by providing reasonable social welfare benefits for those in need of them.  Thirdly, we have come to expect the Minister in introducing his Budget to give a fair assessment of the financial state of the country and the state of the economy and frame his Budget accordingly.  I propose to deal with the last of those three points first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that in my opinion it is the duty of a Minister for Finance in introducing his Budget Statement to recall or record the state of the economy during the 12 months which have just ended and to forecast the position for the next 12 months in order to enable the people, whether they are engaged in agriculture or industry or the professions, to plan accordingly.  Far from this Budget assisting the people to plan <Col N="1122" /> for the next 12 months, in my opinion it has left them in a complete state of bewilderment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stands before the people more or less in the position of a trader who on 18th March last went to his banker and said: &ldquo;I have just concluded a disastrous year.  My business is on the verge of bankruptcy.  If things do not improve I will wind up my business and sell out and emigrate.  In the meantime I would ask you to be patient with me and to give me time to realise my assets and discharge my obligation to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 7th May, a couple of months later, he came back to his banker and said: &ldquo;I have discovered that last year was the best year I had since I started business.  I have money and to spare.  My business is booming.  Will you double my overdraft for the next 12 months and I shall have no trouble whatever in paying you back because things were never better?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> But he was meeting the same man.  I am asking what would the banker think of this man.  Would he not think he was gone crazy or that he was some sort of a confidence trickster trying to pull a fast one on him?  I do not think I could be described as being unfair to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce if I say that they behaved on the 18th March last as the down-and-out trader I have just described and that the three of them came back on 7th May to the banker with the optimistic outlook of that trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House does not have to take my word for the behaviour of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers in recent months. On 18th March the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, requested time on Telefís Éireann to address the nation.  We were duly warned on earlier programmes that day that the Minister for Finance intended to address the people.  The people were alerted that he had a profound statement to make and many of them went <Col N="1123" /> out of their way to be at home at their television sets to hear what he had to say.  The Minister came on television grim-faced, in a serious mood, appealing to the people, with, as he said, all the sincerity and all the power at his command, to exercise restraint.  He warned them that this country was in a bad financial and economic state. He impressed the people considerably and not alone did he get the full attention of television viewers but the following days he controlled the front pages of all the national newspapers. The <i>Irish Times</i> on Wednesday, 19th March, the following day, carried this headline: &ldquo;Grim Budget Forecast by Finance Minister.  Says deficit may be well over £50 million.&rdquo;  And the Minister for Finance on that fateful 18th day of March is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey said the choice before the nation was simple.  Either a tough Budget, a cut-back on social spending, a credit squeeze, import restrictions and unemployment or higher living standards.</P>
    <P>Lower down in the same newspaper he is quoted as making this statement:</P>
    <P>We came into this year with very real financial problems.  During last year money incomes went up on average by 10 per cent while national production rose by only five per cent. We carried this inflation into 1969. When incomes and the price of things bought by those incomes each start to rise the pressure of events chases both upward at an increasing rate.</P>
    <P>But here is the most important thing of all he said, because we know he has attempted to go back on this speech since that and say that he was giving warnings about what might happen if certain restrains were not exercised and if certain belt-tightening operations did not take place.  Here is something in this reported speech of the Minister for Finance about which there cannot be any doubt.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> To frame a Budget to meet the situation was clearly going to be a formidable task anyway.  There would have to be increases in taxation, with small, if any, increases in benefits for those who would normally be expecting them.</P>
    <P>That is a fair indication of the speech made by the Minister for Finance on 18th March.  Indeed, it was followed up by the Taoiseach the next day when he shook the nation by endorsing every word that the Minister for Finance had said and went further and said that such was the state of the economy, that in order to show good example, in order to try to correct the position: &ldquo;We, the members of this Government, are prepared to suffer a reduction of 15 per cent in our salaries&rdquo;.  Surely that was an endorsement of the Minister for Finance?  Surely that was an unprecedented action taken by the Taoiseach on behalf of himself and the members of the Government?  Not since the foundation of the State, except for the gimmick of reducing salaries in 1932&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary might not know this, but never in the history of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
