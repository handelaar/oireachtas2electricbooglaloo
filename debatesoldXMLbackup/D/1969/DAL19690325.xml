      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will endeavour to get action at the United Nations to prevent a supply of arms to the Federal authorities in Nigeria or to the break-away State of Biafra.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Security Council is the only organ of the United Nations which has the right under the Charter to authorise the use of force to carry out his suggestion to prevent the supply of arms, and any one of the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto such a proposal.  The Deputy is also aware, I am sure, that amongst the European and Afro-Asian countries supplying arms are permanent members of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>I see no prospect of the Deputy's suggestion being adopted by the Security Council and even if it were allowed to go through without a veto, I am convinced it could not be made effective against surreptitious shipments of arms.  In all the circumstances, the only hope I see for bringing about stable peace and the delivery of food and medicine in sufficient quantity to succour the most helpless in the wartorn areas of this tragic conflict is the re-opening of negotiations between the Federal Government and the break-away forces.  We shall continue to do our best to promote the opening of such negotiations as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I am not cross; not in the slightest bit cross.

      <P>Can the Minister say whether the Government considered an individual approach to the British Government who are supplying arms to Nigeria, and to the French Government who are supplying arms to Biafra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy must know, there are more countries than Britain and France supplying arms.  I do not suppose that the Deputy wants it to be assumed from his question that Russia is to be left out.  She is supplying 75 per cent of the arms, we hear, and all the aeroplanes to the Lagos forces.  In addition to these three, there are many other people who have a finger in the pie.  There are at least two apartheid countries in Africa itself which have been active and there is a Far Eastern country which also has its finger in the pie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the heart of the problem of the acute suffering the indiscriminate bombing arising from the fact that the Federal Government are employing mercenary pilots from outside Nigeria over which they have no effective control?  Does the Minister think that any public opinion could be brought to bear on them not to import mercenaries into this tragic conflict that is proceeding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I told Deputy Dillon, in answer to a supplementary last week or the week before, that we <Col N="829" /> were very concerned with the civilian casualties that were being caused by the bombing planes.  It was well known that at the beginning, and until recently, the pilots were not Nigerians.  I myself pressed personally on several occasions that the employment of foreign pilots should be stopped.  I am given to understand by the Nigerian Government that for the last couple of months there are no foreign pilots employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Russian and the British Governments, on the one hand, and the French, on the other, appear to be the three countries principally involved in supplying arms to both sides, does the Minister not think that a direct approach to these Governments would have some effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than these three involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the three principal ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than three involved.  There are at least three European countries supplying arms to one side or the other and two apartheid African countries.  There is an Asian country as well.  It would be very difficult to get agreement between them, even if it were confined to these three. The real nub of the problem is whether the Federal Government and the break-away force will come together and recognise that it is in the interest of the Nigerian people, East and West, and of the peoples of Africa as a whole that African problems should be settled on the basis of peaceful negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if, in view of the demands for transport for livestock and other goods, he will now consider favourably increasing the area of operation of merchandise licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided in December, 1967, to extend on application the scope of operation of any existing carrier merchandise licence which permitted the carriage of livestock in a restricted area to allow State-wide carriage of livestock.  As a result of the concession over 630 licensees may now carry livestock throughout the State compared with about 110 prior to December, 1967.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the House I have also established a study group to examine the desirability of general long-term measures to liberalise road freight transport for reward. On my direction, the group gave priority consideration to the question of facilities available for the carriage of livestock and has made its recommendations but as I indicated in my reply of 6th March, 1969, I am examining these recommendations and am not yet in a position to make a statement in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to a recent report that the air companies would have difficulty in financing their capital programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital programme of the air companies over the five years 1968-69 to 1972-73 is estimated to cost £71.5 million.  The policy embodied in the Air Companies Act, 1966 in regard to the future capital expenditure of the air companies was that they should thenceforth be financially self-supporting and independent of the Exchequer raising any necessary future capital requirements either direct from their own resources or by borrowings serviced from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The capital programme over the next five years entails expenditure of quite a new order of magnitude.  This arises because the companies must re-equip on an unprecedented scale. The necessary additions to their fleet include two Boeing 747 jets, two Boeing 320's and eight Boeing 737's. Of the total sum of £71.5 million the companies will be able to provide £29 million approximately from their own internal resources.  The companies must look to other sources for the remainder of the capital required.  The companies are confident of being able to borrow the balance required but it will of course be necessary to be satisfied that the companies can bear the cost of servicing loan capital of this magniture. This is a matter which is under examination by my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Estimated annual home production of honey <Col N="833" /> averaged 115 tons and imports averaged 560 tons during the five year period 1963 to 1967.  Home production is being encouraged by means of a scheme of grants towards the cost of equipment and swarms which is operated by county committees of agriculture and by advice and instruction provided by the instructors in horticulture and beekeeping employed by the county committees, who number about 80.  Licences to import honey free of duty are confined to those firms who undertake to buy any home produced honey offered to them.  The firms concerned have undertaken that all honey brought in under these licences will be labelled as imported.</P>

      <P>I am aware that four clerks of works were recruited by Kerry County Council in 1951 and 1952 for supervisory duties in connection with local authority housing and that they have continued to be employed by the local authority since then.  One of these men has taken legal action against the county council regarding the tenure of his employment and as I understand that the matter is still before the courts, I consider it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the granting of service pay to engineers' clerks employed by the Kerry County Council from 1st July, 1967, was recommended by the Labour Court; and why his Department did not sanction such a recommendation having regard to the fact that the recommendation was accepted by the unions and the managers' association.</P>

      <P>No recommendation was made by the Labour Court concerning service pay for engineers' office assistants.  Agreement was reached between the County and City Managers' Association and the unions representing the engineers' office assistants following a conciliation conference at the Labour Court on 18th July, 1968, that service pay and additional annual holidays were to be agreed upon within the general context of the local conditions obtaining within any specific area.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that, although certifying officers and Old IRA colleagues testify that applicants for IRA pensions and special allowances are eligible for such awards, his Department have on numerous occasions rejected such evidence; and by what method and at what level in his Department decisions are taken to accept or reject such applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the investigation by my Department of applications for the Service (1917-1921) Medal without Bar, it being one of the conditions of eligibility for a special allowance that the applicant, if not otherwise qualified, must be the holder of a &ldquo;duly awarded&rdquo; Service Medal without Bar.</P>
      <P>Since June, 1957, the system of investigation of entitlement to the Medal without Bar is that reports are sought from the surviving officers of the battalion and company of which the applicant claims to have been a member during the three months which ended on the 11th July, 1921.  If no officers are available, members of the company who are pensioners under the Military Service Pensions Acts are approached. The reports received are evaluated in conjunction with the unit rolls furnished to the referee for the purposes of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and other records. If there is no unfavourable report and the applicant is on the unit roll, the application is automatically granted. Even if the applicant is not on the roll, the application is generally granted if, on the roll position being brought to the notice of the officers, they maintain their verification.  If conflicting reports are received the conflicts are resolved as far as possible by correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medals were issued prior to June, 1957, under a less detailed system which experience showed to be unsatisfactory. Consequently, where an applicant for a special allowance is the holder of such a medal, his entitlement to it is reinvestigated under the current system. Recently, this re-investigation is being <Col N="838" /> waived where the person is listed on the unit roll.</P>
    <P>The decision to reject an application or to hold a pre-June, 1957 Medal not &ldquo;duly awarded&rdquo; is taken, after a most detailed examination and assessment of all the available evidence, by one senior officer of my Department, who records his reasons.  Appeals by or on behalf of rejected applicants are submitted to me.  Only rarely do I see reason to vary the decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from the Minister's reply that those medals were carelessly given and are we to assume that if a holder of a medal applies for special allowances, his record in so far as his membership of the IRA is concerned would be reinvestigated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the absurd situation arising out of the fact that Monaghan County Council claim that there were rates due of about £300 from the Lagan Navigation Company before it went into liquidation some times in the 'Twenties; that, as a result of this dormant claim for a minimal quantity of arrears of rates, nobody will take the responsibility for the land and that there is now a large stretch of land <Col N="840" /> passing through County Monaghan on which nobody can build a school, a house or do anything else?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that we had actually approved the building of a secondary school in Monaghan but that we could not build it because nobody owned the land and the Department of Education would not give a grant to a person who had a defective title and the Board of Works would not give title for fear they would admit on their part that they were liable for the £250 which Monaghan County Council claimed from them in 1926?</P>

The Irish syllabus committee recommended that an oral test should form part of the examination in Irish and that one-third of the total marks should be allocated to that test.</P>
      <P>Further meetings were convened in April, 1966, with representatives of the recognised post-primary school associations, at which the recommendations of the Irish syllabus committee and the other language syllabus committees concerning oral tests were accepted.  An oral test in English and practical tests in the practical subjects were also agreed.  No definite arrangements were made as to the manner of implementing the recommendations concerning the oral and practical tests but it was agreed that the schools should operate them on a trial basis in 1967 and 1968. A number of schools co-operated in carrying out the tests on a trial basis in 1967.</P>

Having regard to the large number of candidates involved and the consequent disruption of the work of the schools it was apparent that the application of oral and practical tests by extern examiners appointed for the purpose by the Department would be impracticable.</P>
    <P>Following further consideration I decided that the objectives of the courses in the subjects in question could be achieved through the schools making an assessment of each candidate's oral or practical proficiency in the relevant subjects.  As this would represent a new departure in relation to the certificate examinations I decided that initially at any rate only a small percentage of the total marks&mdash;15 per cent in Irish and 10 per cent in the other subjects&mdash;should be assigned to oral and practical proficiency.  School assessment forms an integral part of examination in many other countries.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a true interior discipline which is what should be our aim in the opinion of those who have studied the problem, is not served by corporal punishment, the main victims of which in our schools at present are those children who are most likely to be harmed by its use, namely, the backward or the difficult child, whose cases should have a deeper study <Col N="845" /> than they at present get and whose cases can only be aggravated by indiscriminate use of corporal punishment?</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties involved.  At present, we are having discussions with the managerial and teaching bodies with a view to discontinuing corporal punishment in infants and first class and to tightening regulations in regard to its administration in the higher standards.  As an ultimate sanction, some form of corporal punishment is required.  I am looking at the matter very closely at the moment.  The matter is by no means as simple as the Deputy suggests.  It is a highly complex problem. I am convinced that at the lower classes&mdash;infants and first class&mdash;corporal punishment should be abolished but, at higher levels, I feel it should be there as an ultimate sanction.  At the moment, we are discussing ways and means of tightening the administration of corporal punishment in relation to the higher standards.</P>

      <P>A lot of evils have been committed in the name of psychology.  Other countries have found quite the reverse of what Deputy M. O'Leary claims.  They found that, when this thing was gone into too precipitately, chaos ensued in the schools. While we can certainly tighten up the controls and abolish corporal punishment in the lower classes&mdash;human nature being human nature, particularly with older boys and girls&mdash;I feel an ultimate sanction of this kind should be there to preserve a measure of discipline so that the ordinary process of education can continue in a reasonable <Col N="846" /> way in the schools concerned rather than rush into a situation where you have total disorder in the school if you rapidly break away from a system of corporal punishment as an ultimate exercise in a case of total indiscipline.</P>

      <P>I have the utmost sympathy with the type of case in question and the examination of the applications in this case that have come in has, to a great extent, brought a good deal of light, as we expected, to bear on this particular problem.  This little scheme was originally introduced to meet two types of cases in addition to doing something for the pensioner concerned, by way of compensating persons who had to give up insurable employment and were not eligible for unemployment benefit by virtue of the fact that they were confined to caring for their parents.  In cases where they gave up insurable employment, came home and certified that they were capable of obtaining, and were genuinely seeking work and drew unemployment benefit and then came along the next day to say that they gave up work entirely to care for their parents, then it is hard to reconcile these two things.</P>

      <P>Cheques in payment of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, to which I presume the Deputy refers, are posted from headquarters of my Department to all recipients in the Tullamore area. About half the recipients are suffering from long-term illnesses and it is, therefore, possible to issue benefit cheques to them regularly in midweek in ample time for delivery before the weekend.  In the case of recipients who are suffering from a short-term illness benefit cheques are issued daily as the medical certificates on which these payments are based are received. However, the last despatch of disability benefit cheques in my Department's working week is made at 5 p.m. each Friday and, it is understood, these should normally be delivered by first post on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to ensure earlier delivery in every case without departing from the general principle that medical certificates must first be received to establish title to benefit and this I am not prepared to do.</P>

      <P>I have had no complaints in recent years from the public or from distributors about the use of trading stamps.  My Department is aware of the practice but has no evidence that its incidence is growing substantially.

Certainly, the view has been expressed that an amount of money is leaving the country via this trading stamps scheme, that it is controlled from British sources and that it adds to the costs of those running supermarkets and, obviously, may have repercussions on consumer prices?

In those circumstances, if a Member of the House passes through a stormy period on the premises and the matter is brought to your attention is it not expedient, if you are satisfied that the circumstances reported to you are of sufficient gravity, that you would take upon yourself the obligation of bringing the matter to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for such inquiry as you deem expedient for the purpose of asserting that what transpires in Leinster House is under your jurisdiction no matter whose conduct is called in question?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say something now to put this thing in its perspective?  There is a procedure in this House whereby Deputies may raise, on the Adjournment, questions of urgent public importance or questions which have been asked at the normal Question Time, with the answers to which they have been dissatisfied.  It is usual on the Adjournment, in fact it is according to Standing Orders of the House, that the Deputy who raises the question is permitted 20 minutes in which to speak and the Minister who has to deal with that question is given ten minutes to reply. There has been a series of questions raised on the Adjournment on the Minister for Local Government's administration over a number of weeks and months past and there has been a deliberate attempt to preclude the Minister for Local Government from using his ten minutes in which to reply adequately.  It was in circumstances like that, when the Minister for Local Government foresaw those interruptions during the course of his ten minutes' reply last week, that he refused to continue with his reply because he knew he would not be given the opportunity to do so.  It is no harm to put that in its perspective.</P>

It is alleged that not only was bad language used but that there was physical violence.  I remember in stormy days in the past difficult situations of that kind arising.

All I am suggesting is that if the Ceann Comhairle is himself satisfied that <i>prima facie</i> evidence of gross disorder within his jurisdiction in Leinster House has been brought to his attention the initiative should be taken by the Ceann Comhairle to take such steps as he thinks fitting, including convening the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and saying: &ldquo;This complaint has been made to me and I think it requires examination by this Committee.&rdquo;  All I am concerned about is to vindicate the dignity of the person and the authority of the Ceann Comhairle in Leinster House which I do not think anyone should flout, whether he be a Minister, a Deputy or an officer.</P>

      <P>We are doing two things in this.  Firstly, the House recently passed the Exports Promotion Bill and the provisions of section 2 of this Bill are tied in with that, and that is to enable the services available to exporters of goods to be made available also to architects and engineers who are operating within this country, but are carrying out works abroad.  I <Col N="868" /> explained to the House previously the reason for this.  Within the purpose of this Bill the objective is to enable political risks insurance to be given to cover that kind of export of services which at present is available for the export of goods.  Without this section political risks insurance could not be given in respect of those kinds of services; it could only be given in respect of goods.</P>
      <P>The other purpose of the Bill is to raise from £5 million to £10 million the aggregate sum which at any time the Minister may undertake by way of guarantee in respect of political risks insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this related to the Kuwait operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not specifically.  It is related to all our export activities.  The Deputy will appreciate that although what I am speaking about is related solely to the export of the services of architects and engineers it may occur in any part of the world.  The figure of £10 million which we want to insert here is necessary because of the commitments already entered into over the years in respect of political risks.  There is a growing demand for political risks insurance, so it is necessary to raise this figure.  This covers all exports of goods and in future, if this Bill is passed, it will cover the export of this particular kind of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising the Bill for being a bit obscure but if a building contractor secures a contract in France, Kuwait or any other foreign administration and hires an architect, a quantity surveyor and an engineer and pays them a suitable fee and as a result of political upheaval the project is abortive and the payment of these technicians proves to be nugatory is the purpose of this Bill to enable the contractor to get insurance from the Minister's Department to recoup the expenditure on the architect, quantity surveyor and other technocrats whom he may have employed in contemplation of the completion of his contract of construction or other work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to make available to the people qualifying <Col N="869" /> under the Export Promotions Act, which the House passed recently&mdash;that is the architects and engineers coming within the category so defined &mdash; the same provisions in relation to political risks as are at present applicable to the exports of goods.  That is the broad general proposition.  There are qualifications to it in that political risks insurance is not given in respect of certain places&mdash;these change from time to time&mdash;nor is it given to the extent of 100 per cent of the amount being covered.  However, I do not think it is necessary that I should go into the details of the political risks scheme except to say that what is being done here is to put the provision of those services, which are now being regarded as exports if they come within the specifications in the Bill, in the same position as exports of goods for the purpose of political risks insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been growing fears that the usual sources of international reserves will not be adequate for the requirements of expanding world trade and payments. No doubt, there will continue to be argument as to how far the monetary crises of the past year or two are due <Col N="870" /> to shortage or maldistribution of international reserves, or to failure on the part of debtor and creditor countries to make the right domestic policy adjustments in time.  There can, however, be no denying that existing means of increasing international liquidity are limited and haphazard.  The main sources at present are gold, the reserve currencies&mdash;sterling and the United States dollar&mdash;and member countries' quotas in the International Monetary Fund, which are the equivalent of their subscriptions to the Fund.  Gold holds a key position because of the intrinsic value it has acquired and its universal acceptability.  Whatever its advantages, it cannot be depended upon as a source of new international liquidity.</P>
      <P>In 1966 and 1967 none of the newly-mined gold went into international reserves, as demand for industrial use and for hoarding absorbed the supply in both years.  In fact, in 1967 and in the first quarter of 1968 a substantial amount of gold was transferred from official reserves into private hands, thus actually reducing the amount available to finance world trade and payments.  Action to prevent this leakage was taken in March last by the termination of the London Gold Pool.  Since then the price of non-monetary gold has been allowed to fluctuate.  As a result of these developments the amount of gold placed on world markets in the past year has been small and the arrangements for the marketing of South African gold are a matter of dispute between that country and the major financial powers.  For the present, at least, the amount of gold available to finance trade can be regarded as more or less frozen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several years the main sources of supply of increased international liquidity have been the deficits in the balance of payments of Great Britain and the United States, chiefly the latter. As Deputies are aware, Britain has taken various measures to reduce the deficits in her balance of payments and it is clear that balance of payments deficits in that country are not likely to continue to provide increased international liquidity.  In the case of the dollar the United States authorities <Col N="871" /> also have taken action to reduce the deficit in the balance of payments, with it appears, some success on the non-trade side.  Ironic as it may seem, the achievement of a sound balance of payments position by the United States and Britain could lead to a major crisis in international trade and finance because of its effect in reducing the volume of international reserves.</P>
    <P>To avert such a development, the International Monetary Fund has for a number of years past being carrying out an intensive examination of the international monetary mechanism to see how it might be improved.  The main purpose was to find a way of creating additional reserve units which would be acceptable internationally.  At the annual meeting of the Fund in September, 1967, a draft scheme was laid before the Board of Governors under which existing reserves would be supplemented by artificially created reserve units, called special drawing rights, to be administered by the Fund. The draft scheme was approved by the Governors and the Directors were instructed to prepare a detailed scheme. This has now been done in the form of the proposed amendment to the Fund's Articles of Agreement.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme, each country wishing to participate will be allocated special drawing rights independently of its external payments position and in proportion to its present quota in the Fund.  Participation in the scheme is optional and will not affect members' other rights in the Fund.  These drawing rights will be handled in a special account in the Fund separate from the organisation's existing accounts.</P>
    <P>The proposed drawing rights will be additional to the Fund's existing arrangements for assisting member countries.  The underlying concept is, however, different.  At present members in balance of payments difficulties may draw temporarily on the resources of the Fund.  These consist of the total of members' subscriptions or quotas, 25 per cent of which have been paid in gold and the balance in members' own currencies.  A drawing is made by purchasing foreign exchange from the <Col N="872" /> Fund in exchange for the member's own currency.  There is a limit on outstanding drawings of 125 per cent of the quota.  The first 25 per cent can be drawn automatically since it represents the gold portion of the subscription but thereafter the Fund exercises closer supervision and must be satisfied that effective measures are being taken to correct the imbalance.</P>
    <P>Special drawing rights will not replace any portion of these existing rights.  They will be created without any prior deposit of gold or currency and they will be used not by drawing on the Fund but by direct transfer between member countries.</P>
    <P>If a country gets into balance of payments difficulties and wishes to use these rights, it will exchange them for an equivalent amount of another country's currency.  The Fund will designate the participating country which will provide the currency, but the transaction can also be arranged directly between two countries.  The borrowing country will use the foreign currency obtained to finance part of its balance of payments deficit.  The scheme, in effect, is based on the obligation of participants to accept drawing rights from other members in exchange for an equal amount of convertible currency.  Special drawing rights, therefore, will have the character of reserve assets.  The intention is that countries will accept the new rights as an integral part of their currency reserves.</P>
    <P>The rights will have a fixed value in terms of gold, this value being the equivalent of the present gold value of the United States dollar.  Countries participating in the scheme will accept them on this condition and on the condition that they are exchangeable for their own currency on this basis.  Thus, they will have many of the characteristics of gold&mdash;a guaranteed value, right of transferability and general acceptability.  In practice, they will represent an effective supplement to the world's gold stocks available for monetary purposes and so to international liquidity.</P>
    <P>To ensure that countries are not encouraged by the provision of these additional reserves to run excessive <Col N="873" /> balance of payments deficits and to prevent their using their drawing rights to the full in order to shield their other reserves, borrowers will be required to hold permanently at least 30 per cent on average of drawing rights allocated to them.  As a deficit country goes back into surplus and begins to accumulate reserves, it will be expected to build up its drawing rights and thus be in a position to help other countries in deficit.</P>
    <P>At this stage, we can only guess at the practical effects of the scheme when brought into operation.  Unofficially, it has been suggested that, in the first five years, the total amount of special drawing rights to be created would not exceed $10,000 million, that is the equivalent of 50 per cent of the total of members' quotas in the International Monetary Fund.  This would be an average of about $2,000 million a year. Contrasted with total world reserves of $73,000 million, this would be only a modest increase in liquidity.  On this basis we would become entitled to receive drawing rights amounting to $40 million or £16.7 million in the first five years.  Our liability to provide convertible currency in exchange for drawing rights of other countries would be limited in the first five years to $80 million or £33.4 million&mdash;that is twice the allocation of drawing rights to us.</P>
    <P>It will not be clear until the scheme is in operation for some time to what extent we will be called upon to meet our liability to provide convertible currency in exchange for other countries' drawing rights.  The Fund in designating countries to provide currency will take into account the strength of the balance of payments and reserve positions of those countries. The objective over time will be to achieve a balanced distribution of special drawing rights among participants. It is probable that eventually we will be required to accept drawing rights from other members in exchange for currency, provided our balance of payments and reserve positions are satisfactory.  As Irish currency is not used in international trade, it would probably be necessary to provide sterling. It is not anticipated that we would experience difficulty in complying with <Col N="874" /> any request made to us.  We, of course, would have exactly the same entitlement to use our own special drawing rights should the need arise.</P>
    <P>There is as yet no firm indication of the likely date of introduction of the scheme.  There are several procedural hurdles to be surmounted.  First of all, the amendment to the Articles of Agreement must be accepted by three-fifths of the members, having 80 per cent of the voting power in the Fund. Progress to date has been slow.  By the beginning of February 34 members out of the required 67, with 50.5 per cent of the votes had accepted it.  Even when the scheme has been accepted, it cannot be initiated until members with 75 per cent of the quotas have deposited their instruments of participation. So far only 15 have done so. Finally, an 85 per cent majority will be required to bring the scheme into operation and settle the amount of rights to be created.</P>
    <P>As Governor of the Fund for Ireland, I have supported the special drawing rights scheme and voted in favour of the proposed amendment. Member countries agreeing to the scheme are expected to make any necessary legislative and other provision to enable them to fulfil their obligations under it.  As a nation, we are dependent to an exceptional degree on external trade for our prosperity. We can only lose from a contraction in the rate of growth of world trade and we have viewed with misgiving the tendency of the international monetary system to drift into a situation of recurrent crisis.  The international payments mechanism must be made to work in the interests of the whole world.  I see the proposals of the International Monetary Fund as a welcome effort to bring order into the situation, to free the world from the dangers stemming from doubtful or haphazard growth in reserves and to provide in the future for the deliberate, planned creation of reserves as and when needed.  It is a cautious approach to the problem.  The scheme has been criticised on various counts.  For instance, many of the developing countries feel that the allocation of drawing rights should not be based on <Col N="875" /> members' quotas in the Fund on the ground that this simply adds to the strong overall reserve positions of the advanced countries.  Nevertheless, the scheme is a beginning and a welcome one and I believe we should support it for that reason.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the introduction of the special drawing rights scheme the amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund as set out in the Schedule to the Bill proposes certain other changes in the Fund's rules and practices.  The main changes are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  formal confirmation of the right of a member country to draw automatically from the Fund up to the limit of its gold subscription&mdash; normally 25 per cent of the total subscription&mdash;and of the right to obtain automatic repayment of any portion of the subscription converted into currencies other than the country's own;</P>
    <P>(2)  a change of the voting rules to provide for an 85 per cent majority for fundamental decisions.  Under the new rules the EEC countries, voting together, and the United States will have a veto.  At present the United States have an effective veto and Britain has a veto to a limited extent;</P>
    <P>(3)  under existing arrangements a repayment obligation can be reduced or wiped out in a particular year if the Fund's holdings of the particular currency to be used for the repayment are deemed to be excessive.  It is proposed to abolish this right with the effect that drawings from the Fund will be repaid more rapidly;</P>
    <P>(4)  it is proposed that interest be paid by the Fund at the rate of 1½ per cent per annum on any portion of a country's subscription in excess of 25 per cent made available to other countries in currencies other than a member's own currency.  The interest rate may be varied by the Fund, by a simple majority, within the range one to two per cent.  Payment of interest will be made in gold or in a member's own currency as determined by the Fund;</P>
    <P>(5)  it is also proposed that the <Col N="876" /> final decision on questions of interpretation of the rules will in future rest with a standing committee of the Board of Governors unless the entire Board decides otherwise; the existing rules confine final interpretation to the whole Board.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that special drawing rights allocated to Ireland will be held by the Central Bank of Ireland and that that bank will be responsible for all transactions and operations involving drawing rights.  Since drawing rights will have the characteristics of reserve assets, it is appropriate that they should be held by the Central Bank, which holds the country's main external reserves.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to take power to transfer to the Central Bank by order certain functions under the 1957 Bretton Woods Agreements Act at present exercised by the Minister for Finance.  These functions relate to the making of payments to and the receipt of moneys from the International Monetary Fund.  Such transactions arise in relation to the payment of our subscription, the purchase of other currencies from the Fund in exchange for Irish currency and repurchases. These operations, therefore, would be more appropriate to the Central Bank than to the Exchequer.  This is the position in several other countries.  The change will also yield some simplification of administration.  Under the present arrangements all payments to the Funds must be made out of the Central Fund and all receipts must be credited to it.  In practice the money for payments is provided by the Central Bank against certificates of indebtedness issued by the Minister for Finance, which are held by the bank as domestic securities in its legal tender note fund.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the vesting in the Central Bank of the asset represented by our gold subscription to the Fund and foreign currency made available to other countries under our obligations to the Fund.  This asset will be credited by the bank against an equal amount of the Government's indebtedness to the bank in respect of advances made for payments to the Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The effect of these arrangements will be that the Central Bank will have direct control over all the external reserves of the State, apart from the sterling holdings of the commercial banks.  The House will be aware, in this connection, that as a result of the agreement with Great Britain on the application of the Basle arrangements to our sterling holdings, a substantial amount of the Associated Banks' sterling assets&mdash;£40 million&mdash;was deposited with the Central Bank in November last.  The Central Bank's custody and control of the external reserves is, therefore, becoming much more complete than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the order transferring functions or vesting the assets in the Central Bank will come into operation on a day to be fixed with the agreement of the Central Bank.  This is to ensure that the transfer will take place only at a mutually convenient and opportune time.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in effect, represents the confirmation of the Government's vote in favour of a proposed amendment to the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement and, of course, it will have our full support. The only comment I should like to make on the very full explanation given by the Minister is that I hope the introduction of this Bill and the decision by the Government which is incorporated in it will serve to indicate to everybody the very definite, real interest we have in the International Monetary Fund and in the achievement, if it were ever possible, of liquidity.  We have that interest because we depend on our trade and our exports.  We cannot in any way be independent nor can we insulate ourselves against the situation to which the Minister has referred.  In recent years we have seen the effects of the devaluation of sterling.  If, as a result of difficulties, any other currency were to be devalued, that would have its effect upon us, indirectly but certainly. Any move, therefore, by the Governors of the Fund towards easing a situation which may arise from temporary <Col N="878" /> balance of payments difficulties affecting any of the member countries is certainly something that should have our support.</P>
      <P>I gather from what the Minister said &mdash;it is referred to in the White Paper&mdash; that the degree of easing of strain aimed at by this amendment has a definite ceiling.  It cannot be, and it is not intended that it should be, used except to ease a temporary and, perhaps, limited balance of payments difficulty in any particular country.  It cannot be used, and it is not intended that it should be used, to enable one particular country to achieve, in fact, a standard of living for its own citizens at the expense of the citizens of other countries.  The way in which this will be achieved, as I understand the Minister, is by limiting the liability of the participating countries to accept drawing rights with a particular ceiling which will be in effect twice their particular allocations to the Fund.  The Fund cannot be obliged to accept drawing rights of any greater extent so that no matter what reduction in strain this may achieve and what degree of liquidity, it will certainly mean that participating countries must continue to live within their means and to trade in such fashion that they cannot use this to increase their balance of payments beyond a certain figure.  In that regard it can, I suppose, be described as no more than a cushion against temporary difficulties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am sorry to note from what the Minister has said that it may be a considerable time before this is eventually incorporated into the present Agreement.  It has taken some 12 to 18 months to reach this particular stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a very small part of what is being set up in this sphere.  The Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> First of all, the amendment to the Articles of Agreement must be accepted by three-fifths of the members, having 80 per cent of the voting power in the Fund.  Progress to date has been slow.  By the beginning of February 34 members out of the required 67, with 50.5 per cent of the votes had accepted it.  Even when the scheme has been accepted, it cannot be initiated until members with 75 per cent of the quotas have deposited their instruments of participation. So far only 15 have done so.  Finally, an 85 per cent majority will be required to bring the scheme into operation and settle the amount of rights to be created.</P>
    <P>It would appear from that that this is, as Deputy O'Higgins said, a long-term plan and possibly we will encounter a great many more difficulties by the time the necessity to use this will arise. The Minister remarked, in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>As Irish currency is not used in international trade, it would probably be necessary to provide sterling.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility of having Irish currency more widely recognised? It is somewhat annoying to be told, even in Britain, that Irish currency is no good.  That was the situation, too, for a time in Northern Ireland.  This has nothing to do with this particular measure, but the thought strikes me that it will give certain people the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;We are tied to sterling, lock, stock and barrel and there is nothing we can do about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This whole scheme is very technical. It is right that we should have some safeguard prepared in case things get really bad.  If this gives us, as Deputy O'Higgins said, a cushion&mdash;cushion is the right word here&mdash;then the House should give every assistance to the Government in ensuring that we do not hold things up.  That is the main thing. I hope that with all the great development, sometime some of our people will come in here and find a goldmine. Then we will be able to do something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We will never have to live with it.  The stench of oil would bring every international rogue in the world straggling to us.  God deliver us from oil.  We will not find much gold or oil in our territory.  However, that is entirely irrelevant to the Bill we are considering.  The great difficulty about the topics covered by this Bill is that very few people understand them and, not understanding, care very little about them.  This Bill is introduced as our small contribution to the Bretton Woods Agreement for the purpose of providing a larger pool of international currency to lubricate international trade.</P>
      <P>That necessity has arisen from the fact that South Africa will not sell its newly-mined gold except to people who want to put it under the mattress and nobody will face the question as to why the problem has arisen.  Why are the old sheiks of Araby reposing on their beds with mountains of gold concealed beneath them?  Why is India of all countries in the world, with poverty, desolation and hunger, smuggling in greater and greater quantities of gold?  Where is the gold of the world going?  In the last two years, out of the total gold production of the world not a single ounce has passed into the central banks of the trading countries?  Where has it gone?  It has gone into the hands of the Asiatic people, very largely.  Why?  It is because they have grown terrified of inflation. The odd and interesting thing is that you find in the deserts of Arabia a more present knowledge and understanding of the devastating effects of inflation than you do in O'Connell Street, Piccadilly and Fifth Avenue.  I often ask myself the question when people talk about providing the resources with which to lubricate the operations of international trade, but do many others ask themselves the question as to how the system would be made to work if every nation stipulates for a favourable balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you reflect for a moment you will <Col N="881" /> find that if every nation insisted on a favourable balance of payments, all international trade would stop.  All international trade in the past has proceeded on the basis that certain countries had such large favourable balances of payments that they could export capital, and it was the exporting of capital and the mining of sufficient quantities of gold that kept the wheels of international trade going.</P>
    <P>Why is it today that the wheels of international trade are in danger of grinding to a halt?  It is because the South Africans will not sell their gold and any other gold that is coming on the market is not going to the central banks of the trading countries but to the sheiks of Araby; and the two international currencies that have heretofore supplied the surplus resources to maintain international trade &mdash;sterling and the US dollar&mdash;are themselves suspect, with the result that you have vast surpluses of the resources of international funds in Federal Germany and in Switzerland, neither of which is prepared to release them for the purpose of international trade because they will not accept any other currency in exchange for their own.</P>
    <P>Why?  For precisely the same reason as the sheiks of Araby are storing gold under their beds.  Nobody trust's anybody's currency any more.  Why do they not trust other people's currencies? It is because they know that in this country, in Great Britain and in the United States itself we are all travelling the road that South America travelled during the first half of the 20th century.  It used to be an object of derision in civilised and sophisticated countries in Europe to watch the progress of South American Republics whose currencies became so corrupt and devalued that perennially they were entirely withdrawn and complete new currencies issued.  It was only the incidence of two world wars that produced that phenomenon in Europe.</P>
    <P>Some people wonder why the dollar and sterling have fought so desperately to avoid devaluation.  They did so because being accepted as international currencies brought them very substantial <Col N="882" /> profits through their mercantile activities in the City of London and in Wall Street in New York.  The franc was never accepted as an international currency and what people forget is the frequency with which the French Government have devalued the currency virtually without comment.  What people should not forget is that the reason Germany is today the most prosperous country probably in the world is that she experienced once involuntary uncontrolled inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only once did Germany experience involuntary uncontrolled inflation. Do not imagine that Dr. Schacht's inflation was anything but a deliberately planned operation in order to defraud Germany's creditors at the time.  She experienced involuntary uncontrolled inflation once and once only and that has left so indelible an imprint on the minds of the German people that they have accepted sacrifices since 1948 of very substantial dimensions in order to guarantee themselves against the possibility of a recurrence of such a catastrophe ever again.  Unhappily, other countries have not learned that lesson, and until they learn it, such measures as we are now implementing here today and such agreements as we are meditating, although they may serve to plaster over the cracks momentarily, make no fundamental contribution to the solution of the real problem underlying the danger that overhangs international trade the world over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember saying in this house four or five years ago to Deputy Lynch, the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Watch out. Unless you accumulate here a powerful reserve position for our people, you will find yourself caught between a storm to the east of you and a tornado to the west of you.  If we ourselves are vulnerable when these two developments strike, our position will become utterly desperate, and our very survival as an independent State will be called in question.&rdquo;  We are very close to that position now, and we are close to that position because the United States of America are determined, apparently, <Col N="883" /> to control their own inflation no matter what the cost.  It will test all the resources of the United States Government to achieve their purpose and the repercussions upon us will be formidable.</P>
    <P>The Government of Great Britain, in order to survive, are seeking to bring inflation in Britain to a halt.  I doubt if they will succeed.  Remember, part of their effort is through the so-called wages and incomes policy which is being energetically contested.  Let this House make no mistake about it, we have to reckon with the fact that in the course of that contest in Great Britain a strike took place in Fords factory at Dagenham, and that put 300 men out of work in Cork.</P>

      <P>It is not at all impossible that there could be further incidents of that kind.  We are here struggling with an inflation of our own. Remember, our conditions will be looked at with a cold detached statistical eye by those abroad who are not in the least interested in our national aspirations or in anything other than our capacity to pay our way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance now makes a television appearance to warn us that we are on the edge of a precipice.  He has not thought it proper to add: &ldquo;We have been brought there by an Administration of which I have been a Minister during the past 12 years.&rdquo;  The fact is that we are on the edge of a precipice and we have been brought there by an Administration of which the Minister has been a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is right that if we have to face legislation of this kind and an effort of this character we should ask ourselves, why?  The answer is: &ldquo;Because of inflation.&rdquo;  It is important to understand that inflation is just as deadly to great powerful countries like the United States of America as it is to relatively weak countries such as Ireland, Iceland, Portugal and Spain. The difference is that countries like the United States of America and Great Britain have great reserves to fall back on before disaster catches up on them, and we have little or none.  We have <Col N="884" /> little or none, because the Government at present in office created a situation in this country which stripped us of the reserves we now ought to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  We are at the moment, as the Minister rightly said on television, on the edge of a precipice. We cannot have it both ways.  It is this kind of mad talk that has brought the country to the stage it is in.  It is this kind of blatherskite that was used in the Cork and Kildare by-elections to justify a declaration that a universal 12 per cent wage increase was not only permissible but desirable owing to the strength of our economic situation and the pressure of a rising cost of living. It was that decision, taken in 1964, which started the spiral of prices and costs which has now reached its apotheosis in a demand from the workers in the building industry for an all-round flat increase of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The request for that increase is not born of a capricious desire for more. It is born of two propositions: one that the cost of living is steadily mounting and everything that the ordinary person has to buy is costing more; and the other that not 12 months ago the Minister for Finance was telling us that everything in the garden was lovely, and that we could afford whatever we wanted.  He is still prepared to say today, for the political effect he hopes it will have in the country, that our reserves were never higher, that our external reserves were never higher. He does not say in what terms he speaks of our reserves as being high. He does not apply any comparison. He does not say whether he is speaking of the net external assets of the joint stock banks or the combined assets of the joint stock banks, the Central Bank and the Government.  He does not say whether he is speaking of a net figure of our total holdings as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think he knows&mdash;I certainly do not know&mdash;what they are.  We used <Col N="885" /> to have them represented as being something in the order of £400 million sterling.  No one ever knew what the total net external reserves of the citizens of this country were.  One thing we were certain of: whatever they were, they were not accessible to the Government to finance balance of payments problems.  Far from it.  Balance of payments problems might reduce them very rapidly as their owners transferred their assets out of this country in apprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They were out of the country anyway.  The fact that they are external reserves means they are out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose that instead of selling their reserves they transferred what they had here outside and followed them.  Does the Minister never envisage that possibility?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking on the one hand of the external reserves as owned by our private citizens.  The Deputy said they might transfer them out of the country.  The fact that they are external reserves means they are out of the country already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I said they might transfer these reserves out of our jurisdiction and access to them by taking with them as much more as they had here, and themselves to boot.  A small nation cannot afford that kind of operation.  We know the boys who go to Jersey, and the boys who go to Bermuda, and the boys who go here, there and anywhere to avoid tax liabilities.  Great Britain may have immense assets and may be able to disregard that activity but even Great Britain, and certainly France today, find they can disregard that no longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In strict terms of international reserves we are far wealthier than Great Britain.  Great Britain has an international net liability of something like three to four thousand million pounds.  We have a net external creditor position.  We have about £280 million or £290 million official external reserves.  That is augmented by a considerable amount of privately-held reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, moving <Col N="886" /> on these high planes of technical discussion, would relate these figures to the international trade which has already been mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Our official external reserves, officially held by the Central Bank, the Government Departments or the commercial banks, would cover our external trading position for about nine months, which is not bad.  I agree with the Deputy that we cannot let them be eroded and the prospect of a balance of payments deficit of £50 million to £60 million this year is something which would certainly cause concern. It would be wrong to think we have not very considerable reserves to be able to stand up to balance of payments deficits providing they are not going to keep on occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fortunate this debate has taken place to extract these words of wisdom from the Minister.  He is now beginning to relate reality to reality.  The Minister mentions £260 million external reserves under pressure of an annual balance of payments deficit of £50 million or £60 million. It would only too rapidly erode if the idea spread about that such deficits might recur.  What was a relatively controllable stream becomes a raging torrent once the currency speculators smell the air.  Do not forget the Republic of France and the gold reserves in the vaults of the Bank of France which looked utterly invulnerable and how in six short weeks half of the total disappeared across their borders.  The present President is now having to control although he said he never would do so.  Nobody can transfer funds out of France without specific Government permission for the simple reason that their unfavourable balance of payments suddenly became the subject of a gigantic international raid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position that we are carrying an unfavourable balance of payments at the present time which the Minister thinks it is proper to describe as possibly amounting to £50 million or £60 million.  That is the first time that figure has been mentioned in this House.  It is the first time that the figure of £60 million has been mentioned as a remote possibility.  I do not think it <Col N="887" /> is a probability but it brings the figure of £50 million into the range of realistic possibility as the balance of payments deficit of this country.  It is useful that that figure should be widely known as a measure of the gravity of the situation in which we now stand.  I am trying to get the House to turn its mind to this: that no device designed to increase the resources of international currency will operate to restore the free passage of trade between nations so long as the spectre of inflation continues to stalk the world.  Until stability of money is restored you can create all the resources that you please, you can mine as much gold as has been mined since the dawn of time but the moment inflation rears its ugly head in any community those resources will pour out in a deluge and as the flood out gathers force it will suck more and more with it until ultimately it leaves the cupboard bare.  Every nation in the world is the same as a joint stock bank. If a bank has liabilities for deposits of £10 million and a rumour goes around a city like Dublin that they have not got the money, within one hour the depositors will start to form a queue. A decision must be taken forthwith, promptly and without delay, to put a notice in the window of the bank: &ldquo;We owe £10 million and we have £11 million. We are providing camp chairs and hot coffee for the queue.&rdquo;  Currency must be delivered to the bank in excess of the total claims on it.  After two hours of that, the queue will melt away. But let the bank put a notice or declaration in the window: &ldquo;We owe £10 million and we have £9,999,999 to pay it &rdquo;, and the queue will extend to Drumcondra.  It will take the Army to control it.  The moment the word goes out that a country's external reserves are being placed in jeopardy by a current deficit in its balance of payments, not only will the deficit in the balance of payments erode those reserves but the currency speculators will proceed to finish the job.  Our great danger is that some such raid should be staged against us.  We have reciprocal arrangements with the Bank of England and they are possibly our greatest insurance against such a raid.</P>
    <P>It would be a great catastrophe for <Col N="888" /> this country if we were to experience such a crisis.  There is no means of protecting ourselves against such a possibility except by restoring stability to our own currency and there is no means of doing that other than by putting an end to inflation in this country; there is no other means of doing that but by making up our minds to spend less than we earn and that applies not only to the individual, to the TD, to the Minister but to the Government itself.</P>
    <P>Unless and until everyone in this House comes to realise and understand that, we are all participating in a course of conduct which few people understand; a course of conduct calculated not only to bring economic ruin on this country but very easily to create a situation in which our national independence would become impossible. That danger is clearly on the horizon at the present time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned today during Question Time that one could legitimately say that almost everything in this country now belongs to foreign interests.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce took great exception to that generalisation and it is a generalisation.  We have drawn in considerable quantities of foreign capital in recent years and dazzled by that successful induction of foreign capital, we have turned our backs on the true state of our balance of trade and on our balance of payments. We have been living on borrowed money oblivious of the fact that borrowed money constitutes an annual charge upon our balance of payments for the interest that those who lent that money intended to draw on it.  This also leaves a potential threat to our entire balance of payments position if those who hold assets in Ireland while resident abroad, proceed to liquidate those assets and to draw out while the going is good.  There is no remedy for that situation except the realisation by our people and, indeed, by the people of the United States and Great Britain that you cannot perennially continue to stay independent and, at the same time, spend more than you earn.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is something which fascinates and amuses me. It is when I hear the Fourth Estate deriding Dáil Éireann for its failure to <Col N="889" /> attend and listen attentively to the deliberations of the legislature on matters of fundamental importance. They just do not know what it is about.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance to every country, including ours, to restore stability to our respective countries. Having travelled as far along the road as we have travelled, it is vital to face the fact that it will not be easy to achieve that end but the interesting thing is that unless we achieve that end here and elsewhere, all the devices envisaged by this agreement will avail nothing; if we achieve it, then all these devices become relatively irrelevant. Dáil Éireann ought to get the full grasp of this fact.  This agreement to which we are subscribing is done in the hope that the other countries will subscribe in sufficient numbers to make effective all that the agreement desires.  This agreement is to give us a breathing space to restore confidence in the stability of currency so that the world as a whole will not go on facing a universal unfavourable balance of payments. However, that is not possible unless we are all to live in pampootees and skins.  Our objective as civilised and sophisticated human creatures who can send men round the moon; who can blow the whole world up with one bomb is simply to restore the belief that when a pound note says it is exchangeable for a pound, it will be exchangeable for a pound which will buy all the things it could buy 12 months ago, ten years ago or that it will buy ten years hence.  Unless and until that day is reached we will never achieve the position that the country with a vast advantageous and favourable balance of payments will be prepared to lend that out to the other countries that need it so that in their time they may acquire a favourable balance of payments which they themselves will lend out to lubricate development of trade elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Remember that unless we reach that point again and quickly, the greatest human tragedy the world has seen since the dawn of time will be enacted under our eye because in so far as we have failed to attain that end the poor will grow poorer and the rich will grow richer until eventually there will be <Col N="890" /> immense civil conflict in the world by those who have nothing to lose but their rags and those who are scrambling to preserve for themselves their illgotten money bags.  Those are the issues which are at stake in the world and those are the problems which we as an independent nation are participating in.  It is vital that we by way of example if not by way of pounds, shillings and pence, maintain stability in our currency as an example to the world of what other nations must do if the horrors I have attempted to outline are to be averted.</P>
    <P>It troubles me that, in introducing a Bill of this kind, (1) the Minister simply brushes all these considerations under the carpet: he does not think it suitable to bother Dáil Éireann, never mind the Fourth Estate people and (2) he thinks it right to make a silly political interjection that our external reserves were never higher than they now are.  But, above all, I think it would be truly tragic that a Bill of this character should pass through Dáil Éireann without the opportunity being taken by the Members of this House to say to our people, for our own sake, even if the rest of the world wants to stumble into the catastrophe that inflation ultimately leads to, for the dignity and the safety of our own people, for the purpose of preserving the freedom that we bought so hard, for the purpose of ensuring that, in every succeeding generation, the flag of this country will be seen to fly in freedom and not for the purpose of getting rich but for the purpose of staying free, that we must restore stability to our currency.  The alternative is the breaking-down of law and the destruction of free institutions in our own country and in the world. Ultimately, the consequence will be a great conflict involving the countless multitudes who are not prepared to go on growing poor while the minority, by monetary manipulation, grow fat.  I think it is the duty of an Irish Minister for Finance to make those aspects of our situation known to our people.  They may not be politically popular but they are nonetheless true. If a man accepts responsibility as Minister for Finance, it appears to <Col N="891" /> me that he has an obligation to discharge the unpopular as well as the popular obligations of his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that, after the long negotiations in relation to international finance, this is a somewhat disappointing measure because we in this country are not responsible for it but must fall into line with any international financial suggestions that may be made as a result of these gatherings that have taken place.  As an ordinary onlooker and not being an expert in finance, I agree with Deputy Dillon that inflation is the major cause of all the trouble.  Inflation, however, has been taking place among the stronger powers and all other countries&mdash;particularly smaller countries such as ours&mdash;immediately feel the impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a member of the Council of Europe up to a couple of years ago, international monetary finance was a very live issue, as it probably still is: I am not in a position to judge that, as I am not there now.  However, it was decided by most of the speakers from the various member countries that some form of international currency was desirable to replace the existing currencies such as sterling, the dollar and hard currency.  The proof of that is self-evident in the fact that the United Kingdom, in a balance of payments difficulty and very short of reserves, are hardly able to maintain themselves as a major financial power at the head of sterling and the repercussions on us are continuous.  As the Minister for Finance well knows and as everybody here knows, we suffered on two or three occasions as a result of repressive measures on the part of the British Government in an effort to contain their expenditure and to keep their obligations to sterling in order.  The United States of America, the dollar currency of which is prominent in the world, faces exactly the same difficulty. France is one of the countries economically sound, having enormous reserves, having practically everything they want without importing.  It is a self-sufficient country for practically everything and was entirely so when she had her colonies.  To a large extent, France still has a very favourable position.  Yet <Col N="892" /> even France finds itself in difficulties. The impact reverberates on all the other countries.  This poses the question, is this international agreement in relation to finance only a palliative? It is an attempt to get all the countries concerned to create a financial situation whereby they can help the various countries when they get into difficulties. But, incidentally, while they are helping countries, that may find themselves in difficulties, the small countries are very often in difficulties through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>The only reason I stand up now to speak is that I feel the only solution to the financial instability in the world today is an international world currency. That is more important today than it was, perhaps, 10 or 15 years ago because it is necessary for the great powers of the developed countries, apart from keeping their own house in order, to have a sufficient reserve so that they may contribute to the development of the underdeveloped countries.  I should like the Minister to tell us if, in these discussions that took place at world conferences&mdash;I think he attended several of them, one being in Rio de Janeiro&mdash;the question of a world currency was discussed, whether there was any sort of general agreement for it and, if there was, if he thinks there are likely to be wider agreements that would go far beyond the legislation he is bringing before the House this evening which, I feel, is just a question of staving off the difficulties of these different currencies and enabling us to carry on as before but which will not give world stability in finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received this piece of legislation. Perhaps I should begin by dealing with the point made by Deputy Tully when he spoke about the acceptability abroad of Irish currency.  There are only two currencies in the world which are universally accepted as a means of settling international payments&mdash;sterling and the dollar.  A number of other currencies could fulfil this role, particularly the German Mark, of being an international reserve currency, being a currency used by other countries for <Col N="893" /> settling their debts.  A great number of these countries, however, carefully avoid taking on the obligation of a reserve currency because, once you do that, you take on a very onerous task.</P>
      <P>It would be totally unsuitable and inappropriate for us with our economic base, and in our general standing in the international monetary field, to attempt to make Irish currency a medium of international exchange.  I do not think that is what Deputy Tully had in mind but it is just as well that I should clear up that point first of all. Deputy Tully is concerned with a much more mechanical matter and that is that when one goes abroad there is difficulty in having Irish currency accepted.  I do not think Deputy Tully need worry about that because there are very few currencies which have any sort of universal acceptability. It is a matter of convenience and if an English shopkeeper is not prepared to accept Irish currency because he has to go to the trouble of taking it to his bank rather than being able to use it in his day-to-day transactions, then that is very largely his business. Our £ is just as good as his £ and there is absolutely no monetary reason why he should not accept it.  It is simply a matter of convenience for the individual trader or person asked to accept our currency or our coinage. Deputy Dillon availed of the discussion on this measure to deal with the very broad issue of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with that.  I do not deny that internationally there is a very great problem of inflation but even if there were no such problem this measure would still be helpful, and perhaps even necessary, because it is true that the volume of world trade is growing, the actual amount of goods passing from country to country in the form of world trade is physically increasing, whereas the amount of money available to finance that physical volume of trade is not increasing and perhaps, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, it is declining. Therefore, it makes good sense to try to increase the medium of exchange <Col N="894" /> available to the different countries to help them finance the increasing volume of world trade.  In any event, whether there was a problem of worldwide inflation or not, this creation of special drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund would be helpful and would be beneficial.  I just want to make that point, that the situation is such that with the amount of gold not being increased, with the amount of the reserve currencies not being increased, some other method must be found of financing world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is gold not being hoarded because of threatening inflation? If the gold came out from under the beds and from the Swiss banks and circulated freely then the problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem would be less but it would still be with us. In any event, even if we had all the gold in the world, gold is perhaps not a perfect instrument for settling international debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a costly mechanism and even if we were not faced internationally with the problem of a decreasing supply of world gold it would still be desirable to create a new type of monetary mechanism which would be flexible and available to the different countries in the world to iron out the inevitable snags that arise in international finance.  I agree that a fundamental, deep-seated disequilibrium in a country's balance of payments must be put right at the source. I also think a great deal of trouble and hardship can arise which could be avoided if there were a perfect ideal mechanism of international finance because then countries which got into temporary balance of payments difficulties would not have to go to any particularly difficult lengths to solve them, they would have available to them through some international institution or organisation a perfectly appropriate method of getting over temporary difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what this piece of legislation is all about.  It is an attempt, mark you it is not a very great attempt and I <Col N="895" /> think it is a minimal attempt, to try to improve the international mechanism for settling world payments between nations, that is available to us.  It has been a long and arduous process to get even this far and I am afraid we are not very far along the road as we stand today.  This is not terribly important from our point of view; these new drawing rights as far as we are concerned will be an addition to our external reserves all right but not a significant addition.  In bringing this piece of legislation in and subscribing to this new mechanism we are really trying to help the international situation more than we are trying to help ourselves.  We just want to add our voice to those voices of reason and commonsense raised in favour of improving the international monetary liquidity situation.</P>
    <P>This is more a contribution by us to the solution of international problems, rather than any particular benefit to ourselves, because the amount, as we see it at the moment, which we would be able to add to our reserves by means of the special drawing rights will not be all that significant in our circumstances. That is not to denigrate the sum involved but just to put it in perspective.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Dillon thought that I was being political when I mentioned that our official external reserves are at the highest level ever.  I did not mean to be.  It is important that we should point out to the public exactly what is at stake at present, that we should underline the realities of the situation as clearly as possible and that, on the other hand, we should not exaggerate. I am happy that our external reserves are at a satisfactory level.  It just so happens that in monetary terms they are at the highest level ever.  At the present time they are at a satisfactory level.  I certainly would not think that it should be an aim of our economic policy to build them up to a higher level.  The level they are at enables us in our economic planning to go ahead from year to year prepared to contemplate reasonably modest balance of payments deficits.  I think that is necessary in our situation where we are endeavouring to build up and <Col N="896" /> expand our economy.  We can only do that by importing the raw materials and the capital goods we need.  If we want to develop and expand we have got to contemplate a tolerable balance of payments deficit year by year.  Perhaps there will be an argument as to what is a tolerable balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, at present our official thinking is that a balance of payments deficit of £20 million to £25 million need not be a cause of alarm on our part.  Provided everything else is going well we can tolerate a balance of payments deficit of that order, perhaps a good deal less in some years, perhaps slightly more in other years.  But we cannot, I think, and could not possibly contemplate balance of payments deficits of the order of £40 million, £50 million or £60 million, recurring.  In an exceptional year&mdash;a year of abnormal international difficulties, a year where special factors obtain in our main markets&mdash;we should not perhaps be unduly alarmed if we did have a balance of payments deficit of £40 million or £50 million, but not, as I have already said, recurring.  Fortunately, we are in a strong creditor position and we have the reserves which would enable us to stand up to such an exceptional deficit.  I, and I think everybody, would certainly become alarmed if we found the situation developing where there was a prospect of continually increasing deficits in our balance of payments.  That really was the reason why I interjected in the middle of Deputy Dillon's speech in the way I did.  I want to put this matter of a balance of payments deficit in proper perspective.  I hope I have done so.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Dillon about the dangers of inflation and the appalling dangers of uncontrolled inflation. I hope that we are not in such a situation at the moment.  There is a danger that we could be and will be unless we take corrective action.  There are all sorts of corrective actions available to us.  The best possible way of putting the situation right is self-discipline. I do not want anybody to think that by that I mean lecturing workers not to seek more pay; I think we have all become too sophisticated for that <Col N="897" /> approach.  What I mean by self-discipline is self-discipline by the whole community in regard to the whole conduct of our economic affairs.  That includes a great deal other than pay, salaries and wages.  If self-discipline does not work the situation will right itself in a way which will be particularly painful and which will involve the sacrificing of an enormous amount that we have been able to achieve so far.</P>
    <P>An inflationary situation can be corrected in a number of different ways. Deputy Dillon spoke about South America.  When I was in South America and looked around the countries there I thought that uncontrolled inflation was the greatest evil that could befall any country and I said so when I came back.  The extent of the inflation we are undergoing at present is a matter for debate, a matter about which contrary opinions can be held. There is no doubt that the way in which we are going could be very serious for us unless we take a very severe look at ourselves and what we are doing and correct the situation in time by means of moderation, restraint and discipline on the part of all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now, of course, passing this Bill.  We have heard the Minister replying to the Second Stage and he has rightly said, quite apart from the broad issues which I raised in the context of our Second Stage discussion, that in the present state of the world and the expanding physical volume of international trade it is a good thing to add to international reserves in order to finance expanding international trade which is to the advantage of everybody.  But I think, in saying that, the Minister unintentionally created an illusory sense of reassurance, where I think he overlooks the inescapable character of Gresham's Law.  It does not matter what quantity of reserves of gold or any other reserve <Col N="899" /> of undoubted, unquestioned value you create, without confidence the bad money will drive out the good; the good money will go under the bed and the bad money will proceed to circulate.</P>
      <P>Then comes into operation&mdash;I am not trying to be technical merely to sound technical&mdash;an equally inescapable economic law expressed by Fisher's equation.  It is one which too many people forget, that on the lefthand side of Fisher's equation stand the symbols M and V, the quantity of money and the velocity of its circulation. If confidence declines, not only does the value of money deteriorate and the quantity grow but the velocity of its circulation rises which exacerbates the rise in prices which expedites the process of inflation.  The point I am trying to make is this: There is no increase in the basis of international currency which will adequately and effectively finance the growing volume of international trade except the restoration of confidence.  There is no means of restoring confidence so long as inflation is allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>We all know in our daily lives that once the public get it into their heads that the value of money this day 12 months is going to be less than it is today the velocity of the circulation of that money will begin to rise.  That is what is happening.  The way it is expressed in an ordinary person's life is the cost of living is going up and if you want a washing machine you buy it now.  It will cost £60 today but will cost £70 this day twelve months. Everybody goes out and buys a washing machine they cannot afford.  They tie around their neck that lodestone of debt until ultimately the weekly wage will not meet the weekly payments that require to be made.  They apply for higher wages not to grow richer but to maintain the standard of living they enjoyed 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is that increase in the demand of the stockbroker for increased dividends, the demand of the worker for increased pay, the demand of the professional man for increased fees that creates the increase in the cost of living, that creates instability, that <Col N="900" /> creates an increase in the velocity of the circulation of currency which completes the vicious circle which in the last analysis ceases to be an economic question; it becomes a vital and diabolical political question.</P>
    <P>I referred here to Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde speaking about two inflations.  I am thinking of the involuntary inflation, the end product of which was not an economic event, it was a political event because it was discovered that no democratic Government could control the monster they had suffered to grow and so was called into existence in the country of Goethe, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert and all the arts, a monster called Schickelgruber. That is what people closed their eyes to.  I do not give two damns what happens to the bankers, the land speculators or the bucks building office blocks or flats.  I do not give a damn if in the morning their flats and their office buildings fell down and they lost their money.  They have plenty more where that came from and they put their money into them for no other purpose but to make money for themselves. What I am concerned with is that my son will live in freedom and there will be no Schickelgruber here.</P>
    <P>I hate the Fianna Fáil Government for their economic inequities in the last ten years they have been in office but it is a free Government, freely chosen by our people and it is a Government under which any free man can live in dignity and peace.  I do not want to see it replaced by a Schickelgruber but as sure as we are in this room the creation of additional monetary reserves is utterly irrelevant to the real danger unless confidence is restored.  I cannot dissent from what the Minister for Finance says with regard to the contribution this small country can make in the restoration of confidence in the great and influential countries of the world being economically speaking miniscule.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget Switzerland is a very small country.  When I was young people spoke of something being as sound as the Bank of England but nobody speaks of that now.  There is no more unstable organisation in the world than the Bank of England.  It is <Col N="901" /> in a perpetual state of wild and frantic oscillation of every tempest that blows on the international money market. But standing in the middle of Europe is a tiny country with no natural resources but everybody thinks of it as being the epitome of security for your savings and that is Switzerland.  Why? It is because the stability of the currency of Switzerland is beyond doubt. Why is it that the Germany of today is one of the, if not the only European country with a massive trade and payment surplus?  Because, as we all know, written on the hearts of the German people is: &ldquo;We will never have a Schickelgruber again.&rdquo;  The end product of inflation is Schickelgruber. That is the point.  I think the Minister for Finance of any Irish Government has a duty to his people to make it clear that there is no substitute for the correction of the political menace of inflation except the restoration of confidence in the currency.  Only too many people completely fail to understand that.</P>
    <P>I will not be talking much more in this House but if I could carry even a glimmer of understanding to the bulk of my colleagues in this House of the political significance of inflation then my time here would not have been spent in vain.  I am trying to make our people awake to the fact that this is not a question of money, this is not a question of being rich or poor or any matter of that kind.  This is a question of being free.  I believe the only force that could destroy freedom in this country is inflation.</P>
    <P>I want to state that I was not making a political crack when I spoke of Cork and Kildare.  I know what happened in Cork and Kildare.  Whatever discussions took place, an atmosphere was created overnight for the purpose of winning those two by-elections&mdash; after the Fianna Fáil reverse, consequent on the purchase tax, in North East Dublin&mdash;that there was plenty for everybody and that the sky was the limit.  That was a political decision.  That is six years ago.  There is no use crying about it now.  We had a general election since.  I know the difficulty and the feeling of futility one experiences <Col N="902" /> when one tries to go out to the country and speak of inflation because to try to explain to any gathering of reasonable citizens all that means is a virtually impossible task, as the Minister for Finance well knows.  Therefore, I want to impress again and again on the Minister and on this House that when we are talking of Bretton Woods, when we are talking of inflation, when we are talking of international currency, when we are talking of monetary reserves, we are not talking about getting rich or poor, we are talking about being free or slaves.  I want no Schickelgruber in this country. Schickelgruber was the child of inflation. Nothing could have set the ovens burning in the land of Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven and Mozart except inflation. Inflation did, and left that great nation that stood in the forefront of human culture split and divided today, half of it a communist desert, inhabited by permanent convicts and the other half forever suspect by mankind.  People who are capable of suffering those things to happen in their midst can they ever be trusted again?</P>
    <P>Do not let that happen in Ireland.  It is perfectly true that despite our best endeavour if the world goes down we must go down with it, but if we must let us go down with our flag flying and clean.  Let us not be a miserable limpet at the bottom of the rotting hulk of a failed civilisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1963, and sundry other Statutes; Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors; Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries; etc.</P>
      <P>This is a token estimate for £10 and it is to enable us to bring into operation the new scheme for widows and orphans of civil servants.  The House is fully familiar with this new scheme.  It came into operation on 23rd July last. I shall have to come to the House with legislation in due course but in the meantime there are some payments which require to be made under the scheme.  The purpose of this token Estimate is to enable me to make these payments pending the introduction of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Supplementary Estimate is in respect of Miscellaneous Expenses. This Estimate is for a total of £70,000. £1,000 of this arises out of the commemoration of the First Dáil.  About half of that arises out of the distribution to the schools of a special edition of <i>The Young Citizen</i> by the Institute <Col N="904" /> of Public Administration.  The other half of it roughly is incidental expenses arising out of the commemoration.</P>
    <P>The main part of the Supplementary Estimate is £69,000 which is required to pay the bills arising out of the measures we took to offset the British special import deposit scheme.  The cost, up to the end of February, is about £69,000.  Deputies will recall that when the British introduced this special import deposit scheme we took action to ensure that our exporters would not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in relation to the token Estimate which applies to pensions for widows and children of certain civil servants that we recognise very fully the need for this adjustment in the scheme announced last summer.  Of course legislation has to be introduced but the position of pensioners has been growing considerably more difficult.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister to deal more generously with the pensioners as a category who have been going through a very difficult time.  I know that what is proposed here applies only to a limited number and I suppose it would be broadening the debate outside the Rules of Order if I mentioned anything more general.  I merely want to indicate that there would be considerable sympathy from these benches for whatever the Minister may be able to do in the near future in a more extensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the scheme to deal with the export problems that arose from the British Government's action recently.  I suppose the Minister cannot give an answer now but we still have the decision to make as to whether, in respect of what I regard as having been a clear breach of the Free Trade Area Agreement between this country and Britain, we are going to apply the one sanction we can, that is, not to enforce the reduction in tariffs due for next July.  It seems to be the one step open to us.  I have no doubt that the possibility <Col N="905" /> may have been mentioned in recent meetings between Ministers of the two Governments, but I hope that will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Many people feel that if we are to operate consistently and honourably the terms of an Agreement which has been repudiated openly by the British in recent times&mdash;and certainly this was not their first breach of an arrangement made with us&mdash;it should clearly be understood that there is a limit to our patience and that we reserve the right to take appropriate action next July in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Estimate for Superannuation and Retired Allowances, it seems to be going home to workers who are employed by the State &mdash; and I hope it goes home to those in outside employment &mdash; that the worker of today is the pensioner of tomorrow, and that it is a good idea that widows and other pensioners should be looked after by those who are in a position to put on the necessary pressure.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Tom O'Higgins said, those who are on pension now and who could have taken some action many years ago did not do it for one reason or another. However, the Minister should redeem the promise of one of his predecessors, the then Minister for Finance, now Senator Ryan, that the pensions of those who retired some years ago would be brought into parity.  If the Minister looks at the matter he will agree there is a great deal in the claim for parity.  I do not wish to transgress the rules of order, but I would ask the Minister to take some steps to relieve the situation of those people who are being treated shamefully, particularly those who retired a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Miscellaneous Expenses Estimate the British Special Import Deposit Scheme at £69,000 makes me wonder, and it did at the time, if Britain wanted to prevent imports into their country from outside, why they should say: &ldquo;We are putting on this levy to prevent imports, but if you can pay the levy that is all right.&rdquo; It did look, big as they are, as if the British Government were looking for interest-free money from this country. It may not be an enormous amount <Col N="906" /> but, at the same time, we are giving it to them for nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know that from these Benches we have been all the time objecting to the terms of agreements with Britain and particularly this one.  No matter what the British do we continue to carry out the terms of our agreement.  It may be the gentlemanly thing to do, but I do not think it is good business, and we have very definitely reached the stage where the Minister and the Government would be very well advised to consider strongly not alone a refusal to reduce tariffs by ten per cent in July but to review the situation with regard to previous reductions.  Going through shops in this city and in small towns and villages throughout the country, one finds it almost impossible to buy articles which are not made in Britain. This is exactly what we warned this House would happen under this Free Trade Area Agreement.  These goods are pouring in through the supermarkets and from the supermarkets into the small shops.  Household goods are being poured in, and apparently the British chain stores are insisting on British goods being sent in here. If one goes into a shop to buy shoes or clothes I will guarantee that if there is no special request for Irish goods, four articles of British manufacture will be offered before the Irish article is put up.  This is killing Irish industry and the Minister would be well advised to prevent any further reductions in tariffs at least until the British are prepared to meet their part of the bargain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate for Superannuation and Retired Allowances is a very precious one to me.  It refers to widows and orphans.  I have told the story in this House of a colleague of mine who, when he came in here as a very young man, was met by the late Deputy Alfie Byrne who gave him certain hints on how any TD should act, and concluded the advice by saying: &ldquo;Remember, you will be approached from time to time by widows and you will be asked to do unreasonable things.  Never give them a short answer. Never refuse to listen to their stories. They suffered enough the day they lost their breadwinner to justify them in <Col N="907" /> expecting a patient hearing from anyone whom they ask to share their burden.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I approve entirely of the scheme envisaged in respect of pensions for widows and children, but there is an anomaly.  This scheme operates <i>ex post facto</i> from the time this Estimate is adopted by the House and the legislation which the Minister may hereafter bring in.  However, we are leaving out of consideration a very moderate number of civil servants' widows who were bereaved before this scheme was thought up.  I know that the deceased husbands of these ladies could have, under existing arrangements, compounded a part of their own pensions and converted their pensions into a pension extending to the life of themselves and their widows, but certain of them did not do it.  We may deplore the improvidence of their decision, but in that we might not be altogether well advised.</P>
      <P>Surely it would not tax the resources of the State to say to whatever surviving widows there are for whom no provision is made: &ldquo;If you are prepared to pay into the fund a sum equivalent to what your husbands would have paid had they been subscribers to such a fund from the time they entered the Civil Service we will see that you get the same pension as the widows of men with equal periods of service will get under the new pensions scheme&rdquo;? Mark you, when this matter was first brought to my attention, I said: &ldquo;I do not believe we will need to bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance the fact that there is a relatively small number of women whose husbands died.  The Minister will make no difficulty about asking the House for a Supplementary Estimate to cover these few cases.&rdquo;  This will be a nonrecurring charge.  It can be written off over the years because widows, in the ordinary course of time, will themselves tend to die off, contrary to what Deputy Andrews thinks; he said here during the Health Estimate that he was greatly shocked by the rising death rate amongst our aged citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not entirely odd that our aged citizens should show a higher death <Col N="908" /> rate than the juveniles amongst us, but that, apparently, had not occurred to Deputy Andrews' mind.  The number of widows will diminish over the years. Hereafter, every civil servant will have this scheme available to him.  If the widows are prepared to pay the subscriptions which would have been collected from their husbands, will the Minister consider accepting them?  I think he would be justified in accepting them for smaller sums than the total required because circumstances might not permit them to pay the full sum.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to bringing the widows of civil servants who died, prior to the emergence of this scheme, within the ambit of the new plan. Every Deputy would be much happier if he could feel that all widows of public servants were covered and that we were not leaving out of consideration a microscopic and diminishing number of widows, already in great difficulties, who could be made very modestly comfortable for the remainder of their days by a very slight effort on our part.</P>
    <P>I heard with interest and sympathy what Deputy O'Higgins had to say about invoking sanctions against Britain for her failure to carry out here undertakings under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  First, it never was a free trade agreement and that was made perfectly clear from this side of the House at the time it was implemented. It was a trade agreement and, so far as I was concerned, I was in favour of it because it protected agricultural exports, exports without which we could not survive.  Thanks be to God, as a result of the principle established in the 1948 Trade Agreement, and carried over into this trade agreement, the good old bullock will pull us out of a great deal of trouble. Bullocks will be worth £12 a cwt. before the end of April, the highest price ever recorded in this country, and that entirely because he has linked them to the price paid for fat cattle in Britain.  Thanks be to God.</P>
    <P>We may see some of St. Michael's products floating about but, thanks be to God, we see Kerrygold butter appearing in the shops in London, <Col N="909" /> Yorkshire and elsewhere.  We hope to sell our cheese in Britain.</P>

      <P>Much as I revere the reverend Général, I think we are just as well out of it at the present time as in.  I would be all for the Atlantic partnership envisaged by President Kennedy outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia the year before he was murdered, but I am now talking about the special import scheme.  I am happy to think that our agricultural products are safe under the Agreement to which I referred.  That was why I voted for it.  It was an important thing.  Let us bear in mind the fact that a trade agreement is not an dictat.  A trade agreement is something in which you give something to get something.  We have to give something in order to get something.  I never over-estimated what we got, but we got things for which the groundwork was laid in 1948 and I was despertately afraid we night lose some of that ground.  It made possible the employment of countless thousands of our people and paid for raw materials.  It made possible the achievement of many things which could never have been achieved if that market were not there constantly available and secure.  In 1948 we wanted certain quantities of coal and they said they had not got any coal.  We could have got tough and rough.  We could have jumped on their faces and kicked them in the stomach, but I <Col N="910" /> think we were wise in saying: &ldquo;They are in difficulties and what we lose on the swings we may get back on the roundabouts.&rdquo;  I do not know how far the Minister will claim to have recovered something on the roundabouts for the £69,000 that he did pay but I imagine, if one puts one against the other, the net loss by Ireland would be difficult to discern.</P>

      <P>I am not attempting to give the figure of £1 million as a firm estimate.  It is tentative, on the basis that this would have to be done for the whole public service.  Whether it is £1 million, £2 million, or £½ million, it is a sum of money and here is the question I must ask myself, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Tully and others: there are many widows in our community; this is only one section of them; there are other widows who are, I am certain, worse off than this section and, if I have any sum of money, £½ million, £1 million, or £2 million, would I be justified in selecting this one group of widows and giving it to them without reference to other widows, some probably a great deal worse off?  To some extent, that is my mind on the matter apart from the fact that it has budgetary implications which make it difficult in any event.  I do not wish to say any more about that at the moment except that it is a problem of which I am fully apprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Free Trade Area Agreement, I fully agree with Deputy Dillon that in any agreement there <Col N="912" /> must be give and take.  It is no good our looking myopically, if there is such a word, at the British special deposit scheme under the terms of the Agreement without looking at the Agreement as a whole.  Since the Agreement came into operation our exports of agricultural produce to the UK have gone up by £37½ million.  Our exports of industrial products have increased very considerably but I am sorry I have not got the exact figure.  As our tariff barriers come down, it is only natural, it is only to be expected, that the exports of British industrial products to this country will increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a sudden increase in recent months but I could not give in clear terms the exact picture.  It is too soon to try to learn what exactly this current trend will level off at.  I wish to assure the House that my colleagues and I have been in the closest touch with British Ministers about the working of the Agreement.  We have impressed on them, and they accept it, that there must be a balance preserved&mdash;that the Agreement cannot be let to run wild in either direction.  If either side has a valid complaint, we will consult about it and see what we can do.  My colleague, Deputy Colley, will confirm that where he has had difficulties in specific cases he has been met very fairly by British Ministers in regard to those cases.</P>
      <P>We have had a very comprehensive review of the entire Agreement in recent months and we intend to keep up these discussions.  We intend to keep every aspect of the Agreement under review and we will see as best we can that the Agreement fulfils the intention we all had when it was signed&mdash;to make a substantial contribution to the expansion of trade between both countries to both our advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have got very irate with the British Government about the special deposit scheme but the British Government, with a certain degree of justification, replied to us in this way: &ldquo;Every international trade agreement <Col N="913" /> in the world makes an exception for balance of payments difficulties and, no matter what any international agreement says, the provisions of the agreement can always be overridden in the interests of a balance of payments crisis.&rdquo;  The British took this action of the special import deposits for balance of payments reasons and, strictly speaking on the legality of the system, it is entirely within the terms of the Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not talk too much about that.  The British Government can say to us, with a considerable amount of wisdom: &ldquo;You have perhaps just as big an interest in sterling as we have.  We are doing a great deal to try to preserve sterling, to try to make it strong and stable again, and you have a similar interest. As long as we have to take measures to protect and build up sterling you have a very real interest in seeing that those measures are successful.&rdquo;  There is validity and truth in that.  We must say to the British Government: &ldquo;We agree we are interested in your efforts to make sterling strong and stable again as a currency but we want you to do that without injuring our vital interests.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have an understanding that in so far as measures have to be taken by the British Government from time to time in the vital interest of protecting their currency, the British are never unmindful of our interests when taking these measures.  I have to say that about them in all fairness: they are never unmindful of our position and our special trading relationship. They do not like taking these tough <Col N="914" /> balance of payments measures any more than we like them to take them. They are pursuing a consistent policy of endeavouring to put their balance of payments right, and we hope they will succeed.  We hope that when they have to take measures of this sort they will see what they can do to ensure that our interests are not adversely affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a statutory basis for the scheme of investment grants for ships which was announced some time ago.  The Bill will enable grants to be paid to Irish shipowners in respect of approved capital expenditure incurred on either the provision of new ships or the conversion of existing ships.  The level of grant will be up to 25 per cent of the expenditure eligible for grant purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> The Bill is designed to help Irish shipowners in the present highly-competitive conditions in the shipping industry. Their main foreign competitors enjoy State aid either by way of outright grants or favourable financing terms for capital investment.  For example, Irish shipowners are in direct competition with British shipowners, both on the cross-Channel and deep sea trades and here the lack of State assistance for Irish shipowners assumed more immediate importance with the operation from January, 1966, of a British scheme of investment grants which provides grants for new ships or the conversion of existing ships. Accordingly Irish shipowners sought the introduction of a corresponding scheme of State assistance.  The present measure provides for assistance to Irish shipowners on a similar scale to that available to British shipowners.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers Irish-owned ships above a certain size operating in the coastal, cross-Channel and foreign trades in competition with foreign ships and engaged on normal shipping operations.  Fishing vessels, for which special grants and other financing facilities are available through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and tugs, dredgers and other vessels not employed in normal shipping operations, are excluded from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we are almost totally dependent on sea transport both for imports and exports and the importance to the general economy of an up-to-date and expanding Irish-owned merchant fleet is obvious.  Our economic well-being depends in large measure on the shipping facilities available to us and the national interest demands that as much as possible of the trade to and from this country should be carried in Irish-owned vessels.  If some action were not taken now to put Irish shipowners in a comparable position as regards State aid to that of their main competitors, the inevitable result would be that the Irish fleet would contract.</P>
    <P>At the very time when tremendous technological advances in the design and construction of vessels are taking place there would be no encouragement to Irish shipowners to take advantage <Col N="916" /> of these various developments which are geared to achieve lower operating costs.  The shipping industry also provides an essential service in its own right.  While earning considerable amounts of foreign exchange it preserves within the economy a very large part of our shipping transport costs. Again, a healthy, thriving shipping industry has a high strategic value in the event of an interruption of international shipping in periods of world crisis.</P>
    <P>Sea transport in all its aspects is undergoing a revolution directed at modernising and rationalising the shipping industry and thereby reducing costs.  This whole process of modernisation, aimed as it is at reducing unit costs, will, of course, help our export industries and enhance their competitiveness. Modernisation inevitably demands increased investment in new and more efficient ships and equipment. The low level of profitability experienced by shipping companies here and throughout the world for some years past has reduced the resources available for re-investment.  Because of the absence of adequate profits, replacement of ageing vessels has had to be deferred. Unfortunately, this deferment undermined the competitive position of the companies concerned because the more modern replacement vessels are much more economic in operation.</P>
    <P>The need for modernisation is exemplified by the case of the B and I company which is replacing its uneconomic passenger vessels by new car-ferry vessels and converting its conventional cargo services to unit load operation. The increasing trend towards bulk carriers and container ships in the deepsea trade has obliged Irish Shipping Ltd. to consider the re-organisation of its fleet.  The company is disposing of a number of its older and less economic vessels and they recently brought into service a 34,000-ton deadweight bulk carrier.  In addition, they have on order two 29,000-ton deadweight bulk carriers one of which will be built at Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>The technological and other developments referred to are pressing even more heavily on the resources of the smaller companies.  It is most important that these smaller companies <Col N="917" /> should be in a position to modernise their fleets and compete more effectively in an industry so largely regulated by the economies of scale.  I feel sure that the assistance provided for in this Bill will be particularly advantageous to the smaller Irish shipping companies as a supplement to their investment resources.  Because of their inability to finance new tonnage some Irish owners in recent years have sold ships without buying replacements and have been forced to charter foreign vessels.  The availability of a grant of 25 per cent of the capital cost should be a very real incentive to replace worn-out vessels and to modernise and re-equip existing vessels where this is practicable.</P>
    <P>Depreciation is a heavy item in the operating cost of a vessel and the payment of a grant would reduce the annual depreciation charge by one quarter.  Technological advances in ship construction are such that it is now necessary to provide for the full write-off of the capital cost of a vessel over a much shorter period than heretofore and the relief afforded by a grant should go a long way towards offsetting the shorter economic life of a new vessel.  At present the only concession enjoyed by shipowners which might assist them in financing fleet investment is the shipping investment allowance of 40 per cent of the capital cost of a new ship which is available under the income tax code. This allowance is available for offset against profits and is in addition to the normal wear and tear allowance so that over the full life of a ship allowances of 140 per cent of the ship's cost can be offset against profits.  In practice, however, this concession has been of little practical value to shipowners because the pre-tax profits earned by them have been too low.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the scheme of investment grants for ships it is proposed to discontinue the special shipping investment allowance of 40 per cent in a case where a grant is paid.  This change involves legislative action which will be taken by the Minister for Finance at the next suitable opportunity.  Payment of a grant will provide a direct financial benefit <Col N="918" /> for the shipowner and in planning the purchase of a new vessel or the conversion of an existing one he will be able to take account of the grant and to assess precisely the effect of the grant in reducing the operating costs of the vessel and in improving the return on his own investment.  Up to this Irish shipowners, unlike their counterparts in other sectors of industry, have not had available to them any direct State assistance.  This has been a severe handicap in such a capital-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that grants will not be payable in respect of the acquisition of second-hand ships.  The object of the scheme is to achieve modernisation of the fleet and this can be done only by the introduction of new ships incorporating the latest methods and equipment.  The whole object would be defeated by the purchase of second-hand out-dated vessels.  I should mention that with the technological developments now taking place in ship construction existing vessels are becoming obsolete more rapidly than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill are largely self-explanatory and call for little comment by way of explanation.  The main provision is that a grant of up to 25 per cent of the capital expenditure involved may, under certain conditions, be paid in respect of the acquisition of a new ship or the conversion of an existing ship.  Conversion might take the form of, for example, adaptation for carrying containers or change-over from dry cargo to tanker.  Significant additions of a capital nature will also be eligible for a grant, for example, replacement of the main propelling machinery or main boilers.  Capital expenditure on containers will also, subject to certain conditions, be eligible for grant payment, provided that the containers are related to the purchase or conversion of a ship in respect of which a grant has been approved.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 5 the scheme will be retrospective to 1st April, 1967.  This retrospection is designed to offset to some degree the disadvantageous position of Irish shipowners <i>vis-á-vis</i> their British competitors who have benefited from a similar scheme since January, 1966. <Col N="919" /> There is also provision for appropriate penalties for offences under the Bill.  These provisions are normal in a Bill of this type.  Section 12 (2) provides for the making of an Order to bring the Bill into operation.  This provision is necessary because some time will be required following the enactment of this Bill to enable arrangements for the administration of the scheme of grants to be settled.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme will depend on the response received from the shipowners. In the current year a sum of £440,000 has been provided in the Vote for my Department but it is expected that expenditure on the scheme in subsequent years will run at a much higher level.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not confine the payment of grant to cases where the vessel is built or the work is done in this country.  Such a restriction would be impracticable because, by reason of the delivery dates required or inability to handle the work, it might not be possible for Irish shipyards to undertake a particular contract.  However, I am most anxious that the scheme should benefit the ship-building industry here and before approval for the payment of a grant for a ship to be built abroad is given I will require to be satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons why the work cannot be done here.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the scheme will result in an increase in the total tonnage on the Irish Register, and will provide a valuable incentive to Irish shipowners to expand and modernise their fleets.  Inquiries made by them of my Department indicate that they are eager to avail of the opportunity which is now being presented to them. The scheme should also result in a more efficient shipping service, with lower unit costs, being available.  This should prove particularly beneficial to our export trade on which our economy so heavily depends.  Another valuable effect of the new scheme is that it should lead to additional work for the Irish shipbuilding industry.  In fact, a car-ferry for the B and I company which will be eligible for a grant is now nearing completion at Verolme <Col N="920" /> Cork Dockyard and work has commenced at that yard on a bulk carrier for Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill appears to be to give to any resident of the State or any body corporate of the State a grant of 25 per cent of the capital cost of a ship with not less than 100 tons gross tonnage. This is given to shipowners who propose to carry on a business.  We have no definition whatsoever of what &ldquo;business&rdquo; means.  It could be that some enterprising person in the city of Dublin might wish to procure a pleasure boat for tours of Dublin Bay and we are going to make him a present of 25 per cent of the capital cost of such a ship.</P>
      <P>I would like to know why the Minister has inserted section 5 into the Bill. He says a grant might be made towards approved capital expenditure incurred on or after the 1st day of April, 1967.  Has the Minister some specific project in mind?  Is there some shipowner who has acquired a ship and who now seeks capital by way of a grant to complete the purchase of it? Why is it retrospective to the 1st April, 1967?  The Minister has not told us the number of companies carrying on business here.  We know there is Irish Shipping, the Limerick Steamship Company and the Wexford Steamship Company.  I do not know of any other companies carrying on business in the State.  There may be others but I do not know of them.  If these companies have been carrying on business here&mdash;and I presume they carried on business for the purpose of making a profit&mdash;they should be able to look after their own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister give us some information or tell us whether new companies are proposed to be set up here for the purpose of carrying on shipping business or trade with either Great Britain or the continent?  We would like to know something about it.  Here we are asked in this Bill merely to approve of a grant of 25 per cent of the capital cost of any ship whose gross tonnage exceeds 100 tons, which <Col N="921" /> ship will be used for a business which is undefined.  We are all aware that many ships owned by Irish Shipping are on charter throughout the world because there is no business for them here.  Many of them are on charter for over two years.  Perhaps we wish to build up&mdash;and we should as a maritime country build up&mdash;our own shipping industry in the State.  We have acquired the B and I.  I take it that the B and I will not qualify for a grant under this particular Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we were only part owners of the B and I. This is, perhaps, the real reason for the Bill.  We are now going to subsidise the B and I to the extent of 25 per cent of the capital of any ship which they wish to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main competitors of the B and I is the British Railways and they get 25 per cent for the car ferry ships.  In order for the B and I to be competitive we have to give a similar grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that the B and I was going to be a profit-making concern and that there would not be the necessity to subsidise it.  That was one of the reasons given why we should purchase this particular shipping company.</P>
      <P>I certainly would like to see more shipping companies in the State.  So far as we are concerned north of the River Boyne and north of Limerick, we have not an Irish ship trading into one of our ports.  If we have charter reversal we have to depend on a Dutch tramp to do it or some other ship which we have to charter from Britain.  It may be for the benefit of ports like Dublin, Limerick and Cork that this Bill is being enacted.  If that is so and if it will improve cross-Channel transport we welcome it, but we hope that other ports throughout the State are not going to suffer and that some provision will be made by these shipping companies to ensure that business is carried on not only in the major southern and eastern ports but at the western and north-western ports as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> Section 6 of the Bill attaches certain conditions to the grants.  It prohibits the charter of a ship in some circumstances.  We all know that Irish Shipping have to charter to make their ships pay.  Is this to prohibit the B and I from chartering their ships also?  It is something that should be looked into.  Is this going to prohibit any shipping companies who may require 25 per cent under this particular Bill from chartering their ships?  While Bord Fáilte do not subsidise ships to the extent of 100 tons gross tonnage they do subsidise them for the carriage of passengers to the extent of 50 per cent.  Many hoteliers throughout the country are now having passenger boats built, admittedly under 100 tons gross tonnage, and acquiring 50 per cent of a free grant for these ships. These boats are competing against privately-owned vessels for which there was no subsidy whatever provided by the State.  That is something we might mention on the Minister's Estimate later on but I do not think it is appropriate to the present Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled about the whole thing.  I do not know near as much about shipping as Deputy P. O'Donnell but, so far as I am aware, most of the Irish vessels appear to be unable to find employment on the Irish coast.  Many of them are chartered abroad and some of them are tramp steamers around the coast of America or even as far away as Australia.  I wonder if this is simply and solely a Bill for the purpose of assisting, by way of another subsidy, the B and I company? If so, the Minister should say so straight out and then we will know where we stand.  Not alone does the Minister go back to 1st April, 1967, but, in fact, under this Bill a grant may be given for approved capital expenditure incurred on or after 1st April, 1967, and a grant may be given towards approved capital expenditure incurred before that date in so far as it consists of any sum paid after that date.  The expenditure could be brought over a number of years, for one reason or another, and the subsidy would still be apparently available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it would be very nice if we had a shipping fleet of our own <Col N="923" /> operating here and giving good service. However, I live beside the port of Drogheda and I must say that of all the tramp steamers that come and go there from time to time, only a small percentage are Irish vessels.  If this was intended, as I at first thought it might have been, for the purpose of giving employment in Irish ship-building ports and if it was laid down as a condition for the grant that the ship must be constructed in Ireland, then I could see great merit in it.  The Minister should make sure that where it is possible to do so, a ship should be constructed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of helping people who are trying to improve facilities here and, while the modernisation of all methods of transport should be encouraged, there is something in this Bill which is not being disclosed and I think it would be just as well if we were told what this hidden thing is. I am not accusing the Minister of being devious but it does appear as if the statement he has given us omits far more than it reveals.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he tie up the loose ends of this Bill before it becomes legislation.  He knows what happened with the B and I, for instance, when the State bought it over. The first thing they did was to get rid of a number of the vessels because, they said, they were too old and they then employed German vessels with German crews while a number of Irish crews were walking around the streets, some of them in the village of Mornington near me.  There is no point in putting down something here and saving that it is for the purpose of being able to buy Irish ships which will operate in Irish waters if this is not the intention.  I am not happy that the whole thing is as open as it should be.</P>
    <P>If the intention in introducing this Bill is to give substantially more to the B and I&mdash;a company which, in fact, changed its ships and procured new ones&mdash;the Minister would get far more sympathy from the House in introducing this Bill which appears to me to be a little clouded.</P>
    <Col N="924" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, there are two kinds of shipping in the world&mdash; the free shipping that exists for profit and which goes anywhere and the shipping that is orientated towards the needs of a particular country.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed about a month ago when the Indian Minister for Industry and Commerce addressed the economic committee there and, when questioned by people from Holland, Germany and other places who said that India was now taking away the business that it had been giving to their ships, he said that it was necessary that there should be some discipline in shipping towards the benefit of the country concerned, the point being that while it might not be the most profitable operation to run certain services, at the same time, these services might be very much more important for the country than the actual profit involved.  He said that for that reason one might need to have discipline in the shipping services provided. The only way in which that could be done in a free profit situation is by having ships of one's own.</P>
      <P>We must look at the whole position in the light of the fact that the largest shipping fleet in the world is neither Great Britain's nor America's but Liberia's.  This is a flag of convenience just to pay little or no income tax or other taxes meaning that a ship is free to go in or out of any port in any place in the world.  That is a private enterprise situation&mdash;a situation where the profit of the ship is the be-all and the end-all and the only consideration, but in an island country it is necessary to provide shipping services, whether they be passenger services, car ferry services, goods transport services or anything else.  It is necessary that the services be orientated towards the advancement of the country itself.  It is absolutely necessary that we in this country develop some sort of merchant fleet of our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I charge the Governments of the past 20 years, and this may include a year or two of our own Government, with not orientating our shipping towards the good of our people and that the ships which we bought with good Irish money for Irish Shipping <Col N="925" /> Limited are operating all over the world for profit as tramp steamers. This was not what the ordinary branch member of my political organisation or what the ordinary member of Deputy Corish's organisation or of the Minister's organisation understood about what we were trying to do in Irish shipping.</P>
    <P>I agree that there was an outside factor and that it was necessary during the war that we should have shipping services that could bring the necessaries of life to us but when that need was filled we failed abysmally to produce coaster fleets that would provide the services that we required even, if necessary, at a loss because the loss incurred could have meant a colossal benefit to our people who were producing the goods.</P>
    <P>It is only now that we are providing a car ferry service which enables the industrial workers of England to drive their small cars on to a ferry and arrive here as they would drive on to a ferry in England and arrive on the Continent.  We orientated ourselves towards larger tramp vessels&mdash;I am not using the word &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; in any derogatory way.  Anyone interested in shipping knows that a tramp steamer is a boat with no set route, a boat available for charter to go anywhere it is fit to go.  I mean nothing derogatory when I use the term &ldquo;tramp steamer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When that necessity of providing the tea and the various commodities we needed during the war was fulfilled, these boats sailed around the world, 90 per cent of their time taking no goods to Ireland and taking no goods from Ireland but acting merely in a private enterprise way just as if they had been flying the Liberian flag of convenience instead of the Tricolour. Flying the flag is a bit like wrapping the green flag round you on an industrial or commercial job.  Over the years, we should have organised our shipping towards the export of our goods, towards the service that would be available for that export.  We should have organised it, further, towards making it easier to bring tourists here during the summer months.  This is what we should have been doing.  I <Col N="926" /> admit we are starting on it now but we are years late and the blame should fall on the Government for that reason. Therefore, I would regard this Bill as an instrument that can be used for good.  It is also an instrument with which we can muff the job, just as we did in the past when we had these huge tramp steamers plying all over the world but not to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain restrictive sections of this Bill.  I welcome the fact that the grant is available only to State recipients and to bodies corporate.  I feel that this is a Bill which would require some considerable work on Committee Stage.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell me how a body corporate can be designated entirely Irish, or not so.  As I see it, a company that has been formed is a company.  I just do not understand how one can identify and designate the capital therein of a body corporate. If one names the people, one finds oneself in the same position as was described by Deputy Sweetman and myself here when Fine Gael moved a Bill quite recently in relation to a company law where you had the system of alternate directors.  In the body corporate, it appears to me as if the money therein might not be Irish money.  There is, again, indeed, the consideration that perhaps it is a good thing to get money from outside so long as we can control the activities of the ships in which we are really investing, in an irrecoverable way, 25 per cent of the cost.  That is the clear situation, namely, that we are investing 25 per cent of the cost with no hope of interest and no hope of recovery. We are giving a grant.  We are being far more restrictive in this Bill than if we gave a re-equipment grant to an industry on dry land.</P>
    <P>In section 6, we insist that we can impose any condition we like.  If there is a place on the east coast or on the coast of another part of Ireland where we could have another car ferry to bring industrial workers from Britain here for a fortnight's holidays at a reasonable rate and if I saw 25 per cent going into a ship to do that job, I should say &ldquo;Hurrah.  Make it 50 per cent if you can&rdquo;.  I want to see the condition that we do not put up 25 <Col N="927" /> per cent of the cost of a ship and then find, while it is flying the Tricolour, that it has become a tramp steamer plying for profit from here to the end of the globe.  That would be money lost because, in relation to the cost, the employment therein is negligible. Let me use an adjective in that respect that was used on one occasion by the Minister in relation to the temporary car ferry: he said it is &ldquo;nugatory&rdquo; which, I understand, is &ldquo;small beer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if we can discipline this, if we can produce a situation whereby these boats will serve the Irish nation, then it is right to give the 25 per cent grant.  If we are going to proceed in any other way and if this is just a way, for instance, of giving a 25 per cent subsidy towards the work, then let us say so.  If shipping is as described &mdash; if British Railways can get 25 per cent of the cost of a vessel if they invest therein in Britain and the B and I are in an unenviable position because of this &mdash; then it is right that we should make the change.  At the same time, if all the shipbuilders on the Clyde are getting a subsidy then we must defend the position of the workers of Verolme.</P>
    <P>We are told that this is something designed to make the Irish merchant fleet serve the Irish nation.  I want this done.  I agree with the Minister that one of the main charges on shipping is depreciation.  Whether or not they would have made something if the owners had had to pay 100 per cent of the cost, so long as they make money when they have to pay only 75 per cent of the cost then let them be bound to the service which they produce as a reason for the ships.  Let us have these ships serving the Irish nation just as we had not these ships serving the Irish nation heretofore.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage, we must look at this Bill on the basis of whether or not it is right that the conditions imposed are entirely conditions that shall be imposed by the Minister. Section 6 sets out that almost any condition shall be imposed &mdash; that a grant shall be available and that security shall be taken in the ship so that if conditions are not carried out <Col N="928" /> the Minister would recover entire interest in the ship.  There are 64 shares in every ship and you can sell them just as in the case of any company and get a bill of sale just as if a stockbroker were instructed to sell five shares or 500 shares.  Therefore, there is no reason why we could not, under section 6, decide that we would take, out of 64 shares in the ship for which we provided the grant, 16 shares.  That is something that shipowners might not bite on: it might be too tough.  But, in normal maritime law, there is the machinery to create the situation whereby we can insist on the conditions under which we gave the grant being carried out.  I think that that condition does not exist at all as far as grants for industry on dry land are concerned but it certainly does exist here and the power can be taken on the Committee Stage, if such is desirable.</P>
    <P>I observe also in section 6 that it is desired that, if it is a partnership, it be an Irish partnership or, if it is a partnership between persons and a body corporate, that, again, it be an Irish partnership.  I want to know how we can define the nationality of a body corporate and, if we do define it in relation to partnership, I would question how we can define the money and the power behind it and how we can approach it on the basis of control by our very selves.</P>
    <P>I am attracted by a scheme whereby, if shares in a ship are not taken, a mortgage on such shares can be taken. There is no reason why such a marine mortgage cannot be got.  I would be very thankful if the Minister would indicate whether or not it is the intention, if a grant of 25 per cent is given, that a mortgage will be taken and that if the conditions are not carried out such mortgage shall be recoverable. There was a day in this Dáil not so long ago when we voted a sum of £180,000 for a subsidy for building six ships in the Verolme Dockyard, at £30,000 per ship &mdash; and let us be clear about this, it was backed up by the Fine Gael Party and I supported it and would do so again.  The Minister may be able to tell me whether I am right or wrong but I think that was about four years ago.  Now we are going to do it in a different way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Again, I have no criticism of that but I do not go as far as Deputy Tully when he demands that we should get the exact situation behind this Bill. That is not possible.  In the business way the Minister must make the decisions. There is a difference, as far as I see, in the Bill between the operations of the Minister in regard to these grants and grants on dry land, because the eventual decisions, as far as grants on dry land are concerned, are made by An Foras Tionscal, on the advice of the Industrial Development Authority.  These two bodies are to be merged but have not yet been, due to the slowness that seems to characterise the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In this Bill, it appears to me that, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and Power shall make the decision himself.</P>
    <P>We are not in a very big way in shipping and the number of decisions will not be great.  If the Minister or his successor &mdash; whoever he may be &mdash; is prepared to take the odium if there is failure and the praise if there is success, I do not see much wrong with that as long as the position is open to criticism both inside and outside the House.  I should like to have clarification on how it is intended to proceed under section 6 in relation to security and how we will approach the very serious question of how our money is to be safeguarded, not as money to be repaid.  This Bill is giving grants but it is money that is being used for a certain purpose and the purpose I wish to define as money to be used in the service of the nation towards the employment of more workers on the land by providing better services orientated towards the people's advancement at sea.</P>
    <P>I observe with interest that there shall be no grant for a fishing vessel and the reason, which is given in the Minister's speech, is that this is looked after by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. There is no grant either for a tug or a dredger or a vessel of less than 100 tons gross tonnage.  This brings to my mind the fact that some newspapers at the weekend indicated that the Minister must have had a rather nostalgic <Col N="930" /> time when he saw the <i>Asgard</i> afloat again.  I see that it is to go to Cowes in the summer with trainees and then to Kinsale on the 14th July and to many other places.  As a sailing man myself I want to salute the re-launching of the <i>Asgard.</i> The Minister's family has been involved in a page of history in which this boat was also involved.  For that reason, I suppose, the Minister's family and the <i>Asgard</i> are inextricably linked together.  We needed some sort of boat to give our young sailors something to live up to, something to reach for.</P>
    <P>There are many young men in this city who are going on the boat to take a fairly uncomfortable trip, under cramped conditions, I would say, judging from the numbers going on the various cruises being arranged.  I take a little credit myself for having over the last ten years repeatedly asked questions at the start of summer and during the summer about what was happening the <i>Asgard</i> when it was under the control of the Minister for Defence.  Some Ministers for Defence found me a little bit persistent but, now that the <i>Asgard</i> has been virtually re-built, we are going to get some advancement for our young men&mdash; after all we are a maritime nation&mdash; I am delighted to see that the Government have spent a little money on this.</P>

      <P>They did not.  She does not qualify.  However, I have abused the Minister so often that perhaps I could be allowed a few minutes to be nice to him for a change. The need for modernisation is mentioned in this Bill.  This need is quite apparent if you consider the container service and all the great changes that have taken place, the different ways for unloading grain, for instance, and so on, and also the fact that nowadays it is possible to operate greater tonnage, greater length and shallower draught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that there is no hope for anybody who is not prepared to modernise and produce a vessel to give the best possible service.  I agree with this.  This is a <Col N="931" /> Bill which on the Committee Stage should certainly be discussed section by section in great detail, particularly section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank Deputy Donegan for his kind comment in relation to my family and the <i>Asgard</i> and I join with him in expressing real joy that the <i>Asgard</i> is now being used in the way in which it was my mother's last wish it should be used.  In relation to the Bill, there is no secret reason for the Bill as suggested by Deputy Tully who, I must say, is generally constructive in his remarks.  There are a number of shipping companies, Irish Shipping Ltd., the B and I, the Greenore Steamship Company, Celtic Coasters and the Limerick Steamship Company and some 14 very small companies who each have very few vessels, or only one vessel of over 100 tons gross registration, all of whom can obtain grants provided they fulfil the conditions to be laid down in section 6.  The purpose of the grant is to enable Irish shipping companies to compete with British shipping companies and foreign shipping companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would take me too long to give a list of the grants and loans made available by practically every country in Europe for the building of ships or the purchase of ships by shipping companies. They vary from one country to another.  In some cases they consist of loans at extremely low rates of interest, the repayment of which is constantly postponed from year to year and they become the equivalent of grants.  The main purpose of the Bill is to enable us to deal with the situation which has spread all over Europe and has obtained in the United States for a number of years where there are enormous subsidies for shipping in that very rich country.  It would have been better if everybody had agreed from the beginning that there would be no subsidies.  Then we would not have to have this Bill.  But, as the British are doing this and as we compete with them to a very considerable extent, it is essential to put forward this scheme of grants.  I do not think the grants will apply to purely Dublin Bay cruising <Col N="932" /> unless there was some competition and I cannot foresee that.  It would not apply in the ordinary way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The present cruisers are advertised today for sale and I thought they were going to be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we would include that type of boat in the grant scheme.  That would come up for final consideration later.  The shipping business we have is a good business for the country even if Irish Shipping vessels do tramp around the seven seas. The Irish Shipping business earned £5 million in foreign currency and employed some 4,000 people in 1968. That is good business.  An Irish ship with an Irish crew, Irish engineers and the Irish flag, eventually home-based, is, in some ways, rather like an Irish industry that does not reside on Irish shores.  It can be compared to that.</P>
      <P>One of the main difficulties we have always had to face in relation to shipping is that we cannot have protection for the Irish shipping industry because it would never pay us to do so. One has only to look at the list of exports and imports, whence they come and where they go, to see that it would not pay us to insist that certain kinds of Irish goods whether exports or certain kinds of imported raw materials must come in Irish bottoms.  We and a great number of small countries, and Great Britain in the Northern European area have always subscribed to the principle that people are entitled to bring in and export goods in any kind of vessel they select.  That inevitably means that the shipping business is intensely competitive for our own companies.  Irish Shipping does in fact do business for Gouldings Fertilisers and in company with the Manchester liners undertakes part of the transatlantic trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have always been difficulties for Irish Shipping in getting into certain parts of the transatlantic trade because of the cartel system of the liner trade which they have not been able to enter. In any event, Irish Shipping does the maximum amount of business possible for it in connection with Irish trade and for the rest, it tramps.  I am glad to say the company has made financial progress <Col N="933" /> recently and it will make a surplus, I hope, something in the region of £300,000, in the current financial year which will be re-invested in new ships or in the development of the company generally.</P>
    <P>I was asked why the Bill is retrospective. It is because grants are due to the B and I for some of its car ferry vessels, for part of an Irish shipping vessel that has been ordered and for the conversion of a Greenore Shipping Company vessel.  There is nothing strange or unusual in the Bill's retrospective character.  As Deputy Donegan and others have said, there has been a literal revolution in the whole of the shipping business because of the coming of container unitised trade.  I hope these grants will apply in the main in future to ships built in Ireland. For example, take the case of the B and I which was purchased in July, 1965, on the basis of two independent valuations made by two of the greatest firms of ships valuers in the world, one acting on behalf of Coast Lines and the other acting on behalf of the Government.  The difference in the valuations made of the assets of that company was very small, in the neighbourhood, I think, of a mere £200,000 out of a total of £3 million. The bargain was struck.  We know that we got the B and I company for the lowest possible price under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The new B and I board, first of all, had to learn their business.  They had to assess what would be required in the way of replacement vessels.  They were doing this in the middle of a revolution which was taking place in which there was an enormous increase in container traffic and in car ferry traffic and when general vessels carrying cargoes, cattle, passengers and cars were absolutely &ldquo;out&rdquo; from the economic point of view.  For that reason it was essential for them to enter the car ferry business as quickly as possible.  As a result, two out of three vessels had to be built out of this country: the third is being completed in Cork.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited has given good business at all times to the Verolme Dockyard.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is, in fact, in <Col N="934" /> charge of the shipbuilding industry; he has general supervision over it.  I would consult him before giving a grant to a vessel that was not to be built in Ireland.  I want to make quite clear that this revolution is taking place and that is why the B and I had to act as quickly as possible and why, for example, they had to hire German boats to begin with in order to carry containers while they were making up their minds as to what kind of container ships they would need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan asked about section 6.  This gives me power to impose conditions to ensure that an asset for which a grant has been made continues to be used as visualised by the conditions of the grant and that if it is not the grant will be repaid in whole or in part.  When the Deputy asks how one defines an Irish company I should say that for the purpose of this Bill it is a company which is resident and registered in Ireland.  We shall have to take particular care if a foreign company is to have a company established here which would wish to go into the shipping business.  It would be my particular care to ensure that in so doing the assets would be preserved here and that the shipping company would at no time hive off the ship to the major company of which it was a subsidiary and that the assets would be used for this country.  That would be one of my responsibilities in providing conditions for the payment of the grant.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to providing a grant for a ship that may be chartered provided I can be sure that the contract in relation to the charter includes the retention of the ship on the Irish register, flying the Irish flag, employing an Irish crew and that the financial arrangements for the charter are such that good money will come to this country continuously over the period, so that in effect it is rather like an industry doing an export trade with Irishmen employed but on the basis of the ship possibly being chartered to another company for a period of years. So long as we can find enough capital in connection with the total capital budget, with which there are always great difficulties, that kind of business could be very profitable to us.  There <Col N="935" /> is no reason why a grant should not be given under section 6 to a company that wanted to charter on that basis.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Donegan and other Deputies that while our capital needs are always going to be in excess of supply whoever is Minister for Transport and Power at any time will have to make sure that whatever grants are made available will have the most beneficial effect.  We would naturally have to make comparisons between the various demands made on us to ensure that the result would be the best kind of employment for our people and the maximum income for the country in the way of earning foreign exchange or bringing tourists here.  I agree with the Deputies who said that care should be exercised in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan made some references to the whole history of our shipping policy.  It would take too long to go into that here today.  That is all in the past.  I would remind the Deputy that after the Suez boom in rates there was a great collapse in the freight rates for shipping all over the world, as a result of which Irish shipping suffered.  At no time did it require a subsidy from the Government but the position was made very difficult for a period of years.  If anybody chooses to make a study of the accounts of British shipping companies, for example, who engage in cargo trade they will find in a very large number of instances if they pay dividends the dividends are paid on something other than the running of the ship, on wharfage, on running a transport business or on property development on shore.  That is the result of prolonged very low freight rates over a period.  The freight rates rose recently but they declined again for a period. Irish Shipping have been thoroughly re-organised by the present board. Many economies have been made and I think they are at the moment in a very good financial position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan asked whether we intended to ask for a shipping mortgage as a condition of giving the grant. I think the answer to that is we intend to provide conditions in connection with the giving of the grant which would make a mortgage unnecessary. <Col N="936" /> Mortgages are not required in the case of grants given for new Irish industry and I do not think there will be any need in the case of ships.  Deputies will also notice there is a provision for very heavy fines for people who are found breaking the agreement made with me as Minister in connection with the use of the asset for which the grant is given.  I think I should be able to take responsibility direct for giving those grants.  It is true, An Foras Tionscal are an independent organisation who provide the grants for industry, but I do not think there will be a large number of applications. In reply to Deputy Donegan, I will always be willing to face the House and to answer Parliamentary Questions on this and I hope I will give a very good account of myself in the manner in which I make those grants available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Thursday afternoon last I was dealing with some of the disadvantages of institutional life, the defects thereof and also the cost of maintaining a child in an institution as against in a foster home.  The cost appears to me to be different in each local authority.  Some local authorities pay scandalously low amounts of money towards the maintenance of a child in a foster home.  Roscommon pay 11/6d for a child under ten years of age and 13/10d for a child over ten <Col N="937" /> years of age.  I think this is criminal.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous that a local authority in the year 1969 should pay as low as this amount to keep a child in a foster home.  When you bear in mind that we in Donegal pay £2 per week I work it out that it is costing an average of £3 6s a week to keep a child in an institution in Donegal.  When you bear in mind that some institutions operate purely on the income from charity and that in Donegal as little as 10/- per week is paid to that institution, you then see that if these charitable institutions were not there this average of £3 6s a week would be increased.</P>
      <P>I do not know the figures for the whole country in this regard but I take it that the average of £3 6s a week in Donegal can be accepted as being the mean average for every health authority in the country.  When you consider that health authorities such as Roscommon pay 11/6d to have a child placed in a foster home and are prepared to pay £3 6s. to keep it in an institution, our sense of proportion, our sense of decency and our responsibility to society is certainly failing.  Needless to say there is no health authority in the country paying more than 30/-a week for the upkeep of a child in a foster home except County Donegal. We are told that the Westmeath authority will apply a rate of £2 a week in the near future.  It is a sad reflection on health authorities that such a situation exists in our society in this day and age.  I make the remark that some of the health authorities are usually classified as being the cream of the country.  For example, Dublin pay the princely sum of £1 10s 9d per week, Kildare pay £1 10s, Leix £1 10s and Wicklow £1 10s.  Those figures are so scandalous that people in public life can no longer ignore them.  I might also add that I think the national newspapers do not play a big enough part in making the people aware of the plight of the orphan child.  When I was speaking here last Thursday I said I hoped the Minister for Health would have available today the figures for the entire country of children under 16 years of age in institutions.  I do not know if the Minister has them available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points I would like to make in this debate is that there is so much accommodation needed for mentally handicapped and physically handicapped children that I do not think it is right that society should allow orphan children to remain in institutions and pay an average of £3 6s a week for their maintenance when there are so many potential, if I may use the word, foster parents who would be prepared to take a child into their homes.  We all know that adoption is the right solution to this problem.  That is not to be discussed in this debate but it is so closely linked with fosterage that it is very difficult to keep them separate.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that I have been told in the last few days which I did not know and I feel it should receive the utmost publicity.  Very often you find kindly people being encouraged to accept orphan children in their homes as foster children.  They are paid these ridiculously low amounts by local health authorities for their maintenance.  I believe that these people should be encouraged to adopt the children.  I am told that if they do this they may still apply, if circumstances in the home warrant it, for the allowance from the health authority. I have no real authority for saying this but, if it is so, I believe that the Minister for Health, and his Department should notify all local authorities asking them to bring this fact to the notice of those parents who at the moment have foster children in their homes so that they may legally adopt them and still not have to take over the responsibility of society which they wish to share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal thing about this is that, while there are so many children in institutions, the demand to take them out, to have them fostered and adopted, if it is properly advertised, <Col N="939" /> is greater than the number of children in the institutions.  It just does not make sense to me that there are so many people who wish to adopt children and that there are so many children in institutions wanting to get out.</P>
    <P>I know that certain societies have been in contact with the Department of Health recently.  I know one firm of solicitors have been in contact with the Department of Health concerning a young girl.  I do not wish to state the details here now but I feel that, if I did, there would be a lot of people in high places embarrassed.  In the interests of all concerned I am refraining from going into the details.  I have so much respect for the Minister for Health that I will pass copies of these letters to him and ask him to deal with them personally.</P>
    <P>Some of the disadvantages of institutional life have been mentioned to me.  One of the things that cannot be found in an institution is a mother. It is described here as a mother substitute.  In normal families you have both male and female.  You do not find this in an institution.  It is usually all boys or all girls.  A child in a foster home stands a greater chance of being legally adopted than a child committed to an institution.  Incidentally, I understand that 432 children have been legally adopted by this method since 1953.</P>
    <P>Adoption gives a new name to a child and a new security in life.  One of the fears of a child in an institution is that something will happen when it reaches the age of 16 years of age. It does not have to leave at that age but there is this insecurity.  If a child is in a foster home it can continue to live there as a member of the family. All these things have a telling effect on the personality of a growing boy or girl.  I have no doubt that if we had found ourselves in this position we would have protested and would have what is commonly described as a &ldquo;chip on the shoulder&rdquo; complex.</P>
    <P>A child in a foster home has a wider choice of employment.  If a child is in a family circle his foster brother or his pal around the corned will mention that there is a messenger boy job down <Col N="940" /> the street or a job becoming vacant in a local factory.  This information is not readily available to a child in an institution.</P>
    <P>In view of all these things I wonder why local authorities do not increase their contribution to foster parents. There are so many arguments in favour of fosterage and so many arguments against institutional life that we can no longer accept the situation where health authorities such as Roscommon get away with paying 11/6d a week for the maintenance of a child in a foster home and are prepared at the same time to pay £3 6s a week on average for the maintenance of a child in an institution.  This is criminal and the sooner the problem is tackled and solved the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to deal with is school medical inspections.  In Donegal we have a school medical inspection and it is the greatest joke in any household.  The school medical inspector arrives at the national school. Every child is examined, recommendations are made that teeth should be extracted or that the child should be seen by an eye specialist or some minor defect attended to.  By the time that child is called he has either moved into the secondary school and is not eligible to be attended to under the school medical system or he has left school altogether and is in Glasgow or Manchester.  The cost of inspection must be tremendous when we compare it with the actual services given.  My eldest daughter had some slight defect in her ear which I knew nothing about. It was recommended at a school medical inspection that she should be sent to an ear specialist.  She was taken from the national school before the school leaving age and went to a secondary school.  Because she had left the national school and was now a student in the local convent, despite the fact that she was still under 14 years of age, she was not eligible for free medical attention.  If you cannot perform the service, then you should forget about the inspection.  It is a laugh; it serves no purpose whatever and the money could be better spent.</P>
    <P>If a child qualifies for the school medical inspection, every defect discovered <Col N="941" /> in that inspection will be attended to free, irrespective of the family.  However, there is a ludicrous situation inasmuch as if the parent becomes alarmed as to the degree of the defect or illness before the child goes to school and takes the child to the local doctor or to a specialist, this invalidates the right of that child to avail of the school medical inspection system.</P>
    <P>This is fair enough if the illness is not permanent, but in the case of physically and mentally handicapped children the right to avail of the inspection should apply prior to national school enrolment, because the treatment which a physically or mentally handicapped child will receive for the remainder of its life is more educational and physical training than medical. Therefore the Minister should accept a recommendation of the Donegal County Council &mdash; perhaps other health authorities have made the same recommendation&mdash;that a child taken to a school medical inspector, whether that child is on the roll of that school or not, should qualify for the facilities of the school medical inspection, particularly a mentally or physically handicapped child.  There is one case I know of&mdash;I will not say where, but we can say it is not in Donegal&mdash;where the parents, who knew the regulations, had a child with a defect.  Because they knew they could avail of the free school medical inspection they took the child to the inspector.  Since it was discovered at a school medical inspection that the child had a defect, that child will receive treatment without charge for the remainder of its life.</P>
    <P>Other parents who do not know they can avail of this inspection, although they may be at a much lower income level than the parents who know, in their anxiety to have the defect dealt with, will take the child to their own doctor or to a specialist. If the defect is subsequently discovered at a school medical inspection it does not follow that the same facilities will be afforded as in the previous case, and the parents will be asked to subscribe according to their means for the treatment of the ailment.  This is an anomaly in the health services, and I <Col N="942" /> know the Minister will be sympathetically disposed to deal with something which is not fair.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly I wish to mention.  Middle-income group patients may elect to go to the local hospital whether they are attended by a private doctor or their dispensary doctor.  If they go under their dispensary doctor they can claim the right to be charged a fee not exceeding 10/- per week.  If they elect to go under the private doctor then they will be charged the full rate and will be classed as private patients; they will lose their middle-income group status.  This applies only in hospitals that are run by that health authority.  The patient could go to the private doctor, ask to be treated as a private patient and, instead of going to the hospital run by the health authority, be sent to an extern hospital If he enters an extern hospital instead of his own local authority hospital, he does not lose his status.  I understand that these are regulations which the Department of Health allow health authorities to make.  They have allowed the Donegal County Council to do it and I think it is wrong.  The health services report which was laid before the Dáil in January, 1966, when the late Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Health, states at page 59 in relation to the cost of our health services:</P>
    <P>The Government, having studied the issue, are satisfied that local rates are not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional moneys on this scale.  They propose therefore that the cost of the further extensions of the services should not be met in any proportion by local rates.</P>
    <P>That was stated three years ago.  At this very time almost every local authority in the country is protesting against the cost of the health services. The people in Dublin are protesting in the streets and asking the members of the Dublin Corporation not to strike a rate until the Government remove the cost of the health services from the rates.  There is a similar situation in various local authorities throughout the country.  We had a discussion on these lines at the recent estimates meeting in County Donegal.  I must say I am in favour of the attitude adopted <Col N="943" /> by various local authorities inasmuch as I feel strongly on this point.  The system of collecting money by rates was never intended to finance health services on the present scale.  In County Donegal the rate is £5 3s 6d in the £; £2 2s 2d of that is the cost of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have revolutionary proposals in their policy document in regard to health and more will be heard of them in the not too distant future.  The Government accepted the report on the health services in January, 1966, and the White Paper was debated at great length here three years ago, and the Government indicated, as quoted by me from page 59, that something would have to be done. I do not know when that something will be done but the sooner it is done the better.  People in other parts of this small island have taken to the streets in protest against many things. I should not like to see that happening here, but people have the right to protest.</P>
    <P>The present system of taxation on a rates basis is not a fair one and the sooner it is changed the better.  As an interim measure the Government might be interested in accepting full responsibility for the upkeep of extern hospitals.  If they are not prepared to transfer the cost of the health services to central funds they might, perhaps, accept responsibility for the extern hospitals.  That might be difficult but, certainly, the problems would not be insurmountable.  I expressed this opinion at a local estimates meeting and a member of the Fianna Fáil Party agreed that this would be a way of transferring the cost from the local authority to the extern hospital.  If the cost of the extern hospitals were the full responsibility of the Department of Health then the hospitals would cease to be our responsibility.  This is not the position in relation to many aspects of our health services.  For example, the Department of Health will not allow the county manager to transfer a patient to an extern hospital unless he is unable to provide a service for that patient in his own local authority.  It would be exciting to speculate as to the possibility of extern <Col N="944" /> hospitals being made the full responsibility of Central Government.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to one matter affecting Donegal, a matter that is nothing less than a national scandal. There was up to recently a hospital in Killybegs, St. Columba's.  It was the property of people other than the county council until about ten years ago.  The Donegal County Council had an option to buy it and they bought it.  Tuberculosis has been eradicated and two, three or four years ago it became very obvious that St. Columba's hospital would cease to function as a TB unit.  A committee in Donegal dealing with the problem of the mentally handicapped made overtures to the county manager and the county council.  Members of the county council, including myself, tabled motions in support of the proposition that the hospital when it ceased to function as a TB unit should be handed over for the purpose of accommodating mentally handicapped children.  Now, somewhere along the line, an association known as CERT succeeded in convincing a sufficient number of county councillors that they had a better claim to the hospital.  Many reasons were put forward by officials as to why St. Columba's Hospital was unsuitable for mentally handicapped children &mdash; but people dealing with the everyday problems of mental handicap, people whose opinion and advice I accept and respect, could see nothing wrong.  In fact, they had nothing but praise for St. Columba's Hospital. With the slightest of alterations it could have been made to cater for 60 mentally handicapped children.  A religious order was interested in coming in to manage it.  However, CERT, a hotel training body, persuaded the council, by a majority of one, to change its mind.  This caused a certain amount of frustration to those dealing with the problem of the mentally handicapped and they were forced for their needs to buy an hotel.  Let me put on record here now my very deep appreciation of the help the Minister gave; without our asking he made finances available for the purchase of the hotel.</P>
    <P>I do not know who took the decision about Killybegs.  The hospital was <Col N="945" /> handed over to CERT, free; gratis and for nothing by the Donegal County Council.  I am told the hospital could have catered for 60 mentally handicapped children.  Last week I read in the local newspapers that the conversion of the hospital has cost to date £160,000.  This is nothing short of a public scandal and I have tabled a question to the Minister about it. I hope he will see fit to have a public inquiry into the cost of converting a hospital into an hotel and causing the association dealing with the problem of the mentally handicapped to buy an hotel to convert into a hospital. This is an embarrassing scandal and someone must accept responsibility for it.  I know the Minister had little or nothing to do with it, but I sincerely hope he will expose those responsible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall not delay the House but I should be lacking in my duty if I did not put forward my views on this very important Estimate.  I do not envy the Minister for Health his job in coming into the House in an effort to justify the operation of a perfectly absurd system and to stand over the financing of that system in an unjust and inequitable way.  I am satisfied the Minister is doing his best to operate a system which it is practically impossible to operate.</P>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Harte in saying that whenever I had occasion to approach the Minister's Department or the Minister himself I received nothing but courtesy and co-operation.  I am not saying that I always got what I sought, but I was always received in a gentlemanly and courteous way and the Minister explained the position to me and did his best to facilitate me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> The continuation of the policy whereby health is substantially financed out of rates is unjust and cannot be defended.  We have in this country a situation in which rating authorities in the past have either struck rates varying from £4 to £5 or more in the £ or in which the majority of them have declined to strike a rate because they felt they were imposing a crippling burden on the ratepayers. I wish to repeat, and I am sure it is already on record, that between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of this huge rate is attributable directly to the Health Estimate we are discussing today. It is the duty of a Government or anybody else who imposes taxation on the people to ensure that this is done in a fair and equitable manner which will have regard to the capacity and the means of the people to pay. The system of rating at present shows a complete and absolute disregard for these principles, and I shall have a lot more to say on this matter on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>The rating system imposes a tax by reference to an artificial value placed on land and buildings.  To appreciate fully the absurdity of the situation it is only necessary to recall that the last general valuation to fix poor law valuations in this country took place between 1852 and 1865.  There has not been a general valuation since then &mdash; in fact it has been impossible to revise the valuations on land since then and there has not been a general valuation on houses or buildings.  That valuation, known as Griffith's Valuation &mdash; I hasten to add it had nothing to do with the patriot Arthur Griffith, who I am sure would have been ashamed of it &mdash; took place between 1852 and 1865 and it is a well-known fact that before that valuation was completed it was already out of date.</P>
    <P>Valuation placed on one part of the country was out of line with valuations placed on the rest of the country because the valuation process commenced in 1852 shortly after the Famine when famine conditions were taken into account, but when the valuation was completed in 1865 conditions had improved and the valuation was carried out in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> I do not intend to deal in detail with the valuation of the country but it is necessary to give one or two examples to demonstrate the point I am making.  There was a partial valuation carried out in certain areas at various times in this century, and within the last 30 years Waterford, Buncrana and, I think, portion of Dublin city were revalued.  But when it came to the valuation of these areas it was found that, though it was necessary to quadruple or quintuple some valuations from, say, £5 to £25, it was found other valuations were adequate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in respect of areas that have not been revalued, certain buildings in this country bear a valuation of £5 and exactly similar buildings have a valuation of £25.  That means under the present rating system the occupier of one property is paying a rate of £25 whereas his neighbour in an identical property is paying a rate of £125.  This clearly shows the absurdity of the system.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is that even if the entire country were revalued &mdash; and according to a Government publication it would take at least eight years to revalue the buildings; but this I consider a conservative estimate and think 20 years would be nearer &mdash; and all holdings were equated one with the other, we can take a situation where there were two valuations of £20 each which was fair for each property concerned.  One of these buildings is occupied by a widow whose husband left her in fairly bad circumstances. On her £20 valuation she would have to pay £100 rates which she could not afford.  In the other building with a similar valuation you could have a wealthy person, a substantial businessman or thriving professional, and he would be called on to pay only the same £100 rates.</P>
    <P>This is the system out of which we are financing health and it cannot be defended.  I will refer to one Government publication and read from the Report on Valuation for Rating Purposes published by an interdepartmental committee in October 1965.  The first recommendation on page 29 of that Report reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> The position in regard to rateable valuation is unsatisfactory and inequitable and should be remedied by a general valuation.</P>
    <P>That is the method we are using to finance health.  That is the yardstick by which we are raising millions upon millions of pounds from the people of this country, in an unfair and inequitable manner.</P>
    <P>To conclude on this aspect of the subject, the Minister is quite naturally very conscious of the unfair method he is forced to use to finance his health services and, in his introductory speech, he felt impelled to defend himself against the criticisms which he knew would be levelled against him in respect of the huge amount of money being raised in this inequitable way. In the course of his opening speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Again I would remind Deputies that what the Exchequer pays must, of course, be raised from the people just as money contributed from the rates also must be raised.  The only justification for a transfer of responsibility for any portion of the cost of the health services from the rates to the Exchequer is that general taxation is a more equitable way of raising money than by increasing local rates; but the fact remains that the total cost must be met by the public.</P>
    <P>Agreed.  If I were to search the Library of this House for an argument which would support the case I am making, I could not get a better argument than that used by the Minister in introducing this Estimate, because he says that general taxation is a more equitable way of raising money than increasing the rates.  If that is so, the Minister has the remedy.  He should use his influence with the Government to persuade them to do what is fair and just and honest.  The wretched system of health services which has been inflicted on the people of this country for years should be remedied.  He should remove health charges from the rates and pay for them out of national taxation. Then, in his own words, he will be raising money in a more equitable way.  It is not good enough for the Government to send a spokesman in <Col N="949" /> here to admit that it is more equitable to raise money by general taxation than out of rates and, in the same breath, to say that they will continue to raise it out of the rates in an inequitable, unfair and unjust way.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record here as saying that there is a moral obligation on the Government to raise taxation in the fairest way possible.  We have it from the mouth of the Minister that general taxation is a fairer method of financing the health services than the rates.  There will be a lot more to be said on this subject when we come to deal with the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to the Government and say that from now on they must remove the health charge in its entirety from the rates.  That is their duty.  I am not a voice crying in the wilderness.  Every rating authority from Dublin to Mayo, and every local authority, are indignant at the bills that are being presented to them this year, and at the rates they have to strike.  The health charge is responsible for approximately 40 per cent of the rates.  Certainly it is nearer to 40 than 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the fact that the health services are financed out of the rates results in some counties in inferior and inadequate health services being provided.  There are certain schemes which may or may not be adopted by county councils as health authorities.  For example, I can point out to the Minister that in my constituency it is possible for a person in the lower income group to have his teeth extracted free of charge but, if that person wants to have those teeth replaced by artificial teeth, he must pay for them himself.  That is because the Cavan County Council feel it would increase the cost of the health services very considerably if they were to provide free dentures.  That is but one example of the way in which the health services can be affected by this system of financing.</P>
    <P>So much for the financing of the health services.  I want to come now briefly to another aspect of health which has been touched on by other speakers and in which I have been interested since I became a Member of <Col N="950" /> the Oireachtas, that is, the hospitalisation of mentally retarded children.  In my opinion, the Government have fallen down on their duty in this respect.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;he will have to admit that even in the cases in which I have interested myself, there are children who have been on a waiting list for four and five years to get into an institution.  That simply is not good enough.  I can speak only from my own experience, and I know that there are many parents who have the problem of mentally retarded children and they are driven nearly demented in trying to get them placed or looked after.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that there are waiting lists and that children have to wait three, four and five years to get into an institution and, if the Minister considers that is a reasonable position, I certainly cannot agree with him.  I have looked through the White Paper on Health, and I looked through the Third Programme which has just been published, and I could find nothing to suggest that there is to be a crash programme in relation to these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which really cannot wait.  It is something which must be attended to immediately.  I do not know how many of these children are in homes throughout the length and breadth of this country awaiting hospitalisation.  I know there are a substantial number of them, and I am satisfied that the problem is not being treated by the Government as seriously and as urgently as it should be treated. It is not being given the priority it deserves.  We know from the Minister's <Col N="951" /> speech that the population of mental hospitals has decreased considerably. That is a good thing.  We know also that sanatoria throughout the country have closed down in recent years.  That also is to be welcomed.  I want to ask the Minister why some of these vacant places cannot be used to house these mentally-retarded children.</P>
    <P>We had an example of this here in the field of education for normal children.  We had really what could be described as a crash programme.  We had post-primary education brought into operation very quickly within 12 months of its announcement.  If that could be done in that length of time for the vast population, comparatively speaking, of normally healthy children, why cannot the Minister for Health and his Department do a similar job for these unfortunate mentally-retarded children?  That is not an unreasonable request.  I am sure in this day and age of pre-fabricated buildings it should not be difficult to provide the necessary housing accommodation for these children.  I am surprised to hear the Minister appearing to be satisfied with the position or considering that a lot has been done and that substantial progress has been made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter I should like to deal with and that is the Report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services.  Here I should like to compliment the Minister on setting up this council.  I should like to compliment the members of this council on the expeditious manner in which they dealt with the task entrusted to them and in which they presented their Report to the Minister <Col N="952" /> for Health.  I should like to go further and compliment the Minister for publishing the Report so quickly.  It is really refreshing to find a Government-sponsored committee getting down to business and dealing with a very complex problem like this in such a short time.  I cannot get the date on which the matter was referred to the council but we all know that the whole thing was dealt with in a very businesslike way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is very refreshing.  It gives people confidence in committees and councils of this nature.  There is nothing so frustrating as to find some problem has been referred to a committee or council and then forgotten about for years.  That did not happen here.  I should like to compliment all concerned on the way they tackled it and on the expedition with which they dealt with it.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I come now to something very near home in my own constituency.  This Report proposes that a central hospital should be sited in Cavan town.  This central hospital is intended to cater for the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, together with sections of Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath and Meath.  In recommending Cavan town as a location for that hospital the council was influenced very much with the central location of Cavan town in relation to the region. A look at the map will prove beyond yea or nay that Cavan town is the ideal situation for that hospital.  If the hospital were to be located in any of the other counties concerned it would not be completely central for the rest of the region.  Furthermore Cavan town is right in the centre of the county of Cavan.  Certain other counties are staking claims, or endeavouring to put forward claims, to have the location of this hospital changed but I feel that they are really doing this because they feel they have to do it. There were meetings called and held to claim the hospital for other counties, and it was admitted that geographically they were not at all suited for the site of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> I feel therefore that the Minister accepts this Report in general and that in particular he accepts it in relation to its recommendation that Cavan should have a central hospital. I am also pleased to note that when the council came to deal with priority on page 127 it stated that in view of the existing condition of the surgical hospital in Cavan the provision of the new surgical hospital at Lisdarn should be undertaken as soon as possible.  I want to add my voice to the recommendation of this consultative council and to tell the Minister, as I am sure he knows, that not alone has the surgical hospital in Cavan outlived its useful life but indeed the St. Felim's Hospital at Cavan also needs replacement.  I am informed that St. Felim's Hospital is about 150 years of age and that the surgical hospital has really grown from a small building which was known as the old infirmary, and is now a patchwork quilt going back a couple of hundred years.  I do not wish to create uneasiness in the public mind but I know that the Minister has obtained advice from reliable sources to the effect that both St. Felim's Hospital and the surgical hospital constitute serious fire hazards.  I am aware that that is on record in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to see to it that preparations are made immediately for the erection of this new hospital in Cavan.  It is not difficult to make a case for placing this central hospital very high on the priority list.  I say that because discussions have been going on about the building of a new surgical hospital in Cavan for the past 25 or 30 years and the records in the Department of Health will show this.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the debate unduly but it is a fact that the staff of the surgical hospital in Cavan are doing a very fine job of work under what would appear to many people to be impossible conditions.  The same can be said for St. Felim's Hospital.</P>
    <P>There is a very fine modern hospital at Lisdarn.  This hospital was built as a sanatorium in the early 1940s but as a result of the progress made in the eradication of TB, it has been used <Col N="954" /> for some years now as a medical hospital.  There is ample room there for extension.  The Minister knows all about that as he was down there last year at the opening of a new nurses' home.  May I say that he was about the only one there in the line of a public representative?  I say that only in passing.  The Minister made a very good job of the opening without any assistance from the chairman or any member of Cavan County Council.  He had to shoulder the entire responsibility for the opening of the nurses' home. However, I am sure that he noticed the very lovely setting of the hospital and the very beautiful grounds which are so well kept.  I am sure, too, that he saw the ample scope for extension which would enable the hospital to serve as a central hospital in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services.</P>
    <P>As I say, that hospital has been placed second on the priority list after Dublin.  I would say to the Minister that Dublin is not badly off for hospitals. At least there is a choice of several hospitals here.  I would appeal to the Minister to complete the work which was commenced 25 or 30 years ago by giving Cavan a proper surgical hospital and, at the same time, the central hospital which has been recommended.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister has misunderstood me, I wish to say to him that I am not blaming him personally, operating within the finances and within the legislation at his disposal for any of the shortcomings in his Department.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to have another look at the problem of the mentally-retarded child and to treat the problem as a national one. I do not think there can be very much money involved in this but it would be a good thing if something could be done whereby the families who have healthy children could help the families who have the affliction of a child who is not just as well mentally as its neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is very happy with the Fitzgerald Report on the future of hospitals in this country.  I suppose since Cavan has <Col N="955" /> been chosen for a general hospital, one cannot blame him for this.  He says that high priority should be given to the building of this new hospital in Cavan. However, to my mind the report was rather rushed and I cannot agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick on the report in so far as my part of the country is concerned.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the commission recommended that the present county hospital in Kilkenny be downgraded to a community health centre, a recommendation that caused great annoyance both in the city and county of Kilkenny because people felt that the hospital should be upgraded instead of being downgraded and that it should be extended.  I understand that the county council have been endeavouring for a number of years to have the hospital extended so as to enable it to cater for all those requiring treatment there.  The Fitzgerald Report states that there is a modern county council hospital in Kilkenny with 166 beds.  I agree with that statement.  This hospital is the largest one of its kind in the south-eastern region.  It is therefore very difficult to understand how the commission, which comprised men, all of whom were specialists in their own fields, could overlook the claims of Kilkenny for a general hospital.  This hospital, with 166 beds, must cater for the needs of everybody in the locality. As I have said, the hospital is overcrowded and more accommodation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the county hospital in Kilkenny we have a specialist in maternity work. We are appointing an obstetrician gynaecologist.  Application has been made to the Local Appointments Commissioners for that appointment.  The idea of reducing the maternity end of it to what is known as a cottage hospital is, I think, altogether out of the question.  The hospital is being run very efficiently.  According to the report submitted to the county council the average duration of stay in the hospital over the past three years has been ten days, which is very short.  Chapter 3 of the Fitzgerald Report says that the general hospital should not have less than 300 beds and serve 120,000 <Col N="956" /> short-stay patients.  Kilkenny has a population of a quarter of a million people within a radius of 30 miles and the hospital should be brought up to 300 to 400 beds.  The report also states that Kilkenny is probably the most centrally situated of the three centres of Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that Cavan was chosen for the site of the general hospital because of its central situation. Here, the committee states in the report that Kilkenny is probably the most centrally situated.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that the general hospital could be brought to Waterford. I do not say that Waterford should not have a general hospital if it is found necessary to have it but I do say that it should not have anything whatever to do with the claims of Kilkenny.  Waterford are very good neighbours to us and we have no objection to a general hospital there as well as one in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We have a Regional Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny with accommodation for 90 patients.  Again, another quotation from the report on an outline of the future hospital system is to the effect that when choosing a site for a regional orthopaedic hospital Kilkenny was chosen because of its central situation in that area.  That, in itself, is a certain justification for the present hospital being made a general hospital. In addition, we have an auxiliary hospital in Kilkenny with 36 beds for patients transferred from the county hospital.  We also have St. John's Hospital, Aut Even, which to a large extent might be known as a community health centre.  Recently, a very fine wing catering for maternity cases has been added to St. John's Hospital and there is a first class operating theatre there.  It has the services of a specialist in gynaecology.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission states:</P>
    <P>(1)  We have chosen Castlebar as the General Hospital for Mayo in view of its central location in the county.</P>
    <P>(2)  Sligo Town is centrally situated in relation to Counties Sligo, Leitrim, and South Donegal, North-West Cavan and North Roscommon, and <Col N="957" /> is a suitable location for a General Hospital serving the area.</P>
    <P>(3)  Our choice of Cavan as a centre for a General Hospital springs from its central location in the North Midlands area.</P>
    <P>(4)  The situation of Tullamore roughly half-way between Mullingar and Portlaoise, reasonably close to both and centrally located in relation to the whole area.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know if all of these hospitals were chosen principally because they were in central positions and why Kilkenny should not also be chosen because it is also a centre in this particular area.  The decision was that Waterford was a thriving centre and that there was an industrial estate there.  I do not think that that should have any bearing on the general hospitals services in Kilkenny.  If Waterford deserves a general hospital, by all means let them have it but it should not be a case of putting out Kilkenny for the sake of Waterford.</P>
    <P>When tuberculosis was practically eradicated, the county council at that time closed down the sanatorium and transferred the few patients left to other hospitals.  Likewise, when drugs became available for the treatment of fever we closed down the fever hospital. Therefore, it is obviously not a case of just wanting to get hospitals going in order to have a hospital in the place.  All public bodies in Kilkenny feel that the county hospital in Kilkenny is a very viable unit.  It is fully occupied practically all the year round.  During the past three years, the average occupancy has been 80 per cent.  It is very difficult to know how that hospital could be down-graded, how the status could be down-graded and how it could be made into a community health centre.</P>
    <P>Apart from people visiting patients, according to the county surgeon's report, at least four emergency cases come in there each month to be dealt with and, if they had to go a further 30 miles, the health of those patients would be endangered by the travelling. I would appeal to the Minister to look again into this matter and, indeed, to come down himself and visit Kilkenny county hospital and see the position <Col N="958" /> there.  There were no public representatives on that committee and, even in the case of hospitals, public representatives could give advice on the siting of hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to accept this report without going more fully into it because we feel that we require the specialist services to which I have referred.  One-third of Waterford is surrounded by sea and therefore nobody can come to the hospital from that area but Kilkenny is in the very centre of a large area and I feel we should get the benefit of this hospital.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to learn when the new Health Bill will come before this House for consideration.  Leave to introduce it was granted to the Minister at the Dáil session in the Mansion House on 21st January, 1969. Apparently there is general confusion throughout the country about the appointment of dispensary doctors and no permanent appointments can be made until the new Health Bill is enacted and the position is made clear and beyond all doubt.</P>
    <P>On the subject of medical cards, I hold that every insured worker should have a medical card whether he is earning £15, £12 or £18 a week.  It is a great burden on the average worker to pay doctor's fees and, oftentimes, it causes delay.  These insured workers are entitled to free drugs and free hospital treatment but they are denied access to a doctor.  I feel that that should be remedied and that every insured worker should have a medical card.  Prevention is better than cure and oftentimes people delay too long either before attending the doctor themselves or sending the children to the doctor.  It would be much better for all if they had early treatment.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister in regard to the rates position. It seems very foolish for the Minister to send a memorandum to all counties asking them to reduce their health estimates.  The Minister must know that the county managers had already revised their estimates because of the enormous increase this year.  In Kilkenny the increase is 3/5d in the £, the equivalent of £64,000 or £65,000. This is an enormous extra charge for health and it is the biggest single charge <Col N="959" /> for any service in the county.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to increase the contribution to the rates in order to relieve the burden on the ratepayers to some extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister who has some of the heaviest responsibilities of any Minister in the Government.  I should like to say that anything I say criticising the operation of the Health Act is not to be taken as a criticism of the Minister.  It should not be the prerogative of any Party to set itself up as the custodian of the health services; it should be the concern of all Parties to ensure that the best possible service is provided for all sections but especially for the poor, the aged, the infirm, the mentally handicapped and all those who through lack of personal resources are unable to pay for their health services.  All Parties are deeply concerned about providing the best possible health services, within our resources, for all sections of the community. However, the big question remains to be answered: are we getting adequate returns for the huge investment in the health services?  I regard it as an investment because on the health of the country depends, to some extent at any rate, the economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Sligo/Leitrim there is concern and dismay, and justifiably so, over the hardships being imposed on ratepayers, especially on those least able to bear them.  In Sligo there was a demand for an increase of 7/- in the £ for health services.  The tragedy is that when people start to look for those services for which they are paying such an enormous amount, they find that adequate services are not provided. The ratepayers are fully aware of the heavy burden imposed on them to finance the health services and they are also aware that these services fall short of what are required.  I deplore the failure of the Government to take effective steps to find a solution to the problem of financing the health services other than from the rates.  This is an outmoded and archaic method, a relic of the landlord days; it is inequitable and does not take into account the <Col N="960" /> ability of the people to pay.  The present arrangement under which roughly 50 per cent of the cost of the health services is borne by local taxation &mdash; actually in Sligo we pay 47 per cent &mdash; cannot be defended and if the Government have become so inept as to be unable to find a solution then they should get out and make way for a Fine Gael Government.  We have a realistic policy which is to finance the health services of local authorities by way of contributory insurance.</P>
    <P>The people in my constituency are very aggrieved because when the White Paper was issued a few years ago the then Minister gave the impression that the rates would be frozen at the 1965-66 level.  Paragraph 116 of that White Paper stated:</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to make arrangements which will ensure that the local cost of the service falling on the rates for 1966-67 will not exceed the cost of the year 1965-66.</P>
    <P>That gave the impression to the ratepayer that the rates would be frozen, for the purposes of the health services, at the 1965-66 level but apparently the meaning of that is now being changed and it is said that that was for that year only.  From that on we have had a huge and unjustifiable increase in rates.  I believe the Minister was genuine when he wrote to the local authorities requesting them to reduce the increased amount for health services.  Unfortunately, however, the letter did not indicate where or how those reductions could be made.  The Minister genuinely thought that he could squeeze something extra out of the Minister for Finance.  Even at this late stage I would ask him to endeavour to do so.  I think he would have a pretty tough job but he should not give up trying.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the inadequacy of the health services in County Sligo.  I think the Minister has a fair idea of the difficulty we are experiencing there.  The school medical service, which should be the most important of all the services, is practically breaking down.  We have no ENT specialist and we know that in children the care of ear, nose and throat is <Col N="961" /> highly desirable.  We have not had an ENT specialist for some time.  I do not know where the fault lies because I know that every effort was made to get one.  A specialist in Dublin even went across to England and interviewed three Irishmen who were qualified as ENT specialists there but they would not return home.  I do not know if the Minister can do anything about this.  Is it a question of money or conditions or equipment?</P>
    <P>We have a long waiting list.  I should like to compliment the Minister for assisting very much a few months ago when I tabled a question which brought out the information that there were 99 on a waiting list for ENT treatment in Sligo at that time.  The Minister became very interested and we got a few beds here and there in different Dublin hospitals with the result that the waiting list was considerably reduced. I am sorry to say that it is almost as bad as ever now.  I am sure the Minister appreciates fully the fact that children are unable to study properly and that their education becomes impaired if they have pain in their ears or if they have bad tonsils which require removal.  We also have a long waiting list in Sligo for the removal of tonsils and I do not know what can be done about it.</P>
    <P>The dental service in Sligo has practically broken down.  We have only one dentist to cover the entire county.  He is an excellent young man who has set his roots in the county. He was originally appointed as a school dentist and now he is overworked trying to look after adults as well as children.  We have provided the money for extra dentists but we cannot get them.  I do not know why. Providing one dentist for the entire county is only nibbling at the problem: we require at least two or three more. We are all conscious of the need for dental care.  It is taught in school; there are charts on the walls explaining it and advertisements in the papers and on television but we have no dentists.  We all like to see our children growing up strong and healthy but I fear that the approach to the dental service is appalling, at least in my county.  A vast improvement is required and I want to impress on the <Col N="962" /> Minister the necessity to do something about the position as soon as possible. I know that he is concerned about it and is aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>We have no orthodontic specialist and in this case there is a three-year waiting list.  I am told by the county MOH that the list will probably become longer if things do not improve. I do not understand this position.  I have a particular case in mind where surgery was required on the gum of a school child and when the parents approached the county MOH they were told truthfully that there was a three-year waiting list.  They made their own arrangements and got the child into St. Mary's Chest Hospital in Dublin almost immediately.  If they could get a child in there through a private practitioner and, if a vacancy existed, how is it that the county council could not get the vacancy?</P>
    <P>We are told we cannot get a specialist to attend in Sligo but there is a specialist attending there monthly in a private capacity.  If that is so, why cannot the local authority get him?  They say he will not act for them.  I should like to know why.  As regards children whose parents have to send them to Dublin as private patients the local authority get them treated under section 25 of the Health Act but the cost of travelling to Dublin with the children &mdash; and especially if they are young the parents must go with them &mdash; is almost prohibitive. Afterwards, the parents must visit them and perhaps take them back to clinics in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This position seems to me to be absurd and I should like the Minister to take special note of it.  If there is a private specialist in Sligo for orthodontic treatment why do the county council not pay for the patient if he goes to that specialist?  They say they cannot.  There is something wrong but it is the ratepayers, the parents and the children in question who are suffering while all this tangle is being unravelled.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to medical cards.  I heard some criticism here regarding the issue of medical cards and I am glad to tell the Minister that I have no complaints in this respect. I have found that each case in my <Col N="963" /> county is dealt with on its merits. Where a case is genuine I find that the county manager, who is a very humane man, always issues a medical card.  I have also heard Deputies discussing the issue of medical cards to old age pensioners.  I find no difficulty in getting medical cards for old age pensioners.  I do not think I have ever been refused a medical card for an old age pensioner.  I would like to suggest that an old age pensioner, who has to go through a strict means test in order to get the old age pension, should automatically be issued with a medical card.  I would welcome that very much and I suggest to the Minister that this should be done.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs has been raised in this debate.  Modern drugs especially are very expensive but I think they are worth it because if a patient can be treated at home with modern drugs then he is still able to work and contribute towards the economy of the country and is not a drag on the local authority by having to pay for him in hospital.  However, there is one aspect of this drug business I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister, that is, that wastage of perishable drugs as a result of being kept in dispensaries can be very expensive.  We find there is a big wastage in perishable drugs and I think the system of keeping them in and dispensing them from dispensaries should be changed and that they should be dispensed from chemists' shops. That would save money and it would save the patient a lot of trouble and waste of time in having to travel long distances to dispensaries.  I know of a case of a woman who lived 25 miles from the dispensary where she got drugs for, I think, high blood pressure and due to some law she did not get them for four or five days.  I think it was over the signing of a document or some technical point that she did not get them for that length of time.  The woman almost died, even though there was a chemist's shop right beside her.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the dispensary service and to the lack of permanent doctors, especially in the west of Ireland.  In my county there is <Col N="964" /> no permanent doctor in Skreen and Riverstown and probably in other places as well.  Consequently, there is no continuity of service.  It is an absolute waste of time and it is not fair to the community as a whole to appoint temporary doctors where permanent appointments should be made.  Any doctor appointed in a temporary capacity will not stay there.  He will stay until such time as he gets a permanent post somewhere else.  Then the position has to be advertised again and there is a great waste of time.  The result is that in some areas weeks or even months go by before another doctor arrives.  Consequently, doctors in outlying areas are completely overworked. It is absolutely ridiculous that doctors with pretty long experience, who are available, married and settled down in a place should go up for interview to the Civil Service Appointments Commissioners and on some technicality, are turned down.  If they were good enough to serve the public over a number of years and the public were satisfied with them when they were working in a temporary capacity surely to goodness they should be appointed in a permanent capacity.  I do not know what the Civil Service Appointments Commissioners are thinking about but I know one thing.  They are not dealing with realities as we who live in the west of Ireland are and they have not a clue about what isolated places there are, what areas of scattered population there are in the west of Ireland.  If they had, they would try to give us a proper service.  If a doctor is appointed in a permanent capacity he has security; he is pensionable and he will stay but as things are in my constituency and, indeed, in other counties in the west of Ireland, doctors who are appointed in a temporary capacity will not stay.</P>
    <P>We have a deplorable health service in spite of the increase in rates and everything else.  I would like the Minister to take particular note of that. Coming from the west of Ireland he knows the difficulty of getting continuity of doctors if their appointments are not permanent.  I would emphasise that point because there is one place in County Sligo at the moment where the people are ringing me up and <Col N="965" /> writing to me asking why we do not give them a permanent doctor.  We advertised for one but the doctor who came was a single man and was appointed in a temporary capacity. When he got a permanent post in another place, we were back again to square one and the people had no doctor.  Outside doctors will not come a distance of ten miles.  You cannot have a satisfactory service under these conditions.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the nursing profession.  It is only when one is a patient in a hospital that one realises the importance of the work nurses are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nursing is a noble profession and deserves proper recognition. The only way to give nurses proper recognition is by giving them an increase in their salaries, by paying them just salaries.  That refers not only to the nursing staff in county hospitals but also the nursing staff in mental hospitals and all other institutions. I am glad to say that in Sligo we will have a general hospital soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hurrah, you are getting something in Sligo.  Marvellous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a general hospital and I know there will be a big increase in the nursing staff there.  I hope provision will be made for the housing of those nurses.  I would like to make a suggestion.  I understand that the Great Southern Hotel in Sligo will be up for sale shortly.  The Minister might think of having it purchased for a nurses' home. It would be an ideal solution instead of having them accommodated in different places around the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one last word which I would like to say, and that is, on handicapped children.  I know the Minister is deeply interested in this matter, as I am.  I know he is very sympathetic towards the treatment of those unfortunate people.  I understand that there are three categories: mildly handicapped, moderately handicapped and severely handicapped.  The future of mildly and moderately handicapped children at any rate is at stake.  For <Col N="966" /> that reason they should be got at as early an age as possible so that eventually they can be trained to take their places in society as useful citizens. I am glad that the parents of those children are more conscious nowadays of the necessity to let it be known that they have handicapped children than they were heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the voluntary organisations and religious orders who are doing a tremendous job in this field and particularly to the French Sisters at Rosses Point for the magnificent work they are doing for girls.  They recently extended their premises and the Minister was down there and saw what they are doing. They are deserving of our best gratitude.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the present Minister a tremendous lot has been done in this field, there is no doubt about that, and I should like to compliment him very much on that. Nevertheless, we cannot rest on our oars.  In my county the problem is in regard to boys.  It would be an indictment of our society if we did not continue to pursue this question until we have it solved.  It will not be easily solved but if the progress which has been maintained in the last couple of years can be accelerated we probably will be able to absorb them all in a few years.  One of the problems here is getting the children at an early age. I had a case the other day of an application to Stewart's Hospital for a child of three years of age.  There was a pretty long waiting list and they do not appear to be anxious to take them until they are five or six years of age. I am sure the Minister is aware of the great strain it is on parents, especially on the mother, to have such a child mixing around with other children in the home, especially young children.  I am sure, however, that we can safely leave the matter in the capable hands of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word on old people. The only reason I mention this is that I have heard the words &ldquo;county home&rdquo; used.  That term should have been dispensed with long ago.  It is a relic of famine days and of the British occupation of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> There is a stigma attached to it that nobody likes.  I never call our house of rest in Sligo a county home.  We call it St. John's.  The idea of putting elderly people into these establishments is wrong.  The dignity of old age deserves special consideration and any institution, no matter how good, can never replace the independence of the home for an old person.  They always like to die at home in their own bed, as they say.  If something could be done to have them cared for at home they would be much more comfortable and satisfied and less expensive for the country.  One way of doing this, possibly, would be to increase the old age pension.  That is not a function of this Minister of course.  There should also be constant visits from welfare officers.  Of course the idea of old people living alone in isolated areas should not be encouraged. We have seen too many tragedies, people falling into fires and so on.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the General Hospital in Sligo, which is nearing completion, I should like to see there a training centre for nurses, provided of course that the local authority would not have to finance the entire venture.  I should like to pay a compliment to the staff of Sligo County Hospital who have worked under adverse conditions in overcrowded wards. I have actually seen three babies in one cot, beds down the middle and so on.  Nevertheless, the matron and nursing staff had the compliments of all the patients I visited and certainly did tremendous work in adverse circumstances. When the new wing is opened they will be better off.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by referring to the rating system and asking that some other system be devised for financing the health services.  The day is coming when too few will be paying too much for too many and that will not be conducive to proceeding towards the creation of a just society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will be very brief indeed but there are a few matters I should like to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a Member of this House in <Col N="968" /> 1953 when the Health Bill of that day was introduced.  I remember distinctly Dr. Ryan, who was then Minister for Health, informing the House in reply to a question that that Health Bill when it became an Act, would cost the ratepayer 2/-in the £.  I remember that figure being queried at the time and Dr. Ryan repeated it.  Within a year Deputy T.F. O'Higgins became Minister for Health.  He, reluctantly I must say, decided to operate the Act introduced by his predecessor.  He said he was willing to give it a trial.  Unfortunately, that trial is still running. Instead of the Health Act costing us 2/- in the £ it is now costing somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30/- to 33/- in the £.  Our forecast at that time was much more correct than that of the then Minister.</P>
    <P>Some years afterwards a succeeding Minister for Health, the late lamented Deputy Donogh O'Malley, introduced a White Paper on Health.  He told us he would follow it up with a Health Bill.  We are still awaiting that Bill. We are now on the eve of the 19th Dáil and we all know that there is no hope of that Bill becoming an Act before the present Dáil ends.  We are back to square one in so far as health is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are addressing the jury or some such nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The jury is the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do that occasionally, successfully.  I hope I will be just as successful in addressing the Minister today.  If I am I will be quite satisfied.  They are a very important jury because they will bring in their verdict very soon and the defence may not like it.  The prosecutor may have the advantage when their verdict comes in, and I am the prosecutor as far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me proceed from where I was rudely interrupted by the Minister.  As a result of that White Paper there has not been a permanent dispensary doctor appointed throughout rural Ireland. There are a few exceptions.  In my own home county the majority of the dispensary districts are manned by <Col N="969" /> temporary doctors, doctors who are merely passing the time waiting to better themselves either abroad or in some permanent post.  Until we can take the appropriate steps, we shall remain in that unfortunate position in which the people are the victims.</P>
    <P>I was drawn away from the question of rates.  Let me make an appeal to the Minister to try to lighten the burden on the ratepayers of Donegal.  They are now taxed to the extent of £5 4s 6d in the £ of which, as I said before, over 30/- is for health services.  I think it was the present Minister who said here two years ago that there would be no further impost on the rates in respect of the health services &mdash; and if it was not the Minister it was his immediate predecessor.  He kept his word in that year, but we understood that as and from that day there would be no further increase in the charge on the rates for health services.  I would appeal to the Minister to ease the rates burden, particularly on the people in the rural counties.  If he does that he will be doing something which will be greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Gilhawley, referred to the County Hospital in Sligo.  I am very glad to see a county hospital in Sligo, but I must protest when it is suggested that a regional surgical hospital be provided in Sligo for the people of south and south-west Donegal.  There are ample locations and facilities for a major surgical hospital in South Donegal, and I sincerely hope these services will be provided there.  The Minister and the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, are aware, as I am, that the people down there are protesting strongly at the fact that they are going to be deprived of a surgical hospital in the south of the county.  I am not advocating any particular location for it.  Nor am I saying that a new hospital should be built in Donegal town or that the Shiel Hospital in Ballyshannon should be extended, but I believe that either of those sites is suitable for a surgical hospital for south-west Donegal.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of south-west Donegal, let me tell the Minister I was in a town called Pettigo last night, <Col N="970" /> the most forgotten spot in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It has no industry, no sewerage, and no drainage of its rivers, and what is worse it has no dispensary. The nearest dispensary doctor to Pettigo is 14 miles away.  If that dispensary doctor, who is merely doing <i>locum</i> in Pettigo, is busy in his own dispensary district, one cannot expect him to attend in Pettigo.  The people in Pettigo asked me last night to make an appeal to the Minister.  In the Six Counties, within 100 yards of that part of the town of Pettigo which is in the Republic of Ireland, there are three excellent doctors in residence.  Surely some arrangement could be made whereby these doctors resident in the Six Counties could attend patients in the Twenty-Six Counties and be paid a fee <i>per capita</i> or a retaining fee.  That would solve the problem for the people living in this forsaken and forgotten spot.</P>
    <P>In a little area called Lettercran the people told me there was a resident doctor within two miles of them, but if they wanted a dispensary doctor they would have to send to Donegal town, which is about 18 miles away. It appears that some short time ago, through the good offices of the Minister, one of these residents of the Six Counties undertook to do <i>locum</i> in the dispensary in Sligo but for some reasons which I cannot understand he received eight bogus calls in one night from a public telephone kiosk in Pettigo, with the result that he resigned from the dispensary and refused to do <i>locum.</i> This is something the Minister should deal with.  I do not think it would require much capital, and I am satisfied it would be a great comfort to the people of Pettigo and the surrounding districts if they were assured of medical attention within a reasonable time when it was called for.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay public tribute to the helicopter service, whether it is provided by the Minister in liaison with the Army or whoever provides it.  It is doing excellent work.  However, the expense of that helicopter service could be avoided if some arrangement could be made whereby the helicopters based at or near Derry City could be used for the transportation of patients <Col N="971" /> from Donegal.  I do not know whether this would work out economically but perhaps the Minister would kindly look into it to see if such a service could be provided.  It would be more efficient and possibly more economical but certainly the helicopters would be available in all weathers, and that is the principal consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will also be very brief.  This is the third week that this Estimate has been debated and it is only right that such an important service, affecting as it does, every person in the State, should receive deep and mature consideration from Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Everything that could be said about the various aspects of health, from the treatment of the mentally or physically handicapped child to the treatment of geriatric patients, has been said.  I rise particularly to highlight the difficult task of the Minister in charge of such a service in facing this House and the local authorities.  Many Deputies are also members of local authorities who are now in the process of striking a rate.  We know the impact which the health services have on the rates, but in spite of this fact, about 95 per cent of the speakers on this Estimate have been looking for improved and more expensive services.  Nobody doubts the desirability of every service advocated here, but all these additional services will cost money.  This is what I find all along the line: we are there for eleven and a half months in the year seeking extra services, more doctors, more hospitals; then, when it comes to striking the rate, there is gloom and depression.  It is only right to point out that, because of these services, the most needy amongst us can get the best specialist services they require.  Lack of money does not militate against them.  The best surgical and medical care is available to them.  That is a tremendous step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry some Deputies have seen fit to raise this matter of a former Minister saying comprehensive health services would cost only 2/- in the £ on the rates.  What was 2/- worth at <Col N="972" /> that time?  We hear questions as to the value of the £ in 1939, 1959 and today. What was 2/- worth in 1953?</P>
    <P>The health services today are much more comprehensive than those envisaged when that statement was made.  When money is available we should not have this niggardly approach to such a very important matter as the health of our people. These services are for those who are less well off.  One has, of course, to exercise discretion.  There is a limit to expenditure.  No matter how desirable a project may be one must wait until the necessary money is available to implement a new service or improve an existing one.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that health services should be financed out of taxation.  Were that to happen administration and control would be taken over by the central Government. There would not be the same personal approach that we have now.  The rates are paid by those who benefit.  At the moment we find it difficult enough to contain the demand for more services. We pay something like 50 per cent of the cost of the services.  If we could demand services without having to pay anything from local rates towards those services I dread the thought of what the demands would be if the entire cost were administered by faceless men in some Government Department.  The cost of the services would snowball all over the country.</P>
    <P>I have listened to, or read, most of the speeches here.  All aspects have been emphasised and dealt with. Voluntary workers are doing magnificent work.  Nobody knows that better than I do.  We have some wonderful voluntary services in Cork for mentally and physically handicapped children and for the aged.  Patients are visited daily in their own homes.  The demand for services like these will always be there and the recipients are most grateful.  No stigma of charity attaches to this service.  An old person very often needs companionship more than food or even warmth.  We have experience of very good homes run by religious, homes in which, one would think at any rate, the aged should be glad to end their days, but they hanker <Col N="973" /> after familiar surroundings, even though those surroundings may mean living in a thatched cottage without sewerage, water, electric light, or any other amenity.  Keeping them in their homes is the best treatment of all.  The trend now is towards that policy and the result is that we have in Cork shortened the institutional stay of the chronically ill over the last 12 months. The old people are now visited in their own homes.  There are &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; and other services provided for them.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in our approach to our health services.  If we had unlimited finance and provided every service asked for there would still be people complaining and asking for more services.  That is human nature. That has been the experience in countries which are wealthier than we are, countries spending far more on health services than we do.  Human nature is insatiable.  We must face that fact.  All we can do is that which lies within our means.</P>

      <P>One of the most unfortunate remarks ever made by a Minister for Health was that made by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was canvassing support for the 1953 Health Act.  He met the members of the different local authorities throughout the country and told them that the proposed health services would cost no more than 2/- in the £ on the rates. It was, no doubt, a correct assessment at the time but it has been widely and consistently misunderstood over the years and it illustrates something I want to develop.  Dr. Ryan, then Minister for Health, was referring at the time to the services available prior to the 1953 Health Act and to the cost of new services in so far as they related to personal health services under the 1953 Act.  He took a costing &mdash; it was a correct costing &mdash; and said that these new services would cost the ratepayer no more than 2/- in the £. I do not say it turned out to be precisely accurate and exact but it was a pretty good assessment at that time as to what health services were likely to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that he made that statement is recalled particularly during <Col N="974" /> not the mating but the rating season, when the cost of the health services are brought home to each ratepayer throughout the country.  At that stage every year people recall with some annoyance, frequently with frustration, the headlines set some 17 years ago when these services were first canvassed throughout the country at 2/-in the £.  But what is important in this connection is that in the past 17 years most people interested in this problem have learned by experience.</P>
    <P>I think all political Parties have learned.  All of them have benefited by their learning, except one, and that is the Fianna Fáil Party who have not garnered any new ideas or new policies from what has emerged from the debates during the past 17 years.  It is clear there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the Deputies who occupy these benches for the moment and those who occupy the Fianna Fáil benches on the very serious question of how to finance the health services.</P>
    <P>We cannot but agree that within our resources we have the obligation and the duty to provide the highest possible standard of health services for our citizens who are sick, disabled and in difficulties.  Nobody disagrees on that. There may be disagreement as to whether a particular service, a particular hospital or arrangement of hospitals, may be required in one place as opposed to another, but we are all clear that we should benefit from scientific advancement in other countries, that we should in so far as we possibly can &mdash; and it is not a question of cost &mdash; try to have the best standard of health services that money can buy.  On that there is no dispute.</P>
    <P>Where the disagreement arises is in relation to the manner in which these services should be paid for.  Under the Health Act and under the financial provisions for the payment of Health Act services, the Government &mdash; they have been Fianna Fáil Governments over the years &mdash; have been consistently tied to the one simple approach that the health service must be paid for pound by pound from local rates and from central taxation &mdash; half and half &mdash; and that in this way only shall we finance our health services.  That is an <Col N="975" /> approach which is old hat and old fashioned but it has been the consistent Fianna Fáil approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this: the fundamental objection still remains which was raised from these benches 12 years ago and which has been repeated time and time again, year after year.  It is that the exigencies of the local rating situation in each local authority area has a decisive effect on the standard of our health services.  Of course, no Minister for Health worth his salt &mdash; I am glad to say none of them has fallen down on this &mdash; would allow a local authority to arrive at the position in which, merely because of the impact on rates, an essential service required for the assistance of sick people would be refused.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that efforts in this direction have not been made.  They have been made but the settled approach of Ministers for Health and the Department has been that these services must be provided, so there has been a situation in which the Government, correctly in this respect, laid down a standard of health services and insisted that these services be put into operation; and down in the local authority area these services have to be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we have gimmicks like the recent circular the Minister for Health sent out to health authorities throughout the country telling them to watch very carefully how they were pricing <Col N="976" /> and costing their health services.  It was a gimmick and it was intended to be nothing else.  It was an attempt to build up a kind of window-dressing to the effect that local authorities had the initiative and the responsibility in this matter, which they have not got.</P>
    <P>These services having to be provided for, with costs going up and the money having to be found by a charge on local rates, then, of course, bedlam breaks out.  People then find that the rates rise, on an average this year of something like 11/- in the £ throughout the country, attributable to health services.  There are mass meetings and protests and the local representatives are approached and put in the dock because this or that rate may have to be struck.</P>
    <P>But the responsibility is not theirs. The fault lies in the daft policy that is behind the present health legislation and health schemes.  Why&mdash;I hope the Minister will explain it&mdash;should we continue to finance our health services in a manner that has been rejected by most other countries?  It is the kind of thing they did in the Victorian days when they abused the poor rate in order to save the privileged from the burden of taxation.  They put it on the poor rate.</P>
    <P>Today, this discarded mentality still imbues the financial provisions of our health services.  We reject it.  Apparently Fianna Fáil still retain this approach and as long as they retain it, when our rating season comes each year people will remember the 2/- in the £ and with bitterness the impact on them in local taxation of the cost of these services.  Of course many of the ratepayers who are protesting are crying out : &ldquo;Why should we be taxed some 40/- in the £&rdquo;&mdash; in Donegal it is something of that order&mdash;&ldquo;to finance a service in which we are automatically deprived of any opportunity to share?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for them, but there are landholders throughout this country whose valuation exceeds the statutory limit, and they are excluded from any benefit under these services. They have to pay for them.  There are people who are running very small businesses whose income exceeds the statutory limit.  They have to pay for <Col N="977" /> these services and they are not entitled to benefit from them.  Of course they protest, of course they express their annoyance, but the system continues.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I will say again&mdash;because this I anticipate is the last opportunity I will have of saying it in this Dáil: I hope I will have the responsibility of doing something about it in the next Dáil &mdash; that it is possible so to organise our health services, with a sensible approach on the principles of social insurance, so that with a small weekly charge imposed on the head of every family an insurance fund could be created, removed entirely from the exigencies of the local rates and not dependent in any way on the difficulties that arise from different problems in different parts of the country, a fund which would finance expanded and comprehensive health services.</P>
    <P>I have said that can be done.  I have studied the way in which it could be done.  I have benefited from seeing how it has been done in many other countries. When I raised the details here in a Dáil motion some years ago, the Government set up a Select Committee&mdash;I suppose to try to prove me wrong&mdash;and that Select Committee sat and heard evidence.  It was led by the then Minister for Finance who was anxious to establish, if you please, by calling witnesses, that there was no demand for an improvement in our health services, that there was no demand for a choice of doctor, that there was no demand for home nursing, and no demand for the various improvements that we had advocated from these benches.</P>
    <P>Of course, when he called witnesses he got his answer very quickly.  Towards the end of that Select Committee I handed in a detailed memorandum dealing merely with the general medical services.  I handed in a detailed memorandum showing percisely how our general medical services could be organised, precisely how they should be costed, precisely what it would mean to the head of every family&mdash;something around 2/- a week.  That memorandum is before the Minister at this moment I have no doubt.  Certainly it is available in his Department.  I challenge the Minister and I challenge <Col N="978" /> the Fianna Fáil Party to demonstrate now any way in which the details of that scheme could not be fully operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister plenty of notice.  He has all his officers available to him.  I challenge him to demonstrate in Dáil Éireann how any detail of the Fine Gael proposal could be found to be unworkable. That is a fair challenge.  I want to go further and say that while this was not the object of our proposal a side effect would have been that for the past ten to 12 years the cost of the personal health services would have been removed from the rates, and they would have been financed from an insurance fund, and much of the present disquiet and difficulty and clamour about the rates throughout the land would not have occurred.</P>
      <P>I am aware that since the time this memorandum was prepared the costings will have changed.  I have no doubt that the costing of the weekly insurance payment as indicated at that time will have increased.  Money has fallen in value.  Prices have increased and costs of medical services have changed. Providing you get away from the straitjacket of the Fianna Fáil health policy &mdash;this you must be free to do&mdash;once you can get away from that, once you accept this principle that people should when they are well pay for the day they or their neighbours are ill, you can make progress and you can advance. If you continue with an organisation of health services which is aimed purely at the day when people are ill you get nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services we have at the moment are designed to ensure that the patient ends up in hospital.  Our health services at the moment are a conduit pipe from the sick man's house into a hospital bed.  There has been no development of adequate home medical aid.  There has been no development <Col N="979" /> of an adequate kind in relation to proper home nursing.  We are still concerned with providing through designated doctors, not nominated by the patient, services in which they look at the person, take his temperature, telephone for an ambulance and cart him into hospital.  The result has been that the development of a comprehensive medical service is as far removed today as it was some 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>I assert that the present cost of personal health services can without <Col N="980" /> difficulty be removed as a charge from the rates and become the responsibility, easily discharged, of heads of families. That is one end of it.  I also assert that as a result of a new approach to the health services the cost in our general hospitals could be dramatically reduced. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26th March, 1969.</P>

      <P>The gross national product figures referred to in the question are averages of two sets of figures, one based on output data and the other based on expenditure data.  Both sets of figures and the averages for 1958-1967 are shown in Table 1, page 3, of <Col N="859" /> National Income and Expenditure, 1967.  Corresponding figures for 1947-1957, based on expenditure data only, are shown in Table B. 6, page 94, of the same publication.  Gross national product figures, based on output data, are not available, however, for 1947-1957. Consequently, it is not possible to give the average of figures based on output and expenditure data for these years.  It would be a very onerous task to compile figures for gross national product at constant market prices, based on output data, for these years.</P>
