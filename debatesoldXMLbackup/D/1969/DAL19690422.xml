      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a request for the provision of an automanual exchange at Castlerea, but I regret that I cannot accede to it.  Under fully automatic conditions, with subscriber trunk dialling facilities, the assistance of operators will be needed for only a small percentage of calls, such as &ldquo;personal&rdquo; calls.  In planning the network, very careful consideration was given to the number and location of automanual centres, of which there will be sixteen. The automanual centre serving Castlerea will be Athlone.  When Castlerea exchange is converted to automatic working in a few years time the telephonists employed will be absorbed into other exchanges.  Every effort will be made to provide alternative employment where it is needed for the small number of male night staff, but if it is not possible to do so, compensation will be payable under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, to those eligible.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive recommendations on the reform of the structure of agriculture in the member States of the EEC were included in a memorandum submitted last December by the European Commission to the EEC Council of Ministers.  It is intended that in the light of the views expressed on these by the member States and by interested authorities and organisations in the Community, the Commission will in due course formulate definitive proposals for submission to the Council.  At its meeting on 28th January the Council of Ministers agreed on a procedure for having the recommendations examined by the Community's institutions.  This examination is likely to take some time and it is not possible at this stage to say what measures may ultimately be proposed by the Commission for consideration by the Council.  My Department is keeping a close watch on developments <Col N="1829" /> in so far as they may affect Irish interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the allegations contained in current Press reports that the sale of fresh cream is still in the hands of the old Cream Exporters Association are mistaken and that the Cream Exporters Association has been wound up and its affairs transferred to An Bord Bainne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Dairy Produce (Marketing) Act of 1961, the Minister assigned to An Bord Bainne with effect as from 1st March, 1964, the function of exporting cream.  That is the actual situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that there has been in existence, with the approval of the Ministers for Agriculture, an association of creameries with a committee which have functioned as the sole exporters of fresh cream from this country to Great Britain?  As far as I am aware, that body continued to function until the very recent past and An Bord Bainne did not concern itself with the export of fresh cream.  It has been alleged in public that this is the reason why our producers have failed to retain their fair share of an expanding market for fresh cream in Great Britain.  Has the Minister's attention been directed recently to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual answer to the question is that there is a longer story connected with this and perhaps another question on the lines suggested by the Deputy in his supplementaries might be put down and then I shall give the full information.  The reply to the question here is, as I have said, that the responsibility has rested with An Bord Bainne since 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister <Col N="1830" /> does not wish in any way to mislead us but is it not a fact that whatever responsibilities may have been placed on An Bord Bainne, An Bord Bainne have, in fact, delegated to this existing body the function of handling cream exports?  Surely the tenor of this question is really designed to elicit from the Minister a statement of policy as to whether he regards the continued delegation of these powers as a desirable user of the general responsibility with which An Bord Bainne is charged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that I have given the reply to the question as asked by Deputy Clinton which was whether I would consider making arrangements for responsibility for cream sales and exports to be transferred to An Bord Bainne.  The factual position is that since 1964 this has been the case.  The allegation is a matter that I feel would be much more explicitly dealt with here by way of a reply if a question on those lines were to be put down next week or some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that if the Minister is asked if he is aware of this delegation by An Bord Bainne and if he will make a statement on it, he will feel free to deal more comprehensively and, perhaps, less disingenuously with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of opinion which we can only get around to after the event.  Yes, I would welcome such a question.</P>

    <P>14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether with a view to popularising fish as a regular dietary item he will remove restrictions from imports of frozen fish fingers, supplies of which are at present almost wholly absorbed by supermarket chains leaving inadequate and irregular supplies available for rural retail distributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The restriction on the import of frozen fish fingers is maintained to protect the home market for Irish fish.  Supplies are imported under licence and the level of imports is kept constantly under review.  In fact in 1968 the quantity licensed was increased by 50 per cent over 1967.  The distribution of imported supplies as between the various types of retail outlets is a matter between the retailers and the importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree with me that the desirable thing is to popularise fish as an ordinary item of diet particularly in rural areas where the consumption of fish has been traditionally almost entirely confined to Friday?  With the emergence of convenience foods would he not think that the longer-sighted policy would be to make this sort of commodity freely available so that as the market expands there would be a base for domestic production of a commodity of this kind which no domestic unit can afford to produce at present owing to the restricted market largely resulting from the quantitative controls which are being used by the supermarket chains effectively to withhold supplies of this comestible from rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation, as the Deputy probably understands, is that the licences are granted to&mdash;I think&mdash; three firms altogether and granted to them because of the fact that they are three firms who engage and have been engaged in the wholesale distribution <Col N="1832" /> of frozen home-landed fish.  In other words it is tied to those with that qualification which, I think generally speaking, is quite a proper thing to do. As far as quantities are concerned, last year we increased the quantity licensed by 50 per cent over the previous year and so long as the quantities requested do not endanger the disposal of home landings then I am not constrained to restrict them unduly.  I suggest that if there is complaint as to the manner in which the supplies imported are distributed it is a matter that could, perhaps, be taken up with the importers by trade organisations such as RGDATA or some similar body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would look into the aspect of the problem to which I have directed his attention, bearing in mind that the popularisation of fish generally benefits the whole industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Should it not be the aim to develop our Irish fisheries and thus obviate the necessity for the importation of fish fingers from abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that quite substantial progress has been made in this direction particularly with the installation at a number of our ports, especially western ports, of ice plants and refrigerated storage.  This is very much a prerequisite to any real effort at supplying in a regular way the needs and demands of our domestic markets.  Certainly, as and when fish become available in the quantities and on the days on which it is needed I think with these installations and the greater availability of ice from these plants we can, and indeed we are making inroads on the market here and I hope this will continue to a greater degree as time goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the advent of PAYE the number of civil servants engaged in the collection of income tax was 141.  There were also 57 collectors of taxes who were not civil servants. They were employed on an annual contract basis and engaged their own staff.</P>
      <P>This system was changed and replaced by a central collection branch staffed exclusively by civil servants. The number of staff employed on collection at present is 382 but they are also responsible for turnover tax and wholesale tax.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to add that the number of persons paying income tax has increased from 220,000 in 1959-60, the year prior to the introduction of PAYE, to over 600,000 at present.</P>

I would like the Minister to bear that in mind when he is framing his Budget Statement for 7th May.  I asked a similar question last year but he did not do anything about it.</P>

      <P>The <i>Encyclopaedia of Ireland</i> was, in accordance with the arrangements for providing libraries in all schools, distributed free to 4,371 primary schools, 595 secondary schools and 278 vocational schools at a total cost of £26,220.  It was not distributed to universities or any other bodies.  The basis for the selection of the encyclopaedia was simply that there is no other such publication dealing with Ireland.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree, even if there is no other encyclopaedia, that this one should not have been issued as it does not give a fair and just assessment of history from 1916 to 1940?  The Minister stated here last week that a team of cultural and artistic people were responsible for examining this book before it was issued.  How can he claim that they are cultural or artistic if they continue the partisan and indeed mulish attitude of <Col N="1849" /> the present Government of not giving credit where credit is due or fair recognition to people who built up this State?  Would the Minister not further agree that due recognition should have been given and has not been given in this encyclopaedia to men like Collins, Griffith, O'Higgins, Hogan, W.T. Cosgrave, Mulcahy, Costello, MacEoin and others?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to the first question is in the negative.  The land bond system of payment for lands acquired by the Land Commission has generally speaking worked satisfactorily down the years.  The Deputy will be aware that the Land Act, 1965, removed the restrictive application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and purchases for cash in the open market are now open to all the purposes of the Land Acts. In the financial year just ended a record amount of £410,000 cash was provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>The question probably refers to a fire at Cloonfad East, Ballinlough Forest on 5/4/69 which destroyed 65 acres of young plantation. An assessment of the value of the area destroyed has not been completed.  A full investigation of the cause of the fire is being made by the gardaí.</P>
      <P>My Department uses a system of forest fire patrols during the fire danger season and gets ready co-operation from the gardaí and the county fire authorities.  They also seek to provide water supplies where this is possible in forest areas.  In the present case there was a stream convenient to the fire area but the long dry spell of weather had dried it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain the need for the Money Resolution. The provisions of Part VII of the Bill allowing certain appeals to be made to the Supreme Court involve the granting of free legal aid to the defendants concerned under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  It is envisaged that the number of cases that would need to be referred to the Supreme Court under these provisions would be very small and that accordingly the expenses involved in the granting of legal aid would not be significant.</P>
      <P>The repeals provided for in the First Schedule to the Bill include the repeal of provisions in different enactments whereby local authorities may be liable to pay witnesses' expenses in certain criminal cases.  In practice, the Exchequer has, for many years, accepted almost the entire liability for these expenses, the payments&mdash;from the Law Charges Vote&mdash;being made in some cases direct to the witnesses and in other cases by way of recoupment to local authorities.  Exact figures are not available in respect of payments made by local authorities and not recouped, but it may be taken that the total for all local authorities would not exceed £2,000 per annum.  It is because of monetary commitments as far as the Bill is concerned that the Money Resolution is necessary.</P>

      <P>The amendment is, in effect, an amendment to section 28, which relates to meetings <i>et cetera</i> in the vicinity of Leinster House, and the other will be a consequential drafting amendment.  I do not want to anticipate the discussion on section 28 which, as I said in my Second Reading speech, is a section that relates to this House itself and which therefore is of special concern to Members on all sides of the House.  I therefore hope to hear the considered opinions of Members when we come to that section.</P>
      <P>At the moment, however, we are concerned with one small point which I, at all events, regard only as a point of clarification.  Section 28 is restricted in its effect to meetings which are, so to speak, directed at Leinster House. I do not think that a meeting in a building would have to be included. The words used in the section, of their very nature, would have affected only open-air meetings.  However, some people seem to have been worried about this and, without prejudice to what may be decided when we come to discuss section 28, we can now agree to make it clear that indoor meetings are explicitly excluded from the section. This is the effect of the amendment we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously regards this as a small point, but in the minds of many people it was a point of considerable importance. The Minister is doing the right thing in moving this amendment exempting buildings from the application of section 28, and I should like to express the hope that the Minister's approach to this matter, which, as I say, in the eyes of many people was a matter of <Col N="1862" /> importance, will run through the remaining sections of the Bill.  If the Minister approaches it in that way, we may be able to make some headway. It is a pity that a misunderstanding should have been created by the wording of section 28 taken in conjunction with the definition section, which defines &ldquo;a public place&rdquo; as &ldquo;any place (including a building) to which the public have access&rdquo; and that the kind of atmosphere created by that definition should have been there.  The Minister is remedying the situation in regard to meetings and processions which, as he puts it, are directed at Leinster House, in that buildings are excluded.  The position now will be that, if section 28 is accepted with the amendment and the definition of &ldquo;a public place&rdquo; in section 28 is accepted, at least we have reached the stage where it is clear that the only meetings or processions or demonstrations which are contemplated by the Bill will be those held within a certain distance of these buildings and held in the open air, and that is an improvement.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 1, I want to sound a note here which may not be a popular one but in respect of which I have a deep sense of public duty and a deep conviction.  This amendment is designed to exclude from the provision about meetings or processions deemed to be a challenge to public order any meeting held in a building.  In my considered judgment there is an attempt being made at this time to use this country as a proving ground for communist riot tactics.  You will observe that I say &ldquo;to use this country&rdquo;.  They have made no serious effort in the Republic towards that end, because the Government of the Republic, whether we agree with it politically or not, whether it be from the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, stands on a rock of moral authority conferred upon it by a freely elected Parliament which chooses it and establishes it as the Government of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is a situation obtaining in Northern Ireland where the Government has no real moral authority, as a result of which mob riot tactics for the purpose of undermining law are being tried out.  If I know these gentlemen&mdash; and I think I do know them pretty well&mdash;and if in an effort to meet a genuine liberal opinion, and I use the word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; in its highest sense, we exclude buildings from a proviso designed to prevent meetings organised to precipitate riot, we will suddenly <Col N="1864" /> find ourselves confronted with a situation in which a public meeting is summoned to a room designed to hold 100 persons and on that room, by careful pre-arrangement, there converges a mob of 1,000.  What do we do with the 900 in the overflow?  Are they an illegal meeting?  Or can they say to the Garda Síochána: &ldquo;We have come to attend a meeting in a building&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a &ldquo;quare&rdquo; one.  It is astonishing how, on a small amendment like this, a great evil can grow. Because an unfortunate chief superintendent is faced on the instant with a decision&mdash;his instructions are that there is to be no open air public meeting in these circumstances&mdash;he says to the gentleman in the red beret, who is organising operations with a bullhorn in one hand and a pamphlet, &ldquo;Thoughts of Mao&rdquo;, in the other: &ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. So-and-So.  You may not gather to the tune of 100 in the building and 900 in the public street because that is not a meeting in a building.  It is a riot in the street.&rdquo; The gentleman in the red beret thereupon says: &ldquo;All right.  We are going to sit down.  Whereupon the chief superintendent with a body of our neighbours, who are members of the Garda Síochána, proceeds to move them on. Now begins the dialectic.  The Garda are challenged to move them.  The Garda proceed to move them and, within 40 minutes, there are 5,000 people gathered in College Green to protest not for the primary purpose of the meeting which first was assembled in the small and inadequate building carefully chosen, but to protest against police brutality, and the gentleman with the red beret and the bullhorn is in the middle of the demonstration in College Green protesting against police brutality.  You see, Sir, Mrs. Red Beret is in the Gallery already.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> Now I was reared and brought up a radical liberal.  I was brought up to claim my right to parade it in any town in Ireland, whether it was in the jurisdiction of the Republic or under the rigged Government of Stormont.  I have repeatedly asserted that right and, when I was told by the RUC that it was by their grace and favour I was to proceed in open procession down the main street of Lisburn, I told them to go and take a running jump at themselves; I was walking down the main street of Lisburn by virtue of my constitutional right to walk in orderly procession in any town in Ireland and not to forget that they were the paid servants of the people and their only function was properly to regulate the traffic so that the procession at the head of which I was walking could proceed in an orderly and proper manner.  I would say the same to any chief superintendent in the Republic.</P>
    <P>But I want to ask you, A Cheann Comhairle, in order to meet the views of people who are actuated by the highest motives, are we to open the doors to the gentlemen who are concerned to undermine the authority of the constitutional Government of this country?  What so many forget is that the day Red Beret blows his bullhorn, that is news.  You are not news, a Cheann Comhairle; I am not news; the Minister is not news.  The louder he roars and the more noise he makes, the more Telefís Éireann will concentrate their cameras upon him and the more his bullhorn will be carried into every home in Ireland.  Are we going to facilitate him to carry the message into every home in Ireland that the members of the Garda Síochána, carrying out their orders, are engaged in police brutality?  Or are we going to make it manifest and clear, right from the word go, that the police force of this State will be deployed in this Republic to protect the right of any person, peacefully and lawfully, to demonstrate anywhere?  But also the whole forces of a legitimate Government are going to be implacably deployed to assert that mob law will never rule in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister to look at <Col N="1866" /> this amendment again.  Will he be so good then as to tell me what will be his instruction to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána if information is conveyed to him that a meeting is being summoned for a purpose prohibited on the ground that it is a danger to public order in a room designed to hold 100 people and that 1,000 people are being summoned to it so that 900 will be asked to move on and not assemble in the street and their instruction then is to follow Red Beret with his bullhorn to another site in Dublin, becoming the hard core thereby of a demonstration of 5,000, the bulk of whom will be wellintentioned, simple people, to protest against police brutality?  I think this is what the Minister forgets; if there is to be an exemption in respect of meetings held in buildings from the general provisions of this Bill, then it ought to be made manifest at this stage that that does not permit the calling of meetings of 1,000 persons to an apartment designed to hold 100 and that what might be described as an overflow, but is in fact an organised riot <i>in potentia</i>, will not be tolerated on the ground that 900, or 1,000, cannot be made to fit in a building designed to hold 100 and that nobody believes that a building designed to hold 100 was hired in good faith by those who had summoned 1,000 to attend the meeting.</P>

      <P>Very good.  The second point I want to make, as far as Deputy Dillon's fears are concerned, is that this is not dealing with public meetings in general.  This amendment is dealing only with the specific provisions in section 28 concerning meetings at or near Leinster House itself.  While I would agree largely with what the Deputy has to say about public meetings in general, I want him to understand that this has the restricted interpretation of dealing with what the House thinks should be done as far as meetings in the vicinity of Leinster House under section 28 are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I understand Deputy Dillon's point, if there was a meeting in a house and some 900 went out on the street, that would be a different proposition.  Amendment No. 1 is concerned with section 28, namely, with the provisions that the Dáil feels should be laid down about meetings at Leinster House and within the confines of section 28.  It was for that reason that I felt we should exclude meetings held indoors in buildings.  There may be many different types of meetings that would not be directed at Leinster House that could come within section 28.  We are thinking in the limited provisions about meetings held or directed at Leinster House under section 28.  It is only in that connotation that we <Col N="1868" /> think this amendment should not affect public meetings in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to press the Minister in this matter.  I think he has missed my point altogether.  I do not believe Communist inspired demonstrations are <i>bona fide.</i> I believe they are trying out riot tactics in the Six Counties because they believe the Government is not morally equipped to control.  Now, the Minister is excluding meetings held in buildings from the provision, prohibiting meetings directed against Leinster House. The point I want to impress on the Minister is this.  A Communistorganised group in this city summons a meeting to a room designed to hold 100 persons but, in fact, they call up 1,000 persons.  Now, they pack the room but there is an overflow from the room of 900 people outside.  The chief superintendent who is on duty comes up and says to the overflow: &ldquo;You cannot meet here. This violates the provisions designed to protect Leinster House from demonstrations directed against it&rdquo;.  They say, in effect: &ldquo;Under amendment No. 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill, a meeting in a building is excluded from that prohibition under which you propose to move and we have come here for a meeting in a building.  But the meeting has assumed such a proportion that the building will not accommodate it&rdquo;. The chief superintendent has to take a decision there and then.  What is he to do?  Is he required by his instructions to allow the meeting&mdash;which is permitted in a building&mdash;to develop into a meeting of 900 people outside the building?  While he is trying to reach a prudent resolution of that dilemma, a gentleman with a red beret and a bullhorn comes up to attack, abuse and insult him and possibly golf balls with studded nails in them begin to fly from the back of the crowd against the gardaí.  Eventually, the chief superintendent decides: &ldquo;I shall act before this situation gets out of control.&rdquo; The 900 gentlemen proceed to sit down and say: &ldquo;We are attending the meeting on the road but we are just the overflow from the meeting being held in the room&rdquo; whereupon the chief superintendent says to the <Col N="1869" /> gardaí: &ldquo;Clear the street: we have to pull these fellows back and to let the traffic pass&rdquo;.  Red beret and his bullhorn at once adjourn to another site and start a demonstration against police brutality because, he says, the gardaí are depriving him of a right which Dáil Éireann, deliberately, by amendment, reserved for them to attend a meeting in a room or in a building in the vicinity of Leinster House.  By this exclusion, we are putting on the gardaí, I think, possibly an impossible task.</P>
      <P>The Minister is an experienced legal practitioner.  Can an overflow from a meeting in a building be described as a meeting in a building within the terms of this Bill as amended, if we pass amendment No. 1?  I think an overflow meeting is part of a meeting in the building.  You cannot take a chalk line and draw it across the threshold of the door of any building and say: &ldquo;Anybody on one side of that chalk line is at a meeting within the building but anyone whose heel is across the chalk line is outside the building and therefore does not enjoy the exemption conferred by amendment No. 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill.&rdquo; That is a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> What I am putting to the Minister and to the House is that I believe the international Communist Party are trying out tactics in this country and one of the first tactics they will try out is to ask: &ldquo;What is an overflow meeting?  Is it exempt?  We shall certainly claim it is and, if the chief superintendent on duty denies that claim, within half an hour we shall have a demonstration going in the city centre to protest against police brutality.  We shall have Telefís Éireann there and we shall have the story told in every kitchen in Ireland that the Garda Síochána are brutes, savages and beat the people up.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undoubted fact is that, as a result of the deplorable situation in the Six Counties, Ireland will be used as a proving ground for riot tactics.  I should like the Minister to face that problem and to answer me as if he were advising a client.  Does an overflow from a meeting in a building constitute part of that meeting or does it not?  That is the question the chief superintendent will have to resolve when faced with <Col N="1870" /> the carefully organised dilemma which will confront him in an event such as I have envisaged for the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say only a few words on this.  I find myself in an unusual position because, as I have said, I think the Minister is doing the right thing in bringing in this amendment but, on the other hand, the arguments put forward by Deputy Dillon are extremely weighty and forceful and obviously should not be lightly disregarded. As I see the position here, we have to be very careful about the entire Bill.  Deputy Dillon will agree that there is nothing about which the Communist elements to which he referred can make more capital than if this House introduces legislation which they regard as provocative and as interfering with long established personal rights and liberties.</P>
      <P>With the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in section 2 which not merely captures a public place in the ordinary meaning of that term or indeed in the meaning given to it by previous legislation of this House, such as the various Road Traffic Acts but which could be extended so as to include a person's private house, one of the dangers about the Bill as drafted is that the question of provocation would be capable of being raised in a way in which the Minister, the Government or any Deputy in this House would find it very hard to resist.</P>
      <P>There you would have a complaint being made that the personal liberty of the individual was simply being trodden on by the Legislature, and we have to guard against that.  In addition to that, the amendment relates not to the general provisions of the Bill but only to the provisions contained in section 28.  The provisions contained in that section relate to public meetings, processions or demonstrations held within half a mile of Leinster House which are calculated to influence or to affect the deliberations of the Members of the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, you have the case put by Deputy Dillon with very great force and clarity, and I think he has made a case which the Minister must answer.  To my mind, the answer to it <Col N="1871" /> is that the Bill should mean what it states, and that if the proposed exemption of buildings from the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; means what it says, it must be interpreted as meaning that buildings are exempt &mdash; that public meetings held in a building are exempt and that the provision does not exempt the type of overflow Deputy Dillon referred to.  That is simply my own view of it.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon is quite right in seeking the Minister's view, but the point I wish to make is that in the long run the Minister's view, Deputy Dillon's view or my view does not matter.  What matters is what we put into the Bill and that is what the courts must have regard to when they come to interpret the Act if they have to interpret it.  Once the point has been raised, as it has been by Deputy Dillon, the Minister must watch the position carefully.  I think he is right, for the reasons given, to exclude buildings but he must make it crystal clear what he means by doing that in the context of the case made by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>That can be done if the Minister has another look at the wording of the amendment.  It could be made quite clear by means of the Minister's amendment that what are being exempted are meetings within the actual confines of a building.  While preserving the terms of the amendment the Minister wants to make, the Garda authorities could be put in a position of having to deal with the kind of case Deputy Dillon has referred to; but we have also got to take into account that the section the Minister is amending deals not merely with public meetings held in a building but also with demonstrations which are held in a public place.</P>
    <P>A demonstration under section 28 may be by one or two people.  A demonstration by a single individual is captured by the terms of section 28. There is every reason to guard against demonstrations even by a single individual within a short distance of Leinster House when either House is sitting if that demonstration is calculated to intimidate or to influence or to affect the deliberations of Members, <Col N="1872" /> but a demonstration held by one individual in a building other than Leinster House obviously cannot affect in any intimidatory way the deliberations or the decisions of Members of either House.  When you get down to a demonstration of that sort, consisting of a single individual or a handful of individuals holding their demonstration possibly in a private house, possibly in the vicinity of Leinster House, which cannot be capable of affecting deliberations here, I see no reason why that should be brought within section 28.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have to do here a kind of balancing act.  On the one hand, we have to avoid being tagged with the label of repressive legislation of a provocative sort which would be very much grist to the mill of the people Deputy Dillon spoke about.  On the other hand, we obviously have to be careful that loopholes are not left in the Bill to enable the kind of riot trouble to which Deputy Dillon referred to be sparked off on the pretext that because there is an overflow meeting that kind of demonstration is to be exempt from the provisions of section 28.  As I say, the Minister must give his views on this and must look again at the amendment he is proposing to the definition section to see if the possibility to which Deputy Dillon referred cannot be dealt with by means of the amendment.  Personally I think it can be dealt with if it is made clear by means of the amendment that the exemption relates only to those actually in a building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting fouled up in an awful lot of words over this amendment.  I am as much opposed to mob rule as anybody in this House and I do not care whether the mob rule is that of Communism or Fascism&mdash;there is just as much chance of the one as there is of the other&mdash; but I do not believe that as things stand at present there is the remotest possibility of the numbers referred to by Deputy Dillon in his example being interested in creating a mob to do those things in this city.  One of the dangers in the method by which this is being discussed here is that while the <Col N="1873" /> amendment was put in for the purpose of lessening the restrictions it does appear from most of the discussion that some Deputies at least are anxious to make it more restrictive.  I believe we should not, except with very good reason, restrict the right of people if they want to demonstrate.  Peaceful demonstrations should not be interfered with in any way.  We have had examples outside the gates of this House of, in the main, peaceful demonstrations although admittedly some pretty noisy ones.  I do not think they did any damage.  The only damage that was done was when somebody was stupid enough to order their arrest.  From the students, to the NFA and to whatever they were from time to time, they were peaceful until somebody arrested them.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister having introduced the Bill and having had a look at it decided after the Second Reading that he would relax it in one place and that was in regard to the question of holding meetings inside a building.  The Minister is right in this. If he is going to impose a restriction it is ridiculous to suggest that a peaceful meeting in one of the hotels around here should, for one reason or another, be precluded from being held under this Bill.  I have a suspicion that a lot of sections of the Special Powers Act under a different heading are being introduced in portions of this Bill.  I do not want to see that happening and I do not think this House wants to see that happening.  My suggestion to the Minister is that a meeting within a building is exactly that&mdash;a meeting within a building&mdash;and if people congregate outside they are not part of that meeting.  I am a layman and I cannot give a legal interpretation of this but either they are inside at the meeting or they are not.  I would prefer if the restrictions were not put down at all.  If there are going to be restrictions let us have them within a building and do not try to tie it up with words by which, eventually, it will be almost impossible to operate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this question in an agnostic frame of mind for a moment.  Why is the amendment being introduced? <Col N="1874" /> That is what I want to know first of all to enable myself to see if it is proper or not.  There is a lot to be said for the view which Deputy Tully has put forward that we should let anybody who likes demonstrate outside the House but there is the other point of view which is largely taken from British practice that you should not have the Houses of Parliament subjected to demonstrations of mobs outside it.  That idea emanated from the British House of Commons, that there should not be any processions or demonstrations outside or near Westminster.  It may be that it is a proper thing to prevent processions and demonstrations which may adversely affect people coming to the Dáil to do their duty.  That may be a good thing.  It is arguable.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that it is a good thing and that something like section 28 is desirable, that it is desirable that there should not be demonstrations outside the Houses of Parliament and that Deputies should not be interfered with coming into the House.  But, why exempt buildings within half a mile? What is bothering me is what is the necessity for this amendment.  There can be a greater nuisance from the tops of the houses opposite this House than from the street.  Every roof in Kildare Street or Molesworth Street can under this section be the subject of exemption.  You can have the greatest collection of communists, fascists, ratepayers, farmers or any other group spread over some of the roofs in Kildare Street kicking up a frightful row, doing all sorts of depredations and making all sorts of noises and effectively intimidating some Deputies or Senators.  Therefore, what is the point?</P>
      <P>I can see Deputy O'Higgins's point that you can have a nice private house and a nice private meeting in which you can let off steam about Deputies and politicians and express all the rubbish that we listen to every day about politicians but if this Bill is put through there is no doubt that a building includes the roof and you can have noisier assemblies on the roofs of Kildare Street within a few yards of Leinster House than you can have on the street.  Is that intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> In regard to Deputy Dillon's point about whether or not an overflow is a meeting I would not express any opinion except to refer to a ruling in a leading case on trade union law taken some years ago in Cork in reference to Fergusons, the hairdressers, who had a trade dispute and who were picketed outside the premises.  An action was brought in the High Court which did not succeed to restrain them from picketing outside on the grounds that the picket was on private property.  The basis of this was that if you own a premises adjoining a public thoroughfare you own a certain distance on to the public thoroughfare subject to the right of the public to pass.  This may be adding something to Deputy Dillon's point that in Kildare Street anybody outside on the footpath is in the building.  There is something therefore in Deputy Dillon's point of view.</P>
    <P>What is the necessity for this amendment?  Is it merely to placate some of these people who seem to be annoying the Minister over these proposals, or is there anything in Deputy O'Higgins's point that it is all right to have private meetings in private houses even though they may be near Leinster House?  Like Deputy Tully I want to make my declaration of faith.  I am against anything within reason that prevents the right of the public to free speech and free assembly.  It is a bad thing from the point of view of principle and we should not erode those principles and constitutional rights unless the public interest imperatively demands it.  While there may be something to be said for preventing demonstrations within a certain distance of Parliament I am not too satisfied that this amendment is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, without going into the rights or wrongs of section 28 and the justification for it, largely, in my view, I think the answer to Deputy Dillon's point&mdash;I shall give my views in regard to Deputy Costello's argument in a moment&mdash;is in the section itself and, without discussing the section, perhaps Deputies who have not recently looked at section 28 (1) should <Col N="1876" /> recall that it provides that &ldquo;any public meeting or procession in or through a public place or, demonstration in a public place by one person or by two or more persons which is (i) at or within one-half of a mile from any building in which a House of the Oireachtas is sitting, and (ii)  calculated to influence or affect the deliberations of such House of the Oireachtas, or the views or actions of any member thereof&rdquo; shall be unlawful.</P>
      <P>Without discussing what may be adopted in section 28 (1), as it stands, in my view, it would cover the overflow to which Deputy Dillon refers.  If, as he said, people made a pretext of having a meeting in their house as he has described and, had it deliberately overflow for the effect of having a public meeting or demonstration, that would, immediately they got on the public street, be caught under subsection (1) to which I have referred. They would become demonstrators or form part of a public meeting or part of a procession in a public place &ldquo;calculated to influence or affect the deliberations of such House of the Oireachtas...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reference to Deputy Costello's argument let me say that the reasons why this amendment was put were twofold. There were those who took the view in representations I received from them that this section as it stands <i>visá-vis</i> Leinster House is too broad and that in the interpretation of what would be&mdash;and I quote from the subsection&mdash;&ldquo;calculated to influence or affect the deliberations of such House of the Oireachtas or the views or actions of any member thereof&rdquo;, you might have grave difficulty with the Garda authorities inasmuch as you could have, to give an example, a half-dozen people getting together for the purpose of promoting some Act of Parliament or repealing it, or for some purpose of that kind, and that they would find themselves caught within the provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a practical point of view, what I am sure Deputies will be concerned with when we come to section 28, is to consider what should be done to keep Parliament immune from demonstrations or interference with the Members <Col N="1877" /> in attending Parliament or efforts to affect their views.  I felt that in view of the danger of people finding themselves, perhaps unwittingly, in some room or at some indoor meeting within half-a-mile of Leinster House, it would be better to remove that uncertainty.  I accept the point made by Deputy O'Higgins that it is most unlikely that a person or a few people inside a room for what I would call a private meeting in a private house or in some private building, would interfere with the deliberations of this House or Members attending it.  That, I suggest, is the way we must think in this connection.</P>
    <P>I know quite well what Deputy Dillon and some others have in mind and I largely share their views.  Public meetings are another matter.  We are dealing here with one specific point, meetings in the vicinity of Leinster House.  Deputy Costello made the point that a man or two could get up on a roof.  I suppose that is so, but I assume that all the people who have buildings in the vicinity of Leinster House are not lunatics and will not allow &ldquo;queers&rdquo; on top of their buildings and will very quickly have them removed.</P>

      <P>Outside the risk to the individual owner I do not anticipate that there would be a real threat to the fundamental purpose for which we have inserted section 28 and what Deputies may suggest should be in the section when we come to it.  Deputy Costello made a point about what I suppose we would call in dealing with the licensing laws&mdash;the curtilage of the premises, how far the ownership goes into the street in a publicly-dedicated highway.  I shall have a look at that.  I do not think that within the ambit of this section when &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is used&mdash;and this I have no doubt has been an expression taken from other statutes&mdash;that a public street or a footpath could be claimed to be&mdash;and this I think is Deputy Costello's point&mdash; private property.  Anyhow, before we come to section 28 I shall have a look at the points made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello.  So far as I am now advised I am satisfied that an <Col N="1878" /> overflow would be caught under this section.  If I find anything to change that view, I shall have another look at it.</P>

I propose to make no further reference to that most eloquent vindication of the argument I seek to make.  I want to remind the House that there is no Deputy in the House who has led more demonstrations through the towns of this country than I have.  I have led demonstrations of 10,000 and 15,000 people through the streets of Dungannon, through the streets of Lurgan, through the streets of Derry, through the streets of Maghera as I have led them through the streets of Raphoe, Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan, Dublin and elsewhere and I have done it not by leave or licence of any police force in the Republic or in the Six Counties.  I have required the police force both in the Republic and in Northern Ireland to make suitable arrangements for the free passage of the orderly demonstrations that I was leading, they having been provided with due notice of our intention lawfully to demonstrate for the things in which we believe.</P>

    <P>I want to put to the Minister an aspect of the situation which, I think, in some measure exists and if I may say so, without appearing to be jealous in any way of my distinguished colleague and ex-Leader, Deputy John A.

I am very well aware that it is not what we mean to say; it is in fact what we say in the language of the statutory legislation which comes from the Oireachtas that the courts will take cognizance of.  It has not infrequently happened that the courts have not understood what we meant to say and we had to amend an Act that we had already passed.  What I am thinking of is the chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána standing in the street suddenly confronted with the question: &ldquo;Do I move them or are they protected by amendment No. 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Supposing that the officer in the Gallery today who heard interruptions had to ask himself: &ldquo;What does the Ceann Comhairle mean me to do?  If I put them out the Ceann Comhairle might complain to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that the garda acted unofficially and, if I do not, the Ceann Comhairle might complain that the garda did not do his job.&rdquo; Fortunately, however, the Ceann Comhairle was here present to say: &ldquo;Remove those who are disturbing our proceedings.&rdquo; Whereupon, the officers of the Garda Síochána and the officials of the House knew what their duty was and they carried it out.  I am trying to ensure that we will not help those who want to discredit the gardaí by leaving an ambiguity so that the gardaí may have to take a snap decision and the snap decision will be this: &ldquo;Shall we lift these fellows off the street?&rdquo; The moment they attempt to do it the man with the red beret and the whiskers whom we have just seen starts an attack on the person of a garda.  The garda may then have to act with greater emphasis and force to clear the thoroughfare in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act whatever that may be once the Act is passed by this House.</P>

We are not dealing with a body of people who want to listen to reason.  We are dealing with a body of people who are concerned with propaganda and who are interested only in rioting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not actually begun to discuss in this House whether section 28 should ever be incorporated in the Bill at all but we have been discussing for <Col N="1881" /> the past 1½ hours how to frame section 28 so that when we come to discuss it we will know what we are discussing and I have been trying to make a case and I think I am in a specially strong position to make it, that the House, as Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy James Tully have said, should be concerned most carefully that while protecting the right of every citizen lawfully, to demonstrate in any part of Ireland, we do not create for the Garda Síochána in the Republic the situation in which the kind of people who seek to interrupt our proceedings here today would be able to summon meetings to denounce them for brutality with the guarantee if and when they do their voices will be carried into every kitchen, every parlour and every drawingroom in Ireland while those who argue for individual liberty, freedom and dignity will be passed over as unworthy of notice because they are not news. Do not close your eyes to the fact that we are passing through this phenomenal phase of human experience that what happens in the Gallery of Dáil Éireann means more to the popular methods of mass communication than what is proceeding on the floor of the Parliament of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is a phenomenon we have got to try to live with but it should not deter us from continuing to do our duty and that is to protect the 144 of us who have been chosen by our own people, to protect the fundamental freedom of our people but at the same time to arm the legitimate Government of Ireland to maintain the law and to defend the institutions of State without apprehension that in any crucial situation they will have to fight anarchy with one hand tied behind their backs.</P>

      <P>It must be repeated that what perhaps all of us in this House are trying to protect is the right of peaceful demonstration, the right to hold a peaceful meeting.  My only regret about what happened in the Gallery is that they got a few tips from people talking here and I am quite sure some of them might now be outside trying to find drain pipes to climb up on the roof of this House.</P>

      <P>The only trouble about that type of person is of course as Deputy Dillon says they get far too much publicity.  Perhaps commenting on them here has added to that and maybe that is the wrong thing to do. As far as we are concerned I think all of us are simply trying to protect the right of peaceful demonstration and the right of peaceful meeting.  I do not think we have any doubt about what the general public in the Republic think of the charges of police brutality. They were made here before on a number of occasions following demonstrations in this city and the general public were not prepared to accept them.  I know there are guards who lose their temper.  They would not be human if they did not but the 99.99 per cent of them in fact behave with remarkable restraint.</P>
      <P>I believe there is no danger here whatever of the situation arising where a big body of people could claim they were treated brutally by the gardaí. For that reason, and particularly as the Minister has agreed with the point I made that people attending a meeting inside a building, are covered and that people attending a meeting outside the building are not covered by the amendment and if that will stand up in law&mdash;I assume it will or the Minister would not have said it&mdash;then I think this settles the problem as far as this amendment is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is a good thing what happened here in the Gallery this evening because somebody must have sponsored those people who came in here.  If somebody did so then we should find out who did.  All of us from time to time have taken responsibility for people coming into the Gallery and if somebody is so irresponsible as to allow people who are obviously, as those people were, from the moment they came into the Gallery, waiting for the opportunity to get their names and possibly their photographs in the papers then that person should be warned he should not do it and these people should not be allowed in again.  If what happened <Col N="1883" /> here this afternoon has that result then perhaps it has been a good thing rather than a bad thing.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House any further on this amendment.  As I say, what we are concerned with here is purely and simply a particular area depending on the distance from this particular building. If meetings are held, whether outdoor or indoor, a half a mile and one foot from this building they will be perfectly legitimate even though they may be designed for the purpose of influencing Members of the House.  We are concerned only with the area within half a mile of this House.  We are concerned with the question of influencing Members.  There is a broad distinction, whether the Minister intended making it or not, between demonstrations held in the open within half a mile of this House and more likely to affect and influence the deliberations of Members and meetings or demonstrations held inside buildings and not in the open and consequently much less likely to affect or influence Deputies. By making the amendment and consequently giving somewhat more liberty to the section the Minister to my mind is giving less cause for complaint to those who would find the provisions provocative and charge against them that they are interfering with individual liberties and for that reason I adhere to what I said in the beginning that the Minister is doing the right thing in bringing in this amendment.</P>

I would prefer the Bill to be so framed that it, or parts of it, would come into operation, on a particular day.  There may be difficulties about that.

      <P>I can understand &ldquo;with reference to any particular provision&rdquo; because there we are dealing with the provisions of the Act but I do not quite understand the reference to &ldquo;any particular purpose&rdquo;.

I am told that this is standard wording and <Col N="1885" /> the only reason for this section is that all this old legislation is going and, in view of the replacement of all the old definitions of offences and misdemeanours, we might find it necessary to take it in phases.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 5, line 25, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;be guilty of an offence and shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed for the purpose of being definite and specific in what we mean to do.  Section 6 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence shall be liable to be tried, indicted, and punished as a principal offender.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the wording of that section as it stands is a little bit odd.  It might be taken only as a threat that aiding and abetting might be regarded as an offence.  I am suggesting that the obvious purpose of this section is that aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring shall be an offence.  I suggest, therefore, that we should be definite about it and that we should say that any person who aids or abets, counsels or procures shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be tried, indicted, and punished as a principal offender.  In other words, we should declare that aiding and abetting <i>et cetera</i> is an offence.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy M.J. O'Higgins on this matter.  I think it would clarify the position.  Part of the purpose of this Bill is to bring the law up to date and to get rid of old practices that have gone out of date and have become unnecessarily cumbersome.  I applaud the Minister and the Department for the work they have done in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had, in the course of my deliberately limited criminal practice, occasionally to appear in Green Street.  I <Col N="1886" /> once had a case of abortion.  It seemed peculiar to me that my client, who was a doctor, and had assisted at the abortion, was in the same position as the lady, who was the victim of the abortion and was charged with the same offence.  I found it a little bit odd. I think the purpose of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment is to make it a separate offence and that if one person is charged with an abortion, and another person with assisting, it is not exactly the same and that one must address the jury in entirely different ways.  The Minister would be well advised to make the position clear.  I think there is nothing sinister here but this should be a separate offence, a statutory offence, rather than putting it in the old way that has been so long in criminal practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a common law offence, as Deputies opposite know.  I have had this amendment examined by the draftsman who is quite satisfied that it is unnecessary, that there is no need to create the offence.  The section deals with the mode of trial.  The draftsman's view is supported, I think, by the fact that when they made the corresponding change in England they did not deem it necessary to create this offence.  They accepted that it was there.  This is really a drafting matter and I would suggest to the Deputy that it is not necessary.</P>

It is not necessary but it is desirable.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), lines 36 and 37, to delete &ldquo;(the onus of proving which shall lie on such other person)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (2) (b) says:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>any other person who, knowing or believing that the offender has committed the offence or some other offence (being an offence to which there attaches a penalty of five years' imprisonment or a more severe penalty), does, without reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on such other person), any act with intent to impede the offender's apprehension or prosecution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>such other person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what exactly is meant by this subsection?  It seems to me to suggest that if a person does not do what is known in this country as a Carey act he will in fact have committed an offence.  That is something I should like the Minister to explain before I proceed to the other amendments.  There may be a perfectly good explanation which I do not understand.  Perhaps the Minister will give it to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in this section that a person who tries to impede the apprehension or prosecution of a person believed to have committed a serious offence is guilty of an offence, and that offence will have to be proved in all cases by the prosecution.  Deputy Tully has referred in addition to the provision in the section which says in effect that even if a person has done this thing he will not be convicted if he can produce a <Col N="1888" /> reasonable excuse.  Obviously it is up to him to produce a reasonable excuse. It would be impossible for the prosecution to produce a reasonable excuse. How could they?  He might have a reasonable excuse which only he would know about.  That is the reason I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is an accepted legal principle that a person who is claiming to come within an exceptional category should prove that he is within that category.  If there is an exception and he is within it, and particularly in the criminal law, the onus is on him to prove it.  Speaking from memory, I think that before the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was enacted there was a statutory defence in cases of carnal knowledge that the accused did not know, or had not reasonable grounds for knowing, that the girl was under 16 years.  I am speaking from memory but I think that was in the law.  The onus shifted to the accused to prove that he was within the exception.  Such provisions have been running through all the law.  If there is an exception the accused must bring himself within the exception.  In this instance a reasonable excuse can only be proved by the accused person, by himself or herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not assume that in the event of a person being charged, no matter what the evidence against him is, even though the evidence which the prosecution have is not good, unless he can prove according to this subsection that he did not commit the offence, that he is not involved, he is deemed to be guilty.</P>
      <P>I always thought, again speaking as a layman, that a person was deemed to be innocent until proved guilty.  As I read it&mdash;again I may be misreading it &mdash;it appears that what the Minister is saying is that an accused person, because he cannot prove his innocence, even though the proof of guilt is not very strong&mdash;it is only an allegation&mdash; must be guilty of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Tully in what he says. We always knew&mdash;and we were fed on <Col N="1889" /> it when we were students as being a great principle of law&mdash;that a person was innocent until he was found guilty. I see throughout our statutory law here an effort made to erode that great principle on every possible occasion.  This is another.  The reason which the Minister gave is a practical reason from the point of view of the prosecutor.  It relieves him of the very great burden of establishing the guilt of a person. Therefore it is in ease of the prosecution that it is put in.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain to me how there can be any excuse, reasonable or otherwise, for any person impeding an offender's apprehension. What excuse can he have?  You may do it but what excuse can you have for doing it?  I do not see the point of the section at all.  It seems to be rubbish: &ldquo;a reasonable excuse for doing an act with intent to impede another person's apprehension or prosecution&rdquo;. If a person is guilty of an offence and the authorities are seeking to arrest him, what possible excuse could any citizen have for impeding them?  It seems to me to be rubbish. Apart altogether from the point of view of proving it, what excuse, reasonable or otherwise, could a citizen have for doing an act which would impede or prevent the arrest of a person who is an offender?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Tully or Deputy Costello. Maybe it is a matter for speculation, but it does seem to me that it is at least possible that a person who knows that another has committed an offence may be under some physical or moral pressure from that offender.  It could well be that the offender still had his gun in his pocket or in his hand.  If the offender says: &ldquo;If you let the Garda know I am here, or if you do not hide me under the stairs, I will shoot you or I will do something to your wife or family&rdquo; that, to my mind, would be a reasonable excuse for someone covering up&mdash;if he felt he was in peril of his own life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly happy to leave it as it is.  It says, any person who does an act with intent to impede apprehension or prosecution.  That is the offence: doing an act.  That person is innocent until he is proved guilty. Even if he is proved guilty he still has a way out, if he can prove&mdash;and the onus of proof is rightly on him&mdash;that he had no alternative but to do that act, that he was under some sort of pressure.  That can happen, to my mind.  So the actual offence is not affected by this presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence is still there.  The prosecution in that case would have to prove the commission of an act but, having proved the commission of an act with intent to do what is prohibited, even then the accused has a way out if, in his turn, he can prove he had no alternative but to commit this offence.  I think we are confusing the issue if we see the onus of proof being on the accused as an infringement of that sacred principle on which I was brought up too.  It is not.  This is a way out.  It has nothing to do with the offence. The onus of proving that the accused had a way out very correctly, to my mind, rests with the accused.</P>

For instance, there is the offence of being an accessory after the fact to a felony, that is to say, an offence committed by a person who knowing another to have committed a felony, aids him to escape apprehension and prosecution.  That is being repealed and replaced.  It is the first of several instances in the Bill where the abolition of a felony as such would leave a gap in the law unless statutory provision were made.  This is the basis of the section in question.</P>

      <P>...does, without reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on such other person), any act with intent to impede the offender's apprehension or prosecution.</P>
      <P>Then he would be guilty of this offence. There may be circumstances such as described by Deputy Booth where he did the act by compulsion.  One could visualise other circumstances.  For instance, it could be a man's wife who was involved&mdash;that the person who had committed the offence was being hidden by her or a relative or some person who was indebted to the criminal in some way.  One can imagine reasons, other than the reason of fear in respect of themselves or their families, why someone would aid or abet a criminal.  While the onus of proof is on the State, there is this exception by way of special defence which is available to the person charged with aiding and abetting and who has this reasonable excuse. Deputy Costello suggested that the insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; would have certain effects and that it would meet the wishes of the House. I cannot give an <i>ad hoc</i> decision on that proposition.  I would want to examine its implications.  However, this exception is there and the reasons can be such that nobody but the person involved would know of.  This is the purpose of the exception.  It is up to the person concerned to avail of the escape clause.  However, I shall look at the suggestion put forward by Deputy Costello.</P>

      <P>Because otherwise the Deputy would agree with the Minister and he did not.  Is that not a good reason?  What I cannot understand or cannot accept is that, according to the reading of the subsection, if somebody, who knows or believes that an offender has committed an offence &ldquo;does, without reasonable excuse ... any act with intent to impede the offender's apprehension or prosecution&rdquo;, unless he is able to prove himself that the excuse is reasonable, then he is guilty of a serious offence.  If somebody commits a serious offence and an innocent bystander gets involved, the innocent bystander will be guilty of another serious offence if he is not able to prove to the satisfaction of the court that that is so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Booth goes out to his garden, digs it up and plants it.  He has not been in the garden for quite some time, but Deputy Booth's neighbour has killed somebody and buried him in it a few days before that.  By digging the garden he gives the guilty person a perfect alibi.  Nobody will ever think of looking there and, if they do, they come to Deputy Booth and ask: &ldquo;Did you cover it up?&rdquo; Deputy Booth will have to say he does not know, but he will have to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he was not trying to aid and abet his neighbour in committing an offence.  This is a very serious situation. I do not want to hold up the discussion. The Minister said he will have another look at the matter.  I would be prepared to accept the amendment suggested by Deputy Costello.  Perhaps the Minister can suggest a better one, <Col N="1894" /> but I would not be prepared to accept the section as it is now.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be well advised to consider Deputy Costello's suggestion very seriously.  Deputy Tully has advanced some of the reasons why this kind of subsection is likely to tie people into all sorts of knots.  I referred to that myself on the Second Stage.  There is the danger that we are providing here for instant guilt.  A person is charged. The set of circumstances out of which the charge arises, if unexplained, might obviously not only justify the court in thinking an offence had been committed but go even further than that. You have a set of circumstances.  You have a charge.  In effect, under this section, unless the person who is accused can himself prove that he has an excuse and can himself prove that the excuse is reasonable, without any definition of what reasonable is, he will be convicted.  He must be convicted because, as the section stands, we will be declaring that he is guilty of an offence, and that is all about it.  It would be a case of instant guilt.</P>

In all these cases the onus of proof is on the prosecution and it is only when it comes to the defence that the onus of proof on the defence comes in.  A person may say: &ldquo;I know that John Willie committed this very serious offence&rdquo; or &ldquo;I believed he had&rdquo; and, by that time, the court knows darned well that John Willie had committed the offence, but the other person says: &ldquo;I did this act and I did it with the intent of preventing the Garda arresting him, but I was under some sort of obligation&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The prosecution in each case has got to prove that he knew or believed that he did the act, that he had the guilty intention of doing the act, and that is quite a burden of proof on the prosecution.  The burden on the accused is to defend himself by producing some good reason for doing something which was criminally wrong. I do not see anything in this.  Even without the particular phrase, the onus of proof would lie on him anyway and I think it is only right to write it in clearly so that people should be fully informed.</P>

      <P>For the record, I want to make it quite clear that I cannot at all accept the interpretation of Deputy O'Higgins in relation to this question of instant guilt.  I do not intend to repeat everything that Deputy Booth has stated.  I would point out, however, that, if the defendant sits back and says nothing, the charge must still be proved to the hilt.  To come back to Deputy Tully's body, they would have to prove that he knew it was there and was put there, and so on. There is no question of instant guilt. All these matters must be proved and accepted by the court before any question of this exception by way of reasonable excuse by the accused would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thinking over the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;, suggested by Deputy Costello, I am inclined to think it might be more restrictive than the section now is. <Col N="1900" /> Take, for instance, the case I gave of a man's wife or close relative, or somebody like that.

      <P>I want to ask the Minister some questions as regards subsections (5) and (6).  Subsection (5) provides that, subject to subsection (6), no proceedings shall be instituted for an offence under subsection (2)&mdash;the one we have been talking about&mdash;except by or with the consent of the Attorney General.  Subsection (6) provides, notwithstanding that the consent of the Attorney General is necessary, under subsection (5) for the institution of proceedings, that will not prevent a number of things.  It will not prevent arrest; it will not prevent the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person for an offence and it will not prevent the remand either in custody or on bail of a person charged with such an offence.  It seems to me that the consent of the Attorney General to the proceedings should surely be capable of being secured if a person has been arrested and before he is remanded in custody.  I just want the <Col N="1901" /> Minister to have a look at that.  I can understand that the requirement regarding the Attorney General's consent should not necessarily prevent the arrest of a person but, once a person has been arrested, if he is being brought before a court, it seems to me it should be possible to obtain the consent of the Attorney General to the proceedings before the matter is dealt with, certainly on the basis of a remand in custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 6, after line 55 to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Consideration&rsquo; in this section shall not include the return to the owner of money or other property belonging to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment to pinpoint a particular problem to which I referred during the Second Stage debate.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but the position, as I understand it, is that the return of a person's property out of which he has been defrauded is at present considered to be a reward under existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me it is regarded as being a reward in the context of compounding a felony.  This provision in section <Col N="1902" /> 7, it appears to me, is being brought in to replace the offence of compounding a felony.  We have in subsection (1) (b) a provision that any person who, knowing or believing that the offence or some other offence (being an offence to which there attaches a penalty of five years imprisonment or a more severe penalty) has been committed, and that he has information&mdash; this is where Deputy James Tully might be interested&mdash;which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution or conviction of an offender for it, accepts or agrees to accept for not disclosing that information any consideration, such other person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I want to inquire from the Minister if &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; is on a par with &ldquo;reward&rdquo; as we know it at the moment.  Does &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; also include the return of a person's property? The problem that exists at the moment, and which I think would exist under section 7 as drafted, is that, if a person is defrauded out of some property and wants to get it back, he probably is not concerned with the question of punishing the person who has defrauded him.  He would be quite happy with getting his money back.</P>
    <P>As I see it, at the moment and under section 7 he will not be in a position to go to the defrauder and say: &ldquo;Give me my money back and I will forget about it&rdquo;.  If he does that he is committing an offence under section 7, because if the return of his property is to be regarded as &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, then he is putting himself in the position where he is agreeing not to prosecute, to put it bluntly, or not to give information on which a prosecution may be laid provided he gets his money back.</P>
    <P>I want to inquire from the Minister, one, if I am right in my reading of the section and with regard to what I think the effect of the section would be in those cases, and two, if I am right, if it would not be worth while considering some kind of a provision such as I suggest in my amendment.  I find myself very often greatly in sympathy with people who are put in a position that the only reasonable way in which they can be compensated for the loss they have suffered is by keeping quiet&mdash;by <Col N="1903" /> agreeing &ldquo;We will call it a day if you give me back my £100&rdquo; or whatever the amount in question is.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to blame a person in that position if he agrees.  On the other hand, the present position of the law, as I understand it, is that if such a person agrees, that agreement is to be regarded as reward&mdash;as accepting a reward&mdash;and the person puts himself in jeopardy of prosecution as an accessory.  The same principle is being incorporated in section 7.  It replaces something that is being done away with under existing law.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not consider that he can accept the amendment as it stands, I should like him at least to consider whether something can be done on these lines so as to exempt, at least from the full penalties of the law, a person who is merely trying to get back his property and who finds that the only way to get it back is to make a deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very interesting proposition and a very tempting one if there are only two individuals involved&mdash;the person who is defrauded and the person who defrauded him.  It is a relatively simple matter and it might be relatively better if no prosecution were taken, because there is the possibility of the defrauder being rehabilitated. If the injured party does not agree to a deal, it means that the case goes to court and the person who has got hold of the money or the property might succeed in passing it on to a third party or to the local bookie. In such circumstances the lives of two persons and their families are messed up.  There is, however, the problem of where more than two persons are involved, where five or six people may have been relieved of property, where one person made a deal and is willing to pocket his money without taking a prosecution, letting the others who have been defrauded go down the drain. The person who defrauded those people might try to collect from other people before the court hearing takes place.  Such circumstances take the taste out of the amendment, as I see it. The Minister may have some ideas on it which might meet both sides.</P>

      <P>Deputies Booth and O'Malley and the Minister will appreciate that very often there is a third person involved.  What happens is that the unfortunate person who has been defrauded goes to see his solicitor and the solicitor, knowing the law about compounding a felony, appreciates that the right thing for that person to do is to go to the police. However, the client says: &ldquo;I am not interested in the police.  I do not want to see this man in jail.  I am interested in getting my money back.&rdquo; The solicitor is then faced with the prospect of writing a letter to the defrauder and he has to be extremely careful about the letter he writes.  If he puts a foot wrong in the letter then the solicitor, in addition to the client, is putting himself in the position of compounding a felony.  Perhaps I should not give away trade secrets as to how the letter should be written, but it is a problem as the Minister will appreciate.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to provide for the restoration of property and so on.  The section to which the Deputy refers may be put somewhat in a false light if we assume that all that is involved is £50 or £100.  We are dealing with serious offences here which are liable to a penalty of five years or more.  We could say that even the theft of sixpence is a crime against the community but when we get up to the big stuff carrying heavy penalties we have to make it clear to the people that they must play their part in guarding the community against people who are doing this sort of thing.  The idea that each offence is an isolated offence is something I cannot accept.  A person who has defrauded another person once to a considerable extent is very liable to do it again and if he defrauds a person once and then makes his peace with that person and says &ldquo;I am sorry, I still have the money and I will give it <Col N="1905" /> back on condition you say nothing&rdquo; he will be terribly liable to do it again. We have to make it perfectly clear that any person who knows that an offence has been committed against him must not compound a felony by allowing the person to go unpunished.  I know there is the danger and the temptation to which Deputy O'Higgins refers of the person saying &ldquo;I will get back my money if I make a bargain quickly&rdquo; but I do not think we should allow people to yield to that temptation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully.  It is much easier to pontificate for other people.  That is why we have to put into the Act &ldquo;You shall not do this&rdquo;.  There should be no question of having an option as to whether you take Deputy O'Higgins's comparatively easy way out.  I admit it has its difficulties, the easy way of getting money, but if a person has committed a very serious offence, which is not only against one person but which really is against the whole community, that person must not accept any consideration for covering up for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that Deputy O'Higgins is right in his interpretation in regard to the words &ldquo;for a reward&rdquo;.  What he refers to would amount to a consideration.  As I stated on the Second Reading, the points made by Deputy O'Higgins are ones with which I have a good deal of sympathy.  I tried to have this matter examined objectively because my own experience had been the same as that of Deputy O'Higgins and I appreciate the difficulties which have been referred to.  Broadly speaking, there is a lot to be said for dealing with the small case between the two people Deputy Tully mentioned, without going through all the panoply of the law and that it could be disposed of in that way but, unfortunately, having examined the matter, there is another difficulty and indeed quite a serious one.  The argument made by Deputy O'Higgins &mdash; and which I would have made from my own experience&mdash;is quite valid in regard to a certain type of case but there are other types of cases that <Col N="1906" /> would raise serious difficulties and up to now I have not found the answer to this problem.</P>
      <P>For instance, take the case of a large supermarket in which pilfering has been going on over a period.  This may have been the work not alone of just one individual but possibly of two or three and even of some members of the public as well.  Then you find some member of the staff being caught red handed, <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, and the employer says to him&mdash;we have seen something of this&mdash;&ldquo;Our losses are so much over this period; you will pay back every penny of that amount&rdquo;, whereas in fact that person might not have been responsible for one-twentieth of the losses.</P>
      <P>I have been reliably informed that this form of blackmail, if I might call it such, has in fact been exercised in cases where pilferings or misappropriations have occurred and one individual, having been caught, has been made responsible by certain employers, under the threat of going to the Garda, for making good all the losses claimed over that period or over a longer period.  The person caught is compelled to make good these losses or defalcations, or whatever it may be, under pain of prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem.  On the one hand, it is accepted as far as I am concerned that there is a strong case for allowing the humanitarian employer to act, in some of the cases suggested by some Deputies, in accordance with what his instincts would tell him was right to do, and he would save the employee from what might have been a small temporary lapse and deal with him justly. On the other hand, we have the danger of a certain form of blackmail being used of the kind to which I have referred.  As I said, candidly, I do not know the answer to this.  At all events, I would ask Deputy O'Higgins to withdraw his amendment at this stage&mdash;the drafting could be improved if we decided to accept the principle that is involved.  I would welcome suggestions from Deputies as to how the danger to which I referred could be got over.  I am sympathetic to the basic idea behind the amendment <Col N="1907" /> but I am frightened by the type of case to which I have referred and if Deputies can help me in framing an amendment that would meet our wishes on this section I will have it considered.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section deals with the question of compounding an offence for which the penalty is five years imprisonment or more.  Subsection (4) states that &ldquo;the compounding of an offence other than treason shall not be an offence otherwise than under this section.&rdquo; That would appear to me&mdash;I may perhaps misunderstand what is intended&mdash; to leave a gap in the law inasmuch as it is an offence to accept consideration for not disclosing information relating to an offence that carries a penalty of five years or more.  It would appear not to be against the law, not to be an offence, to accept consideration for not disclosing information about an offence that carries, for example, three years imprisonment.  I do not know whether my reading of the situation is correct and that that is, in fact, what the law is and is intended to be under this Bill when enacted.  There may be some good reason for it but, on the face of it, it seems strange that it is not an offence to compound an offence carrying less than five years imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of this section, there is another point which occurred to me when Deputy O'Higgins suggested his amendment and it is something analogous to that.  It is the problem that arises under the present law where there is a civil wrong&mdash;a breach of contract or a tort which is also a crime. Under the present law it is not possible to take civil proceedings in respect of that wrong until the criminal <Col N="1908" /> case has been disposed of.  This generally arises in relation to hire purchase contracts where a car, being the subject of hire purchase, is dealt with by the hirer in such a way that it amounts to larceny.  The owner of the car or other goods is unable to avail of his civil remedies against the defaulter until the State have had recourse to their criminal remedy against him. That often takes several months, quite understandably.  On the expiration of the criminal proceedings the value of the civil rights of the party who has been injured may well have been entirely lost because the defendant may no longer be a mark or have any assets and the goods themselves may have utterly depreciated.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to let the House have some information on those two points which I think are relevant to this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister wishes to deal with Deputy O'Malley's points at once, I should like to say something on this.  I wonder am I a criminal in this context.  When Deputy O'Malley has lived as long as I have he will probably have shared my experiences, which I do not doubt the Minister has had and which possibly Deputy O'Higgins has had.  Imagine an old friend comes to you and says: &ldquo;I got my young lad a job and, to put it plainly, there is a sum of £335 that he cannot account for.  Here he is with me.  I brought him to you for advice.&rdquo; My advice has consistently been to say: &ldquo;The only remedy for a wrong is to put it right.  You must take the risk of the consequences.  You cannot sweep it under the carpet.&rdquo; We gather a few friends and we raise the sum required and go to the employer or whoever it is and state openly what has happened.  We put the sum on the table and say: &ldquo;The just man falls seven times a day.  This young lad has gone wrong.  We recognise that the wrong he has done to you must be put right.  Here is the material with which to put it right.  Will you let him quit and make a new start?&rdquo; Is that, in the view of my colleagues in the Dáil, a crime?  What would they do?  Would they go to the police and ask them to prosecute him?  That is one story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> There is also the story of the old and respected person who has had a long life of honest service and takes to drink.  We all know such people.  He becomes a dipsomaniac and suddenly does what he would never have done if he were not sick.  He turns to you because you are his friend and tells you his problem, that he betrayed his trust and knows he has no defence except that he drank it and that it will be found out next Saturday.  What do you do?  Does the Dáil require me to call the police, or am I to be permitted to say: &ldquo;The first thing is to put right what you have done wrong.  The second is to go to the man you have injured and make a full disclosure.  You have sacrificed your right to expect his trust in future and you must do the best you can.&rdquo; That is the advice I would give.</P>
    <P>I would be very grateful to the employer of an old and trusted servant if he said: &ldquo;Let us set 40 years of faithful service against one lapse because you are a sick man.  Let us get you into St. Patrick's for a while and have you dried out and straightened out. Perhaps you will put the whole thing behind you.&rdquo; Is that to become a criminal offence?  Does any of us think that is a criminal offence because, if so, I have done it several times, and I think with uniform success; but, even if it was not always successful, the person to whom I spoke on behalf of the delinquent was never asked by me to give a reference.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Booth is unsympathetic. He knows the situation.</P>

      <P>I take it Deputy Booth and myself are the kind of people who do not want to break the law.  Therefore, <Col N="1910" /> as far as I can see, in the strict letter of this measure we would be compounding a felony inasmuch as we directed a delinquent to collect from his friends the amount that had gone agley, to put it on the table of the aggrieved person and to say: &ldquo;I confess my fault.  My friends have helped me to repair the damage I have done you.  In consideration of that, will you agree not to prosecute me?&rdquo; Does the House think I should have said to the delinquent: &ldquo;You have apprised me of your crime&rdquo; and reached for the telephone to call the Garda?  I confess to the House that, if that is the law, I have broken it repeatedly, and I intend to go on doing in the future what I have done in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to press the case too hard because I am perfectly certain that both the Minister and Deputy O'Higgins had these things in mind.  I know how difficult it is to draft a law for the hard case, and to do so is bad law.  At the same time, I would direct myself principally to the younger Deputies, who see things in black and white and are mainly concerned with making things crystal clear and unambiguous.  But they sometimes forget that human life is not so simple and there may arise a case under which a good person, for all sorts of reasons, will find himself in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot be any question of one saying to persons who are in trouble: &ldquo;Forget about it; you got away with it, so say nothing.&rdquo; One must say to them: &ldquo;Your first duty is to put right what you have done wrong and your second duty is to go openly, face the consequences of this action, and, if the person you have injured is prepared to take a charitable and understanding view, I shall do everything I can to persuade him to do so.  But there is no use pretending that I can ask him to give you a reference as being an honest and trustworthy person because that is something which would involve him in doing as great a wrong as you have already done.  I shall not seek <Col N="1911" /> to set the criminal law in motion in view of the fact that you have recognised your offence and that there is an extenuating circumstance and that your friends or yourself are now in a position to repair the wrong that you have done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that any responsible Deputy in this House wants to make that advice a criminal offence.  As I have said, I recognise the Minister's sympathetic approach to the problems that this section may create but, perhaps, when he is looking into the particular technical problem that is raised by Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, he will also bear in mind the wider question of either the young person in trouble or the old and trusted servant who has broken down, usually through drink, and who has destroyed a long and honourable career.  One hopeless lapse of this character, as any experienced person knows, is a symptom of sickness rather than a criminal tendency on the part of the person concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, Deputy O'Malley is, in effect, asking: &ldquo;Why do we not prohibit acceptance of a reward for silence in respect of less serious offences?&rdquo; Of course, the answer is that there was never an offence of compounding a misdemeanour. The provision arises out of the abolition of felony and it is not considered necessary to extend it to lesser offences.  Deputy O'Malley spoke also of hire purchase contracts and so on. These are questions for the civil law and not for the criminal law with which we are dealing in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the type of case that Deputy Dillon has mentioned and it is that type of case that we had in mind when we were discussing the matter on the Second Stage and again here on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I can find a formula that covers this type of case without leaving wide open the danger of the blackmail to which I have referred, I shall be very glad to do so.  I must say that up to now I have not been able to put my finger on a way of doing this.  The idea behind what has been said here <Col N="1912" /> by Deputies Dillon, O'Higgins and Tully has my full sympathy and if any of us can find a way of meeting the difficulty to which I have referred, I shall have it examined and I shall listen to any suggestions which Deputies may have as to how we might deal with the odd lapse or the minor or exceptional case and, at the same time, rule out the danger of this pernicious practice that I am told exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 46, before &ldquo;he may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within the previous seven days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 (1) says that:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that an offence to which there attaches a penalty of five years imprisonment or a more severe penalty, has been committed, he may arrest without warrant a person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.</P>
      <P>In my amendment, I suggested that the words &ldquo;within the previous seven days&rdquo; be inserted.  As it stands, this section is far too wide.  It appears that a garda can arrest anybody without warrant at any time.  This is something which I do not consider to be desirable. There should be a limit to arrest without warrant.  If a garda meets somebody whom he believes has committed an offence and if he knows the full circumstances, seven days seems to be a reasonable time.  I see no reason why he should not be entitled to arrest that person but I do not think it reasonable that a garda can at any time arrest without warrant somebody on the street whom he suspects of having committed a crime.  All that is necessary is that the garda suspects the person of committing an offence and therefore that puts the warrant in his hand.  It is as good as a warrant.  I feel that this is not something which should be written into the law in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1913" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tully misunderstands the position.  The provision to which he refers is as nearly as possible the same as the existing law.  The existing law allows arrest without a warrant on reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed. The amendment restricts that to where the offence is committed within the preceding seven days, if I understand correctly what the Deputy suggests.  The question of when the offence is committed is not really the important factor.  What is important is when the gardaí obtain evidence to justify a charge.  For instance, this could be a murder charge and they might be collecting evidence for quite a while.  It could be a charge of robbery or larceny or some other charge like that.</P>
      <P>The gardaí investigation might be going on for weeks or even months and it might quite suddenly lead to a detection.  In such a case immediate arrest would, of course, be vital to prevent the escape of the offender who now knows he is detected or knows, as they say, that &ldquo;he is on his heels&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if this seven days limitation was inserted it would, from a practical point of view, rule out the operation of the provision in many cases.  The gardaí may have their suspicions but it may take them weeks to get the necessary evidence to enable them to make an arrest.  Of course, the Deputy possibly was not aware of the fact that under existing law a person could be arrested by a garda on the mere suspicion of a felony.  In view of that the Deputy will appreciate I could not accept this amendment which would be a major restriction on the existing powers of the gardaí in this connection.</P>

If they are following a trail over a long period, as the Minister has suggested, there is ample time to have a warrant prepared and the person should be apprised under that warrant.</P>

      <P>If he has one foot on the mail boat the gardaí can find a reason for arresting him for having done or not having done something and I think Deputy Dillon knows of those circumstances also.  However, to continue the situation where the gardaí have the right to arrest and they could have the warrant prepared if they felt it was necessary to do so, I do not think is the thing because it leaves everybody liable to arrest if the gardaí feel any suspicion.</P>

      <P>There are a couple of things the Deputy said which suggest that he does not appear to understand the legal requirements as they exist. The gardaí cannot get a warrant &ldquo;on spec&rdquo; nor can they get a warrant in advance.  They can get a warrant only when they are able to swear information and to produce certain evidence. They may have their suspicions and <Col N="1915" /> they may suspect a certain person over a period.  They may have been collecting their evidence and they may have a very good idea who the person is who did the job but it takes quite a while to get the evidence.  It may be that, as Deputy Dillon mentioned, the person might have one foot on the boat&mdash;or, as is more likely nowadays, he might have one foot on the plane, which is a faster method of operation&mdash;and it may be only while he is on the way out that the gardaí get a final nail to put in that person's coffin.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (b) page 9, line 11, after &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by the use or threat of physical force&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has to do with the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; in subsection (3) of section 12.  It is provided in this subsection that the police may arrest without warrant a person whom they find doing anything which constitutes or which the member of the gardaí reasonably believes to constitute an offence.  The offences are set out.  The first is an offence whereby, in the <Col N="1916" /> opinion of the member, human life is endangered or a risk of serious injury to any person or of serious damage to property is caused.  The second is an offence involving the intimidation of another person.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of the Second Reading discussion that particularly having regard to the allegations of intimidation made against members of the NFA at the time of the farming difficulties some years ago it is of particular importance that there should be something tighter than the definition &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo;.  We shall not have time to discuss this at length this evening.  I am suggesting in this amendment that the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; should be qualified by inserting the words &ldquo;by the use or threat of physical force&rdquo;.  It will be appreciated that one could possibly by a stretch of the imagination regard such matters as canvassing a person to change his point of view with regard to a particular matter on the basis that if that person does not change his point of view support of some sort would be withheld, as intimidation.  I am sure that is not intended.  I imagine that what is intended is intimidation, where the actual use or threat of physical force comes into the picture.  I suggest that that should be spelt out in the subsection and that it should be made quite clear that it is intimidation of that sort, which after all is intimidation which has immediate effects, that should give rise to the right to arrest without warrant.</P>

      <P>There is a very serious national problem in regard to drug addiction.  The Minister for Health must stand indicted of refusing to accept the fact that drug addiction was a problem in Ireland.  I remember three years ago bringing it to the attention of the Minister for Health and asking if a register of drug addicts could be compiled by the Department so that we would know the extent of the problem and so that we might arrange for the proper treatment of addicts.  I recall that the Minister for Health at the time said &ldquo;You are exaggerating the problem.  I do not think what you suggest is good.  I do not think it will help.&rdquo; He said it was not a serious problem and that setting up a committee to investigate it would not serve any purpose.  The Minister and his Department have been proved wrong.  Drug addiction is a problem. There are young people who are a serious problem in the community using any means to obtain the necessary drugs to satisfy their tremendous craving.  Perhaps we are to blame for this but the problem does exist.</P>

      <P>We are faced with a very serious national problem.  It was wrong that we should have permitted so much time to elapse before realising the position.  Teenagers who are addicted to strong drugs face a life of ruin unless something is done immediately to rehabilitate them.  I do not think the answer lies in admission to psychiatric hospitals because the normal psychiatric hospital cannot offer the facilities necessary for the proper treatment of drug addiction.  We need special, trained personnel.  It is wrong to admit addicts to general hospitals <Col N="1918" /> which cannot cope with their problem. Special centres must be made available. This was recommended in a report by Professor Ivor Browne of the Dublin Health Authority who said that special places would have to be provided for them in special centres.  The Minister would be well advised to consider this as an emergency problem demanding immediate attention.</P>
      <P>We will have to take special measures about the importation of drugs.  There should be more control over distribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is not absolute control.  I am afraid we are too lax about them.  I am talking about importation by the wholesale chemists.  I believe every doctor should have a narcotics number and there should be very stringent control exercised over the prescription of these drugs.  In this way there would be some control over distribution.  The present regulations are far from adequate as we can see.  Remember, we are seeing the end product.  We see people who have been able to obtain drugs very freely.  Their dependence on the drugs has increased and they resort to every means to obtain them.  These people were able to obtain drugs quite liberally when they were on small doses.  Unfortunately, they need more and more as time goes on.  There will have to be very stringent regulations governing the distribution of drugs.  I would suggest something on the lines of a special narcotics code number for doctors in order that we could have this special control.  There should be specially trained personnel in the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to tell drug addicts that they can and will be helped, and that facilities are available for them.  At the moment we are not offering them a helping hand, and that is a great pity. These people would gladly avail of assistance and treatment and we must make it known that they are available. They should be informed that drug <Col N="1919" /> treatment is available for them in small amounts while they are undergoing the withdrawal period from these strong drugs.  Unless we face up to it and realise that the problem is there, we will never solve it.  I earnestly urge the Minister to regard this problem as an emergency and to deal with it effectively, to make facilities available and make it known to drug addicts that they can and will be helped, that they are not criminals but victims.</P>
    <P>We also have a serious problem that is generally overlooked because, as a nation, we are inclined to say that heavy drinking is a characteristic of this country and there is nothing wrong with it.  Alcoholism is a serious problem, a problem to which we have devoted neither time, energy nor resources. Unfortunately, the alcoholic is often treated as a nuisance or a menace in society rather than as a patient suffering from a disease.  The alcoholic is in need of help.  I know one psychiatric hospital in which the normal charges for psychiatric patients do not obtain when an alcoholic is admitted.  The charges go up.  That is not right.  It is unjust.  The alcoholic is as much in need of attention and treatment as the schizophrenic, the manic depressive, or any of the other psychiatric cases one sees in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more and more money devoted to research into the problem of alcoholism which is receiving and has received very little attention from our health authorities.  We have not had any survey or study of the extent of alcoholism in this country. Like many other things, we are inclined to overlook it.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I heard of the number of burials which take place without death certificates being issued.  That is a great reflection on the Department of Health.  We are inclined to overlook these things and to say: &ldquo;Yes, these burials take place, and these things happen, but we can do nothing about them.&rdquo; These are problems which should be tackled.  We should adopt a very constructive approach to them.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in this Bill <Col N="1920" /> about the health centres operating a proper form of preventive medicine. The Minister's offer to the medical profession is geared towards curative and not preventive medicine.  The Minister said not too long ago that he would like to see more attention being given to preventive medicine.  Let him practise what he preaches.  Let him encourage it, and not just say that we need more and more of it.  Let him provide the incentives.</P>
    <P>The excuse is given over and over again that we have not got the trained personnel to cope with a national cervical screening campaign.  I will not dwell on the merits or demerits of such a programme.  It is part of a public health programme which should be carried out by the Department of Health.  Every assistance should be given towards the setting up of screening clinics.  They have their place in helping to diagnose cases of early cancer. In the town of Kilkenny the public health clinic is able to run a cervical screening programme on a shoestring. I heard about it the other day.  It is a wonderful thing.  So far, quite a number of people have co-operated fully with them in operating it efficiently. The response from the public was particularly good, which shows that people are anxious to co-operate in public health programmes like this.</P>
    <P>I should like to see public health centres like this operating in all our major towns so that we could in this way carry out a proper preventive medicine programme.  I should like to see money devoted towards it.  It can be done.  It can be operated successfully. The Minister said they could not get a cytologist from the Dublin Corporation Health Authority.  We could train technicians who could very readily and efficiently carry out this task.  It is not necessary to have a cytologist in every centre.  We could have good trained technicians.  I discussed this with a pathologist of note and he believes it can be done and quite cheaply, and that we could have a very effective public health programme in operation.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of health centres and public health, I see no mention in the Bill about the conversion of the <Col N="1921" /> dispensaries which are to be abolished. I should like to see them replaced by proper health centres which would provide the basic laboratory facilities which are at present made available to in-patients in hospitals.  This could be done at the health centres and would help to reduce the cost of the health services.  It could be done on an outpatient basis at these health centres.  It would be simple to provide that specialists would be in attendance on special days.  If we had this, we could ensure that all the necessary investigations were carried out before the patient was finally admitted to hospital. One can imagine the saving there would be in hospital charges if we initiated such a scheme.  It should be possible to arrange for doctors to attend at health centres and to provide the service needed.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the ways in which we could provide proper health services for our people at low cost.  It is wrong for the Minister to say we cannot afford a national health scheme when he refuses to look into questions like this: how can we run a very efficient health scheme and provide proper services at low cost?  We will have to look into the problem of our hospitals.  We should remember that the hospitals are there to cater for the public, not the public to cater for them.  Everything should be done in the interests of the patient.  I should like to see visiting hours designed to suit the relatives and not to suit the administrative staff. This is important.  The patient is a very important person.  If this were borne in mind we might get a more modernised concept as to what is needed in hospitals.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more information available to doctors about patients' reports.  This is one thing that has gone wrong with our system. Doctors cannot get reports in time because the Minister and the Department refused to provide money for secretarial personnel in hospitals. When I was in practice I saw cases where I could not get a report for weeks.  The relatives came and told me what had happened.  In one case the patient had died and that was the first I heard about it.  Within three or four <Col N="1922" /> weeks I would hear from the hospital and when I complained I was told the Department refused to provide money for secretarial personnel in hospitals and that the medical staff could not cope with the situation without this. We are living in an age when all this must be streamlined and a proper service provided.</P>
    <P>I see no mention in the Bill of what we intend to do for our aged.  I should like to see geriatrics become an important aspect of general hospital care.  I do not think we should set up geriatric hospitals.  Geriatrics should be part of the general hospital service.  I should like to see geriatricians appointed.  We have not many of them, because the care of the aged is always relegated to second or third place.  Geriatrics is a specialised subject, and more can be done for the aged if we have the expert personnel to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see psychiatry as part of the general hospital service. There is no mention of this in the Bill. We talk about psychiatric hospitals but psychiatry should be based on the general hospital system.  In that way we shall alter people's views on psychiatric problems and make these problems as normal as other physical ailments. A stigma still attaches to psychiatric illness, and we are per-petuating this by keeping psychiatric hospitals apart from the general hospitals. If psychiatric treatment were given in general hospitals, there would be greater co-ordination between medical, surgical and psychiatric personnel, and this is in the interests of medicine and of the patient.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reference to the arrangements for a marked increase in the number of domiciliary nurses who can follow up cases discharged from hospitals.  I know of a man who was discharged recently from a mental hospital in Dublin and was found dead on the side of the road.  It is not good enough to discharge these patients without having social workers and domiciliary nurses to call on them. There is no use in placing a person back in the community unless the proper personnel are available to follow up their cases.</P>
    <P>There should be adequate facilities <Col N="1923" /> for the treatment of long-term patients. Perhaps arrangements could be made whereby these patients would be treated at special centres, not necessarily hospital centres.  There is no provision for this, and we must alter the outlook of the Department and of the medical profession on it.  At present these long-term patients take up a great number of beds in our hospitals. In Dublin city there are only two places for the chronically ill or the incurable.  Chronically ill patients very commonly need, not medical treatment, but nursing care.  It is not right to inflict them on their families who cannot provide facilities for them and who are not trained to deal with these problems. These are specialised nursing problems.  Proper centres will have to be provided for them where needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has boasted that we are doing a tremendous amount for our mentally handicapped.  I wonder if we really are.  It is very easy to say we have provided so many beds compared with 1932.  That is not a realistic comparison.  This problem was neglected for years.  Many of these patients in their teens, in their twenties and thirties, were on the waiting lists of institutions for many years, from the age of five or six, but were never admitted because there were no places for them.  They were left to their parents who sacrificed everything to try and keep them.  A grave injustice has been done to those people and to their parents.  The State should have done something for them but refused to recognise its responsibility.  Earlier this evening I spoke to a lady who has a son of 33 physically handicapped since 16 years as a result of tubercular meningitis.  He was never properly trained for anything.  He has made numerous attempts to commit suicide because he has had nothing to occupy his mind.  As a result he is now in a mental hospital.  It is an indictment of our system and of our State that we have done nothing for these people.</P>
    <P>Better facilities for our nurses should be incorporated in this Bill.  Our nurses are still awaiting the 11th round increase, which is due since April, 1968. It is a shame that these dedicated girls, <Col N="1924" /> who do such Trojan work, should be neglected as they are.  Because of their dedication perhaps they do not fight their cause enough.  The demand for Irish nurses in the United States and in Britain is tremendous.  Unless proper salary scales are introduced for them very soon we may not be able to bring in any Health Bill because we shall have no nurses in this country.  There are tremendous attractions abroad for nurses, and the great pity is that although trained in this country they must go abroad to get proper remuneration for their services.  I would say to the Minister in all seriousness that we shall have a great shortage of nurses in this country in the near future.</P>
    <P>We complain that we have not enough nurses.  In many cases this is due to the fact that sufficient nurses cannot be accommodated in the living quarters of our hospitals, in nurses' homes.  There is a ready and a simple solution to this, that the nurses live out.  I do not see why they should live in these homes.  If we are to solve our nursing problem, which is a big one and getting bigger, we must find a constructive solution to it, that is, to allow our nurses to live out and also to abolish this idea of nurses paying fees. The sooner this is abolished the better. It serves no useful purpose.  Its only effect is to prevent the dedicated girl obtaining a place in a nursing school simply because she has not the necessary fee.  This is wrong.  It is unjust. It is an indictment of the system. I ask the Minister to look into this problem to see what can be done about it now and not wait until the problem becomes so acute as to be wellnigh incapable of solution.  It takes years to train a nurse.  Fees should be abolished and nurses should be allowed to live out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Young civil servants <Col N="1925" /> up from the country live out.  I do not see that student nurses are any different. Nurses are treated abominably from the point of view of remuneration.  It is very important that there should be equality of pay in psychiatric nursing in particular.  The female nurses do exactly the same work and work the same number of hours as their male colleagues, but they are paid less than their male colleagues.  At the moment the greatest shortage of nursing personnel occurs in psychiatric medicine.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter of equality of pay for these nurses.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give attention &mdash;he has ignored this matter up to now &mdash;to health centres.  If we had properly organised health centres people could be informed of that to which they are entitled as of right instead of going around looking for information, as they are compelled to do at present. Many people have paid for hospitalisation not realising that they were entitled to avail of health services.  That should not be permitted to continue. All the information necessary should be available immediately to people seeking it.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill about medical training.  It is an important matter.  If we are to have good family medicine we will have to have proper training for our medical students.  It might be a good idea to have these students attached to health centres where they could familiarise themselves with health problems and family medicine.  Doctors in general practice are constantly faced with patients needing psychiatric treatment. Too many doctors are ill-equipped to deal with such patients.  We should also have more psychiatrists attached to our prison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must come forward with an alternative method of financing health services.  He promised to consider an alternative method.  He did say he was investigating the matter, but he has not come forward with any alternative suggestion.  People generally are dissatisfied because of the high incidence of health costs on the rates.  The decision of Dublin Corporation last night is to be commended. <Col N="1926" /> The rates cannot bear the cost of health services any longer.  Central taxation will have to shoulder the burden in future.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider what will happen in the interim period between the passing of this Bill and its implementation. There was provision in the 1953 Act for aural, opthalmic and other services for those in the middle-income group but enabling legislation was never introduced.  In fact, it is being introduced only now.  In the interim will the dispensary service become more disorganised still?  It is in a deplorable state at the moment.  If a dispensary doctor takes a weekend off he has to try to run two practices the following week.  As one doctor said to me: &ldquo;It is like a bus driver who takes a weekend off and he is then asked to drive two buses the next weekend.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance was said to have agreed to the half-million necessary to pay for locums.  The money was never forthcoming and doctors now have to provide locums at their own expense.  If the money had been forthcoming a proper dispensary service would have been available all the time for the benefit of the people needing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make up his mind that he has got to come to an early agreement with the doctors about the method of payment to them, keeping uppermost in his mind the fact that doctors do not want the present very considerable hospitalisation costs. These are the biggest item in the health services at the moment.  The Minister will have to agree to a scheme which will uphold the dignity of the patient from the point of view of the doctor of his choice and the service he wants.  The Minister's ambition should be to give doctors every opportunity of practising good medicine in the interest of their patients and of keeping the patients as much as possible out of hospital.  Admission to hospital should always be the last resort and, where there is need for investigation, only if every considerable investigation possible has been done outside.  These are points he must keep in mind in his plans to reach agreement with the doctors.  The time for silence and secrecy about these negotiations is <Col N="1927" /> over.  He should be forthright about them.  I can see no reason for discussions in private.  Certainly, I do not think that, if they are carried out publicly, without this veil of secrecy, it will do harm.  I do not see what harm it could do.  I think it was used purely for political purposes.  Certainly, there are political motives behind the plan to hold them in private.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister gives us a draft of his proposals.  Despite all his talk with the doctors about keeping it private, he is very quick to send copies of his proposals to the national newspapers. Because of this, I should like to see the negotiations carried out without this veil of secrecy any longer.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an interim period between the passing of the Bill and its implementation, I would ask the Minister to see to it that extra doctors are appointed to our dispensary system in order to try to make our dispensary service operate satisfactorily in the interests of the patients who are suffering terrible injustice under the present scheme.  For his own edification, the Minister should visit some of the dispensaries in Dublin city.  I can assure him he would be enlightened and would certainly appreciate my way of thinking on these matters.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that we will pass legislation.  We should ask ourselves what we can do immediately and effectively to help those people who are in need, who are ill, and who are attending dispensaries and enduring terrible indignities and humiliations.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider and tell us what progress he has made in seeking alternative methods of financing the health service.  I think he has a duty to tell us this in view of the dissatisfaction of the public with present arrangements.  On that note, and with an assurance to the Minister that we will not oppose any measure that will help the people in need of medical attention, I shall conclude my remarks.  We shall not oppose any measure that will improve the lot of our people.  We shall strive at all times to further the interests of our people.</P>

      <P>We have a number of jobs that we must do as public representatives.  It is alleged that no advice is given in our health centres. A number of social workers are appointed to our health centres.  There are health nurses who are specially trained to meet the various patients that will come there.  There are the staffs of doctors and if a doctor is not to be found in the health centre he will always be found at his private residence. I want to be factual about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect Deputy O'Connell, a doctor, to be practical and not to present the House with a number of untruths.  Since it was created in 1960, the Dublin Health Authority has been very efficient.  It has done wonderful work in organising the hospitals and health centres and in the appointment of social welfare officers and doctors. Doctors who are trained for that type of work are given certain jobs.  To <Col N="1929" /> listen to Deputy O'Connell, one would think that nobody was doing anything and that those of us who had anything to do with the administration of hospitals were a heartless crew.  To listen to him, one would think that all we had to do was to raise our hands and that money would fall into them. Criticism is valuable but I abhor a misrepresentation of facts.</P>
    <P>We have given particular attention to the health centres.  We have welfare clinics with special nurses.  We have social welfare workers, also.  I want to defend the authority of which I am a member and to defend, also, the Department of Health who have cooperated with us in every way possible. Naturally, one would like to see more achieved but great strides have been taken in our hospitals in the past eight or nine years.  The general hospitals, as well as psychiatric hospitals, have been modernised.  General illnesses and psychiatric illnesses as well as dentistry are catered for.  There is an up-to-date dental unit in the new clinic which was opened today at Limekiln Lane.  To listen to Deputy O'Connell, one would think that our Government had no consideration for human beings.  It is sad to hear such talk from an educated man, a man who is himself a doctor.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to drugs. I remember that people were taking drugs years and years ago and that position will continue to the end of time.  Recently, there has been a drug scare.  There have been 29 admissions to a psychiatric hospital in this city, most of whom are men.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Health Authority has been doing all they can to look after the aged.  With the co-operation of their very efficient medical staff they have set a centre aside for this work, work which is not at all easy.  Deputies on the opposite side have been saying that it is easy to get drugs in retail and wholesale chemist shops.  They are completely wrong.  I will not say anything about people coming in from other countries to pedal drugs, to sell them in dancehalls, because the Department of Justice are dealing with it. The Minister for Health has set up a special committee to deal with that <Col N="1930" /> problem.  The Dublin Health Authority have set aside ten special beds in a unit which they have called St. Enda's.  In it we hope to give specialised treatment in an effort to cure drug addicts.  That work will go on.  We are meeting this problem as it arises.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Deputies to talk about what should be done for old people. In earlier days nobody could go to a hospital unless he was dying.  Today the whole trend has changed.  Relatives of elderly people are afraid to go out and leave them in the home without anybody to look after them.  Because of this concern increasing numbers of old people have been coming into the various homes provided by the Dublin Health Authority.  The general hospitals will not keep them unless they suffer from acute illnesses and they would be on the road if the health authority did not provide for them.</P>
    <P>This treatment of the aged is a huge problem, as my colleague across the House, who is chairman of the Dublin Health Authority, will appreciate.  Day after day we get letters and telephone calls asking us to get so-and-so into hospital, with the result that our hospitals are becoming overcrowded. We have provided a number of units for the aged, including those in the Connolly Memorial Hospital in a section which formerly was used for tuberculosis patients.  TB is now a disease peculiar to people aged between 50 and 70 who had earlier suffered from such chest illnesses as asthma and bronchitis.</P>
    <P>It is unfair, therefore, to blame the Dublin Health Authority, the Department of Health and the Minister.  All of us are trying to do our best to remedy a huge problem.  The Dublin Health Authority have set up a welfare branch to look after old people and today we opened an old folks' club in the Coombe to care for elderly people in that area.  Many of the people availing of this service come in suffering from malnutrition, having neglected themselves while living alone.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the voluntary organisations for the work they are doing in this matter.  For instance, the Meals on Wheels scheme has been bringing midday meals to those who are unable to <Col N="1931" /> attend the centres provided by the authorities.  The club opened in the Coombe today is second to none.  We have tried to make it as comfortable as possible.  However, the problem of caring for the aged is growing from day to day.  It is a problem in which I am especially interested.  This evening I got a telephone call from a man in County Dublin asking me if I could get his father into hospital.  The doctor attending him told him that there was a big waiting list.  This situation occurs day after day, week after week, throughout Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>I should like to see efforts being made to provide care for the aged more by means of home help, thus allowing sons, daughters and daughters-in-law to look after their parents at home.  It is much more economical to give younger relatives £5 or £6 a week, to help compensate for their inability to go out to work where there are old people to be looked after, than to send these old people to hospitals or other institutions at a cost of between £15 and £20 a week.</P>
    <P>Another problem we are trying to deal with is that our elderly hospital patients are living longer.  In St. Kevin's Hospital, for instance, when I was chairman of the Dublin Health Authority we had three people who celebrated their centenaries.  I suppose Deputy Ryan has the same story to tell about the present time.  The problem is becoming greater despite the tremendous help being given by social workers and religious organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell complained that patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals are never followed up afterwards by social workers.  One of the primary concerns of the Dublin Health Authority is to provide social workers to go to the homes of such people to try to rehabilitate them and to train them to be useful citizens outside. Great advances are being made in this work.  The same Deputy said that such patients have died on the roads.  People have died on the roads and people have died in this Dáil but general statements of that kind do no good and are aimed at discrediting the medical profession, the health authorities <Col N="1932" /> and the Department.  I can only conclude that the man who made that statement did so in ignorance otherwise he would not have made the statement.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prison service, cases are sent through the courts to a psychiatric doctor for examination.  We have special co-ordinating machinery operating between the Department of Justice, the courts and the hospital service.  The training of nurses and doctors for this type of specialised treatment is advancing daily.  The Department of Health have helped us considerably as have various Ministers for Health, including the present Minister. I hope this development will continue and that we will be able to continue to help these people in every way possible</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the problem, which I am sure has been encountered by other public men, of middle class people who through illness in the family or a death in the family are going hungry but who will not tell anybody about it.  In the Dublin Health Authority we set up a special social welfare department some years ago.  We are anxious to ensure that no member of our society will go hungry.  Some people are only too anxious to make representations for themselves but there are others who would sooner die than let anybody know they have not enough money to feed themselves.  I want to avail of this opportunity of thanking the people in our social welfare department for the work they have done in this regard.  They have done it effectively, not only from a charitable point of view but from an administrative point of view.  We are only doing what we should do in having such a department.  I welcome this Bill particularly because when it becomes law the costs of additional medical services will be borne by the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill regarding the choice of doctor.  With regard to the various working parties, this is a big task for public men and for the doctors and hospitals.  I happen to be on a few working parties co-ordinating the work of various hospitals and I must say our progress has been very slow.  The federated hospitals have been holding meetings for a long time and have been very slow to reach a decision. Quite a few members of the Dublin Health Authority are on that body and they are doing their very best. Public men have a more practical grasp of things.  We have no axe to grind except to provide the people with the best medical service we can give them.  We support any advances that have been made in our time for the betterment of our people, but we come up against a great deal of frustration.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made it clear that 50 per cent of the members of these regional boards will have to be public men.  I would nearly suggest that it should be 51 per cent, but I do not want to be quibbling.  Deputy Ryan and myself were on a working party which dealt with the Mater Hospital, the Richmond Hospital, Jervis Street Hospital and the Dublin Health Authority and we had many meetings trying to resolve how many members would be from the health authority and how many from the hospitals.  No matter what our political views are, we are most anxious to cooperate and to provide specialised hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a tremendous task and I do not envy him.  The operation of hospitals is costing a lot of money and one hospital is competing against another.  We have specialised hospitals dealing with such things as cancer and, of course, all hospitals have carried out successful operations for cancer, tuberculosis and other problems.  There is need, however, for a specialised hospital to deal with heart operations. There is a lot of overlapping in the small hospitals which results in great expense for the Department.  The <Col N="1934" /> greatest demands are from the voluntary hospitals and each year the capitation grant is going up.  They cannot help that.  However, as far as the Department is concerned, it is a big drag.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where people are looking for more specialised treatment.  We also have to consider the number of people kept out of hospital as a result of the specialised treatment they get in the health clinics. I am delighted to see in the Bill that provision is made for increasing the maternity allowance.  That will be welcomed by young married people. Another advance is that children can now be treated before going to school. A big problem in Dublin and with health authorities generally is the dispensing of drugs to the various health centres.  The dispensing of drugs is as well controlled as it can be by those responsible.  The provision in the Bill whereby there will be consultation between the Department of Health and the local authority in an area to see that drugs will be given more cheaply, possibly at wholesale prices, so that they will not be too expensive, is welcome.  These are our problems day after day.  The advances made in the Bill are very welcome.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to a free health service.  We should all like to see that, but I should like to know how it could be financed, seeing that it would cost another £50 million or £60 million or possibly £100 million a year.  We cannot get money from any source but the people: if they do not pay for it in the rates it will have to come from taxation.  But, as soon as a Government increase taxation to provide for this service, the Opposition will vote against the increase.  We must be practical and factual.  The idea of a voluntary service has been considered. Many of us are members of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme; many who can afford it do not bother; and there are others who cannot afford it.  However, if it could be arranged that every citizen would contribute some small sum towards the health services, it would relieve taxpayers and ratepayers to a considerable extent. The whole trend today is to depend more on State control, but if the <Col N="1935" /> Minister were St. Peter himself he could not get more money.</P>
    <P>Last night a certain decision was made by Dublin Corporation.  I do not agree with that decision.  I, along with other members of the Dublin Health Authority, went on deputations to the Minister for Health, who received us most courteously.  He went as far as he could, when he met the first deputation, and gave us £350,000 towards our social welfare section.  I do not know how he fared afterwards with the Minister for Finance.  Everybody must realise that, from a Party point of view if we were able to give another £50 million towards health services, especially in an election year, we would be fools in Fianna Fáil if we did not give it.  Some people outside think we have it and will not give it. But we are all politicians and we want to see our Party giving as much as possible so as to make it easy for us to get back here again.  We were never a Party to attempt to make the people pay exorbitant rates, but we must be practical.  We made representations and did our best to get all we could from the Department of Health, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  We failed because the Minister for Finance had no more money to give.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the Fitzgerald Report and I have found parts of it practical and other parts of it not so practical. I suppose everything is good until you try to put in into practice, but you find the flaws when you try to administer it.  In Dublin we are deeply concerned about all the hospitals we have and the various treatments afforded.  I can speak highly of the dispensary service, the doctors and nurses and the general practitioners. They are all doing a very good job and are most charitable people.  Yet, the co-ordination of hospital services is long overdue.  Anything we can do as <Col N="1936" /> public men we shall do it in an effort to give our people the very best and most modern treatment.  Even in the United States there is the same problem of soaring hospital expenses.  They are also trying to co-ordinate hospital services.  In our case it is a necessity. When we built regional tuberculosis hospitals we were able to give specialised treatment and now, thank God, very few young people are suffering from TB.  Only people advanced in years are now affected, according to what our chief medical officer has told us.</P>
    <P>Cancer is another big problem and anything that can be done to save our people from that dreadful scourge will, I am sure, be done.  Both St. Luke's and Hume Street Hospitals are doing excellent work.  Again, this is a case of specialised treatment and early diagnosis.  We hope that medical research will succeed in producing a cure for cancer.  Many years ago it was found possible to cure external cancer. Even an old woman in the Minister's locality had a cure for cancer of the lip in my young days.  Provided the infection was external much good could be done, but in regard to certain aspects of the disease there have not been very big advances except in cases of early diagnosis and treatment.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck with this Bill.  I have only spoken generally about the matters which concern us, without going into detail.  I hope when this measure is in operation it will be found to meet with general approval and be a help to all concerned.  The prospect of a free-for-all service is something that must await consideration as a separate item.  We must see exactly what we want and what increased taxation would be involved. Who will say we should impose it in order to provide such services?  When we reach that stage and when people shoulder their responsibilities instead of running away from them, only then can we hope to provide a free-for-all health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the concluding paragraph of his statement, said that the Bill was a highly technical document and that he was presenting it to the House as <Col N="1937" /> offering what the Government consider the most rational solution to a number of the problems which arise.  Stripped of its superfluous phraseology, this Bill offers little or nothing, despite what the Right Honourable Member from County Dublin has been telling us during the past hour.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, let us examine the advantages of the Bill if they may be so termed.  The main one is the choice of doctor but it was not necessary to have a new Bill to bring in that type of regulation.  That could have been embodied in the health legislation as it exists at present.  We are told that the maternity cash grant is to be increased from £4 to £8 and there is something in another section of the Bill about improvements in the supply of drugs.</P>
      <P>In making a factual appraisal of this measure these are all the advantages to be found but what about the debit side?  This Bill, in my opinion, sounds the death knell of the local representative and we all know the tradition of the local representative in this country. We know the work done by local representatives down through the years, both under the British system of government and under the Irish system since it was established.  Here, we have a Novotny style Bill which might have been drafted by the man who has taken over Czechoslovakia.  It is a Bill which takes all power from the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the Bill in detail and see what is happening.  First of all, let us address ourselves to the burning question of the hour&mdash;the difficulties and problems that have arisen in part of this country because of the local government representation and the system of local government voting.  The people of that part of the country believe that they are denied the right of fair representation on local authorities through the unfair voting system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate my remarks to the Bill.  In this measure known as the Health Bill, <Col N="1938" /> 1969, the powers of the local people through their local representatives are being filched from them by the Minister for Health with the connivance of his Government.</P>
      <P>I know very well, as do many others, that people of a professional type such as the Minister is, have always been opposed to the local representatives.  I am entirely against the administrative provisions of this Bill.  I am a firm believer in local democracy and, as I have said, this Bill is filching the rights the ordinary individual has through his elected local representatives.</P>
      <P>Health boards are to have a 50 per cent public representation and, as mentioned by Deputy Ryan, it is reasonable to assume that a percentage of that percentage will be Fianna Fáil people.  The Minister will appoint his own henchmen.  I do not know what qualifications such appointees should hold but, possibly, it would be an advantage to potential applicants to become members of the well-known Fianna Fáil organisation, the Taca group.</P>
      <P>We are told that in the first instance the Minister will elect the representatives from the medical profession and that later on, according to the Bill, they will be given that power themselves. Even a body constituted on that basis is not empowered to appoint a chairman or a vice-chairman.  The Minister for Health reserves that right for himself.  The Minister, according to the Bill, will appoint 50 per cent of the members of the hospital boards. Bureaucracy is taking over here.  We are leaning heavily on the system that is operating in eastern Europe at the present time and, as I said at the outset, this Bill is the kind of measure one would expect from the parliaments of countries where democracy does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The executive functions of a health board will be carried out by the chief executive officer.  In all applications for services of any kind under the Act, the board members will have no say whatsoever.  The Minister specifically mentions that it is not in order for any member of the board to bring to the notice of the board any individual grievance.  Therefore, an aggrieved person <Col N="1939" /> who, at the present time, could approach his local councillor, will have no business whatsoever in approaching the councillor when this Bill becomes law because this Bill gives the absolute right of bringing forward grievances to the chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>Is that what the Minister's Party term democracy?  This Bill has been produced by the legal profession who, as I have said, have never been favourably disposed towards local authorities and local representatives. I wish to speak as forcibly and as vehemently as I can tonight against this move to deprive the people of the services of their local representatives. It is all right for the Minister to say: &ldquo;Your rights are set down in the Bill&rdquo;. It is all right for some Deputies we have listened to recently to say: &ldquo;All those services are available to you by legislation. All you have to do when you require them is to make application and everything will be in order&rdquo;.  As everyone here knows, that is not the case. How many times have local councillors had to intervene on behalf of applicants denied services, possibly because in some cases they failed to mention certain factors?  Does the Minister now say that that should no longer be the case?  Do the legal profession not earn their living by making representations in court and by bringing forward factors in support of whatever case their clients have?  Do the people not bring their grievances to their local representatives?  Under this Bill all good county councillors, corporation members and others are to be deprived of that right.</P>
    <P>What about the number of members who will get on the new boards?  We have no indication of the size of the proposed boards.  It is all to be done by regulation.  This Bill is a mass of proposals set down in general terms to be implemented later by Ministerial regulations.  Nothing is spelled out.  It is left to the Minister, if and when this Bill is passed, to make regulations suitable to himself. The point I have been making is that we are moving away from democracy. We are moving away from the system we have known in the past, the system whereby local people go forward, offer <Col N="1940" /> themselves for election and after election have a say in the management of local affairs.</P>
    <P>Up to the present health matters could be said to take up at least one-third of the work of local representatives. Now the Minister for Health is removing this from them.  Perhaps it will not be too long until they decide to take matters concerning roads and housing away from the local representatives. Eventually, local authorities will disappear.  If the Government were to say frankly: &ldquo;Look here, we think local representatives have got to go. We propose to run everything from a central body and there will be no need for local representatives for the future&rdquo; then at least they would be honest about it.  But under this system they are doing it in a subtle way.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of Deputies and of the general public to this matter.  Who could approach the Minister in relation to this type of grievance?  If the Ceann Comhairle had a grievance concerning one of his constituents in Donegal is it not to the local county council he would go? Would he not go to the local people on the board?  Would he be likely to go to anyone else?  Everyone knows it is to the local councillor the people go. Democracy sets down that representatives must be elected by the free vote of the people.  When you put persons on a board without having been elected by the people, you are departing from democracy.  Such persons have not to go before the public and give an account of their stewardship.  In this measure you are giving majority rights in regard to health in the future to persons who have not been elected by the people.  This matter cannot be over emphasised.  I am making the case that to a large extent the question of civil rights enters into this, just as much as it enters into the Northern Ireland question at present.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Carter's views are in favour of or against the disappearance of the local representatives and the taking over of the health services in the dictatorial manner proposed in this Bill.  I feel this is not a good day's work.  I feel it is reminiscent of what is happening in countries where democracy no longer exists.  As I mentioned at the outset, this is a piece of legislation which would be more suitable to such Parliaments than to the Parliament of a free democratic country.</P>
      <P>What is likely to ensue from this power which the Minister will be given through the health board and through the hospital board?  Looking at this book <i>Outline of the Future of the Hospital System</i> we find proposals made by eminent men, but eminent men who are not sufficiently close to rural Ireland to know the problems confronting the people there.  Yet we can see these proposals being put into operation by Ministerial regulation when this measure is passed.  When it becomes law he will have power, through his 50 per cent membership on the hospital boards and through his henchmen who will be appointed on the other side, to do exactly as he wants and not act in a democratic way.</P>
      <P>In regard to hospital boards, surely a representative who gets a gift of that post from the Minister will not criticise the Minister?  While he is a member of a health board or a hospital board will he say the Minister is wrong? There is no question of his saying so. He will be there by virtue of the Minister appointing him and he will be a yes-man.  He will not contribute anything towards the board except to do as the Minister will dictate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the membership of the boards as proposed under this Bill.  For Deputy Carter's information the Bill states that <Col N="1942" /> the Minister will appoint 50 per cent of the membership.  Half the board will be appointed by the Minister.  One can see then what kind of board it will be. We are moving over now to the autocratic system; we are moving away from democracy.  That is what I have endeavoured to point out during the last ten or 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>Let us examine some of the results that may arise from this dictatorial system that it is proposed to implement through this piece of legislation.  Let us take the county hospitals that are to be wiped out or demoted or downgraded according to this report to, I think the official term is, &ldquo;rest homes&rdquo; or convalescent homes.  What will happen now to Bantry Hospital in my constituency? Is it likely that the hospital board will vote against the Minister's proposal?  On 14th December last in this House the Minister said he accepted, in principle, this report to downgrade hospitals.  I have been a public representative for more than 20 years.  Before I became a member of Cork County Council there was agitaton for a county hospital in west Cork. That agitation persisted and seven years ago the hospital was opened at Bantry. Now the Minister will be closing or downgrading the hospital that has served the people of the area very well indeed.  They are very satisfied with it and I challenge the Minister to come to any part of south-west Cork, even the part most favourably disposed towards his Party, and argue the case with me so far as the provisions in this Bill are concerned and particularly those which will wipe out or downgrade hospitals such as Bantry.  Bantry is not only one of course.  There are other hospitals throughout the country. There are a number in the midlands; there is a hospital in north Cork, Mallow, which I understand served the people of that area very well.</P>

      <P>There is another at Mullingar.  This is a big question. This hospital in Bantry could be called a newly-opened hospital.  It has new equipment and an excellent staff who are giving satisfaction.  When it satisfies <Col N="1943" /> the people, I do not see what else is needed.  Fortunately we have little or no complaints so far as treatment in that hospital is concerned.  This Bill deprives the local representative of any worthwhile say in ensuring that Bantry Hospital will maintain its present standard never mind being upgraded.</P>
      <P>However, it could be said&mdash;to use a term that may not be parliamentary&mdash; that Fianna Fáil have been a bit cocky of late.  They think they cannot be replaced.  They have the feeling that they will be over there for an indefinite period of time.  As a result they want to assume the mantle of dictatorship. Some of the Ministers have been there for a relatively long period and they are becoming stale and arrogant.</P>

      <P>I mentioned a while ago one of the most important functions of any health authority, that is, to deal with individual applications for medical cards, for hospitalisation or for dental, opthalmic or other services. I want to emphasise again the dictatorial attitude behind a Bill in which it is provided that it will not be justifiable for any member of a health board, a hospital board or a committee established under the Bill to make reference to any individual application. <Col N="1944" /> That is so important that I must find where it is contained here and read it out for your enlightenment, Sir, and show you what it is the Minister for Health is trying to get through the House.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about what is going to happen when this measure becomes law so far as individual applications are concerned.  It reads:</P>
      <P>However, where, under the new Act or otherwise, a specific statutory function is given to the chief executive officer, the board and its committees will not be empowered to take decisions or to issue directions to him about the discharge of that function.</P>
      <P>They cannot issue directions to him. He will be some kind of infallible person.</P>
      <P>In general, the functions on which the board will be limited in this way will relate to decisions on cases&mdash;such as eligibility for services or on the supervision of staff.</P>
      <P>The supervision of staff and the provision of services&mdash;they cannot direct him on that.  All power is being withdrawn. It has been filched in this Bill.  The position is much worse indeed than it is now in another part of the country where they are speaking about the voting system in local elections.  Will Members of Dáil Éireann&mdash;granted members of the Minister's Party must answer yes&mdash;be satisfied?  Are there any Fianna Fáil TDs who are not satisfied with this position?  Are they satisfied to give bureaucracy this power, to deprive those who have to be elected by the people of any say?  Here in the city of Dublin, with its more than 600,000 people, many of whom must avail of health services, as in other parts of the country, once this measure becomes law it will be useless for a person to go to any councillor with a grievance because the councillor is being deprived of any right or any say under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine and think over <Col N="1945" /> another chapter of the Minister's statement.  He states: &ldquo;You have power to appeal against the decision if you are not satisfied with it.&rdquo; The chief executive officer is supposed to be the man who will make the decisions except when he delegates power to other officers.  The Minister tells us: &ldquo;If the chief executive officer were to refuse Mary Murphy's application for dental services, or to refuse her application for a medical card, she can appeal and her appeal will be determined by another officer of the board.&rdquo; Here is a funny situation.  I am sure <i>Dublin Opinion</i> could base a useful cartoon on it.  When you make an application to one man in the office, one executive officer hears it and turns it down, according to the Minister he will then nominate some other officer of the Board to determine that appeal. Do we not know well what will happen?  What will happen is that one officer will say the other man was wrong.  He will in my hat.  This is nonsense of a high order.  It is the type of nonsense we have been getting from that stale, arrogant crowd over there, the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Who says this will improve the health services?  Where are the improvements for the person who is sick, the person who is lame, the person who is blind or the person suffering from any ailment?  Where are the improvements? They are meaningless improvements so far as that section of our people are concerned.  We hear a lot of talk about our elderly folk.  I know very well that the elderly people present a big problem.  In this country, possibly more so than in other countries, unfortunately, a sizeable percentage of our population is in the over-70 age group.  Many of them have to receive institutional care.  I was attempting to solve that problem myself in a proposal I made to the health authority in Cork, which, however, did not see it through.  I said that an obligation rested on public funds to help those of our people who through physical or mental illness cannot provide for themselves, with particular reference to our elderly and incapacitated people, such as bedridden men and women, and unfortunately we have a big number of them in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> I suggested that they should be entitled to apply for and get a disablement allowance when their right to it was determined by the appropriate authority.  Apparently our county manager said that should not be the case, even though it was provided for under the 1953 Health Act.  I forced the issue in Cork and 40 members of the health authority supported me originally that this was sound commonsense and that it would help to relieve the burden on public funds but, when it came to the final stage, I regret to say that that support did not exist except in a small way.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the case in support of my argument.  If John Murphy is 70 years today and he has 100 cows, if he assigns the farm to his son and keeps not more than £50 for himself and his wife, he is entitled under our regulations to a non-contributory pension of £3 5s per week.  That is what the law of the land allows him.  I do not disagree because I can see that with our social welfare code it is not possible to differentiate between a person with that type of means and an old lady living in wretched conditions in a hovel.  All she gets is £3 5s a week also.  I claim, therefore, that the health authority should help her.  That was my proposal and I fought for it over a number of years at meetings of the Cork Health Authority, with a view to getting payment of allowances to people who resided with incapacitated people or neighbours who helped them and cared for them in their own homes.  It would then be the obligation of the health authority to come in and help.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Burke telling us about the number of homes he has visited during his public life.  I have no doubt that he has visited many.  I am sure that he found what I found on all occasions that, irrespective of what the county home is called, whether it be St. Charles' or anything else, the people are not satisfied.  The old people in the homes I visited would much prefer to be in their own neighbourhood living out the winter of their lives amongst the people with whom they were brought up.  They would be much happier and much more contented if <Col N="1947" /> they got a disablement allowance of £3 7s 6d a week to supplement their old age pension.  Would not this be cheaper and better than the present position where in some district hospitals it is costing public funds £16 a week to maintain these people?  Is not that a reasonable argument?</P>
    <P>When this Bill was announced I took it for granted that there would be some guarantees in it for our old people, who constitute our biggest health problem, but there is nothing in this measure which makes it mandatory on these bureaucrats who are being set up under the Bill to ensure that such allowances will be paid.  I am making the case that the functions of this Bill will be administered mainly by the Minister and the bureaucrats who will be appointed.</P>
    <P>I am reading the funny pieces in this book entitled <i>The Health Services and their Further Development</i>&mdash;funny pieces in the light of what is happening at present.  The Minister states that the officers of the board will be responsible for the financing of all projects, that they will hold the purse and that, by virtue of holding the purse, they will be able to direct the executive officer as to how he will work.  What is happening in Dublin Corporation?  They are holding the purse, too.  What happened when they did not act according to the dictates of the Minister?  What happened when they said: &ldquo;We will not give you this £800,000 extra which Dublin Health Authority require.  On a former Minister's assurance that was to come from the Central Fund?&rdquo; What good did their holding the purse strings do then?  We shall soon know because if the election is held in the not-too-distant future nothing will happen, but if the election does not come for a long time they may be dissolved.  The Minister is smiling.  If the Minister and the Government persist in the dictatorial attitude they have adopted about such matters, Dublin Corporation could cease to exist tonight; but possibly with the election pending some other way out will be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred before to the collective responsibility of the Government.  &ldquo;All for one and one for all&rdquo; is the motto of Fianna Fáil. It is a secret how many boards there will be or what areas will be covered. The only reference in the Minister's statement in introducing the Bill is to the effect that we may have eight boards.  We do not know whether that is so or not.  We do not know whether Cork city and county will be deemed to be of sufficient size to warrant one board.  But my mind moves back now to one of our senior representatives, Deputy MacEntee, when he introduced here in 1960 this unified Health Services Bill which established boards in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin. We were told then by the Minister that this was their final word on the administration of the health services and the provision of additional services, and that once this Bill became law and that once the health authorities to be established under it got under way everything in regard to health would be settled.  Only nine years afterwards another Minister says: &ldquo;No.  Things have not worked out as we thought.  We have to change this.&rdquo; We have special sections here wiping out the Cork Health Authority, wiping out the other authorities, and, as I have said five times over in these remarks, giving the Minister and his appointees power to take them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that the Department is paying more than 50 per cent of the cost, I should be quite satisfied if the Minister had a representative or two representatives on a health authority, but surely there is no justification for a Minister saying that because the public funds, through taxation, are bearing more than 50 per cent of the cost he has the right to 50 per cent of the representation?  Were it not that this is a move, as I mentioned earlier, to wipe out local democracy and local bodies, the same kind of case could be made for representation on county councils.  I thought Fianna Fáil had changed so far as the appointment of non-elected members to boards is concerned. I remember when Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture introduced a measure here providing that more than 50 per cent of the members <Col N="1949" /> of committees of agriculture should be elected members of councils, but when the Government fell out with the NFA and other farmer groups, Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, said in 12 months time: &ldquo;We made a mistake.  What are we going to do?  In Deputy Smith's Bill we are giving these fellows who will not have to face the electorate an opportunity of being members of the committees of agriculture&rdquo; and it was changed overnight.  I thought at that time that the emphasis lay on public election, but it is quite evident that, so far as the administration of Fianna Fáil is concerned, expediency is the main motive behind every move.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a few questions. The choice of doctor is one of the items on the credit side of the Bill, an item that could be introduced without any Bill at all, by means of short amending legislation.  I should like an explanation of this statement by the Minister at column 1637, volume 239, of the Official Report of 16th April, 1969:</P>
    <P>An eligible person would, subject to certain restrictions&mdash;mainly as to distance&mdash;be allowed to register with any participating doctor willing to accept him and would be allowed to transfer to another doctor after giving proper notice;</P>
    <P>Persons could be assigned to a participating doctor where this was necessary;</P>
    <P>There would be control on entry by doctors into the service.</P>
    <P>If a person, say, living in a village wants to register with a doctor in a town 15 miles away is he allowed to do so?  The Bill does not say so.  The Minister says he is likely to make regulations restricting such a person from availing of this service because, according to the Minister's opening statement, the main hindrance is as to distance.  As regards the control of entry of doctors into the service, supposing four doctors are operating in a particular town at the present time, is there a likelihood that if all four opted to enter the service all four would not be accepted?  If that likelihood exists, <Col N="1950" /> then to my mind there is not a choice of doctor; in fact, according to this measure, a person could be assigned a particular doctor.  I should like the Minister to define what he means by this paragraph I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>As regards the charges for services, under section 15 of the present measure any middle income group person entering hospital for treatment knows that the maximum daily charge is 10/- per day.  Under this Bill there is no charge spelled out.  This is to be done by regulation.  I do not think it is right of the Minister to take that power unto himself.  He should state specifically whether or not he thinks the 10/- rate is obsolete, whether or not he will have a rigid means test, whether or not he will send assistance officers to families in the middle income group inquiring about the number of cows, hens, or anything else they may have.  Is that the system he proposes under this measure?  It is not a system that commends itself to me. Indeed, I believe the present system under which everyone knows what the inclusive maximum charge is per day is the better system.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has his eye on the voluntary hospitals.  I believe he has it in mind to bring them to heel a little.  The voluntary hospitals depend largely on public funds.  Most of their patients are paid for out of public funds.  These hospitals have played a very important role down through the years.  Their services generally are well up to standard.  Many of those staffed by religious have given outstanding service to the community.  I should not like to see their freedom of action taken from them.  I do not believe there is any general demand for that. If the Minister interferes in the management and administration of these voluntary hospitals the likelihood is that he will worsen the position instead of improving it.</P>
    <P>So far as district hospitals are concerned, they are catering mainly for the aged chronically ill.  I am not at all satisfied with the system under which they operate.  Admissions and discharges are more or less the gift of the doctor or matron for the time being.  Though the hospitals are maintained <Col N="1951" /> from public funds they are administered in a private sort of way and the result is that some people are admitted and others wait for years. Still others are never admitted at all. The system should be examined.  Most of the cases in these district hospitals would be social cases.  They are there because of lack of means.  The only additional income available to them would be home assistance.  I think it is very unfair&mdash;I have been hammering this home in the Cork Health Authority for years&mdash;that the only financial help available to people in the winter of their lives, after a lifetime of service and hard work, should be home assistance. I do not reflect on home assistance, but there is a stigma attached to it.  Because of that stigma many refuse to accept it.  Surely these people could be paid a disablement allowance? Whether the allowance comes from rates or taxation, or partly from both, is of no consequence; no one would object to such an allowance being given to these incapacitated people.</P>
    <P>The treatment of mental ill-health is of paramount importance.  Clinics staffed by competent psychiatrists should be provided.  There should be domiciliary treatment, if possible; anything that will keep people out of institutions is to be commended.  There was domiciliary treatment for tuberculosis patients and it was very successful. Some people object, of course, to attending clinics because they do not want the neighbours to know but, by and large, the numbers attending at clinics are increasing.  Any mentally disturbed person should have treatment. Clinics should be established and patients should be encouraged to attend them.  If some refuse to attend some other method of treating them should be devised.</P>
    <P>So far as the larger mental hospitals are concerned there is urgent need for elimination of the big wards holding 70 or 80 patients.  There is no justification for wards of that size.  There should be wards holding not more than 10 or 11 patients.  That will necessitate more staff and more supervision, but the provision of such staff should not be beyond our competence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> I am pleased to note that some improvements are being effected in that direction in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork.  I have been a member of the committee there for more than 20 years and I know every nook and corner in the building.  I am fighting all the time against large wards.  If people were to see so many housed in such a congested fashion, it would be enough to create a disturbance in their minds.  I am asking here, then, that particular attention be paid so far as our mental institutions are concerned to the partitioning of wards, to reducing their size.  It is completely inappropriate to have wards holding 40, 50, 60 and more patients.</P>
    <P>I have examined closely the advantages of small institutions with particular reference to the hospital known as Saint Ann's, Shanakiel, Cork.  That hospital, with a complement of some 120 beds, was opened to the public some three or four years ago.  It is one of the most modern psychiatric units in this or, indeed, in any country, I would say.  It has a number of private wards for special cases.  The general wards are usually small and the complement of patients in most of them is small.  Everything is laid out in an exceptional manner.  Undoubtedly, a patient receiving treatment in such an institution has a much greater chance of recovery than one would have in, say, the main old building or in the old mental institutions that still exist. I agree that chronic patients are not suitable to be housed in such mental hospitals.  Smaller institutions such as Shanakiel, with sitting-rooms and restrooms which compare favourably with similar rooms in any modern hospitals, represent a great step forward and undoubtedly, taking Cork Health Authority hospitals into comparison&mdash; Our Lady's and St. Ann's&mdash;the difference is vast.  It ranges from the low end of the scale, so far as some of the old buildings in the main part of the hospital are concerned, to the lavish surroundings of the recentlyerected modern unit there.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of providing small units where it is deemed necessary to establish mental homes in the future.  However, with all the medical advice that is available to the Minister <Col N="1953" /> and with all the advances that are claimed in the field of mental illness, one would anticipate a reduction in the number of people requiring psychiatric treatment but, unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.  One would think, also, remembering another phrase of Deputy P.J. Burke about our affluent society, that if, as he states, we are much more affluent now than we were in the past, that should ease tension and possibly result in a reduction in the number of persons requiring institutional care for mental illness.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for prolonging the debate but even though I said at the outset that there was nothing in the Bill I think it is right that Members should address themselves to all aspects of the health services.  Even though some may deem it unnecessary to speak at length, each member of the House is entitled, in discussing this measure, to address himself to all aspects of the health services.</P>
    <P>The problem of mentally handicapped children was an exceptionally heavy problem in Ireland in the not too distant past and to some extent is so today.  I appreciate the problems confronting parents in County Cork who have mentally handicapped children and the great burden they have had to bear in caring and nursing such children and in endeavouring to provide some type of education for them.  I appreciate the many fruitless calls they make on various people for help in getting institutional care for these unfortunate children.  Such care was available only in a very limited way.  But, in recent years, thanks to the Polio Association in County Cork, and to the very active committee in charge of it and, indeed, to the very active secretary of the committee, Mr. Bermingham, great strides have been made in the provision of accommodation for mentally handicapped children in Cork city and county.  The advances made are far in excess of what would have been made if the problem were left to the Department of Health or, indeed, to local authorities to deal with.  Great relief has been given to parents by their children being taken to homes in the city and cared for in an excellent way and trained, in so far <Col N="1954" /> as it is possible to train them.  The work of that organisation for the care of mentally handicapped children cannot be over-emphasised.  The association deserve any support or help that can be given to them from central or, indeed, local funds.  I have particular regard for the very capable chairman of the association, Canon Bastible, as well as for the secretary, whom I have already mentioned.  Canon Bastible was one of the main movers in this worthy enterprise for the provision of accommodation for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I want information from the Minister as to why he has left home assistance with the local authorities.  Is it only because local home assistance is a local charge and the Minister does not make any contribution?  However, I am doubtful if this is a wise move because our allowances, or the allowances that would be payable, say, by a health board, are in many instances supplemented by a home assistance allowance.  That being the case, I think that one body, irrespective of which body it is, should manage or control both allowances.  It is quite evident, of course, that the health board is going to control the disablement allowances. Much as I dislike handing over powers to this type of board which it is proposed to set up, I do not see any great advantage in segregating the administration of both allowances, leaving one with the health board and another with the county councils.</P>
    <P>Another service I should like to refer to&mdash;I do not wish to hold up the debate much longer&mdash;is the availability of blind welfare allowances.  Before 1960, when we had separate health authorities in County Cork, all blind people who qualified for the maximum old age pension and who were so certified, automatically qualified for the maximum blind welfare allowance.  At that time contributory pensions did not exist.  Blind people in West Cork were financially much better off then than their counterparts are today.</P>
    <P>When the Cork Health Authority came into existence they changed that system to a more niggardly one.  Such applicants were in many instances refused any assistance and in others only small allowances of 10/- or 12/-a <Col N="1955" /> week were conceded.  Those of our people who are suffering from this great affliction, possibly the worst, should not be dealt with in such a niggardly fashion.  Those who were entitled to the blind pension should automatically qualify for the maximum blind welfare allowance without any means test whatsoever.  The number involved is not great.</P>
    <P>Another matter which will not be affected to any great extent by this measure is the disabled persons' allowance. The opportunity should have been taken here to adopt a more liberal approach to applicants for such allowances. I appreciate it would cost money but, as I have stated again and again, those of our people who are incapacitated are entitled to our consideration.</P>
    <P>I have stated already that an exceptionally bad feature of this measure is the power it gives to the Minister and his boys in the public service.  It wipes out the powers of the local representatives. It is dictatorial and totalitarian. I do not like that because it will play havoc with the functions of local representatives and with our health services.  Henceforth we will be directed by the Department, by people who need not present themselves for election.  The public representative is being demoted, downgraded like the county hospitals, as suggested in the hospitals survey book to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is frightening to think of what may happen under this legislation to people who may have legitimate grievances. They will have no redress.  I am damn sure that if any of them calls on the chief executive officer of the health board he will not be seen because these executive officers will not be available to talk to individual applicants even during working hours. Public representatives were glad and willing to see them even after hours.</P>
    <P>I am fearful about some of the proposals in this hospital survey book. I do not see much danger of some of the outlandish suggestions in it being implemented but we must appreciate the power the Minister is being given under this Bill and the composition of <Col N="1956" /> the health boards.  Therefore I call on those interested in retaining county hospitals throughout the country to make their voices heard if they want to keep those hospitals.  In view of what is in the Bill, in view of the Minister's pronouncement on 14th December last about hospitals such as those at Bantry and Mallow and those mentioned by Deputy O'Hara, there is grave danger that those hospitals will be downgraded.</P>
    <P>This measure casts aside the people and implies that it is only the bureaucrats who know what is good for them. The proposed new system bears a close resemblance to that which obtains in Eastern European countries where the State directs the citizens and where the citizens' views are not taken into account.  This Bill seeks to implement a similar system here.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks that this is a measure which would qualify for introduction in many East European countries which I have visited and where the citizen is cut out. Therefore I wish to repeat and to emphasise the statement I made at the outset that this is a move to wipe out local representatives.  It is a dishonest move in that direction and if it succeeds it is reasonable to assume that in the not too distant future the system of local representation which has served our country and our people so well will be abolished altogether.</P>
    <P>They are the only comments I have to make on this measure.  Of course, everybody agrees there should be choice of doctor.  It did not take a Bill of 40 pages to tell us that&mdash;this kind of wanton waste of words and phrases, superfluous in every respect.  When, in the name of heaven, will we bring Bills into Parliament in simplified language?  A person who wishes to obtain this Bill must send three shillings to the Government Publications Sale Office in order to find out what he is entitled to.  Where will he find it in the Bill?  We are following the old British system in the way in which we present and draw up measures here.  In some cases this has helped some of our brethren in the legal profession because, in order to clarify questions that have arisen on <Col N="1957" /> sections or subsections of Acts, we have had to go to these learned gentlemen and sometimes through them to the courts.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to support this Bill and I have given a number of reasons why it should not be supported. I am in agreement with the abolition of the dispensary system, which we have had for too long.  It led to too much discrimination and many who had to avail of the system were not getting the service they should have got.  So far as other matters in the Bill are concerned they could easily have been brought in by way of regulation. We were led to believe that an allembracing Health Bill would be introduced. I need not detain the House dealing with the Cork Regional Hospital for which no sod has yet been turned and will not be turned for some time.  I have made my views on that position clear a number of times. Possibly this Bill has been brought in as an election measure.  People were anticipating health legislation and the Minister expects that all that they will take cognisance of is that there is new health legislation and it is supposed to be of marked advantage to them and that may help Fianna Fáil over the election hurdle which confronts them.</P>
    <P>It would be quite easy to describe this Bill in the words used for the title of one of Shakespeare's plays: &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rdquo; but the trouble is that it would not be an apt description. The main feature of the Bill is that it is taking from the local representatives power and giving it to the Minister and to the bureaucrats in the administration of the health services. That is a big feature in this Bill and I hope there will be protests about it. I hope that everybody who is anxious to keep open hospitals in local centres will protest.  I did not refer very much to Bantry Hospital because I expected that it would not be downgraded and that no hospital board or authority would allow that to happen, but under this Bill it can happen as it can happen in Mallow and in the other nine or ten centres mentioned in this Bill.  It is about time that local people, particularly those not having the Fianna Fáil label, told Fianna Fáil what they think <Col N="1958" /> of this Bill so far as it relates to administration.  I hope that at the next election the people will bear these facts in mind, whether the election comes in May, June, October or April, and that as a result of all the accumulated effects of such blunders the Minister will not be on that side of the House to propose any further legislation.  However, I hope at least the Minister will be here, if he is fortunate enough to escape the electorate.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed with this Bill, so are the people and particularly the people of the Minister's native county, Mayo.  I had hoped that the Minister would have brought in a Bill which would have improved our health services, but if we are to accept this measure I am convinced that we will be going into reverse gear.  I am saying that having been elected to Mayo County Council for the past six years and having had experience of the methods by which hospitals are administered not alone in my own county but in other counties.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that it is a retrograde step to take away powers from elected representatives.  The people will regret this step which is being taken by the Minister.  I agree that the Minister is trying to take dictatorial powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us was elected to our local councils without having to go before the people to get their vote and the fact that we have been elected for one term after another is proof that the people were satisfied that we discharged our duties honestly and faithfully. It should be remembered that the members of the various county councils are, in the majority, members of different political Parties, and of course we also have independent councillors. In the main these people are of some standing in the community. They have had the confidence of the people and if they had not got that confidence they would not have been elected.  This is a grave reflection on councillors throughout the country, many of whom have served voluntarily for years without a penny reward, and not only that, but in many instances with serious losses to themselves, having to spend their time away from <Col N="1959" /> their businesses, their farms or professions. I have known and worked with these people of different political persuasions.  I have seen them spend from 11 o'clock in the morning in many cases until 11 p.m. or perhaps until 2 a.m. the following morning at council meetings debating problems that arose in the various institutions within their responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the old days the problems were much more serious than now.  We had the tuberculosis problem.  I remember when first elected to Mayo County Council that we had about 300 or more patients on the waiting list and we had no suitable accommodation for them where they could be treated medically and nursed.  We had to tackle that problem and also the problems of mental health and extensions to institutions.  We had to discuss with our medical and nursing staffs the various day-to-day problems that arose. Nobody will deny that the system operating for some years past has, in the main, given satisfaction.  Certainly, I shall not be convinced by the Minister or anybody else that a board which is appointed as to 50 per cent by the Minister and has certain other appointees, probably people with little or no experience of the running of institutions, will give confidence to the people that the Minister is travelling on the right road.</P>
    <P>I am aware that when people become ill they like to go to their local doctor.  They may also like to consult a local councillor and if he is not of their political persuasion they can always travel or send a note to a councillor some distance away who is, perhaps, a member of another political Party, and ask his advice. When one considers the experience these councillors have gained through the years, one realises that help and advice is appreciated by the patients. We should remember that applies particularly in rural areas.  The Minister, like myself, comes from a rural area and must know the feelings of those he represents since he was reared among them.  I think that the people who elected the Minister to the Dáil will be very disappointed if this <Col N="1960" /> measure becomes law when they realise the type of measure it is.  They will not be convinced that this is the type of legislation that is likely to give a better health service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy has long experience also of the running of hospitals in Cork city and elsewhere and gave us the benefit of that experience.  I emphasise that I agree entirely with the points made, and when I say I agree with him let it be understood that we are both speaking from practical experience. This proposal is an insult to the elected representatives who have served voluntarily and furthered the cause of the sick and the needy through the years.  The fact that they are now being scrapped and that boards will be set up of persons, many of whom will not be known to the people at all, will shake confidence in the whole health system. I have no doubt of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter, a great friend of mine on the opposite side, this evening interrupted Deputy Murphy to remind him that this is a great measure, or words to that effect.  Not so long ago Deputy Carter was very critical of a former Minister's proposal to close down Longford District Hospital and transfer the patients to Mullingar.  He made a very important point that these people come from different towns and townlands such as Drumlish and Newtownforbes and many other towns and villages west and north of Longford town.  He said it would be completely against the grain for these people to be taken by ambulance to Mullingar 25 or 27 miles away.  He said he was opposing the move and would continue to oppose it bitterly.  He pointed out, as I have done, that those he represented would be entirely against the change, that it would create many problems for his neighbours and that he would do everything in his power to prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>I was surprised this evening&mdash;I have great respect for the Deputy&mdash;to hear him say by way of interjection that this was a good measure for our people and that for all practical purposes he could recommend it to the House. Roughly, that was the sum total of his <Col N="1961" /> interjection.  I could not understand this about-turn or see that things have changed so much within two years.  He must have been indoctrinated by his Party since he expressed himself here in other terms on previous occasions in my hearing.  We know that part of the cure of patients is to have them happy about their doctors and nurses.  Above all, when they must avail of institutional treatment they should be happy about the surgeon, the physician, the nurses and everybody else.  Generally speaking, they like to be within a reasonable distance of their homes where neighbours can visit them when they go to town for shopping purposes. That is a great help and a great benefit to sick people.  I myself had five years in hospital on one occasion and I know how much it meant to me when some friends came in to pay me a visit for a few minutes.  It helped to pass the day.</P>
    <P>If we adopt the principle that is embodied in this Bill of providing big regional hospitals for groups of counties, while we may in certain cases effect economies, the whole thing may defeat its own purpose.  Far from having the effect that all of us would desire and, certainly, that the patients who enter these institutions would desire&mdash;the hope of being cured&mdash;it will have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I believe that it will cause panic in the country and the people will be totally dissatisfied with it when it is fully explained to them, as it will when the election comes, if not before.  It is a great insult to the elected representatives of the different political Parties and to independent members of county councils who, down through the years and without any reward, have given of their services and talents&mdash;big businessmen, solicitors, teachers, small farmers and others who pooled their knowledge and worked in co-operation with their county managers.  It is an insult to members of health staffs, doctors and nurses who, as the Minister knows, in County Mayo, succeeded in improving the services and in clearing the long waiting list of TB patients.</P>
    <P>It is true that it has been costly, <Col N="1962" /> but one cannot count the cost when it is a matter of trying to provide the best health services.  Speaking of money, I must say that I am convinced that much saving could be effected in many hospitals throughout the country if we introduced better business methods into hospital administration.  Economies could be effected in every institution under public health authorities without regionalising our hospitals if only we got down to the fundamentals.  I am convinced there is much waste and a certain amount of overlapping and that a lot more could be done to effect economies if the Minister took the necessary steps to see to it that some of the methods employed in the running of our institutions were changed.</P>
    <P>I have it on reliable authority that a considerable amount of drugs which were being used up to two, three, four or five years ago and which were considered to be outdated or, at least, not up to modern standards or requirements, were dumped.  It happened in a number of cases.  Therefore, I believe that the method of requisitioning drugs is very loose and needs to be tightened up.  I am not speaking of any institution within my own county but I am speaking in a general way when I say that, in my opinion, the method of storing drugs in many of our institutions should be improved.  It is a matter that should be checked on with great speed by the Minister or by his officials.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, too, that economies could be effected in many other ways. We have a system to which I have referred here before and which I have mentioned many times in Mayo County Council.  It is the system whereby certain doctors and surgeons have the right to private beds for their patients in certain institutions as part of their remuneration.  I condemn that system, as I condemned it before in my local county council.  That system lends itself to abuse.  It lends itself to a situation in which the rich can get early admission to these hospitals because they are in a position to pay.  Let it be understood clearly that the nurses who work in these private sections where these patients are accommodated get no private fees for the extra attention they must give to these <Col N="1963" /> people who, as I say, belong to the wealthy classes.  That creates an atmosphere in which it appears that, if one wants to get the best that is going, there is one way of getting it and that is by paying for it.</P>
    <P>That fact is generally accepted by the rank and file of our people when they are going into institutions.  They believe that, if they hold a medical card, they will be regarded as third-rate citizens and that they will get only third-rate treatment.  But I must say, in fairness to the doctors I know in my own locality and throughout the country, that it would not be true to say that they give these patients anything that could be regarded as third-rate treatment.  They do as much for them, in so far as I know, as they do for the wealthiest in the land.  For that, I gladly give them full marks and full credit.</P>
    <P>I do not wish it to go abroad that I am alleging that any private general practitioner in my area would refuse treatment to any person if that person did not have any money, but the fact remains that, because these doctors claim the right to have their own patients in these institutions, an atmosphere is created in which a lot of people believe that to get proper service one must be able to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I have fought for the abolition of this system for many years and the statements I made were misrepresented by the newspapers, particularly the local newspapers.  My statements were twisted and changed and at one stage there were a number of doctors who were not even on speaking terms with me.  But, as time went on, they discovered that what I had said was not intended in any way to be personal and that I had not referred in any way to their personal integrity, so that for many years now I have been able to live and work with these men.  It would be far better, in my opinion, if, instead of giving them 11 or 12 beds in the county hospital in Castlebar or Galway or in any other county, those surgeons and doctors were properly remunerated.  If they want £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 a year, or whatever they are entitled to, we should be generous with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> Proper control should be exercised over beds, medicines, tablets and all the rest of it.  It is quite natural, if everybody is drawing from the medicine chest tablets, bandages and bottles of this and that, we would be in the poorhouse in this city or in any other town in Ireland.  If things were run in that way we would not last long. Auditors come around to carry out inspections and they would be concerned about this.  We have them in Mayo and I am sure they have them in other counties.  I refer to these things because I feel there is need for tightening up, but there is not anything in this Bill which will help in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another thing we should remember is the striking of the rates.  My own county is the highest rated county in Ireland and it is also one of the poorest, although perhaps not in the Minister's part of it.  Some of the parts I represent are very poor.  I refer particularly to Erris and Achill as well as some other more congested areas.  In those areas are poor people who find it hard to meet the rates demand.  In the present year they were broke trying to find money to meet the rates. Now they find that health services will run to as high as 46/- or 47/- and there is nothing in this Bill which will have the effect of reducing by even a farthing the rates in Mayo.</P>
    <P>In Dublin they have reached the stage where they have refused to strike the rate.  I am not going to say anything about that but it should be borne in mind, and the Minister should know this well, that the people of Mayo have really made up their minds that they have reached the limit.  In fact, we have gone beyond the limit; but we had the courage to strike the rate because it was felt that, if we did not do so in relation to health, we would probably deprive many of our people of the services which we feel they are entitled to.  If we have to economise, quite frankly I would not like to think we would start to economise on health. It is the very last item that I should like to economise on.  We have to bear in mind, first of all, the responsibility we have to our people and, secondly, the fact that the Minister's Department <Col N="1965" /> give us a very substantial contribution roughly in accordance with the rate we strike locally.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is nothing in this Bill which would encourage our people to look forward with the passage of time to a reduction in health charges. We are now reaching a situation, if this Bill becomes law, in which we must pay our share of taxation but can no longer ask any questions about how the money is being spent.  Our elected representatives, no matter from what side of the House they come, will no longer be able to answer questions about how the money is being spent. We will have to turn to people who will know very little about the matter. They do not have to face the people at election time like the other people on county councils have to.  I am sure when those councillors face the people at election time they will tell them the truth&mdash;that they got a demand from the board and were told: &ldquo;Like it or lump it, that is the demand&rdquo;.  At the same time they have to ask the people for support to elect them to a council which has lost, so far as this matter of health is concerned, all power and all authority.  We will have to tell them in future that there is to be a board composed of a number of elected representatives, some medical men and some having a mixture of this, that and the other.  Those will be known as regional boards.  We do not know anything about them.  That is a most unsatisfactory situation, in my opinion, and it is the direction in which the present Minister for Health is travelling at the present time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the smaller hospitals.  We have a number of them in Mayo.  One of them at Swinford was the old fever hospital. Thank God, we have got rid of some of those fevers due to the advances in medicine and supervision in regard to water and sewerage.  Because of this the health of our people has improved generally.  We have not now got the old fever hospital at Swinford. We have in its place a new 40 to 45 bed modern hospital, which is run by nuns.  I think the matron is a nun but there are also lay nurses there.  As the Minister knows, they derive the <Col N="1966" /> greatest satisfaction from their work. They know all the patients.  Many of my neighbours and, I know, many of the Minister's neighbours go down to that hospital.  They spend a week or two there and after treatment they are able to return home.  They know they are only 10 to 15 miles away from their own locality.  On market days and fair days the neighbours drop in on them.  They bring them some fruit or maybe a drink and this is of great benefit to the health of those patients. It gives them confidence that they are being well looked after and that they are among friends.</P>
    <P>The matron, the nurses and the doctors know every patient by name, be it John, Pat, Mary or Margaret. They know the relatives and friends of every patient.  In such an atmosphere the patients feel very happy. That little district hospital and also one which is run by another doctor, who will be nameless, is well-known to the Minister.  This other hospital is near the boundary.  The patients there all have the benefit of their neighbours visiting them.</P>
    <P>This type of hospital is very good for the purpose of treating minor illnesses. But, according to a statement read out by Deputy M.P. Murphy, it is now proposed to economise by closing down that type of hospital or, in certain cases, having old people in them.  There is need, unfortunately, at present for more accommodation for old people.  Thousands of our neighbours have gone to England and taken up employment there.  Hundreds of them have settled down and got married.  For a while they were able to come back to look after the old people but, now that they have families of their own and jobs where they must watch the clock, they cannot do this. We know that the number of old people is increasing annually.  It might surprise the Minister to hear that, even as a member of Mayo County Council, I failed to get a person into the County Home in Castlebar.  I rang the matron and she told me that the place was packed.  The people who asked me to make representation could not understand it and I could not myself.  If any attempt is made <Col N="1967" /> to close down these institutions it will come as a shock to people all over the country.</P>

Perhaps it is a matter of pounds, shillings and pence without any consideration for the health of our people.</P>

      <P>From what Deputy Murphy said and from my own knowledge I know that there is to be an attempt to regionalise.  I fear that it may be in the Minister's mind to close down some of those institutions.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that that will not happen in places likes Swinford, Ballina&mdash; which is being extended&mdash;and Belmullet. Speaking of Belmullet, it is a strange thing that, although we are short of beds in Mayo, Belmullet Hospital is being used as a county council office and, I think, the district court sits there.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs when there is urgent need for that hospital to be in good working order and properly staffed to serve the Erris region.  In future I suppose I will not represent that area but, nevertheless, I have a duty to mention it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell said that implementation of the Bill will depend on agreement with doctors and chemists. <Col N="1968" /> It will depend on the goodwill of doctors and, I suppose, of chemists to a lesser degree.  At least one or two Ministers for Health have tried to create the type of atmosphere necessary to ensure that any Bill such as this would benefit the people we aim to help.  It is true that the present Minister is leaning over backwards in an effort to create a better climate than existed heretofore between the Minister for Health and the doctors. I feel obliged to say, in passing, that we owe a lot to our medical men and nursing staffs, religious and lay, nurses in voluntary hospitals particularly.  I value, and I am sure the general public and Members of this House value, the wonderful service they have given down the years, in times when money was scarcer and beds were scarcer and they had to make do in many ways.  An old nun in Swinford who is still, thank God, with us and must be nearly 100 years of age, told me that the only method she had of heating water in the old hospital in Swinford was a tar barrel on a turf fire in the backyard. They did wonderful things in spite of those difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in this Bill which will take our dental service out of the doldrums.  In Mayo however we have built on good, solid foundations.  Some years ago a county dental officer was appointed.  He left and another man was appointed in his place.  We are under-staffed to the extent of two or three dentists.  I am aware that in other parts of the country dental services are not all they should be.  I am convinvced that the salary or conditions or something must be wrong when we are exporting our dentists to London, to the United States and to the four corners of the earth. The Minister should communicate with some of those people and ask them what has brought them so far from home.  They are prepared to help in other countries, and we do not grudge that, but our own people should come first.  Dental health is of the greatest importance.</P>
