      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Transport and Power, who is indisposed, I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £500,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, <Col N="610" /> 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this supplementary estimate is to provide an additional £500,000 to enable Bord Fáilte to pay grants in respect of development works carried out in hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation.  The original provision for this purpose was £1 million which was voted as a grant-in-aid under subhead F.3 of my Department's Vote but this sum has proved insufficient to meet all the commitments that have arisen this year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the tourist industry has made considerable progress during the 1960's and the 1968 earnings of £93 million were more than double those of 1960.  This expansion has been brought about by a deliberate Government programme involving the investment of considerable sums through Bord Fáilte in development and promotion.  Accommodation is of course a key area in tourism and here we have been very fortunate in having an hotel industry which has geared itself to the Government's development programme and has undertaken expansion and improvement to meet the needs of the increased traffic.</P>
    <P>The hotel industry, in undertaking development works, has had the benefit of cash grants and interest grants from Bord Fáilte, as well as allowances for tax purposes in respect of capital investment. The Bord Fáilte grant scheme is operated on a flexible basis so as to provide maximum encouragement to projects which best meet the needs of the modern tourist in terms of location, standards and price.  In this connection, the scheme takes special account of the position of the west which has so much to gain from tourist development but which is in some ways unattractive from a commercial investment viewpoint because of the more scattered local population and the lack of off-season business.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the accommodation development programme and administering the grant schemes Bord Fáilte make estimates of the additional number of bedrooms required taking <Col N="611" /> account of the rate and pattern of traffic growth, the increased capacity provided on transport services and the projections for future traffic increase. They must take account also of a certain amount of annual loss of accommodation which arises for various reasons, for example, hotels closing down or being converted to other purposes, reductions in the number of bedrooms through reconstruction and improvement works, etc.  On the basis of all this information and the assessment of market demand, the board prepare annual growth targets.  During the period covered by the Second Programme for Economic Expansion the target for hotel bedrooms was an average increase of 1,200 rooms a year. In fact, the number of additional rooms fell behind this figure and for the four years 1964 to 1967 there was a net shortfall of over 2,000 bedrooms.  This could have led to a serious shortage of accommodation in some areas during the summer months were it not for the fact that a promotional campaign led to the rapid expansion of supplementary accommodation.  Welcome as this development is, there are forms of tourist traffic such as group travel and organised package holidays which require adequate blocks of hotel accommodation. In order to secure the necessary development, the scale of the financial incentives was improved in 1967.</P>
    <P>The improved incentives, accompanied by an easing of credit restrictions and a growing confidence in the future of Irish tourism, have led to an increase in the rate of investment. A further development has been the employment of more advanced methods in the planning and execution of hotel projects.  The result of all this has been that the number of new hotels and the number of extensions and improvements to existing hotels which have been completed and have fallen due for grant payment in the current financial year have exceeded the assessment made when the estimates were being prepared over a year ago.</P>
    <P>This has meant that Bord Fáilte have been unable to meet all the grant commitments arising and hoteliers who entered into development works in <Col N="612" /> good faith have been waiting for their grant moneys.  This in turn has affected builders and other firms providing services to hotels.  It is in these circumstances that the need for a supplementary estimate has arisen. The additional sum involved, £500,000, is the minimum amount necessary to enable Bord Fáilte to meet the immediate and inescapable commitments&mdash; those cases where works have been satisfactorily completed and certified and where a grant payment must be made in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The increased investment stimulated by the 1967 improvement in the incentives has meant that the deficit in room numbers that I mentioned earlier has now been overtaken.  A net addition of 2,050 rooms in 1968 and an estimated 3,200 in the current year has meant that the shortfall has been eliminated and we are now somewhat ahead of target.  This does not of course mean that we should change over to a policy of discouraging development.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry has been recording very significant growth and the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development calls for continued expansion at the rate of six per cent per annum at constant values&mdash;a rate considerably higher than that projected for the economy as a whole.  Our tourist programme is based on the achievements of that growth rate.  It would be folly to devote State moneys to attracting additional traffic from abroad and to invest heavily in the expansion of travel facilities unless we ensure also that visitors' needs in hotels, guesthouses, etc., are adequately met.  The additional bedroom growth which we have recently recorded provides only a modest margin and with tourist traffic expanding regularly there is so far no danger of over-development.  Nevertheless the incentive scheme and progress thereunder is at present being reviewed. It was suggested recently that Bord Fáilte targets may possibly be too high. Bord Fáilte have had an objective professional study of the position initiated and a preliminary report indicates that expansion at or in excess of the Bord Fáilte estimates is required.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that it would be wrong to call a halt to hotel development. <Col N="613" /> We must, of course, be selective in this matter and for that reason the Bord Fáilte incentives are operated on a discretionary and flexible basis so that the development programme will be carried out in a balanced and rational way.</P>
    <P>I feel there may be some misconception about the general pattern of our hotel development.  There is a belief that the bulk of new accommodation takes the form of large new hotels operated on an impersonal basis without adequate regard to Irish traditions of service and hospitality.  This is far from being the case.  In administering the grant schemes, Bord Fáilte favour the provision of extra accommodation through the extension of existing hotels where possible, because the family hotel with its emphasis on informality and friendly service is an important element in our tourist industry.  A large number of hotels throughout the country have in fact availed of the grant scheme to extend and improve their premises.  The response in the western countries, where higher maxima apply, has been particularly good and out of a total of 3,556 additional hotel bedrooms provided in 1967 and 1968, 2,394 or 67 per cent were provided by existing and new hotels in the west. Of these 2,394 rooms, 1,008 were in extensions to existing hotels and 1,386 were provided by 46 new hotels.</P>
    <P>The average size of the new hotels was 32 bedrooms.  The same pattern emerges from an analysis of projects now in the pipeline.  There has of course been a considerable rise in hotel standards also.  This is in keeping with rising standards generally and is exemplified by an increase in the number of rooms with bath from 1,160 in 1960 to 8,163 in 1969.  Overall, a satisfactory rate of expansion and improvement has been established which should enable us to continue to cater for a growing tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Prices are an important factor in tourism and our hotels and other tourist services have been affected by rising costs just like all other enterprises.  I am assured that by international standards our prices are quite competitive but we must ensure at all times that our prices represent good value for <Col N="614" /> money.  Some European countries which have got a reputation for high prices have seen the consequences in a declining tourist trade.  I would echo the recent appeal by the president of the Irish Hotels Federation who urged hoteliers not to take the easy way out by automatically passing on increased costs through raised prices but to absorb as much as possible of the increase through more efficient operation.</P>
    <P>As the programme for development of holiday accommodation is part of a general programme for tourist development, it might not be out of place for me to say a few words about the tourist industry generally.  Our general objective under the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development is to secure an annual growth rate of six per cent at constant values.  Within this overall objective, Bord Fáilte are seeking a significant increase in off-season traffic with the ultimate aim of achieving an acceptable level of year-round tourism.  It is in the interests of all elements of the tourist trade to secure maximum utilisation of our resources and of course the benefits of year-round tourism in terms of more stable employment will be obvious to everyone.  I am glad to say that the tourist industry is united in this aim and that all sectors are co-operating in the measures necessary to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the current tourist programme is the growing significance of car ferry traffic.  In the 10-month period January-October, 1969, 108,000 cars were brought in on the direct car ferry services, representing an increase of 22 per cent on the corresponding period of 1968.  This year we had the benefit of the new Cork/Swansea service as well as increased capacity on other routes.  Next year, capacity will be further increased and British Rail will be providing a new service between Dún Laoghaire and Heysham.  A welcome feature is that three of the existing car ferry services are operating on a year-round basis and it is hoped that by 1971 all the services will be operated all the year round.</P>
    <P>With the general recognition of the economic value of tourism, there has also come an increasing awareness of <Col N="615" /> its social and cultural aspects.  I think it is important that we should recognise that tourism is a pervasive influence and it behoves us therefore to exercise careful discernment about the pattern of tourist development.  We do not have in Ireland the type of attractions which appeal to the mass market and I consider that it would be a mistake to try to provide them.  We have, however, unrivalled facilities for motoring, general sight-seeing and a whole range of recreational and other special interest activities.  The discriminating visitor appreciates what we have to offer in Ireland and is particularly attracted to remote but scenic areas. Thus he makes less demand on organised or man-made facilities and at the same time advances the redistributive effect of tourism by bringing additional income to less-populated areas.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the end of 1969 but I am afraid it is not possible yet to make any reliable assessment of this year's tourism earnings.  Figures for the first eight months of the year show that inward passenger traffic from Britain and Europe increased by 7.2 per cent over the corresponding period of 1968 and traffic from North America increased by 26 per cent.  The overall increase for these areas was 8.8 per cent.  I should point out, however, that estimates of traffic from Northern Ireland are not yet available and it is to be expected that returns from this sector will have been affected by the disturbed situation in the north. Furthermore, the overseas publicity on the Northern Ireland situation has probably affected traffic from other areas in the later months of the year. I would expect therefore that when the official returns are available from the Central Statistics Office, they will show that we have fallen behind the Third Programme target of a six per cent annual growth rate.  Prospects for 1970 are also dependent on the situation in the north.  However, given peaceful conditions in the north and assuming that no other unforeseen adverse circumstances arise, there are good prospects that we will achieve tourism targets in 1970 and secure continued tourism growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> The continued development and improvement of our stock of holiday accommodation to meet market needs is an essential part of our tourist development programme and accordingly I commend the supplementary estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this supplementary estimate provides an opportunity to discuss the very important aspect of what is fast becoming our most important industry.  The sum of £500,000 is for the purpose of meeting certain grant commitments.  The Minister, referring to the planning and execution of hotel projects said:</P>
      <P>The result of all this has been that the number of new hotels and the number of extensions and improvements to existing hotels which have been completed and have fallen due for grant payment in the current financial year have exceeded the assessment made when the Estimates were being prepared over a year ago.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of the tourist industry to our economy&mdash;we are now approaching the £100 million mark in tourist earnings&mdash;and its contribution directly and indirectly to our balance of payments, it is deplorable that a proper assessment could not have been made when the Estimate was being prepared.  It is a bad state of affirs that a number of people who built extensions to their hotels and who were eligible for grants should have been left waiting for the grants for a considerable time.  This is indicative of very bad planning and very poor foresight.</P>
      <P>My information is that the grants outstanding at the moment extend to some £750,000 and I should like to know why, when it was felt necessary to introduce a supplementary estimate, that an Estimate adequate to meet all the outstanding grants should not have been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to holiday accommodation grants, it is extremely difficult for Members of this House to express a considered opinion on the subvention for accommodation grants because the information available to us from Bord <Col N="617" /> Fáilte reports and other sources, and even from the Minister's introductory speech this morning, is totally inadequate. The Board Fáilte report is remarkable for its brevity.  There is just one column in it under the heading &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; which gives the total figure for accommodation grants. Bord Fáilte pays a substantial sum every year by way of holiday accommodation grants.  I cannot understand why they do not give particulars in this respect in their annual report similar to those in the report of An Foras Tionscal where details of grants for industrial projects are clearly stated.</P>
    <P>It is now two years since Members of this House have been afforded an opportunity of debating the tourist industry. It is over two years since the last annual Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power was discussed here : last year there was no time to do so.  As this year is now drawing to a close, it looks as if we shall not have an opportunity for such a discussion.  Despite these comments and criticisms, the provision of adequate and suitable accommodation is a most important factor in our tourist industry.  There has been a tremendous increase in the accommodation available for holidaymakers.  According to the latest figures from Bord Fáilte 93,000 persons can now be accommodated nightly in premises registered or approved by Bord Fáilte.  Still more accommodation will be necessary to meet the demands of the 1970s.  That is particularly so in view of the larger type of aircraft and the car ferry service.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister says here, despite what seems to be the general opinion, despite the Bord Fáilte report and even the Third Programme, in relation to the holiday needs of the future, it is extraordinary that the president of the Irish Hoteliers Federation should have stated at their recent annual general meeting that we must call an immediate halt to the building of new hotels if we are not to continue the downgrade in our servicing.  The president said he made that statement deliberately.  He said that the most important work we have now to do is to raise the physical and operational standard of our existing hotels and <Col N="618" /> guesthouses and provide in them the amenities which the present-day visitor demands.  He said that when this has been done we can continue with the provision of new hotels.</P>
    <P>The reason the Hoteliers Federation are concerned about the building of new hotels hinges on the shortage of qualified staff which is perhaps the most serious problem affecting the hotel industry.  I am glad that provision is now being made at official level for improving and extending facilities for the training of hotel workers.  This problem has not been tackled in a realistic fashion in recent years.  In the past ten years we have doubled the amount of holiday accommodation but no provision was made at the same time to improve and extend training facilities for hotel staffs.  The Minister did not refer to that problem this morning. I understand that discussions have taken place between Bord Fáilte, the hoteliers and guesthouse owners and the Department on the subject of staff training.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some general comment in relation to the development of the tourist industry.  He pointed out that group travel and organised package holidays are becoming the order of the day.  In recent years there has been a vast change in the tourist trade pattern.  The greatest demand now is for the &ldquo;package holiday&rdquo;.  With the improvement in car ferry facilities, more mobile tourists will come here and that, too, will pose problems of hotel and guesthouse accommodation. Persons who bring their cars to this country or hire cars here will travel extensively throughout the country and very often such persons will go into the more remote parts.  It has been noted in recent times that parts of the country which could not be termed tourist centres have had more and more tourists because, perhaps, of special natural attractions in those areas.  In the light of these factors, I wonder if we are providing the type of accommodation these people require.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the lack of adequate information from Bord Fáilte in relation to hotel development and in relation to the manner in which grants are allocated.  I should like the Minister to indicate the criteria or <Col N="619" /> priorities which influence Bord Fáilte in allocating grants for particular types of holiday accommodation.  While the Minister may not wish to state the amount of grants which have been paid to any individual, I see no reason why he cannot give a breakdown in the figures, indicating particularly what proportion of the money paid in grants, what proportion of this £½ million, has been paid or will be paid to people who provided additional accommodation in luxury and four star hotels, what proportion went to the medium type hotel and what proportion went to guesthouse owners.  Surely this is information to which we, as Members of this House who are expected to approve a supplementary estimate for £½ million, are entitled?</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of holiday accommodation, a number of serious problems have come to light in recent times.  The Minister referred to one or two of these problems. Spokesmen for the Irish hoteliers have expressed concern at the extent to which the State has become involved in the hotel business.  In recent times we saw the Aer Lingus link-up with Ryans Tourist Holdings.  We have also seen proposals for the development of motels by CIE and its subsidiary Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.  There was also the recent announcement by the Minister of State involvement in a proposed new hotel at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>It is my considered opinion that the private sector of the hotel industry should be encouraged and assisted in every way possible to meet the accommodation needs of the future.  I also believe that the private sector of the hotel industry has not been assisted up to the present as it should have been assisted, because the present system of grants and other inducements is not adequate to enable the private sector to make the maximum contribution to the development of the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>There is another serious flaw in our manner of assisting the development of hotel and guesthouse accommodation. There is no proper method available of assisting the highly qualified hotel managers.  We have quite a large number of people who were trained at the <Col N="620" /> Shannon Hotel School and other places, who are highly qualified, and whose ambition it is to become owners of hotels.  I agree entirely with recent public statements made by representatives of the hotel industry that the absence of a proper credit corporation for the hotel industry is a serious drawback. I would urge on the Minister the advisability of examining the possibility of setting up some type of credit corporation which would enable highly-qualified young managers to open their own hotels.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with a number of these people.  In most cases these young highly-qualified hotel managers are interested in opening the smaller family type hotel with 20 to 30 bedrooms. There is a demand for this type of accommodation, where there is personal supervision by the owner, and where staff problems are not so acute as in the large hotels.  We should concentrate more and more on developing this type of accommodation.  I sincerely hope that, before long, a proper organisation will be set up to provide the financial and other assistance necessary to enable young Irish hotel managers to become owners of hotels.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of hotel accommodation, as a matter of priority our policy should be to make it possible for the existing hoteliers and guesthouse owners to extend and improve their accommodation.  This should be a top priority in the provision of holiday accommodation.  Secondly, something on the lines of the Industrial Credit Company or the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be available to enable people who are interested in setting up their own hotels to get the necessary financial assistance at a reasonable rate.  In addition to grants and other incentives which are available at the moment, they should be able to obtain the necessary long term loans at a reasonable rate of interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of extending the tourist season. This, of course, is a very important factor in the future development of the tourist industry.  I am very pleased to note that Bord Fáilte have been giving special attention to the problem of <Col N="621" /> extending the tourist season.  A new task force has been set up with responsibility for developing what has now come to be known as year-round tourism.  There are a number of difficulties in the way of extending the tourist season.</P>
    <P>However, recent figures indicate that the spring and late autumn are periods which hold out considerable scope for expansion, particularly in the matter of special interest holidays, conferences and based holidays.  There has been a considerable growth in the number of holidaying anglers coming into the country, particularly people from Great Britain who are interested in coarse angling.  One of the big advantages in the development of this type of special interest holidays is that the visitors can pursue their special interest outside the peak tourist season.</P>
    <P>Another priority which Bord Fáilte have adopted in their efforts to increase year-round tourism is the development of conferences and also the development of further student traffic, and I also note here in a special memorandum issued by Bord Fáilte that the board are now paying special attention to the development of ethnic traffic.  I am developing this point in relation to the fact that we are now asked to approve a supplementary estimate for £500,000 for the provision of additional holiday accommodation.  There is not much point in providing extra holiday accommodation if we cannot ensure the maximum utilisation of this extra accommodation and, as I said, Bord Fáilte are paying special attention to the problem of extending the tourist season.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points which the Minister made and which he did not develop fully.  He said that Bord Fáilte are seeking a significant increase in off-season traffic with the ultimate aim of achieving an acceptable level of year-round tourism.  I do not know what progress has been made, and again in the absence of statistical and other information, it is virtually impossible to comment on this.  There was a problem which arose last year and the early part of this year because Bord Fáilte a year ago decided to allocate the maximum portion of their advertising budget to the <Col N="622" /> development of off-season traffic.  This was quite successful but it seemed to have the effect of reducing the number of people who were coming here at the peak period.  All the emphasis of advertising was on encouraging people to come here in the off-peak season and there seemed to be an imbalance in this regard.  Although the Minister has not said so in his speech, I understand that rather than aiming at advertising and promoting off-season traffic the aim now is to promote year-round traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister also refers to the growing significance of car ferry traffic, stating that in the ten-month period, January to October, 1969, 108,000 cars were brought in on the direct car ferry service representing an increase of 22 per cent on the corresponding period of 1968.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that our tourist industry has tremendous scope for further development.  However, there are certain problems which will have to be tackled particularly in relation to staff training to which I have already referred.  There is also tremendous scope for the development of holiday accommodation on the lines of small hotel, guesthouse and farmhouse holiday accommodation and particularly the more recent development of cottages for renting.  I am glad to know from the Bord Fáilte report that the provision of farmhouse accommodation has shown a very good rate of progress and that there are now 1,905 registered farmhouses providing accommodation for holiday makers which comes up to the Bord Fáilte standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent scheme, known as the rent-a-cottage scheme, promoted by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company to provide cottages for renting to tourists is proving to be a very great success, and recently in reply to questions in the Dáil it was stated that it was the intention to provide these cottages in various parts of the country. I regret that in his speech this morning the Minister did not make any reference to it, but I do not know whether <Col N="623" /> any of the money we are now asked to vote in this supplementary estimate is going towards the financing of this cottage-type accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is growing criticism of the lack of information available in the Bord Fáilte reports about the development of the tourist industry in general. There is a lack of information on future needs, particularly in the matter of the accommodation we were discussing this morning.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in future estimated demands for holiday accommodation will be accurate, that we shall not have a situation occurring, as has occurred, where people extend their premises to provide additional accommodation, having been given an assurance that they would be paid the normal level of grant, and then find that when the grants fall due for payment there is no money available.  I am pleased, as I said at the outset, that steps are being taken now in this supplementary estimate to pay part of the grants outstanding, but I am surprised that the Minister did not go the whole way and make provision in this supplementary estimate for the payment of £¾ million which is the sum due to the hoteliers and others who undertook this expansion work with the approval of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my regret at the temporary indisposition of the Minister.  The obvious comment to make about this comparatively large supplementary estimate is that seasoned estimators would not make the same error.  Deputy O'Donnell has drawn attention to certain defects in the Minister's speech. Certainly there is a lack of specific information in it.</P>
      <P>The sentence:</P>
      <P>The additional sum involved, £500,000, is the minimum amount necessary to enable Bord Fáilte to meet the immediate and inescapable commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>suggests that there are very much larger commitments lurking in the background, but that Bord Fáilte cannot put this particular commitment on the long finger.  I am fully in agreement <Col N="624" /> with the Government bringing in this supplementary estimate, instead of putting the matter on the long finger.  The case is made in the Minister's speech that the experience of Bord Fáilte in preceding years has been such that they could not be quite sure that what was being put forward would be carried out.  This under-estimate of 50 per cent is an extraordinary error to be made in view of all we hear about economic forecasting nowadays.</P>
    <P>This expansion has been brought about by a deliberate Government programme to develop and promote tourism.  I do not decry in any way what has been done by Bord Fáilte. I think the claim about the necessity of supplying accommodation is justified. The tourist industry throughout the western world is a rapidly expanding one and we are bound to get our share of it.  Credit for the development and promotion of tourism should be given to the community in general as well as to Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, and it was pointed out to us by people writing in a friendly fashion, it was thought that our hotels would price us out of the tourist business. Inflation has caught up with that, but the cost of staying in a good hotel for one or two nights horrifies me.  Up to a few years ago prices in hotels such as the Shelbourne and the Gresham gave fabulous value to people who were used to travelling in Europe and the United States.  They are not such fabulous value now.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the problem of staff and there is no doubt that this is a serious matter.  The Government and Bord Fáilte are to be commended on their efforts to remedy the situation.  A good few years ago I had a very bad experience in a grade A hotel in the west with regard to the way it was kept, but I am quite certain that things have changed.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the necessity for building comparatively large hotels because of the development of the package tour.  I used to wonder why people went on these tours, but having taken a package tour to Italy, I think it is a wonderful thing.  One does not have to worry about anything; one makes a single <Col N="625" /> booking and in that way one can have a real holiday.  Certainly, the package tour has a great deal to recommend it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said at the end of his speech that most people come here for a quiet holiday and to see our scenery. Certainly, compared with other western countries we have a great poverty except in Dublin of artistic treasures and architecture.  All we have are the remains of a former civilisation.</P>
    <P>Many British people come here for a motoring holiday and the provision of guesthouse accommodation is a great advantage to them.  It means they can enjoy a long day, until about 10.30 at night without having to worry about where they are going to spend the night.  At the height of the season it can be very difficult.</P>
    <P>We have been endeavouring to lengthen our tourist season by promoting holidays in September and October but I think the beauty of this country in the month of May could be the subject of a promotional campaign which would bring forward the beginning of the tourist season.  We must not be complacent about our tourist industry. We have had the benefit of two remarkable years climatically, something that does not normally happen here.  People who came here in 1968 tended to return in 1969.  In many parts of western Europe it becomes too hot in midsummer whereas we get the most wonderful weather; it is ideal for people whose home countries are very hot during the summer.  That is particularly true of the Americans and there is no doubt that climate was the main factor in this tremendous increase in the American tourist traffic this year.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that interests me personally from the point of view of accommodation.  It is the high standard of accommodation and the excellent meals provided in farm guesthouses.  I notice that foreigners are more numerous in these than our own people.  I suppose, where our own are concerned, families tend to take a house at the seaside and business people tend to go to hotels.  As I say, foreigners were very numerous in these excellently run farm guesthouses.  Those who run them are to be congratulated on the standards and the very moderate prices.  Except <Col N="626" /> for this remarkable error in estimation &mdash;one might, perhaps, make some quips about the verbiage, about words like &ldquo;shortfall&rdquo; and so one&mdash;there is nothing against this supplementary estimate.  This development is very desirable.  Additional accommodation should be provided.  Having had two very good years it is only natural that the demand in the coming year will be even greater.</P>

The earnings of our tourist industry in 1966 were £93 million, a big change in our time. As I have often said, great things have happened in our time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the greatest of all as far as Bord Fáilte is concerned.  Bord Fáilte has contributed in no small way to redressing our balance of payments position.  The former Minister for Transport and Power and his predecessors before him were instrumental in the great advances made in our tourist industry.  These are matters for rejoicing on the part of all who are true nationalists.  We were told in 1945, when we were trying to get the tourist industry off the ground, that we were bringing in foreigners to eat our food and that the hotels we were building were white elephants. <Col N="628" /> A great many of those who held that view at that time have changed their minds since.  They have become more enlightened.  Indeed, I saw them opening hotels a few years afterwards.</P>
      <P>We look forward to an even greater future now.  Hotel accommodation and guesthouse accommodation have increased enormously.  It is important that our tourist industry should continue to expand and prosper.  It is important that everyone should do his best to ensure that the tourist industry is not killed because of overcharging. This is the great danger.  A country can price itself out of the market.</P>
      <P>A few years ago when I was in a certain European country they were charging £7 for bed and breakfast in what I thought was not a very good hotel.  These people have suffered as a result.  One of the reasons why I am speaking this morning is to appeal to our people to realise that they should not kill the goose that is laying the golden egg.  Tourism has contributed up to £93 million to our economy and it helps employment.  Every hotelier and guesthouse owner must try to sell Ireland to visitors.  I emphasise the necessity for people to realise that here we have something that can be developed in time to perhaps twice or three times its present magnitude.  No matter what party is in power this is essential.  The standard of our hotels has improved and I hope will continue to improve.  I trust that the courtesy of staffs will be maintained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said that we were getting what western Europe was getting and that people were travelling more nowadays.  People will not travel if they do not get accommodation and service.  There are certain countries that one visits and would like to see again; there are others that one does not want to see again.  It depends very much on the impression a visitor gets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see guesthouse and farmhouse accommodation being extended all over the country.  I hope this will continue to expand because many people are anxious to avail of the opportunity it offers.  A high standard should be maintained.  I have heard favourable comment from Continental <Col N="629" /> people who stayed in farm guesthouses and are coming back and bringing others.  That speaks for itself. It is also important that transport personnel, the gardaí and even the people in the street should play their proper part in impressing on foreign visitors that they are welcome here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the excellent work that has been and is being done by Bord Fáilte but I hope the Minister will assure the House that the somewhat disturbing allegation made by Deputy O'Donnell is not well-founded.  The allegation was that Bord Fáilte had entered into commitments for approximately £750,000, and on the basis of these commitments people went ahead with hotel building and extension of existing accommodation and now find they are not being paid as quickly as Bord Fáilte undertook to pay the grants.  If that is true it is not good for the hotel business or the tourist industry because it would discourage future development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan mentioned that the Government claim that by their deliberate programme we have achieved rapid progress in our tourist industry.  This implies that the Government are taking full credit for the position.  I do not necessarily agree with that.  If it is true I am sure the Government would concede that there have been outside factors over which they had no control also helping this development.  Following this statement in the Minister's speech he referred to the situation in the north as being responsible for what appears to be the case that we will not reach our growth target of six per cent.  If they claim all credit they must accept responsibility for the lack of growth this year, irrespective of whatever they may try to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have a tendency to concentrate far too much on the American market.  American tourists are welcome here and spend a good deal of money here and have helped our tourist industry considerably but our concentration on the American market has resulted in the neglect of a much nearer market which could be much <Col N="630" /> more lucrative, the British market. The average American who comes to Ireland is, in many cases, fulfilling a lifelong ambition.  These visitors are not, as some think, all millionaires and considerable financial sacrifice and saving are necessary to enable them to travel this great distance particularly if they come from the west coast of America, 6,000 miles away.  They help considerably by occupying hotel accommodation but their spending money is very limited and most of it is spent in America before coming here.  They come on package deals. They do not spend in our country as much money as does the average worker coming from Britain for a fortnight's holiday.  We will get him year after year if we treat him properly, not just once in a lifetime.</P>
    <P>We have neglected this market to our cost.  Bord Fáilte should concentrate more on it.  I had occasion to meet some employees of Bord Fáilte not only here but abroad and not as a Deputy but in another capacity and it should be said that the success which we have had is very largely due to the dedication of these people whom we do not hear about, whose names we do not know.  They are the people in the field, having direct contact with travel agents and people like that.  I was impressed by them.  They have rendered and are rendering a very great service to this country by not just occupying jobs but by their genuine dedication to Ireland. This might possibly be because they are no longer resident in Ireland and feel that special attachment to the country which people not living here but from here have.</P>
    <P>The question of prices has been mentioned on a few occasions.  This is a very important factor.  France which had a great tourist industry finds that they are tending to price themselves out of business and the same thing, but not to the same extent, is happening in other European countries.  This is something we should be very conscious of.  One of the great contradictions of the warnings issued by Government spokesmen concerning prices is prices at Dublin Airport.  I asked a question here 12 months ago of the Minister responsible, who is the Minister standing <Col N="631" /> in today.  He assured me that the prices at Dublin Airport compared favourably with other places in the city of a comparable nature.  I have since checked on this and I am convinced that prices in the restaurant at Dublin Airport are exorbitant.  This could be one of the first impressions people get of our country when they arrive and go in to have a meal or one of the last impressions they get when leaving and find that they are, in my opinion, being rooked.  This is something in which the Government have a direct say.  The Minister responsible should look more closely into the prices in the restaurant at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>I can only describe as hypocrisy one statement in the Minister's brief.  At page 7 the Minister quite rightly states: &ldquo;The discriminating visitor appreciates what we have to offer in Ireland...&rdquo; One of the attractions we have got for a large number of people is our architecture, particularly in Dublin.  We have this statement made by a Government Minister acknowledging that we have certain types of attractions for the discriminating visitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Chair is pointing out is that the supplementary estimate is confined to a particular heading and that matters of general interest would arise on the ordinary Estimate for the Department. The supplementary estimate is confined to the provision of a sum for extra accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not challenging your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but extra accommodation will only be necessary if we attract the tourists and if there is any action by the Government which, in my opinion, will discourage and not encourage people from coming here, I am entitled to comment on it on this supplementary estimate.</P>
      <P>While the Government acknowledge when they are looking for £500,000 for Bord Fáilte that we have such a thing as a discriminating visitor a Government Department is in the process of doing away with two Georgian houses in Hume Street.  This is a complete contradiction and a typical piece of hypocrisy.  There are many types of visitors being directed to this country and I agree with the Minister that we have not got many of the attractions that other European countries have but, surely, it is not too much to expect the Government to ensure that the attractions we have are preserved and maintained particularly when they are in the ownership of a Government Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to finish by saying that apart from the deliberate Government policy which the Minister said was responsible for all this success, there are other factors.  One of them, which <Col N="633" /> has been mentioned to me many times by visitors, is the natural courtesy inherent in our people and which impresses visitors going into shops, hotels, and so on.  This is something to which the Minister might give some credit, apart from Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who spoke constructively on the subject of this supplementary estimate.  I agree with Deputy Cluskey that the courtesy and kindness of our people is indeed to a very great extent responsible for investment in tourism promoted by the Government being successful and without it we would be nowhere.  The personal attitude of hotel keepers and all who work in the industry is a continuation of that tradition and is absolutely essential if our tourist industry is to continue to grow.  It is equally true to say that prosperity in the world around us has contributed to the growth of tourism.  Nevertheless, we are competing with other countries. Competition is keen and promotional accommodation investment is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear tributes being paid to the farm house owners who benefited from grants and who were setting a very high standard.  Some English and American friends of mine who have stayed at these houses have been absolutely delighted.  That grant of £100,000 is not the subject of this Estimate. It is a separate heading and I gather it is all being spent.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to hotel investment in relation to the American and British market.  From statistics we collect through issuing forms to travellers we find that the Americans are the largest spenders per head.  That includes what they purchase in shops which, of course, is a very valuable contribution to industry.  The British market is being looked after.  There are very good staffs in a number of offices in Great Britain but I think that the original prediction by Bord Fáilte that the American market was likely to grow faster than any other has proved to be true.  It will be accepted that the expenditure on promotional facilities has been fairly correctly estimated by Bord Fáilte during the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tom O'Donnell spoke about <Col N="634" /> this large estimate for hotel accommodation grants and suggested that there was bad planning.  Of course, as the Deputy and the House know this is what might be described as an open-ended grant.  The grant in any year is affected by circumstances outside official control.  Credit decisions, planning decisions, progressive building and so on are taken into account.  I must say that when I had the honour of being Minister for Transport and Power it was frequently difficult for Bord Fáilte or I to estimate how rapidly hotel development would escalate from the time of the credit squeeze in 1966 and early 1967 and the time that we were able to offer the increased incentives.  It was extremely difficult to know in advance how many people would take advantage of the very much larger grants for new hotels or for the improvement of hotels in the west of Ireland because there was always the difficulty of securing functional business in the winter in the scattered areas of the countryside.  In fact, the demand multiplied many times in the course of about 15 to 18 months and I do not think Bord Fáilte could have made any better prediction than they did.</P>
    <P>The sum of £500,000 represents the figure required to enable Bord Fáilte to meet the inescapable commitments arising in the current year and this amount will be sufficient up to the 31st March, 1970, and the next provision will become available immediately afterwards when the Estimates are passed.  It may be taken for granted that those requiring payment will be paid in full after, perhaps, some slight delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of the publishing of the details of hotel grants.  By and large the hotel industry in Ireland is made up mainly of small family-type hotels.  Seventyfour per cent of our hotels have 30 bedrooms or less and a further 17 per cent have between 30 and 60 bedrooms. Only 2.8 per cent of the hotels have more than 100 bedrooms.  With regard to these small scale businesses it has always been considered preferable not to publish the names of the hotels and the grants given.  Bord <Col N="635" /> Fáilte apply objective criteria in operating the grant.  The area is taken into account, whether it is remote or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these criteria are applied objectively.  The present Minister has not been in office long enough to know this but during my time in office the number of complaints received from hotel keepers to the effect that they were being deprived of the correct amount of grant was very few indeed.  Bord Fáilte take the greatest care in ensuring objectivity with regard to these grants but various factors have to be taken into consideration. The cost of improving one hotel may be quite different from the cost of improving another because of the different form of construction and so on.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, although Deputies from the Opposition have quite rightly raised this matter and from time to time have put down questions asking that these grants be published, they have not continued pressing after they have had the answer from this side of the House.  In other words, although they themselves would like to see the figures being published, it is quite evident from their reaction that they realise the difficulty with regard to this matter and so the present decision remains.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also raised the question of the Aerlínte investment in hotels.  He dealt with this at very great length.  It is obvious that the large capacity Boeing 747s will provide opportunities for greater increases in tourism so that there will be a need for block booking of hotel accommodation by Aerlínte.  Five European airlines, including BEA and BOAC, have set up a joint company with banking participation to build hotels in principal European cities.  I was very glad that Aerlínte decided to have what is a comparatively modest investment in hotels at the time they did.  This form of investment is proceeding at a rapid rate throughout the world in relation to air companies and those concerned with hotel building.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also raised the question of OIE development.  The <Col N="636" /> company receive no special State assistance except whatever grants they may qualify for in the ordinary way from Bord Fáilte.  No element of subsidy paid to CIE enters into the administration of OIE.  OIE hotels could be sold on the public market for an enormous sum, but there is of course no intention that they should be sold. If one examines the accounts it will be seen that the profits are satisfactory and that they are reinvested in new developments.  Nobody need think that OIE are competing unfairly with the rest of the industry.  The company are a profitable undertaking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan referred to hotel prices.  When I was the Minister responsible I went through about five hotel guides of Europe practically every year and made comparisons, some of them of hotels of which I had personal knowledge through my travelling, with hotels here and I found that the prices here were not excessive. When I last looked at this matter the Austrian prices were competitive, Spanish and Portuguese were slightly lower and with regard to all the rest, our prices were either competitive or very much lower.  That is my memory.</P>
    <P>I should like to back the Hotels Federation in their statement that hotel-keepers should do their utmost to maintain efficiency, to engage in work study.  There is no danger of redundancy in employment if they engage in work study and help the staff to do their work more effectively.  The result, of course, will be that the staff is less burdened by unnecessary movement of materials and so forth.  Work study in the hotel business benefits in particular the staff; they are less exhausted and they work more effectively. This is one of the particular sources of work study that is most helpful to staff and, as I have said, there is no fear whatever of redundancy.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody in this country who is charged an extravagent price for a meal or for a bedroom in an hotel will look at the Bord Fáilte hotel guide and make quite sure that the price is in accordance with the guide.  If they feel they are getting bad value, they are helping this country if they write to Bord Fáilte and make a complaint. The complaint is investigated privately <Col N="637" /> by Bord Fáilte.  It does not mean that scandal will come to the hotel, but the complaint service of Bord Fáilte depends not only on foreigners who make complaints&mdash;they make hundreds of them every year about various matters quite apart from hotel prices&mdash;but we also rely on our own people for this. It will not do any harm to the hotel or the staff in the hotel if complaints are made by our own people when they think they are getting extremely bad value.  The number of complaints received by Bord Fáilte is not excessive and they are very carefully investigated.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the points in regard to this, and I am sure the House will agree with me when I say I hope the Minister for Transport and Power will be available on the next occasion to answer questions in the Dáil on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £35,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1970, for contributions to the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Legal Bodies and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>The additional sums are required for:</P>
      <P>(1) a special contribution of $25,000 to UNICEF in respect of emergency relief and rehabilitation of women and children in war-affected areas of Nigeria, and</P>
      <P>(2) a contribution of £25,000 to UNICEF towards the expenses of chartering a ship for the transport of relief supplies and equipment for the humanitarian assistance of the victims of the Nigerian conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are only too well aware of the desperate plight of the victims of the Nigerian conflict.  The suffering of the <Col N="638" /> civilian population as a result of widespread famine and disease over the last two years has been brought home to us all by the sad pictures of emaciated men and women and skeleton-like children which have been shown to us by the relief organisations and on television and in the press.  The Nigerian tragedy has caused civilian suffering on a scale unknown for a long time, and in all this suffering the children have been the greatest victims.</P>
    <P>I have already told the Dáil on 20th November the Government's proposals for providing humanitarian assistance for the victims of the Nigerian conflict in the current financial year.  As I stated at that time, I am considering further ways in which we can help and I shall inform the Dáil of what we propose, as soon as we have finalised our plans.  In moving this supplementary estimate I intend to confine my remarks to the question of providing assistance out of public funds through the United Nations Children's Fund.</P>
    <P>Since January, 1968, UNICEF has been providing emergency aid for the victims on both sides of the Nigerian conflict.  The report of the 1969 session of the executive board of UNICEF last May states that the particular concern of UNICEF in the Nigerian relief crisis has been to try to see to it that adequate stocks of food suitable for children are available for forwarding to the relief area; to strengthen attention in the over-all relief effort given to the care of children and the cure and prevention of child starvation and malnutrition; to supply drugs particularly required for children and to contribute to transport requirements.  At that session, the board allocated an additional $1.6 million for the Nigerian emergency programme of which $1 million was to be used for the continuation of emergency aid&mdash;largely for drugs and medical supplies&mdash;and the balance to start rehabilitation of health and education services.</P>
    <P>By the end of November, 1969, UNICEF had shipped well over 100 million pounds weight of food, drugs and other supplies.  UNICEF had received donations and pledges for the Nigerian emergency aid programme valued at over $18 million, mostly in <Col N="639" /> kind, from governmental sources and UNICEF itself had allocated a total of almost $3½ million to cover the cost of food, drugs, freight and operating expenses of the programme.  These supplies have been transported and distributed for the most part either through the Red Cross or through the Catholic and Protestant church groups on both sides of the fighting line.  In addition UNICEF is now engaged in rehabilitation programmes in the field of health and education in several of the disturbed areas in the wake of the war.</P>
    <P>The Government are particularly concerned as regards the suffering of the children.  There have been recent reports of grave deterioration in the physical condition of the children and their mothers inside the Biafran enclave. In the other disturbed areas we understand that there is still grave malnutrition, including pockets of famine, and there are many places where rehabilitation proper has yet to begin.  In addition, there are constant threats to the survival of the child population&mdash;kwashiorkor, marasmus, measles, tuberculosis and the possible resurgence of yellow fever and smallpox on an epidemic scale.  It is in this most vital field that UNICEF is doing such excellent work, on both sides, and it is to help UNICEF in this work that the Government propose allocating the $25,000 for which I am asking the approval of the Dáil. This is a relatively small contribution but we would hope in the next financial year to consider further ways for helping the UNICEF programmes for Nigerian relief and rehabilitation as necessary.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Government's proposed contribution to UNICEF for Nigerian relief aid is a contribution specifically intended to assist relief transport requirements.  As a result of a charter signed last month between UNICEF and Africa Concern Ltd., and a subsequent agreement reached between UNICEF and the Nigerian authorities, the relief ship <i>Columcille</i> is being placed by its owners Africa Concern Ltd. at the disposal of UNICEF for the shipment of <i>bona fide</i> relief supplies and equipment to <Col N="640" /> ports of the Nigerian seaboard or of nearby countries, or from such ports, for the relief of victims of the present conflict in Nigeria.  The charter is to extend for a period of four months with an option for an additional two months if UNICEF so require.  The Government propose paying UNICEF a sum of not more than £25,000 for the actual costs of the first four months of the charter.  Both Africa Concern and UNICEF and also the Nigerian authorities will each make their own contribution to the costs of running the relief ship during the period of charter.</P>
    <P>The main reason for our wishing to make this practical contribution to Nigerian relief has been the need since the ending of the co-ordinating role of the international committee of the Red Cross last June to provide adequate relief transport facilities in succession to the excellent system which the ICRC had established and put into operation.  The shortage of financial resources of both the Nigerian National Commission for Rehabilitation and the Nigerian Red Cross have not made easy the building up of new transport and distribution facilities.  As a result, although relief supplies are available &mdash;in fact the ICRC handed over large stocks of relief supplies to the Nigerian Red Cross on 30th September&mdash;due to insufficient transport the relief cannot reach some of the areas where it is most needed.  It was to meet this need, that the Government initiated the discussions between Africa Concern and UNICEF about the <i>Columcille</i>.  This vessel had previously transported relief along the Nigerian coast under a similar agreement for the ICRC and at that time the ship was found very suitable both because of the shallow draft of the ship itself and the able handling by the master and his crew. I hope that the <i>Columcille's</i> period of service under UNICEF will continue to be successful in bringing relief to the victims of the war in the disturbed area along the Nigerian coast, in the mid west, in the rivers and in the south east states.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that the Irish National Committee for UNICEF has long been active in supporting UNICEF's programmes in Nigeria <Col N="641" /> Biafra.  To date the national committee has transferred £25,000 to UNICEF for this purpose, a sum generously contributed by the Irish people.  I hope that the public, particularly in this Christmas month, will continue to support UNICEF through the national committee in the vital work that the organisation is performing both in Nigeria and in so many other parts of the world on behalf of, and for the benefit of children.</P>

      <P>This supplementary estimate is further practical proof of the genuine sympathy which is felt in this country for the sufferings which the people of Nigeria and Biafra, and especially the children, are undergoing. The efforts made by voluntary groups here to raise subscriptions and the contributions which have been forthcoming while this tragic and horrible war has been proceeding have probably been without parallel.  I suppose the fact that so many of our people have worked as missionaries and teachers in those areas, the fact that for so long so many of our families have either had a representative or a member of a family or have had contact and association with families who have had people in those areas, has brought home in a practical way the problem and plight which has afflicted this unfortunate area of Nigeria and Biafra.</P>
      <P>This of course is a topic in which, naturally, our emotions are aroused and our sympathies moved by the very serious sufferings which have affected the people concerned, and particularly children and mothers.  On a number of occasions the question of aid and assistance has been discussed here and I regard the Minister's announcement of the channelling of aid through sources other than the International Red Cross as signifying a desirable change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held the view that in a matter of this sort it is difficult for a country like this, remote from the scene in the physical sense, to make any major contribution or to suggest what might or might not be done.  On the other hand, one of the <Col N="642" /> real problems in this regard has been the getting of supplies through.  I have always had the view, from looking at the situation and trying to get as much information as is available, that the United Nations approach in this matter was far too legalistic and that the question of getting supplies through and channelling them only through the International Red Cross had practical defects.  However altruistic or however high-minded the motives of that organisation and of those who work so zealously in furthering its aims and endeavouring to attain its objectives, nevertheless practical problems, because of the nature of the war and the refusal of the participants concerned to co-operate, prevented on a number of occasions supplies getting through.  It is for that reason I welcome the suggestion to channel the assistance, or some of it, through bodies like Caritas Internationalis or the Catholic, Protestant and other church relief groups.  At the same time there is an obligation on us here to express a view which is, I believe, widely held.</P>
      <P>We have in the main endeavoured to get action in regard to the conflict in Nigeria and Biafra through the Organisation for African Unity.  That, of course, is because of the reason I mentioned a moment ago.  The United Nations decided that the most practical way of getting some action was through the Organisation for African Unity.  Unfortunately, at this stage that does not seem to have achieved a great deal of success.  For that reason I was interested recently to see the suggestion made that the Swiss Government would act as mediators in the matter.  But I believe that, over and above the constructive efforts that we make either as a member of the United Nations Organisation or of any other international body of which we are members and in which our influence can be used, there is an obligation on us to express our condemnation of the principal arms suppliers to this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always felt, and expressed the view before, that there are three principal suppliers: Britain and Russia, on the one hand, <Col N="643" /> and the French Government, on the other.  When I see discussions and read speeches in other parliaments, particularly in the one nearest to us&mdash;I suppose anything we say or do so far as Russia is concerned is likely to have no influence&mdash;when I see concern expressed by the British Government over fighting elsewhere and criticism voiced in the British Parliament, I feel it has a hollow ring when we contrast that with the continued arms supplied by the British Government to the Federal Nigerian authorities.  It is equally objectionable and equally reprehensible that the French Government should supply arms to Biafra.</P>
      <P>This whole operation of relatively great powers supplying arms and equipment to relatively undeveloped and primitive areas and using this as an excuse for engaging in conflict is a matter which must be condemned. We have an obligation to express our detestation of and our opposition to the activities which those Governments have carried on and are carrying on.  I share the view that has been expressed here on many occasions that in a matter of this sort agreement and negotiation is the only hope of solution, that war and conflict cannot solve the problems that are there.  We have supported the application of the Geneva Conventions.  Our efforts have been directed, as far as possible, towards relieving suffering and mitigating the hardship and misery for those involved, particularly the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This supplementary estimate will make a further contribution in that regard.  A great number of people from very different walks of life in this country, many of whom could ill afford it, have contributed at functions organised to raise funds to bring additional succour and relief to those concerned.  I want to support the appeal made by the Minister to bodies and organisations, particularly at the approach of Christmas, further to assist and support the voluntary efforts which are being made, as well as the efforts being made by the State through the Red Cross and other international organisations to help these people.  We must <Col N="644" /> recognise and pay tribute to the wonderful work done by so many Irish people in Nigeria and Biafra.  They are, of course, mainly missionaries and religious but in addition there are teachers and social and other humanitarian workers, such as medical workers, doctors and nurses and so on, and they all deserve the highest praise for their work and the self-sacrifice which has characterised them in this regard.</P>
    <P>Compared with conditions in this area, and indeed in many other undeveloped areas in the world, this is a country which is largely developed and has considerable resources and a high standard of living.  There is no doubt that the advertisements which have been published, particularly by the Red Cross and other authorities, depicting suffering children, have been a great help in raising relief.  The most moving one is that which asks &ldquo;Is one meal a day too much?&rdquo;.  That advertisement has moved many people to sympathy and has secured contributions from many quarters.  This further effort, particularly in regard to making a contribution towards UNICEF, and also the contribution in respect of chartering the vessel <i>Columcille,</i> is another indication of our anxiety not merely to provide a measure of relief but also to ensure that steps will be taken to ensure that supplies will be delivered.  The time has come for us to make it known to those concerned, within the ambit of the opportunities which offer, our strong disapproval and detestation of the reprehensible practice of supplying arms and equipment to the participants.</P>
    <P>This whole matter is something which could be discussed at length. Many different types of solutions have been suggested, such as the recognition of Biafra as a separate State, but matters like that are really outside our immediate concern.  Our immediate concern is to try to bring external supplies of arms and equipment to an end, to bring relief and succour as quickly as possible to those so much in need of it, particularly in Biafra but also in parts of Nigeria, and to use our influence and exert our efforts towards having the Geneva Conventions applied and practised and to have a humanitarian approach adopted by <Col N="645" /> the interests concerned.  So far as we are concerned we are glad of this proposal and regard it as an indication of the support that there is not merely in this House, but outside it possibly to an even greater extent, that we have a genuine anxiety to secure peace and to make an effective contribution to assist the suffering people in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to welcome wholeheartedly this supplementary estimate and to welcome also the tone and content of the Minister's brief.  The brief shows a certain change of emphasis and an increased degree of concern about this matter in the Department of External Affairs.  The Minister, with his usual modesty and out of regard for his predecessor, will probably deny the change of emphasis but I must say that I cannot help noting its existence.  I served for a good many years in the Minister's Department and in my time I have prepared briefs and I think I know the difference between a brief which is simply patting the ball back and a brief expressing actual concern and work done.  This brief, I am happy to say, appears to me to come within the second category.  There has been real work going on here.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular the statement by the Minister when he said:</P>
      <P>I am considering further ways in which we can help and I shall inform the Dáil of what we propose as soon as we have finalised our plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister of full support from our side of the House for anything he may find it possible to do in this direction.  We welcome, as I said, this contribution to UNICEF.  We have a very high regard for the work that UNICEF is doing in the world, as most people have.  However, we do not think that a single channel or a single set of channels is enough; we believe in diversification of the channels of relief so that needs may be met where they exist without being trammelled more than absolutely necessary by the political conditions of the place and time.  UNICEF, for all its best endeavours, <Col N="646" /> which it certainly makes, is of course handicapped in certain ways. By the very fact that it is a United Nations organism it is under the constraints of international legalities and of pressures of member states in this matter.  The view of most member states is that Nigeria is the unit and Biafra the rebel area and, therefore, that direct supplies into Biafra tend to be frowned upon in United Nations circles and therefore UNICEF may be under difficulties in these matters.  I know there is a will to get round these difficulties.  I discern from the Minister's brief that some ingenious ways have been found: these are worthy of praise.  I still think, however, that further diversification is necessary and also a further effort to find out, on the spot, just what means of getting the relief to its destination are working and are likely to work and what kinds of flexibility can be introduced into the whole operation.</P>
    <P>It is not enough just to vote money or to contribute money.  The essential thing is that the relief which the money buys shall get through to the maximum number of people in most need.  There are very great problems in relation to that.  I think it is proper that the Minister's brief should be as it is but, necessarily, it understates some of these difficulties.  Opposition Deputies can dot i's and cross t's which it would not be appropriate for the Minister to do.</P>
    <P>There are two main areas involved here.  The reference in the decorous language of the brief is to &ldquo;the war-affected areas of Nigeria&rdquo;.  There are two main ones.  One is the so-called Biafra enclave&mdash;that is, that extremely crowded area of the so-called &ldquo;Ibo heartland&rdquo; which must be one of the most densely-populated areas in the world at present.  It was already thickly populated before this war.  Its population has now vastly been swollen by refugees from territory now occupied by the Nigerian army.</P>
    <P>In the areas of the old eastern region which have been occupied by Federal Nigerian troops there are other people in grave need.  Some of them are Ibos left behind and some are other peoples in that area&mdash;Efik, Ibibio, Ijaw and <Col N="647" /> others.  It is of no particular concern to us, of course, what is the ethnicicity of any given group: the important thing is that they are in need.</P>
    <P>Looking at these two areas, we have to distinguish, I think, two sets of problems in reaching them with relief. As regards the area of the eastern region&mdash;possibly the problem is not exclusively an eastern region one but I think it is overwhelmingly mainly so&mdash; in that area which has been occupied, I cannot speak of these problems from first-hand experience.  I tried to go there but it was not made possible for me to do that so that, as far as that area is concerned, the occupied area&mdash; I suppose, from a Lagos point of view, the liberated area&mdash;of the eastern region, I am obliged to rely on reports by other people.</P>
    <P>Here, I do not wish to seek to inflame opinion against the Nigerian Government.  I wish to speak with the greatest possible moderation on this subject.  All the peoples of Nigeria are passing through a time of grave tribulation. We are concerned, in considering this supplementary estimate, immediately, at the moment, only with the problem of how effective our contribution can be.  It is only in so far as the effectiveness of that contribution is concerned that we have to consider the conditions prevailing in each one of the two areas.  It is a question of choosing whither we should channel most of our effort and through what channel it should go.</P>
    <P>In relation to the areas of the east, occupied by Federal troops, there are many serious problems.  There are enlightened people in the Nigerian Government and, I am sure, also in Nigerian local administration and even in the army who genuinely want relief supplies to reach all the people.  Those people certainly exist and I think it proper to pay tribute to them.  There are also people animated by quite different principles.  There are, for example, in positions of power both in Lagos and in the local affected areas&mdash;people&mdash;Moslems, from the north&mdash;animated by the traditional idea of the Jihad of the Holy War. We know something about Holy Wars <Col N="648" /> in this island but the spirit of the Jihad retains a great deal of the primal ferocity there.</P>
    <P>Organising relief under these conditions is sometimes a little like trying to channel supplies for the evicted and dispossessed Catholics of Belfast through an administration run by Mr. Paisley and Mr. Bunting: it presents difficulties of that kind.  That is to say, it cannot get through.  We know that terrible things have happened in certain parts&mdash;not all&mdash;of the areas of the eastern region occupied by troops of the central Government. In Calabar, I know from an unimpeachable authority which I cannot name here&mdash;the Minister may know it; evidently he is very well-advised in these matters&mdash;Federal troops went looking for Ibos and killed all the male Ibos over the age of 12.  They also killed members of other ethnic groups found guilty, or suspected of, sheltering Ibos.  These things happened.</P>
    <P>One can see that under that administration at that time&mdash;I am happy to say that the man who did that was subsequently removed from office though for a different reason&mdash;under those conditions, or even under conditions perceptibly better but not radically different, relief supplies will not get through.  I know, from reports from several parts of the occupied region, that the policy of the administration locally, unfortunately, appears to be that of the old adage, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill but need not strive officiously to keep alive&rdquo; in relation to certain people.  There is, therefore, grave doubt that relief distributed under arrangements made by the Nigerians themselves will reach its destination. The Minister may be able in his reply to say something that will allay those doubts of ours.  If so, I hope he will be able to tell it to us because there is ground for such doubts, according to first-hand information from people who have visited the areas&mdash;not people sitting in Lagos.  I am not blaming them for that; people have to sit there from time to time, but people who, perhaps because of difficulties imposed by the Nigerian Government have not been able to travel into areas occupied in the eastern region, cannot be a <Col N="649" /> primary source of information about these areas.  If the Minister is able to give us first hand assessments by impartial people on whom he can count that these supplies are really getting through in this area then I, for one, will be very happy to hear it.  It is very important that these reports should be first hand.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to say with due respect to the relief agencies, the International Red Cross, UNICEF, and whatever, that their reports are deserving of being treated with proper respect, but they should also be looked at with a critical eye.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as I know from experience in several parts of Africa, a natural human tendency on the part of a relief agency to play its own trumpet just a little, to lay proper emphasis on the amount that is being done and not to look with the same degree of urgency at what is not being done, what it has not been able to do. Also, these agencies themselves have to consider&mdash;and this is a more serious and creditable consideration&mdash;their relations with the occupying Government. This latter consideration applies also to missionary bodies.  They have their relations with the occupying Government and they may say: &ldquo;We know terrible things happened in such and such a place, and such and such a place but, in the hope of doing something here and now in this village, it would be better for us to be quiet about those matters.&rdquo;  A kind of dead zone comes in.</P>
      <P>I have been told by missionaries of certain things on which they would not wish to be quoted.  I respect their reasons for not wishing to be quoted on that but it is all the more reason for having a direct look at these things by people whose only duty in the matter is to observe, to go and have a look and see exactly what is happening and come back and report it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would submit that we in this country have a sufficient interest in this area, and have proved our interest in the area sufficiently to do just that, to have a look at the situation on both sides <Col N="650" /> of the lines and see in the light of that &mdash;a report of whose objectivity we could be sure&mdash;how best we can use our limited means of helping them.  It is a question of having antennae on this question and I am not quite satisfied that we do have these antennae at the moment.  I think some of our relief work is going off, as it were, into the void, into the blind&mdash;not all of it. I am sure that to the extent that may be so the Minister and the Department will consider carefully what can be done to set it right.</P>
    <P>I have no direct experience of the situation on the Federal side or the occupied parts of the eastern region.  I have some slight direct experience of relief distribution on the Biafran side. Most recently I was there last Easter. I was there before in 1967.  I went on behalf of the Biafra Relief Services Foundation of the United States, a body which had at that time raised 1½ million dollars for aid to Biafra.  I should like to mention this for the Minister's consideration. It worked in a particular way.  I am not suggesting it is the only way, but it is one way.</P>
    <P>That foundation did not itself do any distribution locally nor did it in any other way locally apply the funds.  It handed the funds over on a sort of counterpart system to a local Biafran group, many of them Biafran doctors, civil servants and other people who had worked in the United States and who knew many of the people participating at the United States end.  They administered these funds and used them for the hospitals and refugee centres in Biafra.</P>
    <P>The purpose of our visit at that time, at Easter, was to see just how effectively these funds were being used by the Biafrans themselves.  We travelled through the area under Biafran control at that time.  It has changed since.  It has not entirely diminished but it has changed its contours since.  We were extremely impressed by what the Biafrans were doing, not only with what we had raised but also with their general attitude to getting our relief supplies out, and their efficiency in doing so.</P>
    <P>There can be few more impressive spectacles&mdash;certainly I cannot think of any&mdash;than the long line of lightless <Col N="651" /> lorries quietly moving up to and away from the blacked out airfield at Uli and picking up the 250 tons or so a night, as it then was, of relief supplies coming in from Sao Tome and Cotonou every night.  That gets out, of course, to the villages.  The missionary orders and other relief organisations usually organise the actual administration of the relief effort in the villages but the Biafrans themselves are responsible for the logistics of this operation which, if you think of the siege conditions under which these people had to work, is a very remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I went away quite satisfied that relief supplies which reach Biafra are getting into the right hands, that they are smoothly and quickly distributed and that they are getting to the people who are in need, quite irrespective of what their ethnicicity may be.  As I say, I speak from first-hand experience on that.  I was absolutely satisfied about it at that time as existing in Biafran as recently as last Easter.  I would of course be the first to agree that things may have deteriorated since then and that conditions may have significantly changed.  I would hope that the conditions in both parts would be checked on, in both the Federal occupied part of the eastern region and Biafran itself, to see how supplies can best be got through and what is the maximum value in terms of reaching people in need that can be achieved by the use of our supplies.</P>
    <P>Is it in the main by taking them into Biafra or is it by trying to work in the occupied area?  Granted that we ought to try both but the test must be essentially how much food, medicine and so on are reaching the people in most desperate need of it and if this is best done by reaching the area where the material in question is effectively distributed.  I am afraid that even though it is a most painful human choice that that is what is imposed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how good our information is about what is now happening inside the enclave.  There was a time up to October, 1967, in the first months of the war when, of course without recognising Biafra, we were in fact represented there.  An official of the <Col N="652" /> Minister's Department was in Enugu. He was in a position to see what was going on there.  He was an extremely well informed and able official and his presence there would have been of the greatest utility and service, I would suggest, to us at present when we are trying to see how most effectively to get aid there.</P>
    <P>As I say, his presence in that part of Nigeria, as it was and is from the official point of view of our Government, did not imply any recognition of Biafra.  It was in fact detached from the Embassy in Lagos and, I suppose, was conceived as having functions of a more or less consular character on the spot.  Unfortunately&mdash;as I think&mdash;he was withdrawn after the fall of Enugu, and he was withdrawn by no coincidence, simultaneously with the British and American representatives who were in the same general position. It is hard to see the strict necessity for their withdrawal but they were withdrawn.  I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully whether he could not&mdash;I am not asking him to recognise Biafra&mdash;without any commitment of that kind, attempt to restore the status we had then.  When these representatives were withdrawn in October, 1967, the assumption was that which the British in particular have been consistently making about this war; that is, it was going to be a short-run affair, that when Enugu fell, and that is more than two years ago now, it was all over, as we would say, bar the shouting. Well, it was not.  The people concerned were wrong and the war has gone on since then and it may go on for quite a long time, with all the suffering it involves.</P>
    <P>We should consider very carefully whether we should not be in a position to see that situation through our own observers on the spot under arrangements essentially similar to those which existed before&mdash;or perhaps, if necessary, under new arrangements of a different, probably more informal, character.  But we should know what is happening there.  We should also insist, through the good relations which our Government must certainly enjoy with the Nigerian Government, that we be able to send our own observers into <Col N="653" /> the occupied areas of the former eastern region and see at first hand what is happening.</P>
    <P>I suggest this would be of value for two reasons: it would help us in allocating our relief effort in the most efficient possible way; and it would serve as a certain restraint&mdash;imperfect certainly, but it might save lives&mdash;on the administering military officials in the area, if it was known that people would be coming in and having a look, people who would then be going home, not missionaries who would have to continue to work on the spot, not relief organisations who have to think of their good relations with the Government, but people who are pure observers, there for nothing else but to look at the situation, and then leave and report.</P>
    <P>We all know it is a natural human tendency that if other people are coming to look at what we are doing we try to tidy up the house, and this is a house that needs a great deal of tidying, and we should help in that effort. I am not saying here, and I have deliberately refrained from saying in this House, that we should recognise the State of Biafra.  The Government have had good reasons for not doing that, in that to do so might hamper its usefulness, hamper relief efforts in Nigeria and otherwise militate against effective help for the people, which is what we have to be mainly concerned with.</P>
    <P>That has been my position but it has been misrepresented and I should like to put it right&mdash;not misrepresented by the Minister or his Department or by any of the gentlemen opposite.  The Nigerian Embassy here has circulated a document, an extract from the <i>West African Pilot.</i> It is headed:</P>
    <P>Irish Government Lauded for Rejecting Rebels.</P>
    <P>Ojukwu Booed By Ibos In Lagos</P>
    <P>The So-Called &ldquo;Biafra&rdquo; is NonExistent Except in Propaganda Terms.</P>
    <P>The first two paragraphs in it read:</P>
    <P>The Committee of Ibo Intellectuals in Lagos has welcomed the news report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The reference to Ibos may possibly <Col N="654" /> puzzle certain Deputies, but it should be borne in mind that these unfortunate Ibos are in Lagos and are perhaps under certain pressures.  I have no intention of criticising them here, but one can understand what their situation is, an extremely precarious one.  The paragraph states:</P>
    <P>The Committee of Ibo Intellectuals in Lagos has welcomed the news report from Ireland that the Irish Parliament has finally decided not to accord diplomatic recognition to Ojukwu's fast-crumbling dream empire, but pledged to support the Federal Military Government in its serious search for peace in Nigeria.</P>
    <P>A statement issued yesterday said that the committee, describing the news as heartening also praised the former UN Observer Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, currently a labour MP in Ireland, for his outspokenness and genuine change of heart in declaring in Parliament that he now supported non-recognition despite his previous utterances in favour of the rebels.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to develop this theme, but I should like to stress its relevance.  We are engaged in voting a supplementary estimate for the war-afflicted areas of Nigeria.  Some of us do not believe that Biafra is a war-afflicted area of Nigeria; we regard it, as I say, as a nation in process of birth.  We wish to help the people there on that understanding and we do not want to be misrepresented for so doing.  I have not changed my views.  I believe in the Biafran cause.  I believe they are a people who have the right to be free. I am not trying to thrust that view on anyone else, certainly not in the debate on this supplementary estimate, but I do not want to be misrepresented and particularly misrepresented to the disservice of my friends in Biafra in the gallant struggle which they are putting up against vastly superior odds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister comes to consider the further ways in which <Col N="655" /> we can help, he will again consider, and I am sure he is considering, whether he cannot channel some of our official aid directly through Joint Church Aid and Caritas Internationalis.  I am a little disappointed that we have not yet decided to do that.  I probably will not be accused by the gentlemen opposite of any excessive bias in favour of clerical administration of things or of any insistence that everything done by the clergy is always done right; I do not think that is so.  However, this is one operation which I have seen on the spot and I know that Joint Church Aid more than any other group&mdash;Caritas Internationalis is playing a very significant part in this&mdash;is actually getting the relief through, and it is to the people who are getting the relief through that we should always give the greatest part of our support.  I do not want to become involved in this debate on the supplementary estimate in any substantial discussion of the political aspects, although you allowed Deputy Cosgrave considerable indulgence in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>With respect, these themes cannot be entirely separated. If at the time of the Irish Famine&mdash;and the present disaster is fully on the scale of the Irish Famine &mdash;Irish Members of Parliament in Britain had tried to introduce the social and political aspects of life in Ireland at that time as relevant to the question of relief of the Famine, then it is possible that the Speaker, in the same spirit as you have done just now, would have ruled that out of order. With respect, I think it would have been a somewhat pedantic decision.  I am sure the Chair will not insist that the political aspects should be set aside altogether in discussing this supplementary estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to enter deeply into the matter but I would like to remind the House of a statement made by Fr. Anthony Byrne who has <Col N="656" /> probably done more than any other person in this country to bring relief to this area&mdash;his work is well known to the Minister.  Fr. Byrne has been working in Sao Tome.  He will be coming back to this country shortly and I am sure he will be in touch with the Minister.  Fr. Byrne has said, &ldquo;Peace is the best relief.&rdquo;  I think that is the most striking definition one could possibly find of the way in which the political and relief aspects of this are inseparable, as I believe they are.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge further on the Minister that he concern himself, with the same degree of urgency and effectiveness as this brief shows with the relief aspect, also with the peace aspect.  I think the quotation which I have already given from the <i>West African Pilot</i> shows that our proceedings are not unremarked in the area. Quite often in international affairs we have been inclined to overestimate what we can do but I think this is one area in which we are underestimating what we can do.  This is an area in which the Minister's voice in particular carries a certain weight and I hope he will use it not for the purpose of promoting immediate recognition of Biafra, but for the promotion of a ceasefire without political precondition, and for an international embargo on the sale of arms to that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state first of all that Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien's concern is shared by all of us.  I, for my part, am completely convinced of his sincerity in the matter. I should like to commend the sincerity of everyone who has spoken in this House regarding the situation in Biafra. We are talking here about the lives of millions of human beings and we are concerned with saving as many of those lives as possible.  I think the way to look at it is to take each life as though it were the life of one of our own children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Government for the financial aid they have already given UNICEF, and to the great generosity of our people who have dug deep into their pockets to make contributions.  I should also like to pay tribute to the various church <Col N="657" /> authorities for the wonderful work they have done.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that the people in this country want to do more than just send money to buy food and drugs; I think they want to participate to a greater degree in bringing relief to these people.  It has occurred to me that the Minister might consider setting up &ldquo;villages of peace&rdquo;, similar to those started many years ago by the late Fr. Dominic Pire, for some of these young refugees in this war-torn part of the African continent.  The State could purchase a farm of, say, 50 acres which they could develop for themselves.  Fr. Pire used the term &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;.  I am sure there are many people in this country who would be willing to adopt refugees, not necessarily orphans but children who would inevitably starve to death because of the massiveness of the problem confronting those concerned with bringing relief.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly suggest that consideration be given to the setting up of a committee to examine how a &ldquo;village of peace&rdquo; could be set up over here.  Each child that dies is a blot on the conscience of mankind.  If we were able to set up such a &ldquo;village of peace&rdquo; I think we would set an example which other countries would follow.  I am not too worried about the vastness of the problem because if we had only ten refugees here it would be a contribution.  If we were to multiply this number by all the countries in the world, in proportion to their population, this idea could grow.  If the idea had been suggested to us at the time of the Famine we would have been glad for any country to take our children so that they would not starve to death.</P>
    <P>We tend to be critical of the UN from time to time because of the way political solutions seem to be very far off.  We do have some consolation in seeing the workings of such organisations as UNICEF and WHO, which in my opinion more than vindicate the UN.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department for the genuine concern they have shown for this part of Nigeria by their actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for the introduction of this elementary recognition of Biafra by giving some of the nation's taxation to these tragic people.  I do not think any one of us can prepare a meal for our families without having brought home to us very sharply the horror and agony of these people.  I would urge the Minister to take even greater initiatives in this field.</P>
      <P>My sympathies are with the people of Biafra and in that context I share the views of my colleague Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien.  I think there is sufficient national concern to see being brought about a ceasefire without any political preconditions on either side. The Minister might usefully consider a joint parliamentary committee or a committee of this House to discuss the situation which has now lasted for a considerable time.  That would be preferable to debating here publicly, in many respects emotionally, the very difficult aspects of the situation.  A committee constituted of himself, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, Caritas and the other organisations could discuss not only the question of relief but also the question of bringing an end to hostilities.  After all, peace is the greatest relief and the collective energies, intelligence and influence of all should be brought to bear on the Nigerian authorities and the overall attitude of the Irish people should be conveyed.  I do not think that would in any way affect the sensitivity of the Minister or interfere with parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I am somewhat sceptical of the direct channelling of relief through Lagos.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure that every possible opportunity and every means of communication are availed of and, in his place, I would cast diplomatic niceties and susceptibilities to the four winds.  I would have no hesitation in doing so provided the one criterion was satisfied, namely, getting aid direct to those most in need of aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are imposing on our Irish missionaries, committed and involved as they are, and circumspect as they must be in their operations, far too great a burden from the point of view of relieving <Col N="659" /> the internal domestic situation. There should be a permanent public representative regularly available in the eastern region.  That is absolutely essential if we are to come to grips more directly with the situation.</P>
    <P>Having, to a limited extent, come to grips with the problem of aid, we should also face up to the fact that this situation has obtained since May of 1967.  Biafra has been and continues to be separated from Nigeria.  That is the reality.  Separation would appear to be the normal development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would hope that the Deputy would confine his remarks to the supplementary estimate before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do so, but I should like to point out that this secession is but one of a long series of secessions and inevitable realignments following on people obtaining their independence. It is only natural that they should wish to direct their own affairs. With regard to aid through Lagos, one cannot ignore the intensity of the strong Mohammedan tradition of the northern areas.  Whether we appreciate it or not, there is intense hostility towards people in the eastern region. This has, I think, been underestimated by the Irish Government.  Nowhere in Africa&mdash;I know this from my meetings with people from that continent&mdash;are there such tragic and vast differences between peoples.  There should be greater direct aid.</P>
      <P>I support the view of Deputy Cosgrave that, while giving aid, we must not lose sight of the more important issue, namely, the bringing of pressure to bear on the peace front itself.  Any pressures should be on a double front, not necessarily a tripartite front.  I would urge the Minister to bring pressure to bear on both the British and Russian Governments to cease supplying arms to Nigeria.  The French contribution is not, I think, substantial. There is grave need, as was pointed out by another speaker, for more direct action by the Government in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I congratulate the master and crew of the <i>Columcille</i>.  This vessel is operating under UNICEF.  The master and crew deserve the thanks and admiration of the Irish people.  We should also express our regard for the tremendous work done by our Irish missionaries, in most difficult and trying circumstances, and the many people in Ireland, teachers and others, who have inspired such generosity towards these starving people.  It is a fact that these have suffered greater physical deterioration in recent months.</P>
    <P>It would be a gesture of solidarity and national concern were the Minister to visit both these areas, without any preconditions.  It would be a useful act of political awareness.  It would demonstrate the development of attitudes.  The Minister might go to Lagos and visit Biafra and find out at first hand what the situation is.  Should he do so we will give him all the support and encouragement he may require.  I have no doubt that there would be substantial development.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I would indicate that our desire is for peace. Admittedly aid is now being given but the real long-term solution is the introduction of a ceasefire without political preconditions and, as far as I am concerned, the ultimate formation of an independent Biafran State.  That is quite inevitable in many respects.  We have no desire in the Labour Party to exacerbate the situation there but we see, in many respects, its inevitability. We can only hope that the aid we are giving will be adequate.  As far as I am concerned the Minister is most welcome to come before the House again with further measures because he can be assured of the full support of everybody in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the support given to the supplementary estimate.  Before going on, perhaps, I should take up a point raised by Deputy Desmond, the praise due to the missionaries for the work they are doing in relief throughout the whole area.  From time to time at Question Time I have expressed my opinion on several of the political matters raised today and I intend to take an appropriate opportunity of <Col N="661" /> dealing with political aspects again.  I agree that it is not possible to separate the humanitarian activities from the political considerations and that peace is the best relief but I wish today to deal just with the humanitarian aspects and some other points raised.</P>
      <P>The main point in the minds of many Deputies is whether the relief is getting through.  Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien raised the question as to whether I am informed about the situation. I am in touch directly with the relief organisations who have people working in the field.  The Red Cross have a team in one of the areas the Deputy had in mind.  I am in touch with the missionary bodies that have personnel working in these areas and I get regular detailed reports from the Embassy at Lagos.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice to move out and I hope they will continue and extend this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the relief organisations are doing their best in a very difficult war situation.  This is why we are giving so much study in depth to what is the best way of giving Government relief so as to give the greatest benefit to the people concerned.  I am convinced that UNICEF is one way of doing it. UNICEF is not limited, I think, by being a United Nations agency.  It is motivated by humanitarian reasons only and I gather that it has been very active on both sides since January of 1968.  UNICEF has used the Red Cross and Church Aid channels for getting <Col N="662" /> supplies into Biafra.  Since the stoppage of the International Red Cross flights they have been using the Church Aid channel.  They supply food and medicine to both sides and have field personnel on both sides.  The UNICEF programme covers about 3,000,000 women and children on each side and the medical care programme also covers both sides.</P>
    <P>In the third quarter of this year UNICEF shipped 43,700 bags of rice; 60,000 bags of beans, 1,000 bags of dried skimmed milk as well as a quantity of corn and soya meal, high protein powder, medicines and drugs and hospital equipment.  The bulk of this has gone into Biafra.</P>
    <P>I am in close touch with the Red Cross about plans for further relief within Biafra.  I hope the technical details of this matter will be solved in a few days and that I shall be able to make a further statement when the plans are finalised.  I have the questions in relation to the political points that were raised and these were answered quite recently, on 27th November, and I think Deputies are aware of the attitude of the Government on the political situation.  There will be an occasion to discuss this again; no situation is rigid and I should prefer to confine myself to the humanitarian aspects today.</P>
