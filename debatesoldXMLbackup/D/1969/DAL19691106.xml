    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day we discussed the Minister's speech and the AnCO report.  The comprehensive <Col N="352" /> speech made by the Minister covered all aspects of the Department of Labour and the report by AnCO, which is their second annual report, is an example that might be followed by all other State and semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>We have seen how AnCO set out in a businesslike manner to establish this department, a department of services for the education and the improvement of skills of the various workers.  They worked together with unions and employers and various committees were set up to run this section so that they are now in a position to train 70 per cent of industrial workers.  They have a centre in Dublin for the training of instructors and Irish management to whom they have given a grant are being used to instruct the various supervisors in all sections of industry.  This body is setting out to promote the highest standard of efficiency and training that is possible and competitive with any other country in the world. I agree with the Minister when he says with regard to the various surveys that a survey is practically history by the time its recommendations can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of a certain number of apprentices and from my checking of the AnCO report there are 90 trainees at Shannon, 100 at Waterford and Galway will have 100 adults and 100 trainees by the end of the year. This is one thing about which the Minister was not very explicit.  He did not tell us the age of the various trainee apprentices.  I gather that at least 80 per cent are apprentices and from this point of view that they are only duplicating what the vocational schools are doing.  This was a very comprehensive report.  All these services have been set up with, according to the Minister, the best men that could be had.  Money has been spent and a big staff employed and so far not many people are being trained. From now on we should watch the results of AnCO.  They have now set up practically everything they need. The Minister said he was going to provide more premises in different areas.  From now on trainees should come in and we should see results. This scheme has been very well <Col N="353" /> established.  In my opinion no businessman or business consultant could have done it better.  It will be interesting to see what return we will get for the money spent and how many trainees we will get from the scheme and how soon we will get 2,000 to 3,000 trainees.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length on the question of manpower.  This is probably the kernel of the problem.  We all agree with him that the placement services and the employment agencies should be separate.  In the last Estimate we agreed that this is the correct thing to do.  The manpower services are expensive. I doubt if they are beneficial. When one discovers that the manpower is available in a certain area, by the time the service has been put into practice the workers have either emigrated or gone elsewhere.  There should be a better on-the-spot system. The employers and the various people involved should be able to give a list of those leaving their employment and also of those they employ.  If this list were sent to a central spot it might be more beneficial than spending money on the huge surveys which we have at present.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on the question of the registration of private employment agencies.  To date, nobody knows the numbers of persons placed by these agencies.  The daily papers contain three or four page lists of people seeking jobs and of agencies offering positions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that no country has found a foolproof system of forecasting manpower requirements.  Perhaps this can never happen but the nearer we get to perfection on this and the more we can improve on it, the better.  I do not think any businessman could tell us on a particular morning how many men he will employ the next day.  He can increase or reduce his staffs.  AnCO can only improve the situation and try harder.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the various firms that had post-mortems after strikes.  I quote now from <i>Irish Industry and Industrial Management</i>, Volume 37, No. 9.</P>
    <P>The long awaited Murphy report <Col N="354" /> on the inquiry into the maintenance strike during the first quarter of 1969 has been presented to the Minister for Labour.  It is a damning indictment of our whole system of industrial relations and like the Cameron report in the other part of our island, brings to the surface the faults of many years past.  Management &mdash; industry &mdash; and labour, the workers and their trade unions, along with the Labour Court itself, all receive a fair share of blame, although the craftsmen's unions especially are, as the public long before this had come to suspect, the most culpable.</P>
    <P>Further on it says:</P>
    <P>This is not the time for recriminations or simply for apportioning blame.  If the series of strikes have taught us anything, it is that both forces of production must come together honestly and with understanding and trust, as well as with far better public and press relations. Both sides should study and try to comprehend the problems and difficulties of the other and sit down early on in any dispute to talk it out rather than fight it out later on. Our entire system of industrial relations must change and this is possible only with good will and determination on both sides, with a Labour Court respected and trusted by both and whose recommendations would be almost legally binding.</P>
    <P>This post-mortem or inquiry shows that employers on the one side and unions on the other, and a particular union maybe, and the workers are not worrying about the other section.  The only solution is to have an incomes policy.  I cannot see any other way out of it.  When it comes to negotiations each person is thinking of himself only. He is not thinking of any union or of anyone else but only of having more money than his next-door neighbour. The ESB were given time to set up a non-statutory body to deal with pay claims.  It would be a great thing if all sections of the community could gradually attend the Labour Court and if we had one authority who would treat them all alike.  The Minister mentioned that he was bringing in protective <Col N="355" /> legislation.  He mentioned the patchwork of legislation and spoke about bringing in something like the Factories Acts and the Holidays Acts. This is essential.  There should be the same basic rules for every worker so that all firms would start workers on the same wages and exercise the same supervision and from there on the most successful business would win out through its own hard work, productivity and salesmanship.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he would look into the question of the hours of working.  That can only be done by fixing maximum numbers of hours.  In the hotel and catering trades the workers must work at different times from other workers.  Most workers work in the daytime but hotel and catering staffs work when others are free.  I agree with the Minister on the question of giving a minimum period of notice which should be tied to the number of years worked.</P>
    <P>A Bill dealing with dangerous substances is something long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a lengthy, comprehensive speech on the International Labour Organisation.  There is little I can add to it but I wish to endorse everything he has said.  This organisation was founded in 1919.  That was after the first world war and the workers who had fought side by side with the better off people in the trenches decided that during the war their lives were as good as any other's.</P>
    <P>As soon as the war was over they might have had to go back to pre-war conditions and they decided not to. The International Labour Organisation was founded to prevent this, to give workers better opportunities when the war was over.  It took quite a while for this to get going.  The Minister mentioned that its main functions were the protection of women and junior workers and the determination of maximum hours per day and maximum hours per week.  It is even more comprehensive than the EEC although it operates in a different sphere.  It covers the whole world and by bringing the wage structure in the various countries up to a certain level, not <Col N="356" /> always the same but very nearly the same, it has probably been the forerunner of the setting up of the EEC and the EFTA countries because when labour charges are the same countries are moving towards achieving the same cost of production and this brings people closer together.  It also gives tremendous encouragement, labour-wise and social-wise, to the emerging countries in Africa.  I am glad to see that the Minister has mentioned a programme to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding which includes the issue of postage stamps, an art competition and a publication of Ireland's role in the ILO.  I hope it is the Irish role and not the Fianna Fáil role that comes out in this as it did in the publication <i>Facts about Ireland.</i></P>
    <P>In the NIEC report No. 11 an incomes policy was recommended.  This is in line with what Fine Gael have suggested.  We in Fine Gael are not against profits, we are pro-profits, and in no circumstances do we want to contain profits at a certain rate.  Even if control of profits were desirable, which is not the case, it is not practicable because profits are earned competitively, particularly profits from exporting. Profits cannot be controlled in advance; they must be controlled in arrears.  For instance, the Government cannot tell a man to produce a box of matches for a penny.  He must try to produce them at a penny first. If he charges 2d he may make profit. This can only be done in arrears.  We are also against dividend control because if a dividend is controlled all companies are being brought into line, the good and the bad, and no incentive is given to a company to improve and pay a bigger dividend.</P>
    <P>What we wish to see is that the rate of increase in the aggregate post-tax purchasing power from dividend is no greater than post-tax wages so that any increase in post-tax dividend must compare with the increase in post-tax wages.  This would prevent a lot of bad example&mdash;people buying £7,000 or £8,000 cars.  If they were taxed sufficiently, if their incomes were not allowed to grow to any huge extent, they could not afford this.  This would <Col N="357" /> also encourage them to leave money in their business or company which would mean producing more money in the economy to create more jobs. The only loophole in this would be where there are cartels or monopolies. Where these are in force special legislation should be set up to deal with them.  Where there are State companies in monopolies there must be a committee set up to watch them.  Just because a company is a State company in a monopoly does not mean that it can add 6d or a shilling <i>ad lib.</i> There must be a watching committee on this.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is essential and it will work here.  It has been reasonably successful in England.  The Government here have no intention of having an incomes policy because to have one it must be co-ordinated with the economic policy of the country and with a manpower policy.  With our economic policy two methods are used to fix up the balance of payments&mdash;increase in indirect taxation which reduces personal spending and a credit squeeze which stops investment.  Both of these measures cause the cost of living to go up.  Increased taxes put up costs.  Reduced production puts up the unit cost of each item.  This in turn puts up wages.  This is what the Government have been doing.  We have two budgets practically every year; we have indirect taxation on most goods&mdash; you may call them luxury goods but most people use them&mdash;and this in itself is creating inflation.  We have a credit squeeze two years out of every four which also puts up the cost of goods to the worker who in turn must get increased wages.  This may be fixing the balance of payments but it is creating inflation.  The Minister must see that when an incomes policy is introduced it is done in co-operation with an economic policy.</P>
    <P>The Government, employers and trade unions frequently use the word &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;.  The Government and the employers have shouted for increased productivity.  The unions used it, sometimes fairly well, but sometimes for an over normal increase.  There is a certain right on their side to look for these over normal increases but you get one group who have a productivity <Col N="358" /> agreement and get an over normal increase, which is copied by other workers.  Then there is another group who get a productivity agreement and it goes right back to the whole lot, six or seven times, instead of one set of productivity agreements and then getting rid of it and coming back to a certain normal scale again.  Productivity, in fact, means harder work for fewer workers or reduced restrictive practices for increased pay.  We do not hear the Government shouting so much lately about productivity, they still do now and again, but productivity is a once only job.  You make one productivity agreement and you cannot go on increasing productivity.  After that you go back to normal wage negotiations based on a percentage increase or a cost of living increase.  When unions and employers have got this productivity agreement they are back to the old wages.  Increases after that have nothing to do with productivity.  It may come into automation but it will not come into physical or manual power. Incentives should be given to workers.  They should be encouraged to take a real interest through bonus incentives, profit sharing, opportunities for promotions and so on.  The Murphy system would make a man an integral part of the firm.  That is what should be done. If the recommendations in the Murphy report were adopted the Labour Court could then become a final tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the problem of a shortage of skilled labour.  The Government have not faced up to this problem. Neither have the unions.  Employers, though not so deeply involved perhaps, have not bothered too much about the problem.  Huge wage demands usually start through a shortage of skilled labour in a particular industry.  If a manpower policy were tied in with incomes a great deal of the present difficulty would disappear. Because of a shortage of skilled labour in a particular trade those engaged in that trade are often in a position to demand any wage increase they like and the repercussions of that run right through the whole economy.  If there were a proper incomes policy there would be no shortage of skilled labour. <Col N="359" /> Those who are not in such a strong position have to wait until certain groups move before they can do anything to better their position.</P>
    <P>I have talked about this to many trade unionists.  They do not really like pushing, but a very small push starts the whole thing going.  Of course, some demands are legitimate and should be met.  The Government have a certain responsibility in all this because they go into certain sectors and create a shortage of skilled workers.  The sudden entry of the Government into a particular sector sends everything skew wise.  If there is a scarcity of a certain type of labour then a particular group is put in a privileged position. That happens when the Department of Local Government, for example, goes into building.  A shortage of labour is immediately created in private enterprise building.  When the Department of Education builds schools a shortage of skilled labour follows.  These jobs are once-and-for-all jobs.  After a period there is no more work.  Proper planning is vital.  If the Department of Health builds hospitals a shortage of skilled workers in other facets of the building trade ensues.  When the hospitals are built there are no more jobs for these workers.</P>
    <P>A new health scheme is being introduced&mdash;actually it is a scheme stolen from Fine Gael&mdash;and this scheme is being introduced without proper prior planning.  The first thing that should have been done was to encourage more teachers to train the personnel who will be required to operate this scheme. There seems to be no proper thought. Someone decides to go into something and then it is found that there is no personnel to operate whatever it may be.  Factories are built and then it is discovered there are no trained workers to man that factory.  The trend nowadays is to pay what workers are available well over the rates.  I have no objection to that, but it does upset the economy.  The Government have more responsibility in this than anybody else.</P>
    <P>Both Fine Gael and Labour have spoken at length about the lower paid workers.  The Government pay lip-service <Col N="360" /> to these workers but, when it comes to a demand by any section of the community, they do not give a damn about the lower paid workers. Surely it should be possible, when there is a demand, to give ten per cent to the lower paid workers and seven or eight per cent to those who are better paid.  The better paid workers get more because their unions are stronger.  We will have to evolve some system of added social benefits. The higher income groups should get no children's allowances while the lower paid workers should get double or treble the allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only way I can see of introducing some semblance of social justice.  I would much prefer to see the employer paying the worker but, if that is not possible, then social benefits will have to be given.  We cry over these workers but we do nothing for them.  The Minister has had experience in the Department of Social Welfare.  He must know that children's allowances in the case of certain groups are just so much pin money.</P>
      <P>There is then the problem of the female worker.  There is a shortage of female labour.  That is due not so much to a shortage of women as to the fact that it is not worth their while to work.  If they work they are penalised by way of taxation, while getting only 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the wage a man can command.  The women are available but it is not worth their while going out to work. One cannot blame them for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last year on the Estimate the increase in wages which happen in different sectors at different times of the year.  All wage increases should happen within a two- or three-month period in the year, thus eliminating leap-frogging.  Take, for example, an increase that would happen in June.  Under a two-year agreement, it would be £2.  By December, it would be £2 10s and by the following June it would be £3.  I do not think it is possible at the moment to know the percentage wage increase over any <Col N="361" /> period.  If we put it into a three-month or a two-month period&mdash;and have it for two years&mdash;we shall know we are free of trouble for two years and that each person will get the appropriate increase.  The Department and the Labour Court could do a great deal in this respect.  The Labour Court may not do it straight away but, over a period, it could gradually bring all the increases to the beginning of the summer: this is the time the unions prefer because there is more work. This would be a very good start and would stop leap-frogging.</P>
    <P>Last year, Deputy Tully and myself were looking for more members of the Labour Court to put this principle into practice: we would need many more members of the Labour Court.  Admittedly, it would work for only three months or so but the cost of paying it would be well worth while in order to get this type of agreement because then we would know that, for two years, we would be free from further wage claims. The Minister said that there had been two or three large increases lately and that there would probably be more in the offing in future months.</P>
    <P>We should try to evolve a national pensions scheme so that some of this increase would go into savings and could be used in a worthwhile pensions scheme.  I am not speaking, now, about a pensions scheme under which a man, on retirement, would get 50 per cent and probably would get a death policy as well.  I believe this could be done.  It would take a lot of this money out of circulation and still provide for the workers' future.  Furthermore, it would help to suppress inflationary tendencies. The money coming in would be money saved.  In all, it would be a good step from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>We shall be watching to see how many people go into the training centres, now that everything has been set up for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhere in his speech, the Minister talks about the main value of his Department being the fact that it could improve organisational <Col N="362" /> procedures between employers and employees.  In other words, the chief value of the Department is its neutral stance in our society, in ensuring that the contracts between the different sectors are as perfect as possible and in ensuring that any disagreements or disputes would at least be on vital issues rather than on trivial ones. That is an important part of the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>Lest I should forget it later, I wish to speak now about the shortage of female labour in different parts of this country.  The Minister should confer as soon as possible with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to whom I addressed a question yesterday about married women at work and the invidious taxation position which they must endure.  I gathered from the remarks of the Minister for Finance yesterday that he is thinking of changing that invidious taxation position of the married woman at work.  If I am correct in my opinion of the Minister's attitude yesterday in response to my question on this matter, I think we should see very early action in the forthcoming Budget in that regard.</P>
      <P>If this shortage exists in different parts of the country, there is a skilled reservoir of married women who are held back from the work force by virtue of the penal taxation measures taken against them.  People may argue that a woman's place is in the home. Perhaps it it.  However, if we do not economically give the husbands of the women of Ireland sufficient to provide for their families, we cannot expect the women to stay at home.  The question is whether we should provide homes for the women of Ireland if we wish them to stay there should they so desire and enable their husbands to maintain those homes.  It is becoming economically impossible for our married women to stay at home: they are forced to go out to work.  If that is the position we should not make it more difficult by penal taxation measures against them.  Their contribution in other developing economies is important. I believe their contribution here could be extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are interested in ensuring our <Col N="363" /> industrial expansion it does not make sense to discourage an important element from taking their full part in that industrial development.</P>
    <P>This Department was born out of the strife of the ESB dispute.  We have remarked on this in previous debates here.  We remember the piece of legislation which marked the birth pangs of the Department was the ESB (Special Provisions) Act which is now in abeyance and it is quite right that this should be in the case.  If that was the psychological origin of the Department, the fact is that, to some extent, this one-sided approach to industrial relations has survived in the economic thinking of the Department.  I would say that that part of the Minister's speech in which he talked about industrial relations, trends in wages and salaries, betrays this kind of one-sided approach to incomes in this country. That part of his speech relating to trends in wages and salaries could, I suggest, very easily appear in a page of the annual report of the Federated Union of Employers.  I think this is fair criticism.  The economic approach of the Minister and his advisers is indistinguishable from that of any employer in the country.  Their views coincide totally on the economic problems of the country.  I reject the statement that the maintenance settlement can be considered the main problem.  The Minister said yesterday that the maintenance agreement and its consequences may slow down the rate of growth and impair our prospects of increasing employment and reducing emigration.  He said the warning signals are already there with our widening trade gap, our growing balance of payments deficit and the developments in regard to credit and the availability of capital. Those remarks come at the end of that portion of his speech which comments on the results of the maintenance dispute. Earlier he remarks that:</P>
    <P>The settlement of that dispute has also become a pivotal factor in the growth of incomes.</P>
    <P>Later he says that:</P>
    <P>the maintenance agreement and its consequence may slow down the rate <Col N="364" /> of growth and impair our prospects of increasing employment and reducing emigration is now clear enough.  The warning signals are already there with our widening trade gap, our growing balance of payments deficit and the developments in regard to credit and the availability of capital.</P>
    <P>The question to be asked is: can we say that the craft unions have brought about a widening of the trade gap, a growing balance of payments deficit and developments in regard to credit and the availability of capital?  That kind of simple economic nostrum might have done 30 or 40 years ago but not any longer.  The economic responsibilities of the Government, their economic mistakes and the results of these mistakes, did not become apparent only after the maintenance dispute; they are continuing features of the Government's economic policy.  To suggest at this stage that the problems in our economy can be directly related to that dispute is to indulge in over-simplification.</P>
    <P>The current idea of discovering what caused our disputes lies in examining the course of these disputes some time later in a cool and impartial spirit but I do not believe that the Department of Labour understands the need for this cool and impartial examination when they can come out with simple, bald statements about the growing balance of payments deficit and the widening trade gap being due to the results of the unfortunate maintenance men's dispute at the beginning of this year.  It is indulging in scare tactics and attempting to shrug off responsibilities which the Government have had since 1957 to suggest that in future the maintenance men's dispute will be paraded as the reason for certain difficulties which have arisen in our economy, or any difficulties that may arise in the future.  Therefore, I would counsel the Minister in this regard: if he believes that the most important function is to provide this organisational perfection, in so far as that is achievable, in the institutions governing relations between employers and employees, then in future he should cut out this area of economic commentary from the Estimate for his Department, <Col N="365" /> especially if he persists in thinking that this should be his attitude on these economic developments.  However, it is questionable if the Estimate for the Department of Labour is the right Estimate on which to talk about incomes. If we assume that it is the best forum for a discussion on incomes, then we admit that agricultural incomes play no part in the problem, have no function or validity and also, apparently, we admit that profits, dividends and rents have nothing to do with a discussion on how incomes should be divided up in our community.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if I comment on the Minister's words I do so with that reservation that this is not the appropriate Estimate on which to discuss these matters, even if the Minister thinks so. We do not accept that the question of incomes can be confined to a discussion on wages and salaries; it is a far larger problem than that.  While that may appear to be a comprehensive way to describe it, in practice the discussion on an incomes policy has usually boiled down to how exactly we can limit the extent of wage and salary increases. Repeatedly we have pointed out that if we are serious about having an orderly incomes growth, then all forms of income must be part of that orderly progress.  As we know, this presents certain well-recognised difficulties, the difficulties outlined a long time ago by a previous Taoiseach when he said that a good sign of the health of our economy is when we see profits and dividends rising.  If that is so, how exactly can we restrain this sign of health?  How can we co-ordinate this dividend and profit growth with wage and salary growth?  If you are serious about limiting one form of incomes then you must present your formula for limiting other forms of income also.</P>
    <P>There is no hope that employees can ever accept a one-sided version of incomes. The Minister worries about the kind of increases that there will be, perhaps, at the start of next year for the twelfth round.  He may well worry because we are aware of the straitened circumstances of many people.  The Central Bank report referred to the question of house rents and to the cost of living earlier in the year.  The Minister's <Col N="366" /> version is that things would be moderately all right if it had not been for the maintenance dispute.  The Central Bank is not a biased source, not a source that we could claim as one that would suit our arguments, but the Central Bank has said that at least half of the eight per cent increase in the cost of living has been caused by the increase in indirect taxation.  Who plans the taxation policy?  The Minister and his colleagues and, therefore, a large portion of the blame for the inflationary rise in prices must lie with them.  They cannot say that a few craftsmen caused the wholesale, wildcat increases in prices.  The Minister and his colleagues are responsible for at least half of that increase, according to the Central Bank.  There has also been an increase in the cost of foodstuffs and again increased indirect taxation has played a big part in that through the wholesale tax and other taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, there is the overall problem of the kind of economy we have under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which the Government signed some years ago.  That agreement opens up our economy to even deeper penetration by British economic interests and British business and the by-product is that we import British inflation with our imports.  There is nothing individuals can do to prevent that situation which is one which is heartily endorsed by the economic policy of the Government.  Therefore, it would be superficial in that situation to suggest that wage-earners have the whole power of economic recovery in their hands.  The entire background thinking of the Minister's statement is that if only these people would tighten up their belts for a little longer, if only they would restrain their immoderate demands, we could move on from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Against what I have been saying, this is a superficial analysis of the situation. A very fashionable part of this limited view of incomes, a view limited to seeing this situation as being one entirely confined to wage and salary earners, has been that by their immoderate demands they worsen the situation of lower paid workers.  This <Col N="367" /> has become one of the tear-jerking songs of Fianna Fáil, the plight of the lower paid worker.  They discovered it just before the last election; it has not been mentioned very often since.  In recent years it became one of the most touching choruses of the Government, the lower paid workers.  Ministers of the Government attempted, by cutting their own salaries, to do their best spiritually to join the lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>May I suggest a very simple remedy to the Minister who is so concerned about lower paid workers?  He has voiced his concern for these people. His colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has it within his power tomorrow morning&mdash;and no trade unionist will object to this&mdash;to increase all social welfare benefits.  He will do more than all the trade union action in the world to improve the position of lower paid workers if he hands out a £5 increase to all recipients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall listen with great attention to any nauseating contribution we may have later from the same Deputy when that is the sort of argument he puts forward.  Incomes of of families of lower paid workers need to be substantially increased and I suggest that the Government, with their overall majority, have the power to do more for the lower paid worker than all the might of trade unionism: they can increase social welfare benefits. That will mean an additional income for every family that needs an increase.  That is an option open to the Minister and no draftsman, trade unionist or Deputy will object to this action of the Government.  If they are sincere about the lower paid worker they have the power, and can have the glory of doing something about it.  We shall give them all the support necessary, put aside any Bill and invite the Government to do something before Christmas for the lower paid workers about whom they have been prating for the past year.</P>
      <P>The Minister admits that the institutional arrangements will be his chief contribution and I agree that the Department of Labour has a very positive role to play in improving the organisational position between em-employers and employees organisations. To some extent the improvements which have been agreed to in the House, such as the improvements in the Labour Court, have been a step in the right direction.  Quite a lot remains to be done.  The Minister mentioned that he is thinking of these things but I have in mind especially the necessity of updating the situation in which the conditions of employment of most workers in this country are governed by an Act of 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should not a Government that is so proud to proclaim its concern and sympathy for workers have done something to update that Act since 1936?  This is 1969.  The same applies to the Factories Act of 1955 which is only a copy of the 1937 Act in Britain.  It is time this was updated.  It seems the <Col N="369" /> Department has a big job on hands to rescue Irish workers from Victorian factory legislation which operates at present.  Whatever the failings of the Northern regime may be workers in Northern Ireland work under modern legislation.  Their counterparts here work under Victorian Fianna Fáil legislation.  That situation should be changed, if the Minister is anxious to preserve the claim of the Government to be concerned about workers Here is another job we invite him to tackle tomorrow morning or next week by bringing in the necessary measures.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to change the out-of-date legislation in regard to shift work.  It is now too onerous and should be updated.  The Minister mentions his intention of ensuring that minimum periods for dismissal notices should be put into law.  This concerns the period for which a worker should know beforehand that there will be no job for him after a certain date. The worker in the North of Ireland has this right.  He has enlightened pieces of legislation to preserve his dignity at work; we still await such enlightened legislation down here.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned his attitude towards redundancy payments and the changes which are necessary.  The Bill as originally drafted excluded employees aged between 16 and 18 and between 65 and 70.  I may add, for the education of Deputies opposite who may not know of the Labour Party's concern for workers that, on the encouragement of my party, the Bill, as amended, covered such employees.  I invite Deputies opposite to refer to the debate of that period and they will see the amount of co-operation that existed between the Minister for Labour and ourselves.  They will see that the Minister accepted our suggestions and they can also see how our workers finally benefited by that co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I here are more important <Col N="370" /> things to talk about than Deputy Tunney's predilections for welts.  Persons who normally expect to work for the same employer for less than 25 hours a week were excluded from the original Bill.  This was altered to 21 hours.  To qualify for a redundancy payment the Minister maintained at that time that four years service with the same employer was necessary and that is what is at present in the Act.  In our amendment&mdash;rejected at that time&mdash;we sought to reduce the qualifying period to two years.  I hope that the Minister, since he now regards the redundancy fund as buoyant, will consider again the Labour Party's amendment and see if he can, in the new Bill, ensure that the qualifying period will be reduced to two years.</P>
      <P>In other Labour amendments the Labour Party sought to extend the periods provided for notice of dismissal to the same periods as are set out in the Northern Ireland Contracts of Employment Act to which I referred earlier.  I hope the Minister can see his way to accede to our request as set out in our amendments to the original Bill.  Also, the Bill originally provided that weekly payments should be made to redundant workers after the expiration of four weeks unemployment. We sought to reduce this period to one week and the Minister agreed to reduce it to two weeks.  Now, perhaps, the Minister could accede to our original request and reduce the period to one week.  At the time our amendment was put down when the Bill was going through the House, he very kindly altered the original legislation and changed the provision from four weeks to two.  He split the difference. We were looking for one week. Since the fund is now in such a good position could he reduce it to one week as we originally requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also sought in a Labour Party amendment to have absence from work by reason of a strike occurring after the commencement of the Act allowable as reckonable service.  Perhaps, he would have a look at this also.  I would also ask the Minister to see if he could arrange for an increase in the lump sum available to workers who are declared redundant.  He said somewhere <Col N="371" /> in his speech that the average payment over the past year or two years under the lump sum provision in the Act was £149.  This will not break the bank.  It does not look as if there has been an extraordinary draw in this area, and the lump sum payment is extremely important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is the average.  It would be very hard to say, but it does not seem to me that there has been an extraordinary draw in this area.  I would ask the Minister if he would consider an increase in the lump sum available to workers who are declared redundant.  The position at the moment is that he gets a half week's pay for each year of service.  I would ask him to double this and to give one week's pay for each year of service.</P>
      <P>I would also ask him in relation to men of over 41 years to increase the amount to two weeks pay for each year of service.  We must remember that a man in his fifties who is declared redundant, and gets the lump sum payment and the weekly payment for a period, cannot look forward, in most cases, to any alternative work.  That is the unhappy position at the moment. Kaim-Caudle referred to these people as senior citizens which is a better term, I should imagine, than old age pensioners.  Such a person cannot look forward, in my experience anyway, to any alternative work for the remaining years of his life.  There are very valuable years of work left in a man in his early fifties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their attitude to such people certain employers are not up to date. They are old fashioned.  In modern conditions a man in his early fifties still has many years of active service left in him.  He has the valuable experience he has gained while working but there is no doubt that there is a prejudice in employers' minds against taking him on.  Unhappily, the practice has been that such people find themselves with no work for the next so many years.  The redundancy payment seems to be the last golden handshake they get on retirement.  In fact, it is a retirement grant they get at that <Col N="372" /> stage, even though this was not intended in the Act.</P>
    <P>They are not in the happy position of many people in Irish industry who receive private pensions from their employers.  I would say that the biggest job we must do in Irish industry is to deal with this matter of class division in Irish industry.  If Irish industry ideally should be a community effort, I fail to understand why certain people in Irish industry have totally different working conditions from other people involved in the same industry.  How can we say that one man in one firm on his retirement should have a private pension scheme from that firm which will go on until he is dead, while another man has no pension scheme? How can we say that one of these employees can have the same dedication to that firm and the same loyalty? It is obviously impossible.  It is easy to understand why one employee should feel a sense of what is called alienation from the activities of the firm and another employee should have a feeling of commitment to the firm.</P>

      <P>The Chair is loath to intervene in the Deputy's contribution, but I am sure the Deputy is well aware of the rules which lay down that it is the Minister's administration of his Department which comes up for discussion on the occasion of his Estimate.  Being critical of legislation and advocacy of legislation or other general policy matters do not fall for discussion on the Minister's Estimate.  There is no motion to refer the Estimate back and the debate is, therefore, confined to the administration of the Minister's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister referred to the problems of incomes in general and he expressed his concern and worry about the effects of the maintenance strike. I am suggesting, in a constructive way, I would hope, that if we are to understand properly this problem of incomes, which is a besetting problem, and understand the psychology and the motivation of those involved in disputes and strikes, then we would need <Col N="373" /> to understand their background in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>I am making the point that strikes and disputes are just the tip of the iceberg.  Underneath that iceberg are such things as the housing policy, the availability of houses, the standard of living, the position of employees in their jobs, how they are treated in their jobs, their conditions of work, the legislation governing their position at work, and the attitude of management and employers towards them.  These are all contributory factors which arise before people go out on strike.  The beginning of the story of a strike does not commence with the strike ballot. The background of a strike and the causative factors of a strike go back a long way.  A dispute occurs and two or three weeks later we set up a study group and say: &ldquo;Here are the chief actors in this dispute, here are the causes, here are the reasons.&rdquo;  We must try to understand the whole background of disputes in our community. Why should a dispute occur, some people ask, in a community in which we all have much the same background? These are valid matters to be studied and considered.</P>
      <P>I would certainly say that the different form of treatment meted out to various employees in Irish industry is certainly a large contributory factor. The place you live in, the place you work in&mdash;these are the things which govern your attitude to work and to society.  I would say that attitudes to society are part of the reasons which motivate people to go on the picket line.  A strike does not commence with the declaration of a ballot in favour of strike action.  The fundamental reasons go very much deeper than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider this managerial attitude.  When he gets up to speak on labour topics in future, he might consider attacking these prejudices which exist in Irish industry on the part of people who do not appear to look upon a firm and the people working in it as a team.  We are sick of hearing speeches to the effect that we must all work together in a team effort. If the treatment is such that it divides the team into captains, subs and regular <Col N="374" /> members of the team, you will not get that team effort you seek.</P>
    <P>Other speakers may have more to say about it, but I would suggest that the Minister should expedite his review of protective legislation.  Much of it was framed in totally different conditions in the 'Thirties.  Much of protective factory legislation which governs the conditions of work of the majority of Irish employees is over one-third of a century old.  That is not a situation that should be tolerated any longer.  The Minister should get that section of his Department to get to work rapidly and we shall make way in this House for any necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>Part of the Minister's speech refers to safety in Irish industry.  The Minister spoke about NISO.  He remarks that he has increased the grant-in-aid to NISO to £10,000 on the basis of £4 from the Exchequer, that is, from the taxpayer, for each £1 of subscription income.  Maybe I am simple-minded about this, but does this mean that Irish firms are not subscribing in full to the work of NISO?  Frequently one sees well-publicised functions in various parts of the country in relation to which thousands of pounds are spent by different firms on advertising.  I can think of no more impressive advertisement of a company's enlightened policy in relation to its employees than to say they were investing in a big safety campaign. It would be of far more positive value to the working community than the value of this tipped cigarette or that tipped cigarette or this or that kind of washing powder or soap.  The Minister should see to it that Irish firms contribute more to safety publicity and safety consciousness among workers.</P>
    <P>The number of safety committees set up is pretty low; the Minister remarks on that himself.  There are only about 100 committees in the whole country.  This is a very bad situation.  I know the Minister will say that the late Minister, Deputy Bill Norton, in his legislation gave the power of setting up the safety committees to Irish employees.  We must reconsider this situation and ensure that industrial managements are also <Col N="375" /> given certain responsibilities and obligations in the matter of setting up safety committees.  It can no longer be left on its present legislative basis, because the proof is there that we are not getting the committees formed.  All the seminars in the world apparently will make no headway against the apathy which exists in relation to safety.  While the number of fatal injuries may be small, something like 20 a year, a bad injury to a wage earner can cause untold hardship to himself and his dependants for his whole working life.  It is important that something concrete should be done about safety and that management should make its due contribution in ensuring that safety committees are set up in co-operation, of course, with the employees, especially when the situation is that only 100 safety committees exist for the whole country.</P>
    <P>The Minister say that the Government's attitude to emigration is unchanged. I presume what the Minister means is that we are not for emigration, that we are still against it, and that we are doing everything in our power to stop it.  Emigration continues and it must continue as long as there are no jobs available.  To have jobs available means that we must have some strategy for the provision of jobs.  Part of that strategy, as I understand it, was the development of growth centres.  It is like <i>Hamlet</i> without the ghost.  In the whole speech I do not see any reference to the strategy of growth centres.  There is a certain nervousness on the part of this Government in declaring where the growth centres must be, and I can quite understand it.  However, a Government with a majority like this, if it is serious about growth centres, must say where they are going to be.  I would imagine that if the Minister for Labour is anxious about emigration he must begin to say where these centres should be.  If we are to have a manpower service, training and so on, all these things are useless without knowing where we are planning to locate industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister bemoans the fact that there is no tradition of mobility of <Col N="376" /> labour between one part of this country and another.  That may be, but one big impediment to a worker moving from one part of the country to another in search of a job is the lack of houses. Deputies behind the Minister, from the different constituencies, could tell him that the building of houses is a lost art.  They have not built houses for a long time in many parts of the country.  You may have a newly opened factory but where will you get a house?  Where will you get a builder to put up the house? How long will it take to put it up?  Mobility between different parts of this country will never be achieved until we solve this problem of house construction, and this is something to which I would direct the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister's manpower forecasting unit, we understand, is not yet in action.  We are told this is a problem which affects all other countries, that this is a new area.  I have no doubt it is and that the Department is coming up against the same problems as similar departments in other countries, but I would hope that in the near future we would have some idea of the findings of this forecasting unit.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he will separate the placement facilities and the manpower service, that is the one which will direct employees in search of work, from the benefit paying sections in the exchanges.  This is long overdue.  I think the Minister will come up against a very strong psychological barrier because employers do not have any tradition of notifying unemployment exchanges, as they used to be called, of job vacancies.  Unemployed men usually find that the best jobs are not at the exchange.  I do not know what the Minister can do about this problem but he will have to get a totally new acceptance of job placement with employers, unions and the general public if his new job placement service is not to be isolated in beautiful offices with no applicants. I do not think that would be a very successful exercise.  I do not know exactly what the Minister can do about this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly has enough problems on his plate without venturing <Col N="377" /> into the thorny area of incomes. I would suggest the Minister leave that area alone.  A lot of reputations have floundered in trying to solve that problem. I know the Minister is a man for the quiet life and I would counsel him to forget this area because his Department simply cannot extend its scope into all the areas that should be concerned in the formulation of an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the career leaflets which this placement service has distributed, 166 of which have bombarded our schools, I hope there is some selectivity in their distribution.  I hope we are not proceeding on the basis of providing a leaflet on everything from chiropody to manicuring.  I would like to suggest that we concentrate on priority areas of employment and on areas which have futures.  As we all know, there is very little career guidance in our schools.  The Minister may have a role to play in liasion with the Department of Education because there is a great deal to be done in an advisory capacity for our school children.  I would consider the best way in which the Department could co-operate with the Department of Education is to visit people, giving them up-to-date information in specific areas of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should do something to extend the protective legislation with regard to juveniles.  I would ask him to act on the memorandum submitted to the Department by the trade unions when they asked for employment of juveniles under 15 to be prohibited. It is strange to realise that such a request should be necessary in the year 1969 and it is equally strange to realise that there has been no response. The trade unions also requested that the Minister should have power to prohibit juveniles under 16 years from particular classes of employment. They also requested that the employment of juveniles between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. be prohibited.  Again, it is strange that this request should be necessary.  The whole area of juvenile employment is one of the large areas of discrimination left in this country. There is little protection offered to <Col N="378" /> them because many of them are in employment in which they are not protected by unions.  The worst exploited elements in this country at the present time are our female workers and our children&mdash;and that is the proper name for people under the age of 15.  I am sure nobody would halt the Department in any protective legislation it might bring in to safeguard our children from exploitation by employers.  It is up to the Minister to bring in legislation to ensure that exploitation is stopped.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his long speech talked about a number of the various functions of his Department.  He mentioned certain things that in my opinion he should have refrained from mentioning, or at least that he need not have gone into in such detail, especially on the matter of incomes, because, as I have explained, the incomes situation is not one that can be described solely as a matter confined to wages and salaries.  The whole question is related to all forms of income.  We on our side of the House would not accept that profits be left out.  We suggest that if the Government are serious about doing something for the lower paid worker they have the power to do so by increasing social welfare contributions and by their general taxation policy.  We would not feel too happy about the Department of Labour concentrating on an area in which its overall functions do not permit it to speak on questions and matters outside its control.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt in any great detail with the Minister's comments on industrial relations.  There are the changes in the Labour Court.  I notice the Minister does not quite say that the Trade Union Bill has been dropped.  I would counsel the Minister, even if the Department does display a certain one-sided approach in economic matters, that it should not adopt this approach on the question of industrial relations.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the intention announced in the Trade Union Bill to confine the activities of trade unions and to limit their freedom of action.  I would say to him that the tightening up of trade <Col N="379" /> union procedure in this country is something that the unions themselves are best equipped to do.  He may say they have done very little about it up to now; this is a fair enough answer. He may say they have done very little about a voluntary incomes policy. None of us is under any illusion that if we are to talk about an incomes policy at the present time we must speak only of a voluntary incomes policy, one which is entered into freely.  Likewise, if we are to talk about rationalisation of trade union organisation this can only come about voluntarily and, difficult though it may be, we all now understand that this is the only progressive way that this will occur.  To speak about legislation to bring this about is, in fact, to create added problems and this has been the experience of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department, at the start of its career, assumed that legislation was the whole answer and now, some years after, although under a different Minister, appreciation has developed in the Department that a voluntary, enthusiastic principle at work is a far better guide to progress than coercive legislation at work.  I would certainly urge the Minister in any Trade Union Bill to bear this in mind.  There are certain good things he mentioned in that Bill and he knows them better than I.  He has had enough discussions with the unions.  There are things they agree on, and he should proceed to work with them in those areas but he cannot proceed with some of the ideas he mentioned, which have created widespread opposition.</P>
    <P>I would appeal also to the Minister, speaking in this area of trade unions, that he should honour the pledge given by Mr. Lemass in the light of the Educational Company judgement, that the limitations introduced by the Act on the activities of the unions would be removed.  I know it has not been repeated recently and I know the Minister still feels their removal must be a bargaining counter for co-operation on the other side.  I would ask the Minister to rid himself of this kind of attitude in the matter.  I would ask him to live up to this pledge previously <Col N="380" /> given.  The pledge was given that the Act which would limit the unions would be removed from the Statute Book.  Correspondence passed between the unions and the Minister on this matter.  If the Minister wants to start off on the right foot with the organisations representing employees, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, he should ensure that the Act will be removed and that the necessary legislative change will be made.  It is not for me to say whether it would need a constitutional change or otherwise but it would go a long way to removing the disabilities created by that Act if the Minister were to agree with the unions and bring the necessary enabling legislation into this House.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister in his reply can give us some idea about the future work of his Department, give us an idea as to what will have priority in the work of his Department, whether it will be the protective factory legislation, which I believe is the most important work of the Department, and will give this House an assurance that the Department is now at last abandoning the coercive measures it attempted earlier in its career in relation to unions.  I would urge the Minister in future Estimate speeches, and indeed in the coming year or two, to avoid the question of incomes and to wait for action by other members of the Cabinet on that matter.  I would suggest it is a snare and a delusion for him, as Minister for Labour, to wade into this area of incomes when the full writ of his Department does not run to deliberation on all forms of incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his brief here has given us plenty of detail in regard to hopes and aspirations of finding some way of implementing all the good things which the Minister and the House want in regard to the labour situation in this country.  At the end of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If we are to have any chance of realising the hopes we all share for the future of our people, the causes of our troubles must be dealt with and some better way found to achieve orderly increases in employment and incomes without the evils of inflation and industrial strife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> In that sentence the Minister summed up what we want.  The point is then: &ldquo;How do we achieve it?&rdquo; We are a small community but yet we have failed up to the present to create a community spirit.  Every section of our people&mdash;employers, trade unionists and the general public&mdash;would agree that we have a common purpose to achieve the common good.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say that but, bearing in mind the weakness of human nature, we realise something greater is called for than mere directives or mere hopes.  Education has the greatest part to play in conveying to our people the fact that unless there is a great community effort with each one willing to make the necessary sacrifices, we are in for more trouble and we will be no better off than those countries that have long abandoned spiritual values and have replaced them by material values.</P>
    <P>We can say we are making progress. The figures for employment given by the Minister, the fact that emigration has fallen and that our people are generally better off than they were a few years ago are hopeful signs that we can progress and by the use of common sense can solve many of our problems and thereby reduce suffering.</P>
    <P>We can say, also, that in some spheres we have full employment.  Perhaps we might even say that in some skilled crafts we have got over-employment. At the same time, the fact must be recognised that many of our people have not yet been able to find gainful employment.  If we are to achieve the target set by the NIEC of full employment by 1980 there will have to be a big increase in employment.</P>
    <P>Men are generally inclined to think only of male employment and the fact that women can play a part in the community has been overlooked.  That fact was mentioned several times in this House on the various occasions when we discussed the very thorny problem of women at work.  It is all very well to say that a woman's place is in the home, which I suppose basically it is, but the fact is that unless we create conditions where the mother of <Col N="382" /> a young family does not have to go to work in a factory or office in order to supplement the income of her husband, it is being hypocritical to try to confine her to the home when we have not created conditions which will allow her to perform her office of mother to her children without worry as to where next week's rent comes from or how the children's clothing is to be paid for. There is no easy way of creating conditions in which we can say to a woman: &ldquo;Yes, your right place is in the home and we will ensure that it will be a home where you will be able to carry out your duties unhaunted by the spectre of how to make ends meet.&rdquo; Of course, we cannot say that no other country has done this yet.  In other perhaps more prosperous States women can find work easily.</P>
    <P>In this country and elsewhere, the necessity for women to go out to work has raised grave problems in the matter of the upbringing of their children. Although there is a lot to be said for the emancipation of women, it may also be suggested that women who compete in the industrial and commercial rat race have been taken out of their natural environment.  It may not be a matter for the Minister for Labour to solve this problem, to eliminate the necessity for women with families to go out of work.  The Minister for Finance last week said he would look into the matter of taxation of working women, but I am afraid he must go further, perhaps by way of increased children's allowances to working class families, to eliminate the necessity for married women with families to compete on the labour market.  I should hope that we would practise the philosophy of a woman's place being in the home by making it possible for her family to live in comfort without her earnings on the labour market.</P>
    <P>In this technological age we will always face new problems in the matter of industrial relations.  It is one of the thorniest new problems we have and if one reads the Murphy Report on the maintenance strike one finds plenty of food for thought.  However, nobody can come up with a blueprint and say: &ldquo;If you do this you will not have future upheavals&rdquo;.  In strikes it is always the <Col N="383" /> unfortunate workers who suffer most, as in the craftsmen's strike.  It is no use pointing an accusing finger at either the employers' associations or the unions.  Most of us were thunderstruck by the developments in the craftsmen's strike and its effects.  The Minister gave figures about the loss of man hours, of production and consequently of exports. These figures can teach us a lesson and perhaps wiser counsels may prevail all round in future.  The strike is over but we must be prepared to learn from the experience gained and to try to ensure that by mutual co-operation there will be no recurrence of such a dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise any worker for trying to better himself by way of salary or wages.  I realise that a man must sell his labour for as high a price as he can get, but I wish to emphasise that a worker's claim for better wages and conditions must be based on production because if we have increased production we can sell more goods at home and, particularly, abroad.  In this context I should like also to emphasise that in industrial disputes and strikes it is always the lower paid worker who suffers most.  At no stage, for instance, of the craftsmen's strike could the lower paid workers hope to get a reward.  The only bright spot in that strike was the fact that one trade union leader took the lead and succeeded in giving the workers a certain dignity.  He did not stand by to see his people suffer when it was realised they had no hope of any benefit from such suffering.  That leader set a good example and I hope the lesson of his action will not be lost on other trade unionists or, indeed, on the employers.</P>
    <P>One remedy for the ills in industrial relations which would help to create the necessary community spirit in industry would be legislation to give trade unions opportunity for amalgamation, greater rationalisation.  The unions themselves want it: they have asked that everything be done to help towards union amalgamation.</P>
    <P>At this stage we might remind employers' organisations that they, too, need to get together.  Generally we make the mistake of thinking that <Col N="384" /> there is but one organisation of employers. In fact, there are several.  Why can they not come together in one organisation? Reorganised in that fashion they could play a much bigger part than is being played by splinter groups some giving and some refusing to give the increases sought by the workers.</P>
    <P>Unless we can solve our industrial relations problem we will never be able to provide full employment for our people.  Every Deputy deplores the necessity for any man to emigrate.  We must face the fact that industrial strife has caused many of our people to emigrate, not that they will find a much better life in Britain; it is possible that they will on the Continent. A feature of emigration in recent years has been the number of our people who have gone to the Continent rather than to Britain, the traditional target for them.</P>
    <P>It is very fashionable to stress the needs of the lower paid workers but this is a point on which I feel strongly. Our society is changing and some sections have become extremely affluent. The lower paid worker is given help by the State in various ways and efforts are made by local authorities to provide better housing, but for the man of ambition and aspiration we must create better prospects and more opportunities.</P>
    <P>We must be able to say to a man whose father was a labourer that he need not be one also.  We must say in respect of every child born in this State that no office shall be barred to him due to lack of education or family finance.  In recent years we have made great strides in opening up educational opportunities for all our children.  The Minister for Labour and his Department have a tremendous task before them, and they must play their part in educating all sections, both employers and workers, to the fact that the lowest paid of our workers has a place in our scheme of things and that he can rise to the heights if he has the ability and ambition.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned a point that we should examine very carefully, that is, the employment of young <Col N="385" /> people.  If one goes into certain establishments in the city one will find young boys working in an environment which will not help them in later life.  I hope the Minister will look into this problem of juveniles in employment which is often quite unsuitable.  It may be said we have safeguards against this, but they were geared to meet the needs of past times.  The social and industrial scene is changing and we must ensure that children first have a sound primary, and preferably post-primary, education before they are asked to take their place in the labour market.</P>
    <P>One point in the Minister's brief gave me satisfaction&mdash;the control of private employment agencies&mdash;and I thank him for stating he will introduce legislation to deal with those agencies.  Last year I told the House of one agency in the city where it was alleged, but I could not get proof, a girl who sought employment was sent to a brothel in London.</P>
    <P>When I raised this question before I was told that it was a matter for Dublin Corporation which was then in existence. I went over to the corporation and found that the corporation part was covered by an Act of, I think it was, 1891 and all that Act said was that the agencies' premises should be kept in proper condition.  The Act applied only to the employment of domestic servants.  This illustrates just how much we need new legislation on this point.  We must ensure that no agency will be in a position to send young girls away to places such as I have mentioned and that they cannot be sold to the London market.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister regarding unemployment and emigration are heartening and the figures for unemployment can be reduced even further if we all become conscious of the fact that apart from having a job ourselves we have a duty to provide jobs for those who have not got them. If sacrifices must be made we cannot ask the lower paid workers to make them.  It is time that we had a new charter for the lower paid workers who are the ones making the sacrifices all the time.  We must show that our utterances here are not mere platitudes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Redundancy Act, <Col N="386" /> the Minister gave some interesting figures which show that there is a drop in the number of people affected by redundancy.  However, I ask the Minister to have another look at the Act and possibly make it a little easier for appeals to be made to the tribunal. Very often one comes across people who are not sure of what steps they should take when there is disagreement between them and their employer concerning redundancy.  I know that the trade unions will prepare a case for them but only last week I met some men who had never heard of the appeals tribunal.  This is not the fault of the Department, but it is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned protection of people in industry.  Previous legislation gave workers the opportunity and privilege of setting up safety committees in industry but they never seemed to get off the ground.  Some employers take excellent safety precautions while others do not take any at all.  Last year 20 men died as a result of accidents in industry.  This number is far too great.  It is probable that in the majority of those cases the accidents would have been prevented if the proper precautions had been taken. I feel certain that the Minister will ensure that management in industry will have every help from the Department to ensure safety on their premises. Where there is a mechanical plant in operation there will always be some danger but if men and women are educated to respect the danger that may be inherent in that machine many accidents could be prevented.  Safety in industry is as vital as, say, lack of strikes.</P>
    <P>The International Labour Office, as the Minister has mentioned, are this year celebrating their fiftieth year in existence.  The fact that the Organisation has been awarded a Nobel Prize this year is an indication of the great strides that have been made in the field of labour generally.  It is a tribute to successive Governments in this country that they have always played their part in backing up the ILO in their lofty ambitions by introducing effective legislation here in so far as we can do so.</P>
    <P>One could speak for hours on this Estimate, which I regard as, possibly, <Col N="387" /> the most important one in the list, because on this will depend our progress or lack of progress in the future.  The Minister, in his short time in this Department, has shown his awareness of the problems that must be faced.  He is a most approachable Minister on any matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised to amend the Trade Union Bill.  Deputy O'Leary has said that this is a matter for the trade unions themselves.  Last year, I and a number of other Deputies, realising it can be a tricky business to bring in a Trade Union Bill to satisfy everybody, addressed an open letter to congress telling them that we appreciated their objections but asking them why they did not put forward what they thought should be in the Bill, and then have it introduced by way of a Private Members' Bill.  However, there is no need for a Private Members' Bill on this, because I am sure that when the Minister receives the recommendations from congress they will be examined. am sure that the Minister will not take punitive action in regard to any section, but will bring in a proper piece of legislation designed for the good of all.</P>
    <P>There should be no contention between the trade unions and the Government on this issue.  We are much too small a community for that sort of thing.  In this sphere we could set a headline for other small countries in Europe by letting them see that we agree on basic principles and that we are quite willing to make sacrifices to ensure that these principles will be put into effect.  I appeal for help from either side of the House to drop this antagonism which I do not think exists deeply down but which may sound good in a speech to castigate the other side.  It may relieve somebody's feelings but it will not take us any further on the road to national prosperity if we criticise each other all the time.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his attitude to the training of workers and to pay tribute to AnCO for the way in which they are tackling this training.  We have very far to go before we have all the methods, systems and institutions which we all want to see We are tackling the problem <Col N="388" /> in the right way.  AnCO have the co-operation of all sections of trade unions and employers, and the goodwill of us all, but they have still far to go.</P>
    <P>Careers guidance is very important nowadays.  Less than 20 years ago in this city a boy or girl would go to a job for the first time, taking whatever job turned up and feeling lucky to get it.  Nowadays we suffer from the aftermath of this system because workers sometimes went into jobs they detested since they were the only ones available.  This is changed for the better but there is still the problem of preventing a square peg being put into a round hole, or the problem of the boy who, because his father was a tradesman, took up a similar trade without really having any interest in it. This was the old pattern here.  I hope it is fading out.  Young people were sent for employment in trades they did not like and perhaps would never be good at.  They were sent to trades for which there was some tradition in their family groups. People do not always conform to tradition.  Career guidance officers can do much to influence the parents of a young person in the choice of employment and at the same time to advise the boy or girl.  We have aptitude tests nowadays to help inform a youth of the job he should take.  It is the Government's duty to create conditions in which employment will be available for everybody.  Employment should be more than an end in itself.  A man should be employed in such a manner that he can lead a full life and play his part in contributing to the general prosperity of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at the lack of vision shown in the Minister's speech.  By farsightedness and energy on his part he could greatly help industrial relations in this country as well as the development of the regional technical colleges and the apprenticeship schemes, especially those of AnCo.  This Department must be seen in the context of the European Economic Community.  It is important that the Department should turn its thoughts to the Rome Treaty because under that treaty there would be freedom of movement of workers <Col N="389" /> within the Community and discrimination based on nationality will not be allowed in private industry.  These changes alone must have a profound and lasting effect on employers and workers in Ireland.  It must be remembered that membership of a trade union must then be open to foreigners. Foreigners will be allowed to avail of our social security system.  Foreign companies and firms will be allowed the right of establishment in the Republic.  Irish property and farmland may be bought under the same terms as will apply to Irish citizens.  Indeed, professional services would be open to non-nationals including posts in medical, banking and insurance fields.</P>
      <P>In general the freeing between member countries of factory production will have a tremendous effect not only on the industrial scene in Ireland but also on the trade union, industrial relations and employers fronts.  It is peculiar to note that the Minister did not even refer to the European Economic Community, nor did the speaker from the front bench of the Labour Party.  In the circumstances, I would suggest to the House that a select committee be established to examine the consequences of our accession to the European Economic Community.  The consequences for trade unions and employers and the structure of industrial relations should be examined. It should assess the situation here in Ireland and the situation which exists in the European Community.  That select committee could do invaluable work and help in no small way to inform this House, and indeed the Irish public, of what lies ahead in the field of industrial relations and the field of apprentice training in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Curiously enough, the longest passage of the Minister's speech referred to the trend in wages and salaries.  I was frankly slightly amused at the approach taken by the Minister to the Irish economic and monetary scene.  The Minister referred to the 12th round and asked whether we could survive the damage.  He even called on Providence and a lot of luck to see us through.  This approach is a childish one.  I have no intention of analysing the Irish economic scene over the last <Col N="390" /> few years but I say here and now that this Government alone stands condemned for not controlling its own expenditure and for not controlling the general level of prices within our economy.  It has, in fact, allowed political interests to override those of sound monetary and commercial policy.  When history comes to be written in this sphere this Government can only be described as capricious and vagabond in its attitude to prices.  I refer to this because the Minister has done so in no small way.  Perhaps it might be better to discuss it on the Estimate for the Department of Finance but I felt moved to discuss it now in view of the Minister's pronouncements on it.  I consider that his approach was very ill-advised and that the workers have a right to reject it. It is, after all, important that the Minister has the confidence not only of trade unions but also of employers.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations scene last year was a most unfortunate one. While I should like to express the highest hopes that this year will not be a repetition of last year, I wonder whether it would not be good legislation to introduce in respect of essential industries a cooling-off period such as that which exists in the United States.  A cooling-off period could have a very beneficial effect on trade disputes.</P>
    <P>The new Industrial Relations Act gives the Labour Court more flexibility in its handling of disputes, and for that it is to be welcomed.  I hope the Government can come to some agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about the now lapsed Trade Union Bill.  I consider it very important that the Government should agree with Congress on any move to amend trade union legislation.</P>

      <P>Much good can come of agreement but much discontent and ill-feeling will arise if the Government force upon the scene a Bill which is not acceptable to the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have cause to be interested in what I consider a very important development on the labour scene, that is the activities of An Chomhairle Oiliúna. The training and re-training of workers is a vital activity of the Minister's Department and it is one to which I hope he will give the utmost attention in the coming years especially in the context of the evolving European scene.  I accept that the various schemes are in the embryonic stage but I believe that they have a sound future.  I would suggest that the staff of AnCO should keep in touch with the new regional technical colleges and indeed the various technical schools and the universities because together they can <Col N="392" /> be a great force in developing an excellent pool of technical and technologically trained people in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to have current and accurate information on manpower availability and therefore the national manpower service is to be welcomed. Its success will depend on its being efficient and up-to-date with its figures. I hope that the service will encompass the manpower surveys, which I hope will be continued, and manpower forecasting. It should also provide information on redundancy payments and resettlement allowances.  This is of vital importance if we are to make labour mobile within our community.  This, of course, is apart altogether from the need for housing in the various industrial development centres to which the Labour Deputy referred, a point which I take.  Indeed, last week the National Building Agency got increased capital for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I, too, feel that the protective legislation of the Department should be updated.  It is antiquated and should be immediately made the subject of new legislation.  This, of course, refers also to the safety, health and welfare of workers, which are important.  In passing, I would say that the trade unions themselves have a part to play on the factory floor in enforcing this protective legislation.  They should object to bad, unsafe procedures and indeed the Minister should encourage the setting up of safety committees in factories, as indeed the trade unions should encourage the setting up of safety committees in factories.</P>
    <P>The career information service of the Department should extend beyond mere leaflets.  That is a pitiful contribution to this important aspect of career guidance.  The Department should engage qualified experts in the field of adolescent career guidance and I would suggest that industrial psychologists could play a great part in helping young people to decide in what field they will spend their adult lives.</P>
    <P>The question of juvenile employment is one which I do not think gives rise for concern throughout the country. We have reached a certain maturity <Col N="393" /> in this field.  The Minister should, of course, keep an alert eye on abuses of juvenile labour and should not hesitate to prosecute in any case where exploitation of juvenile labour has been perpetrated.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, too, that the Minister should interest himself in the conditions of agricultural workers.  He should not exclude this section of the population.  I accept that the wages and conditions of agricultural workers may not at the moment lie within the jurisdiction of his Department.  I suggest however this is the proper Department in which to discuss and legislate upon conditions for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Any development within our economy must come about within the context of an incomes policy.  If we are to survive in Europe we must have an incomes policy.  I am not forcing an incomes policy down the throats of any section of our community but I believe it should be possible between the Trade Union Congress, the Federation of Employers, the Department of Labour and, if necessary, the Government to hammer out a national agreement on an incomes policy.  If incomes must be restrained, so be it.  It is only right that workers should be in a position in which they are aware that every section of the population is agreeable to restraint in incomes.</P>
    <P>I come now to the ticklish problem of profits.  The Labour Party must appreciate the necessity for profits. Profits are an incentive.  There is nothing to stop the Government taxing the distribution of profits, but that is a different matter altogether from saying that profits must be controlled.  Anyone who says profits must be controlled is ignorant of the function of profits within our economy.</P>
    <P>The Department have a major role to play in the years ahead.  If the Minister in control of the Department is progressive enough, or even adventurous enough, to grapple with the problems of industrial relations in general, then much can be done to update attitudes in industry, attitudes which cause strikes.  Much can be done to update and bring into line <Col N="394" /> with European trends industrial relations generally, with specific reference to arbitration and conciliation.  If the Minister remains reactionary, or conservative, his Department will be not only superfluous but one which could cause a great deal of industrial strife. It is, therefore, a Department which must be handled by a capable, competent Minister.  If the Minister does not come to terms with the problems facing the country on its accession to the European Economic Community it will be just too bad for the country; it could set back industrial relations by a decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his very comprehensive report.  It is an indication that the Department of Labour is coming of age and will play an ever-increasing major role in the future economic and industrial life of the country.  I endorse the Minister's remarks in regard to the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the International Labour Office.  Every facet of our economy should record the tremendous contribution that organisation has made in advancing the standards of living and the interests of working people throughout the world.  It can be said that Ireland has made a definite contribution to the annual assemblies of the ILO and to its various committees. In the years ahead I hope that worker delegations, employer delegations and Government representatives from this country will play an even greater part in the work of the organisation and I hope that this House will discuss in greater depth the functions of the International Labour Office and the work it is doing.  We have given a good deal to the organisation.  We gave a director-general and two presidents to the annual conference of that organisation, as the Minister has already pointed out. We have made a considerable contribution and I would ask the Minister to convey to the director-general this formal tribute on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, first of all, to deal with industrial training and the work of An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  My first criticism is directed at successive Irish Governments because of the long delay before <Col N="395" /> they were officially convinced there was urgent need for a Department of Labour.  Having established the Department, it was necessary to come to grips slowly, but surely, with the internal workings of the Department.  Because of that delay industrial training has lagged far behind the work done and already in operation in both Northern Ireland and Britain.  Notwithstanding the advance made by An Chomhairle Oiliúna, we are still far behind, so far behind that it must be a matter of serious national disquiet that we are so far behind in industrial training.  I shall elaborate further on this later.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would have hoped that by now the Minister would have been in a position to report to the House that the statutory levy in the case of designated industries was, in fact, in operation.  It now appears we will have to wait some considerable time before the levy system in the four major industries designated will, in fact, be in operation.</P>
    <P>This, therefore, is the second criticism we can make of ourselves and to which I think this House must pay some considerable attention.  Notwithstanding the progress reported by An Chomhairle Oiliúna in the past 12 months, notwithstanding the fact that 16,000 workers in the textile industry are now covered by consultative committees and, in the engineering industry, some 54,000 workers are covered in progress of designation of their industry, notwithstanding the fact that some 32,000 workers in the clothing and footwear sector are involved in consultative designation and, of course, for the construction industry, with 95,000, a consultative committee and a statutory training committee are being set up&mdash;nevertheless, I am afraid we have lagged very far behind.</P>
    <P>I think one can say that, in Northern Ireland, progress has been immeasurably greater.  I think the staff of An Chomhairle Oiliúna are quite conscious of this.  The Minister himself has referred to the situation in other countries but, in regard to Northern Ireland, I think it can be said that we have failed to catch up <Col N="396" /> or indeed even half catch up with the progress made there.  For example, last July the detailed implementation of the industrial training legislation had already fallen, in Northern Ireland, into some nine industrial training boards&mdash;for construction, engineering, catering, clothing and footwear, man-made fibres producing textiles, road transport, food and drink for the distributive industries&mdash; and these boards covered, in Northern Ireland, some 60 per cent of the total working population.</P>
    <P>While we could draw an analogy here and say: &ldquo;Right, some 200,000 Irish workers, or 70 per cent of those in manufacturing industries, have been covered by our boards,&rdquo; I am afraid that the extent to which the Northern Ireland boards have advanced, introduced levies, brought in a wide, massive range of training schemes, indicates that they are most certainly very much ahead.</P>
    <P>If we are to have free trade between these islands&mdash;this applies in terms of free trade between entrepreneurial abilities&mdash;most certainly the industrial expertise of Northern Ireland workers and those in Great Britain is already vastly ahead of ours and is likely to increase in even greater measure unless we make an exceptional effort in the next two or three years to catch up with the position in these islands: I am referring particularly to Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Likewise, for example, in respect of the construction and engineering industry training board in Northern Ireland, in the First four years of the scheme which that board has already put into operation, some 1,700 boys have completed satisfactory apprenticeship training and some 800 are currently in training.  With twice the population here, I think it can be said we have not advanced as quickly and as effectively as we should have here in the past 12 months.  I know that, in the construction sector, there have been considerable improvements in apprenticeship training methods by An Chomhairle Oiliúna but, quite bluntly, they are, in the context of what is done in Northern Ireland or <Col N="397" /> in Great Britain, just peanuts: I think that is the only term one could use.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the Government training centres.  In Northern Ireland, to give one example, there are now some quarter of a million square feet of accommodation compared to 50,000 square feet in 1965.  We have got embryonic services of a training centre nature in Waterford, Shannon, Galway with a capacity of 600 places and with an output from them of probably about 1,200 persons per annum.  In Northern Ireland, they have advanced at a tremendous rate unheard of in the Republic.  In Ballymena they opened a new centre in the autumn of this year.  They have some eight large and medium-sized centres in operation in Northern Ireland&mdash;in Belfast, Lisburn, Craigavon, Omagh, Derry, Newry and Enniskillen&mdash;and these alone will provide some 2,500 training places in Northern Ireland centres and, indeed, it will be possible to turn out some 3,000 trained workers from these training centres.  We talk in the context of three centres in the Republic producing some 1,000 trainees at full belt. Therefore, while I do not want to sound unduly carping or unduly critical, I must point out very strongly that the efforts we have made here, commendable as they are, fall very far behind the efforts in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am equally conscious that efforts have been made here to build up the stock of industrial trainers in Ireland. The training advisers in AnCO, for example, were increased from 23 to 40 in the past 12 months.  I know that valiant efforts are being made to build up competent, trained industrial trainers externally in the manufacturing industries of this country by An Chomhairle Oiliúna but I think the effort is not of the magnitude required by this country.  I make the point because we have got a degree of full employment in Ireland at the moment. Over the past 12 months, we have had an increase of some 11,000 new jobs in Ireland in the general sector.  Of course, we have to deduct from that the decline in employment in agriculture. Nevertheless, there has been a growth of 11,000 jobs.  Unless we can match <Col N="398" /> our industrial training services with the growth in employment in Northern Ireland, I am afraid we could come to a completely imbalanced situation and, as a result, our impetus and growth which has occurred in Ireland in the past five years could substantially be reduced and, indeed, could very much be emasculated in the ten years ahead.</P>
    <P>Just to look at one other aspect in Northern Ireland let us take, for example, the industrial training college on the outskirts of Belfast.  I am conscious that the Minister's staff has had every opportunity of visiting that college but, as they are aware, by mid-1969 over 1,000 instructors were trained at that college in the past four years.  Can we point to any major comparable achievement in the Republic? This is a factor which should concern us.  It is something that should seriously be reviewed by the Government and by the Department internally.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would strongly urge the Minister to review the operations of An Chomhairle Oiliúna in a constructive sense&mdash;in the sense that there are trade union and employer and educational representatives on the board of An Chomhairle which incidentally has one of the finest chairmen I have met on any State-sponsored organisation of the country, Mr. Killeen, a man of considerable competence. It has executive staff of competence. However, the need now, I think, is literally to light a very hot fire under all of us&mdash;the trade union representatives, An Chomhairle, employer representatives and educational representatives&mdash;and tell us that what we have done, satisfactory though it may be, is only half what we should be doing for the future.</P>
    <P>In Britain at the middle of 1969 the national capacity was in the region of 21,000 places for trainee workers. I know that we are talking about two entirely different scales of labour but 10,000 of the capacity of the industrial training centres in Britain are in the development areas and in that setting Ireland could be classified as being a development area.  Tremendous work has been done by the British industrial training boards.  There are some 28 industrial training boards in operation covering the best part of 17 million <Col N="399" /> industrial workers all of whom are involved in levy exercises and so on. We have copied the British experience in industrial training but we are five or six years behind them and yet we are going into a free trade situation. There is, therefore, a great need to implement without delay this essential component of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's intervention in industrial training.  We underestimate the extent of change which has occurred in Irish life.  Ten years ago a Minister for Labour would have been publicly crucified for daring to suggest that the responsibility for industrial training rested with the State as an integral part of development. Down through the years there was a tremendous reaction against any concept of State intervention in industrial training and building up a stock of industrial skills.  This was regarded as being the sole prerogative of employers and that view was defended by many Cabinet Ministers sitting on those benches, not least of all by a man who was progressive and who did fantastic work for the country in the 1930's and the 1940's, Mr. Lemass.  He would never concede the concept of the Industrial Training Act and he was reluctant to concede the Industrial Injuries Act and also very much reluctant to concede the Factories Act of 1955.  Yet, in a short period since then, we have had a change of attitude and a distinct turning about in philosophy in relation to industrial development and now there is provision for a substantial measure of intervention by the Government in this very vital field. The intervention should be even stronger in the national interest, and in the common good, if I may use the favourite catholic term of all socialists.</P>
    <P>Tremendous difficulties are going to face the Department of Labour in regard to manpower forecasting.  I know that there are tentative indications in the Minister's statement that every effort will be made to build up reliable manpower information on a continuing basis and, therefore, he wants to see the development of an effective national director of manpower services. Indeed, a senior officer of that Department has already been appointed to <Col N="400" /> that post.  However, we should be bolder and more experimental.  While there will be howls of rage from politicians who will glance at departmental reports in a superficial way and pick out employment projects from them and use them for their political ends, I still believe that any work done, even on a tentative basis, by the manpower forecasting services should be published. We should not wait until such information becomes two or three years out of date.  I see nothing wrong with the Department constantly circulating to the trade unions, employers and Government Departments, working papers on manpower forecasting projects even if they are on a tentative basis, because this is an experimental field.  Even though the politicians may at times tend to mislead the public on their interpretation of the facts, nevertheless, there is a serious need for a more effective service from the Department. While the Department has our sympathy on this aspect we are in a bit of a vacuum because we have not seen any results and the Department, internally, has not seen any great results, but we all realise the urgent necessity for ensuring that the forecasting becomes as generally effective as possible.</P>
    <P>There is, for example, an urgent need to examine the very considerable changes in the pattern of skills in Ireland.  I am afraid we have become very traditional and this is one of the criticisms I would make of AnCo's report.  There is no detailed account given of the changing pattern of skills in industry.  In the years ahead I hope there will not be this kind of apprenticeship breakdown and this emphasis on apprenticeship which is within the report.  We must come to an important conclusion in regard to one aspect of training and that is in regard to the very narrowly oriented apprenticeship systems which train young people for specific and limited occupations.  This system is entirely out of date in a rapidly changing technological society. The strategy of the Department should be that retraining must be as broadly based as possible in order to meet the continuous need for changing skills. Training must become an integral part of everybody's life, and indeed, the <Col N="401" /> worker may have to be retrained every decade during his working life of 30 or 40 years.  The important point is almost to abolish the idea of retraining. I am opposed to this concept of re-training. We should become so accustomed to retraining in itself that we should not think in terms of training, retraining, more training and then further retraining, but rather should we think in terms of a continuous process of training right down the years.</P>
    <P>As the Department are aware, in Germany, with what I might call the general three-step programme of industrial training, and in the engineering industry in Britain, they have introduced the modular system.  This involves a complete break away from the traditional concept of craft training apprenticeship and provides for a very much broader based training.  The engineering industry here is a major and growing sector and it must form the basis of a great deal of our general expansion.  In Britain in 1964 the engineering industrial training board set up the modular system which allowed for different learning rates for particular workers, depending on their capacity to learn, rather than on arbitrary time scales within which they would have to achieve a given degree of craftsmanship or development.  The modular system of industrial training is one which I would greatly welcome in the engineering sector because it provides something which we badly need here, something by which to span job boundaries in order to build up multi-skilled craftsmen and particularly multi-skilled engineering workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be a valuable innovation if the Department examined with a very critical eye in consultation with the trade unions&mdash;some trade unions may not be very pleased with me for some of my comments here this morning&mdash;the changing pattern of industrial skills in Ireland in the years ahead.  For example, there might be some consultation about developments in Britain.  I may refer back to what is now a rather much maligned report in Britain&mdash;the British national plan produced by George Browne, Secretary of State, in 1965.  That report pointed out that the broad industrial picture <Col N="402" /> showed that the demand in Britain for administrative, technical and clerical staff was likely to grow at twice the rate of forecast employment generally. The demand for highly qualified manpower, scientists, technologists and technicians was expected to increase some four times as fast as the administrative, technical and clerical group as a whole.  The demand for skilled operatives was forecast to grow about half as fast again as the demand for general or manual workers.  The rate of increase of demand would vary for different skills.</P>
    <P>Replies to the inquiries made in 1964-65 in Britain suggested there would be very much increased demands for certain types of qualified engineers, particularly electrical engineers, electronic engineers and those concerned with industrial production problems. That is why I would particularly welcome&mdash;I think the Minister welcomed them&mdash;the attempts, particularly by UCD, to have engineers oriented on an industrial production basis, on a postgraduate basis, and it is something that I think we should all welcome.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out in that report that there would be increasing demand for mathematicians, chemists and physicists, technicians, particularly those trained in particular industries such as heating and ventilation, for work study engineers, for accountants, economists, systems analysts, computer programmers in general, instrument mechanics, electrical and electronic craftsmen.  There might be, I suggest, within the manpower forecasting unit of the Department, a considerable analysis of the likely demand in particular industries for particular occupational groups.  This, on publication, would assist us enormously in the work done to date.</P>
    <P>I conclude my comments on industrial training by making the point that this new Bill and the participation by trade unionists particularly worker representatives in industrial training and industrial training boards has imposed and will impose ever-increasing demands on their time and involvement in the statutory training boards.  I found in my experience as a trade union <Col N="403" /> officer that this tended to be so.  I am rather critical of the trade union movement generally that it does not seem to have appreciated that, increasingly, a large number of their executives, of branch and committee members, of shop stewards, of full time officers will, if they are to make a real contribution to industrial training, be required to spend ten, 15 or 20 per cent of their working time on industrial training in the interests of their members.  The same applies to the employers' side. In many cases I think that not many employers, apart from an interest in industrial training in their own firm or industry, are geared to make the kind of contribution of a representative capacity that I would wish to see them make and which is most urgent in that respect.  With that exhortation to employers and trade unions to ensure that they re-gear their representative abilities on the various committees of An Chomhairle Oiliúna I may pass to other aspects of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>As regards the Management Institute and the provision for financial assistance for that body being transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Labour, I heartily endorse this as an essential rationalisation which will be very useful.  The fact that the Irish Management Institute is this year getting some £90,000 of the taxpayers' money, an increase of 50 per cent on the subvention for the previous year, I have no doubt is an indication of the importance that this House attaches to management training and development.  I welcome this and would point out to private enterprise and to State sponsored bodies that they are getting £90,000 of the taxpayers' money because there is often this snide public impression that somebody that may attend IMI courses is going to a little beehive of private enterprise development not in any way subvented by State funds.  It is useful to emphasise this as something of considerable general importance.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note also that the money for the attendance of managerial, supervisory and trade union personnel <Col N="404" /> at training courses is now being transferred to AnCO from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am beginning to worry about the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Minister, in years ahead, may have a Department that has been rapidly denuded of some of the major functions in that sector.  However, that is outside the scope of this debate.  Likewise, the passing of responsibility from the Department of Labour in respect of CERT, the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training for the Hotel Industry, is a logical move.  I am glad to see this being channelled directly through the Department.  Equally, it will give a greater measure of rationalisation of industrial training and get rid of the proliferation of departmental responsibilities which has been the bane of various organisations through the years.</P>
    <P>It may be, although I am rather loath to suggest it, that a further transfer may be necessary.  There might usefully be transferred also from the Department of Industry and Commerce the subvention relating to the Irish National Productivity Council.  I have no special authority to make this suggestion but I believe the £500,000 which INPC have got from the State through the years could have been more usefully and effectively expended and would certainly have given a far greater cost-benefit analysis return if it was operated from the Department of Labour.  This should be seriously considered by the Minister and the Government.  While he has already a proliferation of bodies developing under his departmental auspices I think the transference of INPC to that sector would do no harm.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the placement services themselves.  I am rather critical again here.  If I may refer the Minister to the statement of his predecessor, Dr. Hillery, in his Estimate speech in 1968 in which he said he had commissioned the Institute of Public Administration to carry out a review of placement services and the report recommended that placement work should be divorced from the benefit-paying function of the employment exchanges, that the task of placing people in jobs should be carried out in <Col N="405" /> separate offices which would also accommodate a new guidance service to be set up under the control of the Department of Labour.  The report also stated that those steps are necessary if the placement and guidance service is to be effective as an important instrument of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation was that the service should be voluntary and competitive without any compunction on employers or workers to use it.  It recommended that persons claiming unemployment benefit should no longer be required to register for employment with the placement service and that that service should not be used to test an unemployed person's willingness to accept work.  The Minister said these matters are at present being discussed with the Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the slowness with which bureaucracy evolves.  I appreciate the little underground power struggle between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour in this matter.  I appreciate the reluctance of any Minister for Social Welfare to have further powers taken from him and handed over to the Department of Labour.  We can place on record in this House that from May, 1968, to October, 1969, while there has been considerable development in the placement service, nevertheless, one can hardly say that the proposals have been implemented with the degree of expedition we certainly would have wanted.</P>
    <P>Again, we have an assurance from the Minister in relation to what the proposals envisage&mdash;separation and so on; separation of offices for manpower work, recruitment of staff from outside the Civil Service and the development of a new regional structure for the new organisation&mdash;but I would suggest that the report of the Institute of Public Administration on placement and guidance services has had a tardy implementation.  I am very conscious of the limitations of availability of staff. I am very conscious of the need to train staff, particularly placement staff brought into the Department</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is again an urgent need to develop national manpower <Col N="406" /> services in the country, and that we are far behind.  Even if we run, we will still be only catching up with the distance already covered particularly in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain with which we are a direct competitive labour market.  No Irish worker will wait for an Irish placement officer to track him down.  He will probably emigrate with his skills even though in many areas he is urgently required for developing sectors of the economy.  This is the criticism I would make of that particular sector.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer is the long-awaited and long overdue registration of employment agencies which charge fees.  I note that the Minister is to register them.  He says that one of the purposes of the Bill will be to bring to notice some activities which have been the subject of complaint. There is no intention of interfering with the work of reputable and long-established agencies which perform a useful function in this field.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there is a danger in mere registration.  There must be some teeth in this legislation.  There is an urgent need for criteria in relation to private employment agencies which charge fees, and these criteria should be developed competently by the Department. I would strongly urge the Minister to consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its affiliated organisations on the draft legislation prior to its introduction.  Indeed, he might consult with other organisations as well, because it is rather like registering builders: you can register them, but what you do with them after registration is another problem.  Therefore, there is need for the Minister to review that part of his speech.</P>
    <P>Another aspect I should like to deal with is the problem of industrial relations outlined directly by the Minister. I think his treatment of it was rather scant.  I can fully appreciate the reluctance of any new Minister to go into a field where angels fear to treat and to make general pronouncements, but I would point out that there have been many sweeping assumptions floating around the Irish scene in the past year and particularly in terms of an analysis <Col N="407" /> of the maintenance dispute.  These assumptions have given rise to a great deal of disquiet.</P>
    <P>Trade union organisation in Ireland is not as widespread as is popularly imagined.  Without trade unions you cannot have industrial relations.  You have industrial autocracy without a trade union movement.  In the Republic there are now some 95 trade unions with 368,000 members.  It is a matter of pride to record in terms of industrial growth, and it is a reflection of industrial growth, that over the past ten years trade union membership has gone up by about 5,000 every year or about one per cent per annum.  It is equally important to note that one of the most significant developments on the trade union scene in the past decade has been the growth of unionisation of the white collar workers particularly in a number of the private manufacturing sectors, the service industries and the State sponsored end of the Irish economy.  This is a matter of considerable importance and something which must be welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>However, it is suggested repeatedly that the present system of industrial relations has many serious deficiencies. It is suggested that, because different amounts of power are enjoyed by one group of workers as against another, this can lead to trade unions and employers themselves exploiting their position at the expense of other sectors of the community.  It is a fact of life in our economy, and a matter of serious concern, that one strike in one industry can inflict very grave damage on the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>This is possible, of course, because modern industry has become tremendously interdependent.  I think it can be said that in some measure our system of collective bargaining has failed to get to grips with these two particular problems and that there has been a failure not so much to reform institutional arrangements but to revise institutional attitudes, and to revise condemned procedural arrangements and outdated procedural arrangements. Because of this I am afraid that the economy could face even greater difficulties in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> We have an obligation in this House to attempt to make that kind of analysis because there are now 750,000 insured workers in the State.  At long last we have a Labour Estimate on which to talk about these things rather than doing it in a sideways fashion under the auspices of the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. We must be rather careful in our analysis of the Labour Court itself.  I detected within the Minister's approach a certain impatience on his part and a certain coming to the end of the honeymoon&mdash;if one could apply that phrase to a 23 year old institution &mdash;with the Labour Court itself.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that, although a higher proportion of Labour Court recommendations are now being rejected by the workers than in previous decades, nevertheless, in the other and even more important sector of Labour Court activity, that of conciliation conferences, the record is generally as good as it has been since 1946.  That is a factor which is not mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a marvellous contribution, but may I ask him a question?  Does he consider that 95 trade unions are too many in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal at length with the question of rationalisation here, but the short answer is that I think it is quite excessive.  On Thursday, 23rd October last, I asked the Minister for Labour the number of conciliation conferences arranged by the Labour Court conciliation service in the first six months of 1969 and the number of such conferences which led to settlements between the parties involved. The Minister stated that conciliation conferences were held in respect of 184 issues during the first six months of 1969, and that these conferences, involving 354 meetings, led to settlement in 141 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise that there are employers who have not the moral courage to face their fellow directors and make an offer in an industrial dispute, and there are some &mdash; I would say a minority&mdash;of union officers who have not the courage to tell <Col N="409" /> their members what they are likely to get at the end of an industrial dispute.  The Labour Court has been bedevilled down through the years with conciliation officers who have been promoted as departmental officers but who with no training did their utmost to become immersed in the tremendous complexities of employer-worker negotiations. Only recently has the court developed its own conciliation service, with conciliation grading for its own staff.  Notwithstanding the internal deficiencies, the system of conciliation, which is the whole basis of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, has continued to work with marked effectiveness and with no great publicity or hullabaloo.  It may well be that the strengthening of the conciliation process of the court could lead to a greater number of settlements in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>At the same time I am conscious that the ratio of rejections of Labour Court recommendations has tended largely to increase over the years.  Unfortunately there is a tendency in recent years for trade unions and employers to expect from the Labour Court results which they themselves should be directly striving to negotiate across the conference table.  It shows an intellectual laziness, an organisational deficiency; it shows a lack of courage on the part of unions and employers to settle their differences at the conference table using, as inevitably they must use, their respective bargaining strength, the unions, on the one hand, having the power to withdraw labour, and the employer, on the other hand, having the power to close down the place of employment and walk off into the night, if he wishes to be obdurate.  There is no better system for bargaining and until such time as this House can devise a better system, we should keep our wisdom to ourselves.  One of the chief difficulties facing the Labour Court is, as the late Mr. Mortished said, that the unions and employers expect the Labour Court to do for them what they should be doing for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is being abused in respect of public settlements.  There seems to be a general assumption that the court should set a headline generally. <Col N="410" /> I do not entirely share that view. Most of us in this House would reject the claim of any Government Minister formally to declare a national minimum wage in absolute terms.  We would not accept that any more than we would accept that a Government Minister should have the right to outline relative differentials between different groups of workers.  I think we would reject that as leading to fascism in industrial affairs.  It is the job of the trade unions and the employers to resolve these issues by collective bargaining around a table.</P>
    <P>I would commend to some of the unions and many of the employers the kind of development which has occurred at Dublin Port in recent years. There has not been a strike in the Dublin docks for the past three and a half years, and somebody should take a look at the reason why.  One of the basic reasons is that there is a port committee.  A large number of the decisions of that port committee go against the trade unions and against the dockers, but those decisions are accepted.  There is an effective committee in Dublin Port which can resolve at local level, at the place of employment, within hours, with independent chairmanship, the issues that arise. There is no need for the dockers of Dublin and their trade union representatives, for the stevedores at Dublin, to go chasing up to Ansley House every time there is a dust-up in regard to conditions of employment in Dublin Port.  This example could be usefully followed in many other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, I would recommend to the Minister decasualisation of dockworkers' employment generally.  This has been done in Britain and on the Continent and is long overdue here.  I am appalled at the general inefficiency and ineffectiveness of stevedoring employment in our ports.  There should be consultation with the employers' organisations, with the various harbour commissioners and with the dock workers on the question of permanent decasualisation.  Some of the ports would be too small to consider that development, but it would be of immeasurable benefit to a large body <Col N="411" /> of workers in the major ports, and a tripartite commission should be set up to consider the question.  As I say, in Britain, there has been a tremendous development in respect of the regularisation of employment in that sector.  I would make that recommendation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Coming back to my original point, I would suggest that collective bargaining offers the best and only opportunity for securing well ordered progress towards a high level of employment.  I know it has many defects.  There are great differences between the formal system of collective bargaining and what actually happens on the job itself. I think there should be greater evolution of collective bargaining at the level of the work place.  We have an economy of some 750,000 insured workers with some 13,000 industrial establishments covered by the factory inspectorate.  There should be more and more bargaining directly at the level of the work place between shop stewards and employers, or their representatives, than at national level.  This is going to impose even greater strain on the trade union movement.  I know from experience how much more satisfactory it is to have national negotiations where we meet Congress and the FUE and hammer out a national agreement. I question the general wisdom of that approach from the point of view of all workers getting a general uplift as well as from the point of view of the 35 to 40 per cent of the workers not in any trade union who would also benefit but my attitude is towards more and more collective bargaining at the level of the work place involving the trade union movement.  This would mean that managements would develop a far better realisation and appreciation of shop floor life.  They would also have the major responsibility of settling their own problems at the place where they should be settled.  This is one of the general recommendations I should like to make to the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards strikes and the general question of industrial disputes, I would refer to one fashionable proposition which has emerged here in recent years, namely, that the Minister should <Col N="412" /> consider the introduction of a conciliation pause within legislation.  On the Chair's direction, I have no intention of discussing the Trade Union Bill, but I would refer to developments advanced in Britain that discretionary reserve power should be given to the Minister to secure a conciliation pause, in which might be termed unofficial or unconstitutional strikes, where serious jeopardy to the national economy arose.  This proposition was put forward by a British Labour Government and in some respects it has been advanced here as a solution to our industrial relations problem.  I would submit to the Minister that it is not likely to lead to any betterment of industrial relations generally.  I do not know of any country in which this discretionary power for a conciliation pause has reduced strikes or has stopped people going on strike as soon as the 28 days period has expired.  It is something not worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The British TUC managed to convince, not just on a political basis in terms of Labour Party liaison with the trade union movement, Mr. Wilson and his Government of the ineffectiveness of that kind of proposition.  If men want to go on strike the 28 day conciliation pause will not stop them as was proved by the New York dustmen when Mayor Lindsay made that proposition.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a general assumption on the part of many people that all industrial strikes in this country are related solely to the basic wage issue. In Britain some 32 per cent of strikes were over money; 29 per cent because of dismissals; six per cent were concerned with recognition and non-unionism, breaking of agreements by employers and the others were complaints arising out of conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we appreciate the cause of industrial strikes.  The Minister should consider setting up a body to have continuous review of a general nature into the causes of disputes and the reasons behind them without having <i>ad hoc</i> investigations by outside individuals. I am not entirely happy with the work of the Labour Court being subjected to a further investigation by <Col N="413" /> yet another individual as soon as the dispute itself has concluded.  There should be a regular system of review of industrial disputes which should be the subject of agreement between the Minister and the trade unions themselves.</P>
    <P>Public relations with regard to industrial disputes have on many occasions been open to question.  There is an hypnotic effect once a television camera is put in front of us but I have seen cases where individuals have not been able to resist saying something when, in fact, they had nothing to say about an industrial dispute thereby causing misinformed impressions in the minds of their own members and creating chaos in the public image.</P>
    <P>The officers of the trade unions, the officers of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the industrial correspondents of our national media should meet regularly on a review basis purely to discuss the multitude of interests affecting unions and their members.  It is only when industrial disputes break out that this contact is developed but if these regular briefings were to take place a great deal of the misinformed comment on industrial disputes could be avoided.  The industrial correspondents of the four daily newspapers, as distinct from the evening newspapers, and the industrial correspondents of RTE are generally of the highest calibre but unless there is regular contact between the unions and the industrial correspondents who very often bring news to the trade union members long before the union officers are able to inform their own members of what is going on, an air of veracity will be given to tentative terms of settlement.  The role of the Minister for Labour on occasions will be made rather impossible; and on occasions one can find truth being given to planted terms of settlement, to assumptions about the settlements relating to industrial disputes which can cause untold havoc in leading to a settlement of industrial disputes.  There is a very definite responsibility, therefore, to avoid the incalculable damage and the dissension which can arise internally in a trade union or, indeed, internally in an employer organisation and to <Col N="414" /> avoid the prolongation of industrial disputes which often occur because of misleading assumptions which have been generally stated in the communications media.</P>
    <P>There should be joint discussions with responsible trade union organisations, such as the National Union of Journalists, who to their credit suggested this kind of liaison long before now, RTE, the ICTU, the industrial correspondents of the newspapers, the newspaper editors themselves, the news editors and the FUE to devise some clearcut code not of conduct but of procedure and understanding or, indeed, liaison or contacts with people in authority to speak on given issues in respect of the many explosive aspects of industrial life.  This is an element which is sadly lacking in the Irish industrial scene.  I would suggest that what should be reported are the facts of an industrial dispute not the supposition and the speculation generally surrounding it.  That is about the only admonition I would make in that field.  I would also urge the trade unions to arrange for their members &mdash; and, indeed, some of the employers could also benefit from this &mdash; regular television training for those who are obliged to go before the cameras in highly emotional industrial dispute situations so that they will have at least the benefit of experience of this form because it is essential that the full-time union officers and the part-time executive members of unions should have the benefit of this aspect of communications in the modern world.  Indeed, one is appalled by some of the spectacles one has to witness on some occasions when this approach develops.</P>
    <P>As regards the lapsed Trade Union Bill referred to by the Minister one can only hope that the discussions between his Department and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will lead to a more acceptable development of trade union law being brought before this House.  Some of the original criticism of that Bill in respect of its bad framing and drafting was quite valid. The extent of consultation at times was rather confused but there is now an opportunity open to the Minister to have a very sharp and severe look at <Col N="415" /> what should, in fact, be incorporated into this legislation.  I appreciate the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle that we cannot discuss prospective legislation in depth as such but I have already referred to the general, unnecessary conciliation matters being incorporated into such legislation.  We are glad to note that the Minister does not regard it as a serious proposition at this point of time in Ireland.  Certainly, there has been in a great deal of public comment here much emphasis on balloting procedure internally in unions.</P>
    <P>I would commend to the Minister, in respect of many of the propositions which he will be faced with during his tenure of office, that he should exercise the greatest circumspection in respect of making provisions by statute for secret balloting procedure in relation to industrial disputes.  In Britain, for example, the general council of the British TUC, who have had vast experience in this field and who have been involved in day and night negotiations in respect of their trade union law, pointed out that the discretionary powers which the British Ministers proposed to take unto themselves to require a union in a dispute, which in the Minister's opinion threatened economic damage, to conduct a secret ballot, were literally inoperable and highly dangerous and could give rise to the most serious damage to industrial relations generally.  I do not believe it is fully appreciated by this House that the vast bulk of decisions by industrial workers to take industrial action arise from secret ballots and that all the general unions and the vast majority of craft unions have clearcut executive provisions whereby no sanction for a wish to go on strike is authorised by those people unless, in fact, a secret ballot has taken place.</P>
    <P>I know there have been some notable exceptions in this regard in recent years but those exceptions can be met by the odium poured on unions, where they failed to carry out that procedure, rather than having formal statutory legislative provision for secret balloting introduced.  The British Government even went another step further, which I note has got a certain imitation in the Irish scene, that there <Col N="416" /> should be an appropriate majority specified in such legislation.  A two-thirds majority was specified in Britain in certain cases.  I would raise very serious practical objections to the concept, therefore, of compulsory ballots written into legislation.  I would point out, for example, that the timing of a ballot in an industrial dispute situation &mdash; Deputy Dowling would agree with me from his experience trade union-wise as, indeed, would Deputy Belton as an employer&mdash; making arrangements for a ballot and the method by which one defines who precisely is entitled to vote in an industrial ballot situation, the extent to which you could find yourself in a body of the High Court on the basis of any employer or any group of members, dissenters or approvers, alleging that irregularities were taking place in respect of the procedures for a ballot, is very important.  All those things would lead to one major outcome.  It would be a positive encouragement to unofficial strikes in any industrial situation.</P>
    <P>I would have the gravest reluctance to say to members: &ldquo;You are hide-bound by so many regulations that if so many of you turn up it will have to be a two-thirds majority and if so many more of you turn up it must be a 50 per cent majority.&rdquo; You finish up making so many statutory legal procedure arrangements with compulsory notification of the result and a lodgment of that result in the unions' book open to legislative scrutiny that you would finish up saying to members: &ldquo;Look we better not go through this exercise as laid down by the Minister; there are many other ways of resolving industrial disputes.&rdquo;  One would be tempted in that direction.  Therefore, as pointed out in Britain, such propositions lead to an encouragement of unofficial action on the part of industrial workers.</P>
    <P>I would point out in addition to the Minister that in relation to this concept &mdash;I would stress, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am not relating it to the Trade Union Bill as such, that I am talking about propositions that have emerged in recent years in this country&mdash;he should again analyse the arguments put forward very coherently with a great <Col N="417" /> deal of compassion, understanding and appreciation of the problems of industrial relations, in the Donovan report itself in respect of the royal commission on trade unions and employer associations.  Having examined the proposals for statutory enforceable procedures, cooling off periods and ballots in respect of strikes and so on, on the proposition that it was the system which by and large could work, that came through clearly and unequivocally. For example, let me quote one section of this report, seeing it has not been referred to in this House.  I quote from paragraph 428:</P>
    <P>There is little justification in the available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirm this. Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action. This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and British Colombia.  Two instances of ballots held in recent years in this country where the vote went against strike action are sometimes quoted in support of the case for compulsory secret ballots.  One was held in connection with an industry-wide wage claim in engineering in 1962, and one in connection with action to secure reinstatement of certain employees dismissed by the Ford Motor Company in 1963.  But these ballots were held on the initiative of the unions concerned. They do not provide reliable evidence of what the outcome would be if ballots were held in quite different circumstances, and under the compulsion of the law.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 429 and 430 continue:</P>
    <P>There are other objections to such ballots.  Once a vote has been taken and has gone in favour of strike action, the resulting stoppage may delay a settlement by restricting the union leaders' freedom of action. Moreover, how is the question on which the vote is to be taken to be framed?  If the vote is, for instance, about whether to accept the <Col N="418" /> employer's latest offer, its result can be stultified if the employer subsequently makes a slightly improved offer.</P>
    <P>We do not recommend that it should be compulsory by law, either generally or in certain defined cases, to hold a ballot of the employees affected upon the question whether strike action should be taken.  We think it preferable that trade union leaders should bear, and be seen to bear, the responsibility of deciding when to call a strike and when to call it off.  Occasions may of course arise when union leaders would themselves wish to hold such a ballot or are required to do so by their rules.  The decision on such a matter should continue to rest with the unions.</P>
    <P>That is the commission's considered attitude&mdash;I have quoted only a brief extract from the Donovan Commission Report&mdash;in respect of non-compulsion on the part of the unions to hold ballots.  This is of considerable importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of trade unions doing this internally, and I shall come to what they should be doing at a later stage.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that, because of experience in Britain and the wealth of literature available on the attempted introduction of a White Paper by the British Labour Government, subsequently withdrawn by Mr. Wilson&mdash;more for reasons of practical expediency and appreciation of industrial relations, I might emphasise, than because he might lose the support of the trade unions&mdash;he should consider the proposition I have advanced even <Col N="419" /> if, as one can legitimately point out, no legislation is sometimes better than the introduction of legislation.  This is something we in Parliament might be very reluctant to accept because in the ordinary development of society we like the prospect of introducing legislation frequently.</P>
      <P>One of the most fashionable propositions put forward by the Hugh Munroes of Irish industrial relations&mdash; I am not sure that the FUE are in favour of it; they are in a state of flux in regard to its legal aspects&mdash;is that industrial agreements as between employers and unions should be enforceable legally.  This is distinct from ballots and cooling-off periods.  There are two main objections to the proposition of putting a legal veneer on the written agreements between employers and workers.</P>
      <P>First of all, it is politically wrong to insist on legal enforcement when the trade union movement itself has the direct obligation and responsibility to keep its own house in order, in terms of the breaking of agreements between employers and workers.  In the second place, the very nature of industrial agreements between employers and union representatives would make for blatant legal sanctions, which would make enforcement of such agreements a farce, a mockery, a purely statutory charade and completely unenforceable.</P>
      <P>Agreements between employers and union representatives by their very nature are so very varied in scope, so wide in their general application and have such a wideranging connotation in terms of employment that it would be immensely difficult for employers and union representatives to sit down and draw up documents in legally applicable form concerning holidays, employment conditions, wage rate differentials, piece-rate systems&mdash;the multiplicity of headings which must come into any such agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, again, is the judgment of the Donovan Commission.  They stated that there was no evidence to support the allegation that the statutory enforcement of trade union-employer <Col N="420" /> agreements would lead to a general betterment in industrial relations. There is the major problem in regard to the enforcement of such agreements. Whereas in civil and criminal law one can bring the full force of statutory officers of the law to bear on civil and criminal procedure, when it comes to industrial relations that type of approach is just not on in any country. Therefore, I think one must reject the concept of compulsory agreements.</P>
    <P>I now come to making what I would call a positive contribution in the remaining minutes I have at my disposal. I wish to make a proposal.  I strongly endorse the view of the Donovan Commission.  There would be in Ireland a much more orderly and effective regulation of industrial relations between union representatives and companies if only they would exercise imagination, be far more energetic and more anxious to enter into written agreements.  There is a dearth of such agreements in this country.  The trade union movement should have the following objectives: they should develop comprehensive, authoritative collective bargaining machinery on a written basis, internally in companies, if necessary department by department, to deal with companies at factory level, to cover various terms of employment. Trade unions and employers should develop together joint procedures on a written basis for the settlement of grievances that arise internally in relation to collective employment agreements.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I should like to point out to the Minister the need for employers to conclude with trade union representatives agreements in relation to the position of shop stewards.  Shop stewards are in a no-man's land, they are in a valley period of industrial relations, and there is an urgent need to clarify the position of union representatives, factory-wise, internally in companies, to make sure these matters are quite clear in operation.  There is the need, on a company basis, to make sure that agreements are reached in written form on redundancy.  There is very often an absence of such agreements.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest there is a need to <Col N="421" /> adopt rules and procedures concerning internal disciplinary procedures in companies, particularly in relation to dismissals. Very often there are not any formal written trade union&mdash;employer agreements on procedure relating to dismissals.  There should, of course, be written procedures in relation to industrial safety but I shall deal with that at a later date.</P>

      <P>The report on the outline of the future hospital system&mdash;the Fitzgerald Report &mdash;recommended that Waterford city be selected as a centre for a general hospital and suggested that it be based on the existing hospital at Ardkeen.  At present, the general hospital services in Waterford are provided in Ardkeen Hospital and in the County and City Infirmary.  There is also a maternity <Col N="422" /> hospital at Airmount.  The first requirement in the further development of the hospital services in Waterford, as recommended in the Fitzgerald Report, is the close association of the services being provided by the existing hospitals. I am pleased to say that the authorities concerned have agreed to undertake joint discussions on the best means of proceeding with reorganisation and development of the hospital services in Waterford.  I would hope that, as a result of these discussions, a phased programme of hospital development will be worked out for the area.</P>

      <P>No, the Deputy must not misunderstand what I said.  The Fitzgerald Report also suggested that general hospital facilities, including a number of specialists, be provided at the Ardkeen Hospital for a larger area.  No decision has yet been taken on that.  We are doing what is absolutely vital in connection with all hospital development in trying to provide integration, better services at lower cost, the sharing of consultancies between hospitals in the same city or even in the same local area and the avoidance of overlapping.  That is the subject of study.  The question as to whether Ardkeen will have a great number of additional beds to serve the whole south eastern area has not yet been decided.</P>

The inauguration of the Health Bill in April of 1971 will not mean that in every case I will be required to make a decision on matters which require large amounts of capital.  It would not be possible to make all the decisions by April, 1971.  Certain decisions have been made, such as the provision of a hospital in Tralee, and on additional beds in various parts of the country, but major decisions will have to await further examination and I have also agreed to see the local authorities in the areas where there are to be major changes before making any decisions. It is unlikely that I will be able to go into the whole position by April, 1971.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will outline clearly the implications for the Irish tourist industry of the introduction of the Boeing 747 on the transatlantic route and the steps which must be taken to gear the industry to meet the new challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of Boeing 747 on the transatlantic route provides an opportunity for securing a substantial increase in the number of tourists from the United States and Canada.  The extent to which the Irish tourist industry will benefit from this opportunity depends on the scale of our marketing activities in North America and the facilities we provide at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> Aerlínte and Bord Fáilte will be intensifying their marketing activities in North America and there will be greater concentration on the development of inclusive holidays suited to the expansion in seating capacity.  These efforts will have to be supported and supplemented by increased participation by hotels and other tourism interests.</P>
    <P>As regards arrangements for the larger aircraft and the handling of increased numbers of passengers at airports, works are already in progress to effect the necessary improvements at Shannon and Dublin.  In the sphere of holiday accommodation, the improvements in the financial incentives which were introduced in 1967 have stimulated investment in the provision of new hotels and the extension of existing hotels and Bord Fáilte have informed me that a momentum has been established which, if maintained, will be sufficient to cope with the anticipated additional demand.</P>
    <P>There will also be a greater need for recreation and entertainment facilities throughout the country.  Bord Fáilte are now engaged for some years in a campaign to stimulate the provision of the necessary facilities.  The board will be continuing their efforts in this field but I would expect that with the growth in the number of visitors and the gradual lengthening of the season, private enterprise will be increasingly attracted into investment in this field and that an adequate range of recreational facilities for visitors will be provided.</P>
    <P>Generally, the advent of the Boeing 747 aircraft will call for greater investment by both the public and the private sectors and increased effort in marketing and promotional activities.</P>

It is relevant to say something in the House beforehand.  The situation is that the response of the private sector to the incentives made available by Bord Fáilte and the Government has run ahead of the funds available.

I understand that the dredging operations being carried out, or likely to be carried out by the Harbour Commissioners, are interfering with mussel stocks and I would ask the Minister, in consultation with his colleague, to take all steps that he can to ensure that the livelihood of the mussel fishermen is not interfered with and that they are compensated.</P>

      <P>The Government expect harbour authorities to be operated as commercial undertakings and to be self-supporting.  Grants for harbour improvement schemes are given only in exceptional circumstances to enable harbours to cater for commercial traffic with particular reference to industrial developments which require improved harbour facilities.  Traffic by pleasure boats does not come within this category but it is open to a harbour authority, which can show that improved facilities for such traffic would lead to increased tourist development, to approach the approprivate Regional Tourism Organisation with a view to seeking assistance from Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that they are not aware of widespread complaints about poor television reception in the Ballyfermot area.  There have been some complaints about lack of proper power for electrical appliances.

This applies throughout the country generally and this year the board will spend £5.1 million on this work.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to Conventions of the International Labour Organisation is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards ILO Recommendations, I might explain that a Recommendation does not create any international obligation but is designed to provide guidance to Governments in formulating their social problems.  There is no formal adoption or ratification as such of Recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Conventions which have not been ratified and which are applicable to Ireland are kept under regular review in my Department.  A full review of these unratified Conventions has been initiated since the Department of Labour was set up.  A number of these unratified Conventions are broadly in line with Irish law in practice, but cannot be ratified because of differences in detail between the requirements of the Convention and the present situation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="445" />
      <Col N="446" /> ILO Conventions not ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Notes: (i)  The Government have decided to ratify in the near future those marked A.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Those marked B have been superseded by later Conventions.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Conventions marked C are not applicable to conditions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Four Conventions, marked D, are no longer open to ratification.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Verolme Cork Dockyard is a limited company incorporated in this country under the Companies Act, 1963.  The company is, therefore, a separate legal entity from its Dutch associates.  The majority of the ordinary shares in the company are, however, held by a Dutch associate company and, when the reorganisation of the Cork company has been completed, Taiscí Stáit will then hold £450,000 in ordinary shares as against £500,000 already held by the Dutch associates. The Articles of Association of Verolme, Cork, provide that of the five directors, three shall be nominees of the Dutch associates and two shall be nominees of Taiscí Stáit.  The Articles also provide that the chairman of the company shall be one of the Taiscí Stáit nominees, and that the board may not act unless both Taiscí Stáit directors are present.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on 30th October, I gave the Deputy details of the extent of debenture loans held by Taiscí Stáit in Verolme Cork Dockyard and of grants made to that company by An Foras Tionscal.  I am advised that the Dutch investment in the Cork company could not be withdrawn without first repaying the Taiscí Stáit loans and also paying all unsecured creditors of the company, which in such event would include An Foras Tionscal in respect of its grants.</P>

Would the Minister not consider that this is rather unjust?</P>

On Thursday last when giving an omnibus reply to questions 107, 108 and 109 I stated that in the previous ten years it was only at the end of the June quarter 1968 that the average enrolment in Mountpelier School warranted the appointment of a third teacher.

      <P>The additional accommodation available in Bridgetown had previously been used for school purposes and was considered adequate for the short period for which it would be required pending the provision of an additional classroom.

      <P>Ullard national school was amalgamated with Skeaghvasteen national school and free transport was provided to the latter school for the children concerned. It is a matter for the parents to send their children to Borris or to Graiguenamanagh as they so wish but transport can be provided only to the central school at Skeaghvasteen.

In relation to Mountpelier where the school has been closed and some of the children are sent to a large school, that is Castleconnell, he objected.  In this case he is asking me to provide transport to Graiguenamanagh for the former Ullard national school children and thereby reduce the number in Skeaghvasteen and leave it a two-teacher school and, therefore, in line for closure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

I do not propose that anybody should be removed from Skeaghvasteen.  I do not see any reason for that.  It is the Minister's suggestion, not mine.  What I am asking the Minister is: were the parents consulted and is it not a fact that the parents would prefer in the main, to send their children to Graiguenamanagh or to Borris but not to Skeaghvasteen?</P>

      <P>The provision of a temporary prefabricated classroom is, however, a necessary interim arrangement to provide for the additional pupils to be accommodated at the school.

This is a scheme we all welcome but on what grounds is this facility being afforded to male students and being withheld from the girls?

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that his Department's requirement that children must have attained the age of 12 before being able to participate in State-aided secondary education together with pupil/teacher ratio requirements, provides an incentive to secondary <Col N="482" /> post-primary schools with non-aided primary sections to promote to the secondary school older and less able children; and whether his Department's inspection system is alert to this danger and is taking steps to prevent pupils being placed at a disadvantage in this way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will consider withdrawing the requirement that secondary pupils must have attained the age of 12 to be eligible for participation in State-aided secondary post-primary education in view of the hardship and frustration caused to clever children by being held back in this way and the expense caused to their parents arising from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take these two questions together. The Rules for Secondary Schools require that, to be a recognised pupil, a pupil must be not less than 12 years of age on 1st January of the school year and must, as a rule, have completed a full course of primary education.</P>
      <P>Thus a pupil, to be recognised, must be eleven years and eight months old, at least, on 1st September of the year of entry to secondary school.  This minimum age is based on educational considerations which are twofold.  It ensures on the one hand that pupils will not be entering secondary education before they have completed their primary education.  It ensures on the other that they will not be completing their secondary education at an age when they would be ineligible for entrance to the university or other institutions or higher education and when they would be under age for the various competitions based on the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he has not in any way answered Question 80?  He said he was answering Questions 80 and 81 together but he has only answered Question 81.  As regards Question 81 the Minister said this ensures that pupils do not enter secondary education before they have completed their <Col N="483" /> primary education.  But this ensures nothing of the kind.  Many pupils complete their primary education before the age of eleven years six months, as it would be in relation to June of the year in question, and they are prevented from continuing.  Is the Minister not aware that the majority of pupils do not go on to higher education and to hold all pupils back in this way because, if they were allowed to go on they might find themselves a little early for university or higher education, is an absurd proposal and one which is damaging to the pupils and an extra cost to their parents.  Does the Minister not agree this is something that should be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is absurd.  The decision to prescribe a minimum age of 12 years on the 1st January was arrived at after consultation with all the primary and post-primary interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether any educational experts were consulted?  One is well aware that the interests would have been consulted and of the implication that some of these interests would wish to hold back the children in the primary schools until a certain age is reached, but that is not necessarily in the interests of the children and their parents and this should be our main concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong of the Deputy to imply&mdash;as he has done&mdash; that the people with educational interests in primary and post-primary schools would decide something in their own interests rather than in the interests of the children.

      <P>The Minister did not answer Question 80 at all, and I should like to raise a question on it. Is the Minister aware that the combination of the age 12 rule and the pupil/teacher ratio requirement creates a situation in which an incentive exists for schools to promote to secondary schools the less able and to hold back the more able pupils who have reached that stage but who have not reached the age of 12 years.  What I want to know is whether the Department's inspection system is alerted to this and whether it has taken steps to prevent pupils beings placed in this disadvantageous way where in the case of the less able children they are being pushed ahead and in the case of the more able children they are being held back. That question was not answered, adverted to or touched on in the Minister's reply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions 82 and 83 together.  The man concerned is a teacher of metalwork who was trained in the Department's course 1966-68. Before entry on that course he signed an agreement that on successful completion of the course he would serve for not less han five years in Vocational Schools.  Teachers of metalwork are in short supply because of the difficulty of recruiting for training courses persons with the required degree of skill and the necessary standard of education. It is essential that when they are trained their services be given where they are most required.  There is no doubt but that the greatest need for these services exists in vocational schools, particularly in connection with apprenticeship training.</P>
      <P>As regards the payment of incremental salary to secondary teachers, the position is that such salary can be paid only to registered teachers.  The conditions for registration are laid down by the Registration Council which is a statutory body and is comprised of representatives of the universities and university colleges; of the various managerial and teaching bodies and of my Department.</P>
      <P>The council has refused to register any teacher unless he has followed a three year training course and had before entry to that course reached leaving certificate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For me to recognise for salary purposes in a secondary school a teacher <Col N="487" /> who is not registered would represent a challenge to a statutory appointed body which I am satisfied would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>I feel in fact that the best way to cater for practical subjects in secondary schools is through co-operation between these schools and vocational schools in the matter of teaching arrangements.  I will be introducing legislation probably in the next session which will enable such co-operation to take place in a formal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the policy his Department are pursuing is directly contrary to that announced by successive Ministers of Education encouraging the study of hand-and-eye subjects in secondary schools?  In this instance the man in question believed what successive Ministers for Education had said and took a post in a secondary school in accordance with their policy of introducing these subjects there.  The position now is that not alone is the schools not being paid the incremental salary but the man has been asked to pay back the cost of his course, £640, because he is doing what successive Ministers for Education have said should be done. Would the Minister agree as a minimum to withdraw the demand for the return of this money?</P>

      <P>This man was very well aware of the fact he signed an agreement that on completion of the course he would serve for not less than five years in a vocational school.  This he did not do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt but that arrangements could be made <Col N="488" /> which would help in this matter.  As I mentioned in my reply, we are having considerable difficulty in getting sufficient people of the necessary standard to take these training courses. We are doing our utmost to provide as many teachers as possible for metalwork but we are having difficulty in getting sufficient suitable people to take the training courses.</P>

When a man does that he is penalised by an attempt to recover £640 from him in loss of salary.  How does the Minister reconcile that with the policy laid down?  Would the Minister now reconsider the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's reply, is he aware that there are certain technicians who, in civilian life would be earning £20 to £30 per week and as reservists are being paid only, approximately, £8 a week?  Is he aware also, or can he confirm, that certain private firms, whose employees have gone into the camp as reservists, are not recouping their employees for the deficit in their pay as a result of becoming members of the Reserve Force and that, in fact, some of those people's jobs have been jeopardised by the fact that they have become reservists?  Is he also aware that many of those reservists are being asked to do mental work which could only be described as very bad for morale?  This is particularly a cause for worry in view of the fact that those men joined up in anticipation of acting as soldiers and not as chars. Is the Minister also aware that the sleeping accommodation being offered to the reservists is very bad indeed and that they are being asked to sleep in cold cement structures and in some cases they have been asked to sleep in aircraft hangars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Due to maintenance and manning considerations, it has not been the practice to have all three corvettes in commission at the same time.  During the present year, one of the corvettes has been in commission at all times and occasionally a second was in use. Only one is in commission at present. This corvette patrolled off the Donegal coast during the period 24th to 27th October, 1969, but found no evidence of foreign trawlers engaged in illegal fishing there.</P>
      <P>A special refit of this corvette was completed early this year at a cost of about £27,000.  It was taken off patrol duties and put into drydock for routine maintenance for four days last month. The other two corvettes were withdrawn from commission during the year for survey.  Pending full consideration of the reports of survey, it is not possible to forecast their future.</P>
      <P>As publicly announced on the 18th December, 1968, the Government have authorised the purchase of two ships for the Naval Service, one a naval ship with a fishery protection potential and the other primarily a fishery protection vessel.  The matter has, in the meantime been actively pursued.  Priority was given to the naval ship, but difficulty has been experienced in locating a type of naval ship, already proven in service, which would conform to the rather special specifications which conditions off our coasts demand.  Inquiries in relation to both types of vessel are proceeding with all possible speed.</P>
      <P>Fishery protection, as well as naval requirements, was taken into consideration before deciding what ships should be got.  The possibility of using small fast boats for fishery protection was fully considered.  Such boats might have a limited use in local areas in favourable weather conditions but would not provide an adequate fishery protection service, which requires the employment of larger vessels of the type it is proposed to purchase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

Will he take steps to see in the near future that we have a force capable of supervising foreign trawlers fishing within a few miles of our coast?</P>

      <P>The establishment of a branch Post Office in Ballyfermot would not be justified.  The full range of postal counter services is available at the two sub-offices in the area, which are adequate to deal with the amount of business normally transacted.  Delay occurs on the day on which children's allowances become payable, but this is unfortunately unavoidable at any office where a large number of people seek payment at the same time. Telegraph facilities are not available at the sub-offices, but telegrams may be sent to the central telegraph office at any time from any public or private telephone in the area.  There is a public telephone kiosk outside each office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In any fairly large residential area the collection of children's allowances creates a problem on the first Tuesday of each month.  All we could do is to appeal to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses to lay on additional staff to try to cope with this rush.  It is rather difficult to do anything more positive about it.  It would be difficult for those people to have part-time employees standing to. It is difficult for them to make some kind of stand-by arrangement for one <Col N="501" /> day each month.

The other adjoining post office at Inchicore has an average of a little more than one per day.  As I see it, this establishes the fact that there is not a need for this particular requirement in that area.</P>

In relation to what the Deputy said about that particular evening <Col N="505" /> which happened to be the evening of the all-Ireland final, I would have thought that there would be an absence of emergency calls at that time because of the national interest in the game.</P>

      <P>It was announced in December, 1968, that the charge for local calls from coinbox and public telephones would be increased from 4d to 6d when the mechanism of coinboxes had been suitably modified to take 6d pieces.  This work is now in progress.  The cost of the modification will be approximately £40,000.  Further adjustment will be necessary to enable telephone coinboxes to take the new decimal coinage after 15th February, 1971, because the new bronze coins which will not be issued before that date will differ in size from the present 6d and 1d coins.  During the period when this adjustment is in hands the present sixpenny and penny coins will still be in circulation and they will continue to be required for coinboxes awaiting adjustment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today I strongly advised against incorporating into legislation and into any legal framework so-called conciliation pauses such as were suggested in the British White Paper.  I have spoken strongly against the concept of statutory secret ballot which has been fashionable in some quarters.  I am against the idea of compulsory legal agreements between employers and workers.  Instead, I want to advocate that there is an urgent need for comprehensive written and voluntary general agreements covering the whole range of conditions of employment between workers and employers and that these agreements, signed on a voluntary basis, would give immeasurable impetus and benefit to the industrial relations climate as a whole. This is my basic argument and I propose to develop it in the next few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party and in the trade union and labour movements generally have been very conscious that the whole structure of industrial relations in these islands has been developed and built over half a century with a minimum of legal sanction. Employers and workers have been free to use their respective strengths in industry as a whole and at national level, to formulate their own particular code of industrial relations and to devise and ensure their own means of observance&mdash;in other words, a voluntary structure.  The Government have traditionally and in my view quite correctly, limited their intervention to assisting the parties and providing facilities, as under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, to ensure that collective bargaining does result and that settlements are brought about in disputes.  In that matter, trade unions have been given understandably and quite rightly, some legal immunity and some privileges directly in the furtherance of trade disputes.  I submit to those who would sweepingly change the legislative framework at this <Col N="512" /> point of time that it should be only with the greatest care and under the most extreme circumstances that one should consider meddling with or changing substantially the immunities and legal priviledges that have been granted down through the years.  I would oppose in particular statutory collective agreements between employers and workers.  I quote from &ldquo;Collective Bargaining: Prescription for Change&rdquo; by Allan Flanders:</P>
    <P>But the case for preserving as much as we can of this aspect of voluntarism does not rest solely on grounds of social expendiency.  It finds its strongest defence in the very character of the human and social problems which industry creates; and the more dynamic and advanced industry becomes the stronger the defence.  The fact&mdash;that industrial activity changes day by day, that technology and markets are constantly in flux, means that it cannot be directed with a sensitive regard for the manifold and diverse interests of those involved by a régime of strict external law and outside regulation. Fixed codes of rights and obligations, rigid notions of justice and equity, are not applicable to industrial relations.  Every modification of a process may produce a redistribution of tasks and rewards and so provide occasion for deciding whether the terms offered are reasonable and fair.  Since we have no objective or socially agreed yard-sticks to settle these questions they are best decided&mdash;within such limits as the public interest may impose&mdash; to the satisfaction of those who are most directly and most intimately affected.  This can only be done by representatives of their own choosing, who know the facts of the case and the feelings of the people for whom they speak.  Such democratic considerations are a substantial part of the case for preferring collective bargaining to State regulation, but they are equally powerfull arguments for our own non-legalistic style of collective bargaining and not for settling industrial disputes in the courts.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, submit to the Minister <Col N="513" /> that there is a danger in a great many of the legislative attitudes in respect of industrial relations developing at the moment in Ireland that we could very easily slip over the brink without perhaps much deliberation or any great intent of reactionary attitudes into a situation where overnight we would have ourselves in the courts surrounded by lawyers, surrounded by legalistic interpretation of trade union-employer agreements.  This could easily eventuate.  I would therefore urge that any change in that regard should be given the greatest of thought for the betterment of the country.</P>
    <P>I noted in the Minister's statement, also, that the intends a continuation of consultations with employers and workers on the proposed legislation to give workers statutory entitlement to a minimum period of notice of termination of employment and also to a right to written particulars of their terms of employment.  I particularly welcome, and I think all trade unions and indeed all progressive employers will welcome, the statutory entitlement to a minimum period of notice of termination of employment.  The frustration, the bitterness and the internal reaction which can develop in employment where insecurity arises because of a possibility of termination of employment is something which perhaps we do not appreciate until we get on in years.  There are many managerial staffs, many management staffs, many supervisory staffs in the country and, indeed, a whole host of general workers, skilled and professional workers in industry, who have only got, when it all boils down, one week's notice or one week's pay in lieu of notice.  Four out of every ten workers in the country are not in a trade union and they have no protection at all. Therefore, I welcome particularly the concept in new legislation to be brought in soon by the Minister, of a minimum period of notice of termination of employment and I presume this will be based on length of service and also of a right to written particulars of their terms of employment.  This is progressive social legislation and it is something which we on this side of the House certainly welcome very emphatically <Col N="514" /> and something which is in many respects long overdue in this country.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister also stated that he would be prepared to have a review undertaken of the law relating to picketing which would cover the issues raised in the Educational Company case.  I note that he still has this attitude in this matter and that if Congress and the employer bodies are prepared to participate in such a review he would be glad to initiate the review.  We welcome that comment from the Minister.  I would bring to his attention the fact that wittingly or unwittingly there has been built up in the trade union mind a certain amount of conflict, almost, in respect of the Educational Company judgment, more particularly in respect of previous correspondence between the trade union movement and the Department of Industry and Commerce from mid-1966 to date.  It would be a useful exercise if the Minister could clear that much out of the air as quickly as possible. Otherwise it could become a rather difficult issue because separate legislation was to have been introduced to deal with the situation that arose following the decision of the Supreme Court in December of 1961 in respect of peaceful picketing in the Educational Company case.  There is nothing to prohibit the Minister from separating that from his attitude in respect of picketing at large and on that basis I feel that the current dispute between the Department and Congress as to who said what on which occasion could be resolved.  That could be cleared first and then the other aspects could be got down to as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would also urge the Minister to consider amending as a matter of urgency the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1961.  Whether it should be incorporated in a new omnibus Conditions of Employment Act or not I am not certain but a straightforward amendment of the 1961 Act certainly could be introduced immediately to provide for, I would suggest, three weeks holidays on a statutory basis.  As the Minister is aware, it is now quite commonplace in Irish industry to have extended annual leave but the 1961 Act has <Col N="515" /> not reflected the tremendous change in extended annual leave in Ireland.  In that regard I would bring to the notice of the Minister that we in Ireland lag very far behind the Continent and presumably if we go into the Common Market we will have in many respects to follow the Continental practices.  I would point out to the Minister that for example, in Belgium adults have from 22 to 28 days between paid and public holidays; in France, an aggregate of 32 days annual leavel; in Germany, between 25 and 37 days annual leave between paid and public holidays; in Italy between 29 and 47 days paid and public holidays; in Luxembourg 28 to 34 days; in the Netherlands 24 to 30 days and generally in Britain as we know between 15 and 21 days.  While we may be rather reluctant to go in excess of what is in operation in Northern Ireland and in Britain I would point out to the Minister that there is a good case for amending the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, and bringing it into line with what, in fact, is in operation in the current setting in Ireland itself.  I feel therefore, that we should bring about this change as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Redundancy Act, Deputy O'Leary previously suggested various amendments to it.  I am glad to note that the redundancy fund is now in a very sound condition and that it has a credit balance of approximately £1 million.  This is a measure of the foresight displayed by a previous Minister and his departmental officers in setting the particular scales but I would bring to the attention of the Minister that the Labour Party did ask for a reduction in the period for qualification for redundancy payment for a dismissed worker from four years to two years. Now that the fund is in a sound condition and now that I am certain that <Col N="516" /> the Minister is working along these lines I would hope to see this amendment brought in as quickly as possible to extend the scope and effect of the Redundancy Payments Act.  I would advocate and strongly support an amendment by the Minister reducing the qualifying period of four years' service to two years for redundancy payment.  Likewise, we did seek to have extended the period of notice of dismissal as is in operation in Northern Ireland.  The Minister might be prepared to indicate if he will now extend the period of notice of dismissal given to workers under the Redundancy Act.  This would be a useful extension of the Act and I have no doubt the Minister could bring it about.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the Redundancy Act there is an extremely good case now for having a provision whereby weekly payments should be made after two weeks instead of, as is the current position, making redundancy payments after the expiration of four weeks unemployment. It is undesirable and anti-social that we should have such legislation and ask a redundant worker to wait for four weeks after he is declared redundant before we pay him. I would like to see that period reduced to two weeks.  These amendments could be brought in and they would be of immense benefit they would be brought in in a period of considerable growth in employment, in an atmosphere in which we are now emerging slowly but surely into a climate and economic situation of full employment. On that basis, I feel that this Act could be substantially improved.</P>

It will be necessary to erect a building to house the new exchange on a site which is now in course of acquisition, to design an automatic installation to meet the needs of the town and of the smaller dependent exchanges served through Ceanannus Mór and to seek tenders and place a contract for the manufacture and installation of the necessary equipment before the work of converting Ceanannus Mór exchange to automatic working can commence. The sub-office exchanges in the Ceanannus Mór Group are Carlanstown, Carnaross, Crossakiel, Moynalty and Mullagh.
