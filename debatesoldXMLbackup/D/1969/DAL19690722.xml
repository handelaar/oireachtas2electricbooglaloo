      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in the light of his replies of 16th July whether, in his view, the question of the partition of Ireland does or does not remain relevant to the question of entry by the Government of Ireland into military commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the partition remains relevant to the question of any possible entry by Ireland into military commitments to the extent that no undertaking or commitment would be considered which would impede the fulfilment of the national will to restore the territorial unity of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has told us on 16th July that our neutrality in the last war was determined by the division of our country, would he not agree that as the division of our country still exists the factor which, according to him, then determined our neutrality still exists and that, therefore, we have as good reason to be neutral now as we had during the last war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Circumstances will have changed, I believe, entirely.  In any event, our neutrality will be determined in relation to current events and I do not think the fact that we were neutral in the last war would in any way impede this Parliament from taking a decision that would make us <Col N="970" /> non-neutral in other circumstances, for example, in the case of obligations under the EEC as they develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy just wants to raise the matter on the Adjournment because he has not time to ask questions, or something.  Why not ask more questions and I will answer him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will consider setting up a Department or a section of a Department devoted to the promotion of the arts in all their aspects in the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been announced that An Chomhairle Ealaíon is to be reorganised.  Under the proposed new arrangements, each of the three main art groups, namely, the visual arts; drama and literature; and music, opera and ballet, will receive special attention with the help of additional State grants.  In those circumstances, I do not consider that the setting up of a new Department or section of a Department as suggested by the Deputy will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this proposal is a logical extension of the attempts of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, to promote the arts in Ireland, and will he not agree that these three instruments for the promotion of his policies will be subject to the responsibility of one Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation has not yet been introduced and it will be open to the Deputy to make suggestions by way of amendment or otherwise in the course of the passage of that legislation.  In the meantime, I should like to remind the Deputy that the head of the Government of the day of which he was a member, when he introduced the original legislation suggested that the original body &mdash; and, therefore, these bodies which will now replace the original body &mdash; should not be trammelled by the strictures of Civil Service procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have given further consideration to bringing the activities of State bodies, including their accounts, before a special committee of the Dáil; and if he will introduce proposals to establish such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of <Col N="972" /> establishing a special committee of the Dáil to review the activities of State sponsored bodies is being kept under consideration by the Government.  As I have stated in reply to previous Parliamentary questions, the problem is a difficult one since a satisfactory solution would have to ensure that, on the one hand, ministerial control was not unduly restricted and, on the other hand, the commercial freedom of State sponsored bodies was protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate whether he might consider introducing this procedure for a trial period in respect of certain selected companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy, the procedure is kept under review.  I propose to give it more active consideration between now and the re-assembly of the Dáil so, if the Deputy will raise the matter again early in the new session, we can deal with it.</P>

      <P>Intern posts at Limerick Regional Hospital are not reserved for graduates of University College, Cork.  This hospital is a teaching hospital of the medical school of University College, Cork and, as is to be expected, a majority of the applicants for the intern posts and of the persons appointed to these posts are graduates of this college.  A number of graduates of other colleges have also obtained intern posts at the hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number and location of <Col N="973" /> hospital and institutional beds for geriatric patients; and what provision will be made over the next ten years to meet the accommodation requirements of the anticipated greatly increased geriatric population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a written statement I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind accommodation for the elderly other than those who are acutely ill, suffering from mental illness, mentally handicapped or otherwise in need of care in a specialised institution.</P>
      <P>The lines of development now being pursued in regard to accommodation for the aged is that, where feasible, there should be three distinct types of accommodation, viz., geriatric assessment units, long-stay hospital units and welfare homes.  The assessment units being intended for investigation and, where necessary short-term care, require the facilities of a general hospital and must, therefore, be located at or near general hospitals.  Elderly patients requiring prolonged hospital care should be accommodated in long-stay units which should, if possible, be associated with a general hospital.  Welfare homes are intended to cater for elderly patients who do not need care in a hospital setting but for whom institutional care is required, usually for social rather than medical reasons.</P>
      <P>The extent of the building programme that might otherwise be necessary to meet the needs of the aged can be significantly reduced through emphasis on sheltered housing in appropriate centres and the continued development of community social services, including day centres.  Requirements in the way of new accommodation must also be affected to a considerable extent through hospital buildings or sections of them becoming available as new acute hospital accommodation is provided in the implementation of plans for a reorganised general hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some further time must necessarily <Col N="974" /> elapse before it will be possible to arrive at any firm conclusions as to the extent of the building programme that must be undertaken.  In the meantime priority is being given to the replacement of county home buildings which are outmoded and which are not part of hospital complexes which provide facilities for other classes of patients, as, for example, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin, and Western Regional Sanatorium, Merlin Park, Galway.  Special emphasis is being placed at this stage on locating the new accommodation in more appropriate centres, e.g. long-stay units are being planned in certain instances as annexes to existing general hospitals where staff and facilities are available, and small welfare homes are being planned in centres other than where such county homes are located.  The extent of the programme may be judged from the number of persons accommodated in these county homes, i.e. about 8,000, and the estimated financial outlay likely to be involved&mdash; in the region of £16 million.  Considerable progress has already been made in carrying through this programme. By the end of the present year it is estimated that about 2,400 places will have been made available while schemes in progress will make a further 400 places available.  Commitments in respect of schemes completed or in progress are in the region of £4.2 million.  It is also expected that eight further schemes involving about 600 places and a gross expenditure in the region of about £1.5 million will be put to tender over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Apart from the county homes programme financial assistance is being provided from central and local funds to voluntary agencies which are providing welfare home accommodation in certain instances for persons referred by health authorities.  It is expected that there will be increased activity in this sector over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The following is a list showing the location of and the latest information available regarding the number of beds and places in health authority institutions and voluntary institutions which cater for the aged and which receive support from health funds.</P>

      <Col N="977" /> A considerable number of aged patients occupy beds in district hospitals for long periods and could be classified as long-stay patients.  The number varies from time to time but it is generally in the region of 900.</P>
    <P>There is also a number of other institutions which cater for the aged. According to available information these would total about 100 and provide accommodation for about 2,400 persons.</P>
    <P>The services required to cater for the needs of the aged are many and varied. These have been reviewed in great detail by an inter-Departmental committee on the care of the aged which has recently completed its work. Accommodation requirements and the various factors which influence such needs are dealt with in this report.  The report will be published as soon as practicable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the decision of the Radio-Telefís Éireann Authority to phase out cigarette advertising on their television programmes.  The process of phasing out such advertisements commenced on 1st April last and should in the manner in which it is being operated have an appreciative effect in lessening the attraction of cigarette smoking for the youth.  I should explain in this regard that the normal RTE television programmes carry no cigarette advertising until after 8 pm in the present year and will carry no such advertisements in the coming year until after 9 pm. In three years from now they will carry no cigarette advertisements at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that the Deputy has particular enthuiasm with regard to this matter but I indicated to him on the occasion of his last question that this is a question partly of Government action and partly of voluntary restraint.  The Government are carrying out propaganda campaigns among young people to discourage them from smoking.  When this matter was debated in the Dáil, a very large majority of the Dáil were not opposed to the Government's attitude towards the general advertising of cigarettes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is Nos. 46/49 St. Stephen's Green and No. 1 Hume Street.  As regards the second part of the question an applicant for planning permission to a planning authority or to me on appeal does not have to prove ownership to me.</P>
      <P>As regards the remainder of the question the payment of compensation is governed by conditions which are set out in Part VI of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  I may say, however, that the question of whether compensation is payable in any particular case is a matter to be determined under the relevant provisions of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such proposals before me.  The determination of the future land-use pattern for the area in question is primarily a matter for the planning authority. Their proposals for land-use, development and conservation in that area are set out in the revised draft development plan for Dublin which is at present on public display.  The plan shows the limits of reclamation as at present envisaged, together with the uses proposed for the reclaimed area and adjoining existing land.  Part of the area is zoned for industrial use, but the planning authority intend that the industrial zone should be separated from the residential area of Sandymount by a wide belt of amenity land which they intend to reserve for use as public open space.  Apart from this area, it is an objective of the draft plan that the entire foreshore of Sandymount Strand should be reserved as an area of high amenity and it is stated that the area will be examined with a view to considering the making of a special amenity area order in respect of it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, it may be something of a hardship to require those frames to be fitted to existing tractors.  The idea is that they should be fitted to all new tractors and, by 1977, that it should be extended to all tractors.  With regard to the question of tractors not used in a public place, I am considering that in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

When the Old Age (Contributory) Pensions Scheme was introduced it was decided that persons in the employments referred to should be excluded from the scope of the scheme.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will introduce legislation to reinstate the provision in the Children's Act, 1957 for inspection of illegitimate children placed without <Col N="1001" /> reward, which was dropped in the Adoption Act, 1964, and to extend it to adopted children.</P>

      <P>As there has been a number of Parliamentary Question of this kind recently, I think there is a danger that adopters and prospective adopters may become worried about the situation.</P>
      <P>In order to dispel any worries such people may have, I would like to say, with all the emphasis at my command, that I would regard legislation on the lines suggested not only as being highly undesirable but as being altogether unthinkable.</P>

The whole principle of legal adoption which is that such children should be put, in so far as the law can put them, in the same position as children born to adopters, would completely be nullified.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason the Government are channelling relief exclusively through the Red Cross, and not contributing to the emergency relief operations of Joint Church Aid&mdash;&mdash; which are at present more effective&mdash; is that the British Government does not approve of the missionary relief activities in Biafra at present?</P>

I believe that technical talks between the Red Cross and the Nigerian authorities on the takeover of relief &mdash; co-ordination by the rehabilitation commission &mdash; were held on 14th July and adjourned for ten days apparently to allow the Red Cross to produce certain documents.  The negotiations are still alive between the Red Cross and the Nigerian authorities.</P>

I spoke to the Foreign Minister of Belgium, Mr. Harmel, Mr. Luns of the Netherlands and Mr. Stewart of Great Britain.  All the time I had two topics.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of a recent directive to bank managers concerning the restriction of credit and facilities to customers; if this directive was issued at the instigation of the Central Bank; and, if so, the circumstances in which it was issued and the full terms of any such directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a general guide-line on credit policy which the Central Bank issued early last month to the Associated Banks.  I assume that this is what the Deputy has in mind.  The guide-line, which was <Col N="1008" /> published in the Press on 5th June, indicated that total additional bank lending in 1969-70 should be of the order of £75 million to £80 million.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank's advice, which was given in accordance with the functions vested in it, rests on its economic forecasts and its views of likely financial trends.  It will be reviewed during the year in the light of changes in the economy.  The bank has asked that particular attention should be given to ensuring that credit be reserved primarily for productive purposes, especially for exports, and should not be available to finance excessive consumer spending.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have the text of the Central Bank's credit advice circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the text:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Credit Policy</i> 1969-70</P>
      <P>The gross amount of additional credit provided by the Associated Banks in 1967-68 (April to April) was £64 million and in 1968-69 the increase was £106 million, much more than was considered appropriate by the Central Bank for that year.  The gross additional credit provided otherwise than by way of Exchequer Bills and Government stocks was £39 million in 1967-68 and £69 million in 1968-69 (April to April in each case).</P>
      <P>The experience of recent years will be analysed in the Central Bank's forthcoming report.  For 1969-70 the aim of credit policy must be to reduce the pressure of inflation and, while sustaining a high level of economic activity, to guard against any major or continuing fall in external reserves.  A lower rate of increase in total bank lending in 1969-70 than actually occurred in the past year &mdash; though higher than that originally advised &mdash; is indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Associated Banks, in the aggregate, would in any event have had to adopt a stricter lending policy than last year owing to the fall in the ratio of their liquid assets to their liabilities resulting from last year's exceptional increase in credit.  The extent of this tightness of liquidity varies from one bank to another and there would be danger of an undue restraint on lending <Col N="1009" /> if arrangements to modify its effect were not made by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>On the basis of present estimates of the increase in bank deposits and in exports, of the net capital inflow and other relevant factors, the Central Bank considers it appropriate that total additional lending by the Associated Banks in 1969/70 should be of the order of £75 to £80 million, of which some £50 million may be required for public capital purposes.  The estimate of the increase in bank deposits is lower than for 1968/69 and allows for the possibility of more direct use of cash resources in the private sector; therefore, the reduction envisaged in net credit creation (lending less deposits) in 1969/70 is less than that in gross credit.</P>
    <P>It is emphasised that the credit expension indicated, which (gross and net) lies between the actual figures for 1967/68 and 1968/69, is intended as a guide-line at the outset of the year and is based on the assumption that increases in money incomes, costs and prices will be less inflationary over the year ahead than 1968/69.  The possibility of fairly rapid change in the economic environment makes it particularly necessary to review credit policy every quarter and the Central Bank intends doing so to see whether an adjustment of the general guide-line is required.</P>
    <P>Specific advice within the general guide-line will be given to the various banks.  Conformity with that advice will, as heretofore, be sought on a voluntary basis but consideration is being given, in consultation with the banks, to the establishment of more definite arrangements regarding liquidity and reserves.  In this and other ways it is intended to develop a context in which credit policy will in future be more effective.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank expects particular attention to be given by the Associated Banks to ensuring that credit is reserved primarily for productive purpose, especially exports, and is not available to finance immoderate consumer spending.</P>

Would he say whether, in the light of those circumstances, if the amount in respect of the private sector is not sufficient, consideration will be given to the needs of the private sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we will do everything we can to minimise the Government's taking up this credit.  At the moment it does seem likely that we will be taking up a fairly considerable proportion of it, but we will do what we can to minimise that proportion and to make as much as possible available for the private sector.</P>

      <P>A drainage scheme for the portion of the Ouvane River below Kealkill was carried out in 1963.  When the scheme was being prepared the inclusion of the area upstream of Kealkill was investigated but it was found that the cost of the drainage works would have been excessive in relation to the benefits they would bring.  It is not proposed now to do any work in this uneconomic area.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is relevant on this Resolution.  The Minister must be aware that, at present, certain sections of agriculture are suffering badly because, apparently, we are importing fruit and selling it to the jam manufacturers with the result that the producers of fruit for jam are finding that they cannot sell any fruit at all.  I know this is widening the debate but I do not know where else I could bring the matter to the notice of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2) (b), line 20, to delete &ldquo;in relation to an individual&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it would be helpful to discuss amendments 1 to 5 together.  These amendments are all designed to improve the wording of section 2. Although the section as originally drafted was quite in order, nevertheless we felt that if we made these small changes in the wording we might make the section much clearer to all concerned. Nothing significant is involved in any of these amendments but I might, perhaps, mention No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to correct something in the original section which might have led us into difficulties.  As Deputies know, the section provides that a claim must be made and, of course, people cannot procure an exemption until they have made the claim and the claim has been successful.  In the section as originally drafted, a person might, make a claim and be rejected.  Ten years later he might produce something of value which would entitle him to an exemption and he would be able to claim all the way back to the time when he made the first claim even though it was rejected. If Deputies will look at the wording now they will see that it says: &ldquo;... the individual concerned makes a claim under clause (I) or (II) of sub-section (2) (a) (ii) in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners make such a determination as is referred to in the said clause (I) or (II), as the case may be.&rdquo;  This simply means that it will <Col N="1027" /> apply only from the time a person makes a successful claim.</P>

      <P>Most of the people who write books are commissioned in advance to do it and do not make a penny later.  The publisher is taking a chance on them.  The bulk of the money that the writer gets often comes 18 months or two years before the book gets into print, before, therefore, anyone is in a position to say whether it is a work of art or not, even if we assume that it is.

      <P>There could be something in the point Deputy Keating made, that if an advance was given 18 months before a book was published, it is possible that, when the book is published and the writer makes his application to the Revenue Commissioners, more than two years would have elapsed.

      <P>As I say, if the writer is the sort of person that the publisher would pay in advance, then he is probably an established creative writer and there is no problem.  Even in the unlikely situation where a publisher would make an advance to a person for his first book, what I visualise would happen is this: immediately after the writer has received the money or before then, he would make his claim to the Revenue Commissioners and that would bring him in.  When the book would be published the Revenue Commissioners would decide on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I can say just a few words in explanation of this amendment.  First, I think it is proper <Col N="1032" /> to commend the Minister and the Minister's intention in section 2.  I want to assure him that we are not endeavouring to create a breach in the Act or in the intention through which a larger number of people could be smuggled, but we are endeavouring to widen the category of people a little. I think it is beyond argument that the theatre is one of the great Irish arts. There are arts in which we are weak and arts in which we are strong, and in the theatre we are magnificently strong.  I am sure it is a source of pride to everyone.  There are very distinguished theatrical people all over the world who would like to work more in Ireland, who would like to spend more time in Ireland and who would like to contribute their great stature to the development of the Irish theatre, but there is at present a taxation barrier against their doing this.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that we are not asking that every performer &mdash; and by performer I mean actor and musician &mdash;be included; I am not asking that all one would have to do would be to produce a union card to qualify.  I am saying it is perfectly possible for the Minister's servants to develop a method of assessing performing artists similar to that proposed for writers or sculptors. I would make this distinction: the Minister has made allowance for writers, for those who write music and for those who paint pictures.  All those arts are, in a sense, private arts.  They are arts created with a piece of stone and a chisel and so on.  All one needs is a sheet of paper and a pen or a brush, a canvas and what have you. Experience all over the world has shown that the arts which are in great danger are the social arts, and they are becoming more and more expensive. By social arts I mean the theatre, opera, ballet, and performances of orchestral works.  A writer or painter out of the necessity of his own soul will always go on creating, whereas the social arts which depend on an audience are in danger of dying.  The most awful thing that could happen in the artistic area is that the Irish theatre would die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unfortunate decision to distinguish between the creativity of someone <Col N="1033" /> who writes a novel and the creativity of an actor who creates a part.  The well-being of the social arts is in greater danger than the well-being of what I am calling the private arts.  If it is the Minister's intention to encourage the flourishing of the arts in Ireland &mdash; I take it that is his intention and a very laudable one &mdash; would it not be wise to make allowance for performers, in other words for re-creators, as well as for those who create in the first instance <i>de novo</i>?  If it is so desirable, then surely the mechanism for assessing artistic merit can be used in the same way for performers as for original works?  Surely we would be carrying out the Minister's intention by contributing in a monetary way to the end that I think all sides of the House will agree is desirable, the flourishing of the arts in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy Keating.  I should also like to congratulate the Minister on his Budget proposal.  It can, I suppose, be accepted as an attempt by the Minister to deal with what he hopes will be the increasing leisure for the masses of the people so that living may become more culturally valuable, as it were, from the aesthetic point of view.  There is a distinction drawn.  Does the Minister believe, as we do, that an actor or an actress can be a creative artist in his or her own right?  This is part of the dilemma with which he finds himself faced from the point of view of what is art and what is rubbish.  However, that is another problem altogether.  There can be two opinions about the Minister's attempt to define a creative artist as a sculptor, writer, painter and so on.  We believe that the actor, actress, violinist, pianist, solo instrumentalist, can equally be described as an artist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As young people, we knew theatre in Dublin; we had the Hilton EdwardsMacLiammoir group, the Longford Group, the Abbey, the Gaiety.  We certainly had a wonderful selection of alternative high-level theatre.  Most of our education in drama was got in these theatres and, in most cases, these theatres ran under great difficulties. Theatre is still a very important component of the education of young people in a developing society.  We, <Col N="1034" /> in our time, had Ibsen, Moliére, Shaw, O'Casey, Chekov and other great world dramatists.  These are denied the young people today largely because the theatre is being drained of talent.  First of all, there is the cost of production and, secondly, there is the powerful magnet of London and New York.  There are too, commercial television and commercial films.  It is becoming more and more difficult for artist actors and actresses to contribute towards maintaining a living theatre here unless there is some financial help given to them.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if he thinks help should be given towards the promotion of living theatre?  Does he think that would be desirable?  He probably does.  Everybody knows that the annual theatre festival has become a sort of senile euphoria of the theatre in decay. There is a very short season and then the theatre disappears from Dublin and from Irish theatrical life.  From that point of view, the creation of a proper social life cannot be fully developed. Promotions tend to fail because people have got out of the habit of going to the theatre as we did when we were young.  A taste for the theatre is a progressive development.  It is a very desirable one.  I believe this proposal would help considerably in promoting good theatre.</P>
    <P>There could be difficulties in drafting proposals to prevent, as Deputy Keating says, the person with the union card coming forward but I believe the Minister has courageously faced the dilemma in his own provisions.  They will be difficult to administer but he has taken on the job and he will do what he can to resolve any difficulties that may arise.  I do not think it would be any more difficult to find a formula through the medium of which he could assess <i>bona fide</i> actors and actresses or professional solo instrumentalists if he really wished to do so. The proposal seems to us a logical progression following on the Minister's own excellent proposals.  I recommend the amendment to the Minister.</P>

These are artists and we must face the fact that youth today supports them.  Should we not consider including these people if the amendment is accepted, or should they be excluded?  Who will decide who is and who is not an artist?  Generally speaking, there is some merit in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand, particularly in the light of the Minister's very progressive step, why those who follow the profession of acting are not included.  My colleagues have mentioned that one of the difficulties which probably influenced the Minister in excluding actors and actresses was the fact that difficulty might be experienced in determining who was a legitimate actor or actress. I do not think that should present any difficulty, particularly from the point of view of union cards.  As far as I am aware &mdash; I speak subject to correction &mdash;Irish Equity have a system whereby one does not acquire full membership unless one reaches a certain recognised status in one's profession.  They are quite rigid in regard to full membership of their association.  The Minister has very rightly seen fit to encourage the arts in Ireland, and as mentioned by Deputy Keating, one of our most flourishing arts and one of which we can be justifiably proud is our legitimate theatre and the standard it has maintained over a long number of years.  Not only may we be proud of its contribution at home but also abroad, where our reputation in this sphere is internationally known and recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the acting profession, particularly for those who are not established, is a very hazardous profession and a very badly paid profession.  Its members are not recognised or appreciated in monetary terms until they have spent a long and difficult apprenticeship.  Anybody who is familiar with the theatre in Ireland knows of the tremendous dedication <Col N="1036" /> shown by young people who choose to go on the stage and that they certainly could not hope to make a fortune. There is in this city at the moment quite a number of young actors and actresses who are trying to survive and who find it very difficult to pay their way.  Frequently they have to go without meals.  When these people are working they are not paid large sums of money.  Some people seem to be under the impression that anyone who goes on the stage can earn anything from £30 to £50 a week.  This may be true in very exceptional circumstances but I doubt if 85 per cent of average artistes earn more than £10 a week on average.  They would consider it in many cases a very fortunate year in which they averaged £10 a week.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully aware of the contributions these people are making to the arts and I do not think he would be inclined to exclude them from this practical recognition of their contribution to the arts.  No one would dispute the fact that actors and actresses who properly interpret a character as created by the author are truly creative artistes.  I do not think that the difficulty mentioned, trying to separate the bad from the good, the legitimate actor from the chancer, would justify the Minister in what, in fact, would mean penalising legitimate or creative artistes.  I would ask him seriously to consider adopting this amendment in order to do justice to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Our prime purpose in tabling these amendments was to draw attention to categories of people which we think should legitimately and consistently be able to benefit from the principles which are enshrined, and which we welcome, in this section.  The suggestions we are making and which we hope will be considered by the Minister are suggestions for him to bear in mind, to try to fit into the framework of this Bill if he thinks there is merit in them.  Our idea is that these provisions should also be governed by the general cannon of recognition of cultural merit which is in the Bill as it stands.  If the Bill without any amendment were to be passed an injustice would exist because <Col N="1037" /> there would be created a gross distinction and discrimination between the writer and composer and performing artistes.</P>
      <P>Everybody connected with the arts will agree that the great performer is himself a creative artiste and his work has artistic and cultural merit and there is no logical grounds on which he could be excluded from the benefit of the principles in this Bill.  Most of us remember the work of the late F.J. McCormack.  Everybody who saw him and who benefited from his work recognised in him a creative and original artist of a very high order indeed. It would be most artificial and regrettable if such a man, or a woman in the same category, should be excluded from the benefit of this notable measure.  We would agree, of course, that there are difficulties in distinguishing between categories of people here, difficulties which would often be invidious, but these also exist in relation to writers and composers.  We hope that the Minister will at least go some way to meeting this suggestion at this time and may possibly meet it more fully in future years.</P>
      <P>I understand that certain proposals are before him from Equity on this matter and I hope that he will give due weight to Equity's representations.  We are concerned here with creating an environment which will be congenial and sympathetic and good from the point of view of the artiste.  We put it that this cannot be created by simply making a concession to one very small but important class, writers and composers. The Minister's objective cannot be attained unless artistes and theatres are considered and unless the performing artistes receive their appropriate recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself compelled, regretfully, to oppose this amendment.  I have to do so for a number of reasons, reasons which are mainly practical considerations.  I must make it absolutely clear that I have no prejudice against those who wear the buskin.  Indeed, I am very happy to number many of our actors and musicians among my friends.  I have an enormous admiration for the work they do and I have an enormous <Col N="1038" /> admiration for their courage in taking on a life in the theatre with all its hazards and ups and downs and its insecurity.</P>
      <P>The fact that I am not including them or bringing them within the provisions of this section does not at all reflect my opinion of them or mean that they are any less worthy or make a lesser contribution to the qualities of living in Ireland than the people who are included.  Many Deputies have already said that this is a difficult area, a difficult undertaking, to try to do something which, as far as I know, has not been attempted anywhere else.  It is wise of us as legislators to proceed cautiously.  The exemption as it is designed at the moment is a reasonably specific one.  We have confined it to the situation where there is an end product, something is produced, whether it is a book, a painting, a piece of sculpture or a musical composition &mdash; a work that can be examined.  Furthermore, Deputies may not have noticed, but this section is confined to people who are self-employed.</P>
      <P>This section applies only to earnings from a person's own individual efforts. The section does not apply to any form of salary or wages.  It applies only to an artist who produces something from which he earns profits or income. There is a clear distinction there between that sort of person and a person who certainly is an artist and certainly creative but who merely performs, merely interprets.  Whatever difficulties the Revenue Commissioners might have in administering the section as it is framed, they would have enormous difficulties in trying to administer a section which purported to bring in performers who simply, as I say, interpret and do not by the nature of their work create an end product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would like Deputies not to be too perturbed about this because I think that we can deal with the situation in another way.  I want to assure the House that I am now going to act very quickly to help the live theatre in Ireland.  I know that I have promised to do this on a number of occasions and that there has been very great delay in giving effect to my <Col N="1039" /> promise, but I hope to do it now and to do it very quickly.  I think that is the right way to approach this matter. What we have got to do is to try to make sure that our actors, actresses and musicians at least earn a livelihood first before we worry too much about whether they pay tax on what they earn.  Indeed, if we were to extend this exemption benefit to actors and actresses, it would not be of any great importance to them.  What they want, as far as I can gather from talking to them and their representatives, is support for the theatre so that there will be more theatre, more jobs, with better employment, and better security in employment for them.  That is the way I intend to approach this matter. Maybe, later on, when we have experience of the working of this we can go a step further but, immediately, what we should do is move positively to give financial assistance to the live theatre.  Of course, I include opera and ballet in that as well.</P>
    <P>One Deputy made the point that great actors or actresses of world renown would come here and perform for us if this exemption were given to them.  I do not think there is any validity in that, for two reasons: first of all, such persons would hardly come and reside here exclusively and this section is confined to persons who reside here and reside here only but, more important than that, no matter what tax exemption we would give an actor or actress, the rewards, the amount they would earn, the amount that could be paid in Ireland, would be so meagre compared with what they could earn in the capitals of the world that this mere exemption from income tax would not tempt them to come here.</P>
    <P>I do want to make the point again that the Deputies would be pushing me over a very slippery precipice if they pressed me to accept this amendment. It is very difficult for me to see where we would stop.  There would be all sorts of other people who would have a reasonable claim if we depart from the position which I have taken up, namely, that there must be a product as it were and the person must be self-employed. <Col N="1040" /> I want to maintain that position, for the moment at any rate, maybe for a year or two.  As I say, I do not think we would be doing any serious injustice to our actors, actresses and musicians because I do not think this really is their problem at the moment, and, until we do bring about a situation here where there is plenty of theatre and plenty of good theatre and plenty of employment in the theatre for these artistes, I do not think we need worry unduly about exempting them from income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can put my case much more strongly than that.  I do not want to rely too much on the argument that this is experimental and that we must wait and see how it works out, although that is a reasonable position for me to take up.  I do not want to rely altogether on that.  I want to make the point, as I have been endeavouring to do, that there is another and, perhaps, a better way of helping the theatre.  Again, I want to assure the House that I will act now very quickly in that direction.</P>

      <P>We would like to welcome &mdash; I think I speak for all of us who tabled these amendments &mdash; two positive elements in what the Minister has said: his promise of a positive encouragement to the live theatre and his promise to reconsider these aspects when it comes to next year.  In view of these positive plans we do not intend to press these amendments which we tabled in order to bring certain factors to his consideration but at the same time we suggest that there may be a danger of looking at these essentially artistic questions from an excessively administrative and even industrial point of view; for example, the Minister spoke of creating an end product and said that the work of an actor like F.J. McCormack does not create an end product.  I suggest that it does create an end product.  The end product of art is a human aesthetic experience and a great actor creates that in the theatre.  I have no doubt about that at all.</P>
      <P>We have some doubts in principle about the distinction made between artists who sell their work for a fee &mdash; artists who are self-employed &mdash; and those who earn salaries or wages and who are to be discriminated against for the moment at any rate.  We do not think that the Civil Service should be encouraged to divide artists into art operatives of grade A or grade B.  We do not believe that that is the spirit of the principle advanced by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is not quite as simple as that.  An artist who goes out and becomes a full-time artist and who relies on his own efforts to make a living is in a very special category.  In the case of an artist who is employed by somebody else I am not sure that it is not the responsibility of the employer to look after that artist fully and to give him a decent salary rather than for me to look after him.  As <Col N="1043" /> Minister for Finance, I certainly should be sympathetic towards an artist who lives by his art and by his own efforts only and who has suffered the ups and downs of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to quarrel with the Minister on that point.  The Minister has met us fairly enough for the moment but there are, in fact, categories of performing artistes who are so to a very great extent in practice even if not always so in theory and in general I would hope that we will have an opportunity of looking at this matter again in the future and that the Minister will think it over and see whether more cannot be done for this very important category of artistes without whom the kind of environment he wishes to have created cannot be created.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his obvious sympathy with this problem, has expressed differences of approach. I should like to emphasise the many differences there are.  It is the promotion of the living theatre which I am nearly more concerned with than I am with the actors.  In so far as we are all subject to taxation, I have doubts about the merits of this whole process of exemption but it is a good approach. It is the preservation of the living theatre which I believe depends on a number of its components which are the management and the people who produce &mdash; people who, themselves, are brilliant, the Edwards and the Sean Kennys and people like that.  There are so many components of the theatre that it is not just a question of the actors and the actresses.  One must <Col N="1044" /> think of all the people who also make up the living theatre.  Therefore, if these proposals were satisfactory we would achieve our objective but the Minister says that the promoters should be able to pay the actors.  I agree completely but it would seem that the Minister will concentrate on the promotion and I do not mind if he feels that this is what he should do but promotion and management in Ireland are a terribly adventurous and financially risky and dangerous enterprise.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister, in relation to the management, consider that this idea of tax remission might be an assistance not only to our own people here but also to theatre managers in Britain who might find that this could become a good outlet for trial runs for theatre productions later to go on in London or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has met my amendment, at least I assume he has from the terms of his amendment.  I raised this matter on Second Stage and it is a matter that has been raised here on a number of previous Finance Bills.  The Bill, as originally drafted this year, confined the relief to the case of a married man whose wife or himself was incapacitated.  Certainly one case has come to my notice where the individual is not married &mdash; in some cases the person might be a widower or for that matter a woman who is obliged to employ assistance because of her incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as I can see, this meets the case.  These are cases of very considerable hardship because the people concerned are obliged to employ help in one form or another in so far as their domestic arrangements are concerned. This assistance would be partly in a nursing capacity and the Minister's amendment meets the terms of the amendment which I have tabled. <Col N="1046" /> It deals with the defects which I mentioned on Second Stage.  I believe this will be a relief to a number of persons and as such I am glad it has been included.</P>

      <P>The Minister has included an amendment for Deputy Cosgrave which improves the section.  This is skating around the problem which has been mentioned in the House on numerous occasions.  It is the question of a family in which a woman stays on in the house after her husband's death, housekeeping for members of the family.  She becomes ill and some female member of the family, usually a daughter, has to look after her.  A son is working in order to keep the family going.  There is no allowance of any kind given to that son.  In what way can this section be stretched to cover that situation?</P>

The son is working with Meath County Council or is a farmer and he is keeping the house while his mother is housekeeping.  The daughter is working away from home. The mother is not 70 years of age but she becomes ill and the daughter must come home to look after her.  There is no tax allowance given for that daughter who is looking after an ailing parent and housekeeping at the same time.  I am not asking the Minister to give an instant decision or solution to the question. I would ask him before this Bill goes to the Seanad if there is any way in which this amendment can be stretched so as to cover cases of this kind.</P>

      <P>When I saw the first draft amendment I had doubts myself. That point struck me.  For the record, perhaps, I might say a word about this. I found recently that we do things here in this House and provide certain exemptions and new allowances and so on but often people do not know about them.  It is well to make clear what we are doing here.  The original section which I drafted applied to a married couple where either the husband or the wife was totally incapacitated, either physically or mentally.  We provided this new allowance for a spouse who employed somebody to look after the incapacitated spouse, whether man or wife.  Deputy Cosgrave drew my attention to the fact that we were overlooking similar types of cases where there <Col N="1048" /> was not a husband or wife involved, but only an individual who was totally incapacitated and that individual had somebody employed to look after him. This amendment brings in such an individual. The original section only applied to a husband or wife, either of whom was totally incapacitated.  Now we are extending the allowance to a single or widowed individual only, either man or woman, who employs someone to look after him.  That person will now get the allowance.</P>

      <P>It does not require omniscience to understand that the same hardship can apply to unmarried and married persons.  There are two points I should like to raise.  The wording is still fairly tight in its application of the concession to those to whom it is now being extended.  It requires that one be &ldquo;totally incapacitated&rdquo; and that that incapacity shall be operative throughout the year.  These are very stringent conditions.  What exactly is meant by &ldquo;totally incapacitiv <Col N="1049" /> tated?&rdquo; Is it a medical phrase or a financial phrase?  Does it mean they cannot look after themselves?  I take it it is not simply that a person is incapable of earning his living but that he cannot look after himself.</P>

      <P>There are times when the precise wording of the Bill by the draftsman is designed to cover contingencies more than the Minister wished to cover.  I want to ask whether we could do without the word &ldquo;totally&rdquo;. Should we apply reliefs in relation to the whole year and not to a part of it? Could we not provide this relief so that it would apply in respect of any part of a year in which a person is incapacitated? It would appear to me that if a person became incapacitated on 7th April as he had not been incapacitated throughout the whole year no benefit would accrue to him until the next financial year.  This seems very harsh. Is there any reason why the relief should not apply for the remainder of that year or that the relief should not apply <i>pro rata</i>?  Do we have to give £100 or nothing?  Why do we have to be so rigid about it?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister look into the question in the future to see whether the administrative problem of splitting them up in certain cases could be got over?  In this particular instance it seems very harsh on somebody who for example &mdash; I gave a very good reason where somebody became incapacitated on the 7th April &mdash; gets no benefit from this until the next financial year.  Does the Minister not agree that this is rather harsh and would he not agree that this is something he could look into to see whether in the reforming of the code he could reform it in that direction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be very hopeful.  If you started splitting those reliefs, then you would in fact take them away from people who have them for the whole year at the moment.  For instance, the marriage allowance is given for the whole financial year even though the person might get married during the year.  I do not think people would appreciate Deputy FitzGerald's suggestion that it should be apportioned over the whole year as is done in Britain.</P>

      <P>I might just say, not to hold up the House but to put it on the record so that people will know where they stand, that this section gives further relief in regard to health expenses.  When we brought this relief in first, as Deputies will recall, it was simply to meet the case where a person had a serious illness during the income tax year.  We confined it to the case where medical expenses were at least £50 or over for any one individual. Of course, that was a reasonable precaution to take when introducing something of that nature but it meant a man could have, say, £40 expenses in connection with three different members of his family and spend a total of £120 in medical expenses in any one year but get no allowance; whereas another family who had one individual member of his family with an illness which cost £60 would get an allowance. Now, we are going a step further and we are saying that, where a person has £50 expense or more in relation to one individual, or £100 for the family as a whole, the allowance can be granted.</P>

      <P>Where an individual, having made a claim in that behalf and having made a return in the prescribed form of his total income, proves that in the year of assessment he defrayed health expenses which were incurred for the provision of health care for qualified persons and which amount in the aggregate to more than £100, but excluding from the computation of that aggregate any such expenses in excess of £500 for any one qualified person, he shall be entitled, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the income on which he is to be charged to income tax, to have a deduction of the amount by which the aggregate of the health expenses so computed exceeds £100 made from his assessable income and such deduction shall be in substitution for and not in addition to a deduction under paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>It is quite clear.  On the face of it, this relief can apply only where he proves the claim not where he shows it is true. It would be quite different if the section said that on showing it he shall be allowed it but that the Revenue Commissioners shall be entitled to require proof.</P>

      <P>No.  The history of this is simple.  It arose out of a recommendation by the Income Tax Commission. They set out to deal with a case where a person had a serious illness and they had some other qualifications in it.  We came along to deal with the situation.  We wanted to exclude ordinary everyday medical expenses and to deal with a serious illness.  We wanted to exclude the simple ordinary running medical expenses, as it were.  The exemption was to be confined to a case where hardship arose to an individual taxpayer because he had a particularly <Col N="1056" /> serious and costly illness.  We accepted the figure of £50 suggested by the Commission on Income Taxation. Considering the price of drugs these days, it does not take much of an illness to run up medical expenses.  If any one individual in the family has an illness costing more than £50 in the year, he is in.  Then we say that if the family as a unit has expenses of £100 or more for the family, they are in also.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me to draw the Minister's attention to a point he raised on Second Stage on 15th instant.  The reference is columns 1519-20 of the Official Report and he spoke as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a similar difficulty in regard to section 11.  My attention has been drawn to a case where a person is in receipt of a tax free allowance of £60 on his PAYE certificate <Col N="1057" /> in respect of his mother-in-law who has no income except a contributory widow's pension and whatever financial support she receives from her son-in-law.  In the financial year 1968-69 the inspector of taxes advised that as an increase had been given with effect from January last and the mother-in-law's income had exceeded the limit of £140 per annum by £18, the allowance was consequently reduced by £18 at the rate of 7/- in the £ per year.  In section 11 of the Bill it is proposed to raise the allowance from the sum of £140 to £196.  Whether that increase will cover the case or not is not clear, but I mention it now so that the matter may be considered between now and Committee Stage. The present contributory widow's pension of £3 5s per week amounts to £169 in a full year, or a sum of £29 over the income limit.  This reduces the tax allowance in this case to a mere £31.  As a result of the increase of 10/- per week which will apply as from January next, this person will have an income of £195, or £55 over the limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sure, but there is one small point I want to bring to his attention. Section 544 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 deals with measures of relief for clergymen.  I quote:</P>
      <P>... and where any such clergyman or minister is in the occupation of a dwelling-house, but pays no rent therefor, he shall for the purpose of the foregoing provision be deemed to pay a rent equal to the annual value of the dwelling-house as assessed to tax under Schedule A.</P>
      <P>That is, if he owned the house and paid no rent he got an allowance of one-eighth. With the abolition of Schedule A the clergyman's relief was not carried over by the special provisions and is completely done away with at page 53 of this in the Fifth Schedule.  Is this not so?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any comment on the price of beer in view of the statement that was made by somebody, whose name I cannot remember, connected with MOVE where he suggested that we might be pricing ourselves out of the tourist market?  I <Col N="1064" /> feel the Minister and his predecessors must take some responsibility for this.</P>
      <P>About four or five years ago when Dr. Ryan was Minister for Finance it was suggested that taxation on spirits, beer and cigarettes had almost reached saturation point, but we still continue increasing the price of all these things. The Minister says this is to pay for social welfare benefits: we believe they could be paid for in other ways.  I believe the Budget proposals have been a contributory factor to the big increase in the past 15 or 16 months.  We have had three Budgets &mdash; April of last year, then in November and in April or May of this year &mdash; in about 13 months and in that period the price of these commodities has been increased considerably, not only by the manufacturers and others but by the Minister himself.  It may be premature to talk now in relation to the next Budget whenever it may be but I think the Minister must admit that, as I have found in the past few months, visitors are complaining about the price of these commodities, non-essential as they may be.  Up to recently the price had been a tourist attraction.  This does not appear to be the case now.</P>

      <P>When this Bill came first before the House I worked out a calculation but since I lost my notes I can only make a guess now.  My recollection is that the price of the ordinary pint has gone up by 6d in the last three Budgets.  My recollection may be wrong but this is a fabulous increase in a period of 12 months, especially when we see such continuous reference to buoyancy of revenue and large Exchequer receipts.  My view may have been a little jaundiced recently but I think the taverns are not as full as they used to be some months ago.  Summertime is by far the best time as everybody knows.  This fine summer weather attracts people to the local public house, the golf club and so on but I think the increase in the price of beer&mdash; I do not know why beer should be selected for such savage treatment in this relatively short period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Corish on what he has said.  When I met the Minister I mentioned to him that over the years the increase in the price of drink had reduced tourism.  I also mentioned that in the big hotels that were being built we did not cater for the type of tourist we had prior to this.  The increased price of drink prevented them coming&mdash; I referred to the workers, miners and <Col N="1067" /> so on from England.  We can see the amount of money that comes in when the Welsh international rugby match is on.  The price of drink has been going up all this time and is now reaching the English price and, as a result, I feel we have lost a lot of tourist business. I do not know if we have to get the Minister's approval to reduce the strength of drink but to my knowledge both beer and whiskey are different here.  In the case of whiskey there is a bigger measure with the same strength and the beer is a stronger drink in this country than in England.</P>

      <P>The Minister is only interrupting my argument.  He is not making any effective point at all. That is the truth of the matter.  If the Minister wants to make a little techfusion <Col N="1069" /> nical point that is all right with me.  The fact is that this further increase in the price of petrol will affect our tourist industry most seriously.  There is no doubt about it.  In my opinion the price of petrol is just ludicrous.  It is extraordinary that it should be so expensive in view of the fact that the yield is going up all the time.  Of course, it is an old tradition in revenue departments that you get your money where you can get it easiest.  That is a wellknown tradition.  I suppose there is something to be said for it from the point of view of those who are trying to collect revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his advisers should think again about the way they are handling this.  Whatever about stopping people drinking, you do not want to bring the economy to a halt altogether by putting up the price of petrol and so reducing the amount of activity in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was making the case that this is very bad because it increases the cost of transport and thereby goes into the cost of most commodities.  In reply, I want to make the simple point that this increase does not apply to public transport which is a very important proportion of the transport in this country.  That is all.</P>

      <P>This is the most damaging tax of the lot.  It will affect us in a great many ways.  Practically all the distribution of food is carried out by means of petrol and, therefore, no matter what the Minister may say, it will affect the cost of living generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached the unenviable stage of having the third highest petrol rate in Europe.  That is pretty good going when you consider that a few years ago we were particularly low on the list and, as such, had a continuing <Col N="1070" /> tourist advantage.  We have lost that now.  This tax will affect the cost of living more than anything else.  It is all very fine for the Minister to say it is not on public transport.  Of course, it is not.  If it were there would be uproar from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is one of those insidious hidden taxes which will do us more harm in the long run than anything else and, in my opinion, the Minister would be well advised to take it off because of the advantages to be gained.  It has already been said, not only in the press and on the radio but in many statements made by people generally, that our tourism this year is not measuring up to the standard to which it was expected to measure up.  I want to put it to the Minister: will he gain anything by this taxation?  I say he will not.  There will be further pressure for an increase in wages as a result of the general rise in the cost of living.  There will also be a further disadvantage to our balance of payments because the concealed, shall we say, advantages which accrue from tourism and so on will not be available to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This poses the question: where is it going to end?  Will the Minister for Finance, whoever he may be &mdash; I assume it will be the present occupant of the office for the next four years anyway&mdash; come in here every year and put an increase on the price of petrol?  If he does, as sure as I am standing here, it will affect us nationally and economically and the cost of living will go up steadily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  The Deputy may recall that recently we brought in a special provision to lighten the burden of estate duty on the widow and children of a deceased person.  Briefly, the provision is that estate duty is abated by £1,000 for the widow and £500 for each child.  It worked in such a way that in some cases the family did not get the full benefit of all the £500 allowances, as it were, and we are trying to provide that the family does; in other words, that none of these £500 allowances in respect of children, or any portion of them, is lost to the family, as it were. Would the Deputy agree with that?</P>

That is something we have to consider very carefully.  We would have to consider whether we could make any concession with regard to the capitalised value of superannuation annuities and whether we could do something for the genuine cases, something which would not be availed of by the shrewd operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter that I have raised on an earlier occasion.  It is quite possible for people nowadays, people who are not well-off, who wish to provide protection for their families through the medium of insurance policies, to end up with an estate the nominal value of which can be very large from the point of view of estate duty.  As I said, I raised this matter before, but nothing has been done about it.  My knowledge of the problem arises from my own personal experience.  I pay an insurance premium of £100 in respect of a particular policy. It is not a very large sum.  There are many people with policies of this kind. The real benefit accrues only if I have the good fortune to die before a certain age.  If I die before reaching that particular age the value of the policy for estate duty purposes will be £45,000. This is arrived at by the rather odd method of adding up all the annual payments and treating them as a capital sum.  This involves an inequity.  As a matter of fact, I discovered that my wife would have to find a sum of £15,000 estate duty because, by virtue of my paying £100 a year premium, I put myself into the second or third highest estate duty bracket.  The thing is absurd.  A widow would have no hope of finding £15,000 and she could not benefit from the policy unless she agreed to commute part of it and that would reduce her annual income to <Col N="1079" /> £600.  In fact, the insurance policy is not a true insurance policy at all.  There is a hidden element which reduces its value.  I think the Minister has some responsibility to see that estate duty does not apply in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Where any person, not later than the 31st August, 1969 satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that he had completed prior to the 8th May, 1969 a contract for the purchase of any land, the instrument giving effect to that contract whenever presented for <Col N="1080" /> stamping, shall be liable for duty at the rate in force prior to the 31st July, 1969 and not at the rate provided by subsection (1) (a) (iii) hereof&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point here is fairly clear.  The Bill is very stringent in the way it applies this new provision and it seems reasonable to provide that the duties should be payable only in the circumstances set out in the amendment. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; a process not itself easy &mdash; that the contracts had been completed prior to the 8th May they should in those circumstances be exempt.  The Minister might reasonably give consideration to this.  There has been considerable concern over this matter which has been raised by many people since the Bill was introduced and it is something that should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have gone far enough in the Bill.  I must confess when I first saw this section drafted I got a bit of a shock because my original idea was to make this provision operative from the day of the Budget. However, wiser counsels, perhaps, prevailed and it was pointed out to me by my advisers that it would be unfair to make it apply immediately after the Budget because there would be transactions in the pipeline which would be unfairly caught.  I decided then to postpone it to the 1st August and to give everyone who had transactions in the pipeline time to finish them up and get them through.  I would not be prepared to go further than that.  Everybody was put on notice in the Budget very fairly that this was on the way and there would be plenty of time for those who had projects in train to get them finished before 1st August.</P>

Considerable problems are being created, great pressures are being put on at the moment and undue haste is being required in the execution of a number of these documents and this may cause difficulty later.  In light of the number of complaints it is <Col N="1081" /> clear that the Minister's expectation that the execution of those documents could be carried out within a period of ten weeks was over optimistic and he should be prepared to alleviate the position.</P>

      <P>There is a problem here which perhaps the Minister has not considered, although I hesitate to suggest that.  A situation can arise that a house fails to qualify for a grant because there is some defect in it. In such a case it seems hard that the owner who has already suffered from having bought a defective house, and thereby is at a disadvantage, should be doubly penalised by losing the estate duty exemption for reasons outside his control.  The Minister's intention is clear: that this exemption should apply to the smaller type of house only rather than to large and luxurious buildings. In seeking to achieve that perhaps the Minister has overlooked the particular case I have mentioned.  It should be possible to devise an amendment to deal with such cases and I am prepared to help the Minister in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. This is a very good way of defining the type of house that should attract the concession.

This is a very good way to devise the section, but <Col N="1083" /> perhaps the Minister has not allowed sufficiently for the fact that there are two reasons why a house does not qualify for a grant.  One is that the design and size of the house leave it outside the grant limit, and the other is that the house may have some defects in construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are caught anyway. The man in the business of developing is caught for income tax, corporation profits tax or surtax of whatever it may be, on his profits. This is a new type of tax, the nearest thing to a capital gains tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular tax is, perhaps, the wrong approach to the problem.  What we are concerned with are the profits made by developers.  I think that is the thing we are trying to catch.  These are caught at the moment, the Minister says.  I know &mdash; by a tax in respect of which they pay at the standard rate of tax.  What we should be doing, it seems to me, is taxing at a higher rate in view of the scale of profits made and the fact that they are exploiting a semi-monopoly situation.  I do not think the right approach is to put a tax on the building, which merely pushes up rents; and they are not going to pay the tax.  This tax will not be carried by the developers. They will simply increase the price of the building as they are operating in a semi-monopoly situation, as is clear from the scale of the profits made at the moment, and the rents go up.  Indeed, the main effect of the section, I am advised, will be to increase the amount that the Government will be paying because such a high proportion of these office blocks are rented by the Government, they will find themselves paying ten per cent extra on their rents.  Moreover, as the system of reviewing rents at the break point, say, seven years after the construction of the building, is to review the rents on the basis, not of the cost of living or something like that, but on the basis of the current construction and completion costs of similar buildings at that time, the Minister will find that when the office blocks which he is at present renting come up for renewal of the lease the increase in the rent he will have to pay will be forced up by virtue of this tax which, because it will affect the current costs of building and of <Col N="1087" /> renting in the years ahead, will, in fact, be the determining factor in the revision of rents.  The Minister, therefore, will find himself as a result of this tax paying higher rents on new buildings he acquires and also suffering a bigger increase in rents when the blocks he now occupies come up for renewal of lease.</P>
      <P>I am all for fixing developers' profits but it seems to me that what the Minister is doing is taxing the Government primarily.  It is they who will have to fork out extra money for this to the people who own these properties. It seems to me that the net effect of this is the opposite to what the Minister intends because he will be paying the developer more than the developer is paying him.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the whole problem here does not arise from our peculiar concept of the income tax code as applies to corporations.  We have accepted for many years past that as applied to individuals the income tax is to be progressive.  We have a surtax system which is cumbersome as a system because it is superimposed on an income tax system but by adding the two together you get a progressive system in which people with higher incomes pay at a higher rate.  In the case of taxation of companies we adhere to the ancient 19th century principle that there must be one standard tax rate for all profits, regardless. This seems to me a very conservative viewpoint, may I put it to the Minister who is found of accusing other people of being conservatives?  I think it is because we have this extremely conservative approach to company taxation that we find ourselves adopting inappropriate expedients of the kind proposed in this section which will, in fact, rebound on the Minister and the net effect of which will be that he will be paying out a lot more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of explaining why he thinks the problem is imaginary. The section in its present form has this defect which I have mentioned.  It has other defects.  First of all, it has this defect, that in trying to tackle the problem of developers' profits the Minister will be taxing firms which in the legitimate pursuit of their business find it necessary to expand their office accommodation.  The Minister will, as I understand it, be applying this stamp duty to a firm which builds offices for itself and where there is no intention of achieving speculative gains through the process of property development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will. Whether it has gone out or not, it will be out after this.  That is not, in fact, the case, as the Minister knows.  Firms frequently do this.  In fact, most industrial firms have their office accommodation near the factory, as part of it, and they build the office accommodation as an integral part of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of Irish industries, in fact, have their offices as part of the factory.  The factory is their property.  It is not, in fact, leased back.  The Minister knows that it is only a minority of sophisticated firms that employ these techniques. The ordinary firm&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we made it £50,000, so that a firm like that can provide its own office accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary firm in building offices attached to its factory will find itself caught by this unless the <Col N="1089" /> office accommodation is so small that it is less than £50,000 worth.  There are very many Irish firms whose office requirements will be beyond that and it seems to me that the section should exempt office accommodation built by a firm for its own use to the extent that it remains in the continuing use and occupation of that firm, the stamp duty to be payable if at any stage that accommodation is disposed of, or any part thereof, by way of sale or lease to any other interest because when that happened the firm would, in fact, be engaging in property development at that point.  I think the Minister should consider an amendment here, should exempt the office accommodation built for a firm's own use.</P>
      <P>There is a further point here which I should like to take up and ask the Minister to consider seriously and that relates to section 4.  The procedure proposed here is one under which, if a contract is in any way varied during process of construction, notification has to be given of the new terms involved.  I should like the Minister to explain how this operates.  If the purchaser of the building decides during the process of construction that he wishes to have a change, for instance, to have a mahogany door instead of a deal one, he must, according to the terms of the Bill, notify the Revenue Commissioners because of the stamp duty required.  Would it not be better to wait until the project is completed and then, if the cost were greater the additional payment could be made and if the cost were less, stamp duty could be refunded?</P>
      <P>Surely this would be more appropriate. The Minister may believe that this could be used in some way to postpone payment of stamp duty but I do not think this would be so.  There are several ways of getting over the problem.  The Minister and his officials have sufficient ingenuity to devise ways and means of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that this particular piece in section 50 is rather difficult in terms of taxation.  I would certainly question the particular paragraph which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at the expiration of ninety days <Col N="1090" /> after the making of a contract of a kind referred to in subsection (1) of this section the instrument containing it is not duly stamped, all the parties to the contract, as well as being liable for the duty unpaid, shall jointly and severally be liable to a penalty equal to twice the said duty, and the penalty shall be recoverable in the same manner as if it were part of the duty.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I would envisage a great deal of difficulty there between the Revenue Commissioners and persons intending to initiate construction or alteration of a building in that regard.  Nowadays with so many blocks in so many areas being used partly for industry and partly for office accommodation, there could be a very great deal of difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners particularly as there has to be a statement of intentions on the part of such persons.</P>
    <P>The suggestion seems rather tangible in so far as it imposes a particular duty on the value of the construction rather than on the income to be derived from the sale of that building.  It is all very well to have a 10 per cent on building costs but if, for example, a person constructs a building of 200,000 square feet in Hume Street and if he then proceeds to sell that building, he will have according to current values, an income of £300,000 on which there will be no taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>This section is designed as much as anything else, to slow down office building.  I am as much concerned with getting away from office block building as I am with raising revenue.  The building industry is strained at the moment and even if I were to make more money available for houses, the industry could not build them at present.  In bringing in this section I was motivated by a desire to try to inhibit people from office block development to some extent.  However, there is a lot of substandard office accommodation and there is great need for new office accommodation but, at the same time, it seems to me from the number of applications for planning permission that are submitted to Dublin Corporation and to the Minister for Local Government that too much of our scarce building resources are being devoted to office block development. This section, therefore, is to some extent directed towards a slowing down of the rush to build these huge office blocks.  I am reasonably satisfied with this section.  I think it will achieve its purpose.  There are fairly adequate anti-evasion provisions in the section as it stands.  The type of buildings which we are after is a major financial undertaking.  These things do not go ahead unless there are pretty big financial institutions involved in them. I do not contemplate the large-scale financial institutions who would be engaging in this type of activity and putting up the money for these buildings having anything to do with shady practices or evasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not invent the economic system.  It is not an economic system which is personal to me. This whole field of taxation, and where the real burden of taxation falls, is one for experts.  I would not attempt to be a pundit about it.  The Deputy reminds me of a point made by Deputy Desmond.  People who are developing and building office blocks and engaging in property development are taxed on their profits.  They are engaged in the business of property development.  All their activities as such are taxed.  They have income tax and corporation profits tax if they are a company, and income tax and surtax if they are individuals. They do not put the money in their own pockets and go free.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald mentioned corporation tax as distinct from corporation profits tax, of separating personal income tax from taxation of companies.  This is a matter which we have actively under consideration at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They can get a capital profit tax out of the developers.  The developers can make money by avoiding this tax, first of all, by only doing 50 per cent or, perhaps, 30 per cent of the work.  There is no doubt about that.  It is being done at the moment. The £1 million or £2 million finance which these companies get is not given to a company.  It is given to a person in that company on his ability.  There is nothing to prevent that company, if <Col N="1093" /> they were making £300,000 and the building is worth £1½ million capitalised, and worth £3 million in ten years, from selling their shares to an insurance company and they would not be taxed on it.  Does the Minister mean to tell me that a person from London who was never in Ireland before is not going to do this?  He can get the money in England because they have known him working there and can come in here and set up a company.  He will get money because they know in England that he is a good operator.  He can sell the shares to an insurance company and get a good return and go off with £3 million in his pocket, not taxable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is purporting to be naïve in speaking as if there was no avoidance or evasion of taxation on profits.  I should like to go back to Deputy Dr. Browne's point. While the Deputy exaggerates his point, it has merit.  Some taxes have the effect of being put on to the consumer more readily than others.  In Dublin at the present time, we have the value of buildings, their capital value when built and the prices at which they can be sold to an insurance company, which are determined by the market situation as regards building of office accommodation in Dublin and the people have suddenly become alert to the desirability of new office accommodation, there is a demand for office accommodation which far exceeds the amount of modern office accommodation available. rents.  Owing to the fact that there have been many decades of a backlog in the There is a monopoly-value attaching to the modern office blocks which far exceeds their cost.  We have the rentals of the blocks which are fixed by the demand and supply situation.  The monopoly situation involves rents being fixed at very much above the cost of construction.  We have the cost of construction which is determined by the constructional costs and the price at which land can be bought.  One does not need to know much about property development to know that the profit margin available to developers <Col N="1094" /> at the moment is, perhaps, of the order of 50 per cent on their cost.  They can buy land, build a building and make arrangements to rent it, and then sell those rentals at a price which exceeds by 50 per cent the amount they have paid out in respect of the entire transaction up to that point.  That is a fairly normal ratio.</P>
      <P>Some developers may do better than others.  There is no relationship between the cost to them, fixed by the building costs and the cost of land, and the rentals and capital value of the property when developed.  There ought to be some relationship under our economic system.  If free enterprise is given free rein long enough and if nobody does anything to prevent office blocks being built at some point in the 1970s or the 1980s supply and demand will come into balance and the monopoly values will disappear.  We are faced with a monopoly situation for a short time in which monopoly profits are being made.  In that situation if we, in fact, taxed more heavily than at 10s in the £ the profits of property developers we should not push up, possibly at all but certainly perceptibly, the rentals of office accommodation, or the value of office accommodation for sale, because of the fact that those rentals are determined by the supply and demand situation and not by the cost. I am not suggesting there is no relationship between the two, but it is a weak relationship at the present time.</P>
      <P>If a tax at a little over 10s in the £ were imposed on developers' profits it would secure additional revenue to the Exchequer.  It would be a very desirable kind of tax.  It would not push up office rentals significantly.  The Minister would find himself not having to pay higher rents now, or on renewal of existing leases.  The point Deputy Dr. Browne made gives a basis for suggesting that we are imposing the wrong kind of tax here.  The Minister took it that I was suggesting having a corporation tax system instead of the existing system based on personal income tax.  That may be technically necessary but I am not convinced of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there is nothing to prevent us, in a Finance Act, saying that the rate of income tax chargeable <Col N="1095" /> on a particular kind of profit, or the rate of corporation tax payable, shall be at a higher level on a certain kind of profit than on others.  I do not see why it is technically impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to operate this system on, say, a 35 per cent or 40 per cent corporation profits tax on profits on property development.  If such a tax were imposed it would not significantly affect the cost of accommodation for rental.  Therefore, I would commend to the Minister, when he gets around to changing the whole tax system, to consider something of that kind.  It would be better than what is here and might be introduced in substitution for the proposals here.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back, however, to the points the Minister has not dealt with.  I think I am right that this Bill in its present form, that is subsection (4) of section 50, imposes an obligation to notify every change in the contract, every change when a building is being built involving additions to the building costs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In section 3 (1) to add the words &ldquo;or such proportion thereof as may be appropriate to the proportion of the year of assessment during which the incapacity existed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment arises out of a discussion <Col N="1100" /> on the Committee Stage.  It arises, really, from the Minister's intervention with regard to the question of the married allowance.  He very helpfully pointed out that there is no reason why this particular problem cannot be got over, that is, the problem of the application of a benefit of this kind during the year in question.  In the case of the married allowance he says it applies for the whole of the year, retrospectively. I am suggesting here something less extreme though I am prepared to go to that extreme if the Minister wants to, and apply it to the whole of the year.  It seems to me that there is no reason why the allowance should not be proportionate to the proportion of the year during which the incapacity exists.  What are the precise technical problems which would impede this amendment from being implemented? I can quite see that the income tax code is complex and cumbersome. I can quite see that the introduction of certain changes during the year gives rise to difficulties.  At the moment.  I am not convinced, in relation to this particular matter, that any impossible problem exists.  I should like the Minister to explain to me on this amendment precisely why he would have difficulty with it or preferably I should like him to accept the amendment if he finds it possible to do so.  It is something on which we could have a brief discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have much to add to what I said on the Committee Stage.  It is a well-settled principle of all these personal allowances that they are for the year as a whole.  I foresee enormous administrative difficulties, out of all proportion to the benefit we would be giving to particular taxpayers, if we introduced this kind of thing into the granting of personal allowances.  If we grant it here I think we should have to grant it for all the others.  This is a new thing.  It is a new concession to taxpayers to meet a particular difficulty. We want to stick strictly to the principle of total incapacity.  If we do not, we go into great difficulties in deciding who should get the exemption and who should not.  I think we must be very rigid on this matter of total incapacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  It is a point the Deputy made before.  It is a new provision in easement of the lot of a certain type of taxpayer who has a particular problem.  I think that, in the normal circumstances, such a person must be totally incapacitated the whole year.  I do not need to point out to the Deputy that there are a lot of days in the year &mdash; 365 &mdash; and his amendment would mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes 366 days. His amendment would mean that you would have to be prepared to apportion these allowances out over any number of that number of days.  I think it would be enormously expensive for us to do it.  I have not had time to discuss with the Revenue Commissioners as to how cumbersome and difficult it would be but I imagine it would be very formidable.  But this other principle of having the allowance for the whole year is so long-established now that there must have been a very good basis for it.  It has never been challenged before.  I really believe it would be, administratively, terribly difficult and expensive for us to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me for saying that his defence seemed a bit weak.  Perhaps he has not had time to prepare it and therefore it is understandable.  I am always unhappy when I am told there are insuperable administrative difficulties about doing something.  When that defence is put up, I think one is entitled to ask what these administrative difficulties are.  In this House, we all too easily fall into the trap of accepting this argument without exploring it. If we had a more adequate committee system in this House we should have more opportunities of exploring this excuse that is put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are there insuperable difficulties? The Minister has really fallen back fundamentally on the defence that it has always been done this way and we cannot change it now.  I am inclined to accept that it would be difficult for him at this moment, in the middle of <Col N="1102" /> this debate, to accept changes of this kind but I want to use this opportunity to suggest to him that this whole question should be re-examined.  The income tax code is extraordinarily antiquated in its present form.  While many things have been done to improve it, and some things done to disimprove it from the taxpayer's point of view, the whole concept of it is still very much out of date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is trying to do things like this to help particular taxpayers who are in difficult circumstances that contributes to making it complicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was complicated.  I said it was antiquated. The Minister misheard me.  Of course, it is complicated.  It will always be complicated.  My concern is that it is a system which has been built on certain out-of-date principles.  We have now introduced PAYE and we have introduced computers but we have not begun to draw the logical conclusions from the existence of a PAYE system and the existence of computers.  The logical conclusion of that is that this whole concept of the calendar year being taken as a whole should go by the board.  I would accept that it will take the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners a little time to work out the full implications of this but I would urge on him to forget the past completely and to sit down and think out a new code of income taxation based on the realities of the present day.</P>

      <P>Earlier today the Minister showed signs of irritation which made me doubt that.  I am glad that they were ephemeral.  I would urge on him to rethink the whole system and to think it out from <Col N="1103" /> scratch, not to keep adding this and changing this but to go back to first principles and say: &ldquo;Here we are now. We have a PAYE system.  We have a computer available for the purpose. How should we now arrange to redistribute income drawing it from some and giving it back to others?&rdquo; I feel that what is involved here is a fundamental reappraisal of the system.  I urge on him, therefore, in withdrawing this amendment, to undertake such a reappraisal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In section 50, subsection (7) to add a new clause:</P>
      <P>(d) in relation to the construction, alteration or enlargement of a building or part of a building to be occupied by the person making the contract and the employees of that person provided that if at any subsequent date the building or any part thereof is transferred to the use of other persons the duty shall be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this is to deal with the point I raised in the debate that this tax should not fall on people who are building office accommodation for their own use.  The purpose of this amendment is to show how it would be possible without insuperable administrative difficulties in this instance to get over that problem.  It seems to me that where a building is built by a person &mdash; I am using the terminology of the Bill, a person standing, of course, for a company as well as for an individual person &mdash; where a person or company build office accommodation for their own use to the extent that it is for their own use and remains in their own use and is not diverted to any other use the stamp <Col N="1104" /> duty should not be payable.  If at some stage they dispose of it in any way or permit other people to use it whether on terms of sale or lease or any other terms, for whatever consideration or without consideration, if they cease to occupy it, then at the point at which they cease to be in exclusive occupation of the building or part of the building the stamp duty in respect of that building or part of the building would become payable.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly simple and straightforward way of getting over the problem and I should like the Minister to consider whether, in fact, he really wants to catch firms building office accommodation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the business world goes in fads. Suddenly everyone wants new office blocks and I feel that even in the case of people who are building for themselves it is not a bad idea to put some inhibition on them just to keep them within reason.  I think it is temporary madness.  Everybody now suddenly wants nice, shiny, new office blocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is that he was not, in fact, aiming this particularly at speculators, something I had suspected, because of the ineffectiveness of this tax in catching up profits and it is, in fact, designed primarily to discourage office building.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I hoped to get out of this was enough to pay for my concessions in regard to stamp duty on houses.  Ten per cent is a fair amount of tax and I wanted to get some of these profits which the Deputy agrees are, because of the situation, <Col N="1105" /> inordinate at present.  At the same time, I wanted to inhibit to some extent the building of office blocks <i>per se.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking the Minister, perhaps, more literally when he said that these were his two objectives and I was assuming that he attached importance to the question of profits.  It is clear to me now, the more I look at this, that it will not have any effect on speculative profits.  I accept that it will have some effect on inhibiting the building of office accommodation but the principal impact of that is on the Government.  There is something paradoxical about a Government who are imposing a tax to discourage the building of office blocks and are themselves one of the principal renters and, indeed, arguably the principal renter, perhaps, even the renter of the majority of office accommodation. If the Government are serious about discouraging the building of office blocks they should stop renting a large part, if not most of the new accommodation. That would be far more effective than taxing it and putting up costs for industry and for business generally.  The Government have a responsibility in this and I hope the Minister, in another aspect of his corporate capacity, will be as serious about this matter of discouraging office building as he purports to be here.</P>
      <P>In so far as this is the purpose of this Bill rather than taxing speculative builders I accept that the exemption of offices built by people for their own use would reduce the value of the measure and to that extent I withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> This is the manner in which the revenue was raised.  Apart altogether from the printing of money which goes on in all western countries nowadays, as much here as anywhere else, I reckon that this Bill this year is somewhere in the region of £350 million. What interests me about the economy in the last six months is the number of people with no connection with financial or economic matters who talk about inflation.  I hear continuous reference to an increase in prices.  If I search out where this arises it arises primarily from Government expenditure. I made a rough estimate some few months ago and I found that Government expenditure has been going up at the rate of 16? per cent a year for the last three or four years.  We are told that the value of money has been going down at the rate of about five per cent and, of course, these two put together by economists give us a lovely growth figure, a growth figure of four or five per cent.  Of course, the whole thing is a fraud and a fake of the very lowest sort.</P>

      <P>Very good.  What is in the Bill is a great deal of amending of the law relating to many forms of raising of revenue which involves a great deal of work for a great many people outside Government circles.  I cannot understand why each year the Finance Bill must be about 60 pages in extent.  One of the amendments down today was purely a verbal one which could have been taken without having been put on the Order Paper. I think this Bill will be shown before the end of the year to be inadequate for the purpose for which it was introduced and that, in fact, there will be a mini-Budget or, alternatively, we shall have the cry that such has been the balance of payments difficulty that the unfortunate lowest-paid workers cannot get their status increase.  The Minister's colleagues have begun that already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give some elucidation as to the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;as duly calculated&rdquo; in column 1 of the Table, particularly in relation to savings of old people.  We think it very unfair that at this time, when funeral expenses for even a modest funeral are not less than £75 and can frequently be £100 or £125, an old age pensioner should have only the first £25 of savings excluded in the assessment of means. After that, a notional 5 per cent is charged on the next £375 which an old pensioner may have saved.  The reality of the situation is that most old age pensioners have their savings institumodestly remunerative saving institution such as the Post Office Savings Bank where the interest rate is only 3½ per cent.  To be notionally charging these people with receiving an income of 5 per cent on savings above £25 is causing very real hardship, particularly when most such people are not spending any part of their earnings from interest, small as it is.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some promise of alleviation in regard to old people's savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill as submitted again places a premium on improvidence.  It confers benefit on the spendthrift and gives advantage to the non-saver, to those who have not saved, and it deprives of <Col N="1109" /> benefit those who have saved a little. One of the greatest fears of elderly people is fear of a pauper's grave, fear of some real want in the closing days of their lives and to continue to assess their savings with a notional income of 5 per cent after £25 is very wrong. I doubt if it would cost the State much to give relief from all assessment of savings of £100 or under.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also give some information for the benefit of some Deputies, including the former Deputy Booth who, on Second Stage, asked for some guidance as to the manner of assessing means from land and cottages occupied by elderly people?  I think that the Department have some rule of thumb which applies to land.  If land can be established as having an actual income, that income is taken as being the income which an elderly person receives but where land in some cases is not actually let, some notional value is put on the land and this appears to cause hardship in a number of cases.  These are the areas where great benefits could be conferred on people.  I hope the Minister will see his way to doing this as I do not think it would cost a great deal.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I express the hope that as these increases are being given to old age pensioners and under other sections to other people, the increases will not be taken into account by local authorities in calculating home assistance and disablement payments?  I know that the practice has been for the Minister to send circulars to local authorities encouraging them not to take social welfare benefits into account for the purpose of reducing home assistance and disability payments.  We are sorry that the Minister has not made it mandatory on local authorities to ignore such increases.  I do not think there are many cases in which executives of local authorities deliberately reduce home assistance payments as a result of pension or social welfare increases but there are cases on record, I think, where such payments have not been increased where they might have been increased because, apparently, under the social welfare code other benefits have increased.  The tendency in some areas has been in the wrong <Col N="1110" /> direction and we hope the Minister will take the opportunity on this occasion again to remind local authorities that the State having assessed the need for substantially increased social welfare payments, these should not be taken into account to reduce the burden on local authorities.  I am very much in favour of local authorities having their burden of welfare payments reduced but it should not be done simply because these are increased.  It should be done by the State taking over total responsibility but of course that, Sir, is another matter entirely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Ryan that there may be a case for examining the amount that is ignored in the assessment of capital as means, in view of the increased expense of funerals and so on.  I think he is correct in saying that it was originally intended to cover those expenses.  I will certainly examine the feasibility of increasing the amount that is ignored.  I think it should be due for review now in any case.</P>
      <P>In regard to the method of assessing the income from remaining capital&mdash; 5 per cent on the first £375 and 10 per cent on the rest&mdash;it is a fact that the return from an annuity purchased with a certain amount of money by a person over 70 years of age would be more than that, and that it is, in fact, possible for a person of this age, with this amount of capital, to obtain from that capital a higher income than is assessed under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the assessment of means from land, this is done for these purposes on a factual basis.  An assessment is made of the actual net income from the land and that is the income that is assessed.  It is not correct, as Deputy Bruton thought, that a rule of thumb is applied and that it is assessed on a notional basis, on the valuation. That applies only to the unemployment assistance scheme where the assessment is on the basis of £20 per £1 valuation, irrespective of the actual income that is obtained from the land. So far as old age pensions and widows' pensions are concerned, the assessment <Col N="1111" /> is on the basis of the actual net income obtained either from the letting or the working of the land.  In many cases this is more favourable than the notional system would be.</P>
    <P>I think by now it is fairly well established that local authorities do not take account of increases given in social assistance payments in the assessment of home assistance or disabled person's maintenance allowance.  If any Deputy comes across any case in which that is done, I will be prepared to take it up with the local authority concerned.  I do not think there have been any complaints about this for a great number of years.  It does not appear to me to be necessary to do anything formal about it.  Generally the local authorities are reasonable in this matter and do not take these increases into account.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the means assessment.  When an old age pensioner has money and transfers it to a member of his family, it is not unusual for some social welfare officers not to accept that transfer as genuine.  In discussing other matters in this House, we always underline the advisability of aged people transferring means to younger members of their family so as to give them an opportunity to improve their position in life by giving them capital which might be used advantageously in the development of any business they may own.  I cannot see, for the life of me, why it should be, as it so often is, that a transfer of money&mdash;in many cases by an incapacitated old age pensioner or a person of over 80 years&mdash;is not accepted by the Department of Social Welfare.  In this measure we should do away with that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot treat all these people as dishonest and suggest that they are doing something to circumvent State regulations to be entitled to a pension. My views are very definite on this. Unfortunately, I have come across a number of cases from time to time of old age pensioners with £1,000, £1,500 or £2,000&mdash;or whatever sum people in that group may have&mdash;who transferred that money to a member of their families and the transfer was not accepted. <Col N="1112" /> That should not be questioned.  This assumption that so many of our old people are dishonest is completely incorrect.  I could cite individual cases.</P>
    <P>The determination by the appeals board is scandalous in many cases when they do not uphold the right of a pensioer to transfer any capital which he might like to a member of his family.  I am asking the Minister and the House to support that viewpoint. No longer should this be questioned. It should be dealt with in the same way as the transfer of farm property.  Once it is transferred it is automatically accepted as being transferred and there is no further question about it.  It is not assessable subsequently. The same should apply to capital.  I am urging that on the Minister and on the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, as Deputy Murphy said, that the transfer of land is automatically accepted and that the transfer of capital is not always accepted, but that does not mean to say that it is always treated as not being genuine.  Every case is examined on its merits and, if it appears to be a genuine question of a family settlement, then it is accepted.  If a transfer is not accepted by the old age pensions committee as a result of a social welfare officer's report, the pensioner has the right of appeal.  It is not a question of deciding in advance that every person who makes a transfer such as this is dishonest.  It is a question of fact, and whether or not a transfer of money is held to be for the purpose of getting an old age pension or whether it is accepted as a genuine transfer to a member of the family.  The position is that sometimes it is accepted and sometimes it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is realistic to suggest that we should make a rule that the transfer of money should always be accepted and in all circumstances, irrespective, apparently, of the amount of money involved.  That would leave the way wide open for very wealthy people to get a non-contributory old age pension. Generally speaking, the present system works fairly well.  In cases where it is believed that a person has been treated harshly, the right of appeal to an appeals officer can be exercised.  It <Col N="1113" /> just is not realistic to suggest that all transfers of capital should be automatically accepted.  There has to be some assessment of the facts in individual cases.</P>

    <P>Section 3 and 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the rates of pension and I understand that it also deals with the assessment of income.  I want to refer again to a question I raised here before, that is, the differential between the assessment of means of a widow as against that of an old age pensioner. Suppose that a widow has £1,000 in the bank or in her possession.  She is assessed on an income of £45.  At 70 years of age she moves along to the old age pension.  She is getting older, possibly more feeble, but the assessment of that £1,000 increases to £78 15s and, as a result, her pension is decreased.  I am surprised that this was not changed in this measure.  Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of speaking when the Second Stage of this Bill was going through the House, but I want to impress upon the Minister and the House the undersirability of retaining that type of assessment.  It is unfair that incomes should be assessed at a higher rate in respect of widows once they reach the age of 70 years. Therefore, I am appealing to the Minister to change this on the Report Stage of the Bill, if it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what Deputy Murphy has said.  This comes back to the point I was making earlier about the lack of reality in relation to present-day money values, that with the present rules in relation to capital and interest thereon, there is a crying need for re-assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A widow with £1,000 and a number of small children is not by any means a rich person and it is entirely wrong to be assessing that unfortunate person with having an income out of what should be a nest egg to be reserved for some almost inevitable expense arising <Col N="1114" /> in the course of raising her family. Could the Minister say offhand when was the level of income which a widow could earn before having her pension diminished last fixed?</P>
    <P>With the exception of such amendments as may have taken place in the widow's pension, it is a long time since there was any re-assessment made of what that level should be and it certainly does not bear, in relation to present-day income possibilities, the relationship which existed when the level was last fixed.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would cost a great deal to bring the figures up to a realistic point.  The reason I say that is this: it is common knowledge that there are non-contributory widows in receipt of incomes from other sources which, if they were disclosed to the State, would disqualify them from receiving a non-contributory pension.  I think the reason this is not disclosed is that their friends and neighbours know that morally it would be unjust to have the widow's mite that they received from the State withdrawn from them simply because they are trying to supplement income by going out and doing a few hours work here and there.  The Minister for Social Welfare may, in his official capacity, hold his hand up in horror that such should be occurring but I imagine that as an ordinary Christian gentleman he in common with other Members of the House would probably rejoice that widows were supplementing the utterly inadequate non-contributory pension by doing a few hours work.  If they can do it without harm to their family life, most people will say: &ldquo;More power to them.&rdquo;  Therefore I do not imagine there would be a huge influx of new demands for non-contributory pensions if the income a widow could earn before her pension was cut was to be brought up to a realistic figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential in assessing means arising from capital is in favour of widows, and this is recognition of the fact that a widow, being considerably younger than the old age pensioner, is more likely to have a young family and therefore have far more demands upon her income than the old age pensioner.  As I have already said in dealing with section 2, <Col N="1115" /> in the case of the assessment of the capital of an old age pensioner, it is a fact that a higher income than that assessed can be obtained by the purchase of an annuity with the capital in possession of the old age pensioner. Therefore, it is not an unrealistic method of assessing the income from a certain amount of capital, because a higher income can be obtained from it than that which is assessed.  Deputy Ryan asked when was the income level last fixed.  Of course, the level of income entitling a widow or an old age pensioner to a non-contributory pension is extended every year according as there are increases given in the rate of pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that the maximum rate of pension is payable to the widow or the old age pensioner with no means, and the rate of pension then decreases in five shilling steps according as the means increases from nil up to a certain figure, and according as the maximum rate of pension is increased the means scale is correspondingly extended at the other end.  It goes from nil up to whatever is the appropriate figure, depending on what the maximum rate of pension is at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that circumstances may vary so far as the young widow and a widow of the 70-year mark are concerned, but I see no justification for continuing a law which reduces an allowance for a person because she moves beyond the 70-year milestone.  I am just taking this £1,000 <Col N="1116" /> capital as an illustration.  The income on this amount is supposed to increase by £33 15s just because you move from your 69th year to your 70th year.  This is a matter which deserves immediate consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's statement that it is possible to get dividends on this capital in excess of the assessment made by the Department of Social Welfare.  In respect of capital in excess of £400 held by an applicant for an old age pension, the applicant is deemed to have a dividend of 10 per cent from that capital.  Very few sources in this country provide a 10 per cent dividend on capital invested.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the position of young widows, particularly those in the farming community and in small retail businesses. The widow of a small farmer, with four or five children, or the widow of a medium-sized shopkeeper, applies for a non-contributory pension.  Because of the rates of assessment in operation it is extremely difficult for such a widow to qualify for a pension.  I can appreciate the difficulty of the social welfare officer who goes along to a widow, who has a farm carrying 12 or 13 cows, and tries to make her net income less than £5 or £6 a week in order to qualify her for a non-contributory pension. In order to bring her within the scope of the regulations to qualify for the maximum rates he would want to put down &ldquo;nil&rdquo;.  Her income must be &ldquo;nil&rdquo; to qualify for the second rate of pension; and £52-odd to qualify for the third rate of pension, with small adjustments in respect of each child. It is an impossible task for any social welfare officer.  It is no use talking of 10s a week as an income for anybody. What would 10s per week buy in 1969?  What would ten times 10s buy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the regulations, a widow with two qualified children, who is demed to have more than £195 15s a year, or less than £208 15s, gets a pension of 33s 6d a week.  That is a widow with in or around £4 a week.  She could have £3 17s a week.  Because she is deemed to have that income she loses 65s a week pension.  That is not equitable.  I should like to have the Minister's views on this.  I am sure every Deputy has <Col N="1117" /> had experience of these cases.  It is the regulations which are at fault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that it was possible to get a dividend in excess of ten per cent from capital. What I said was that, in the case of a person over 70 years of age, it is possible to purchase an annuity which will give a greater return than that assessed under the system.  That is very different from obtaining a dividend.  I was referring to an annuity which would, of course, disappear on the death of the annuitant.  It was pointed out to me a number of years ago that that did not apply in the case of younger people and it was as a result of that that the change was made in the assessment of means of widows. That change is now being used in an effort to have the same change made in the case of the person who reaches 70 years of age.  I suppose it was inevitable that, as time went on, this easing in the case of the younger widows would be utilised to bring pressure to bear to have the same thing done in the case of old age pensioners.  I am merely pointing out now how this arose.  The assessment of capital in the case of old age pensioners is a realistic assessment.</P>
      <P>Of course, the income from a farm, or a business, is naturally affected when the husband dies.  That is taken into account in the assessment of means. The gross income is assessed and allowances made for the expenses that naturally arise.  If Deputy Murphy really considers this matter deeply he will see that it would not be equitable, the amount of money available being limited, to give the same amount of pension either to an old age pensioner or to a widow with an income of £195 a year as one would give to a person who has no income at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only satisfactory way of dealing with this problem is to increase the maximum rate of pension to a realistic amount and it certainly should be adjusted in accordance with income after that.  The case of the widow or old age pensioner who has means of £195 or anything else will be automatically dealt with if we continue the process of increasing the maximum rate of pension and extending the means scale as we have been doing.  To advocate giving <Col N="1118" /> the same rate of pension to the person who has means of £3 or £4 a week as we give to the person who has no means is to advocate the allocation of a substantial amount of money to the other recipients of social assistance and not give any of it at all to those who are most in need, who have no means at all.  To abolish the means test completely would, as I have pointed out here before, cost £17½ million.  To advocate the abolition of the means test is to advocate the raising of an additional £17½ million, distribute that to the various social assistance schemes, but to give nothing at all to those who have no means at all.  I do not think anybody in this House would seriously recommend that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

The Deputy said, and I felt he had not really considered it deeply, that he would advocate that the widows whose means are assessed by £195 and under £208 should get the same pension as the widow with nil means.  That, to all intents and purposes, is advocating the abolition of the means test.  I do not think that would be equitable.  The only way to deal with this in an equitable manner is to increase the maximum rate of pension as much as possible every year and to extend the means scale as we have been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must join issue with Deputy O'Donovan who on Second Stage queried the payment of children's allowances to the first child. He said what, of course, is right, that the child is the cause of great joy and consolation to the parents.  That is true of the first or any subsequent child, or it is true in most cases, but where the couple have only one child they have expenses which are much greater than if they had a number of children.  Certainly <Col N="1119" /> there are no hand-me-downs for the first child, no clothes or school books.  The capital expenditure is a once arising case only, a pram, a cot, a coat or anything else.  It must be bought once and cannot be used by any other child.  In many cases having only one child would deprive that couple of any opportunity in their lifetime of getting housing accommodation, subsidised or otherwise, from the local authority.</P>
      <P>The one-child family has considerably higher expenses in many respects than the family which has a number of children.  Those families with a number of children have expenses in relation to the first child which deserve the support of the community in the same way as the expenses in relation to other children.  While I can appreciate that even if children's allowances never existed the ordinary natural inclination to have children would arise and it is only proper that society should endeavour, by the distribution of income, to ensure that the social standards and opportunities for any children or their parents should not be diminished by reason of children coming into the world.  That is the whole purpose of children's allowances and if that is the valid principle it is applicable to the first child just as much as in relation to subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with some disappointment that we in Fine Gael view the nonincrease of children's allowances in relation to the first child.  It should have been increased in relation to the first child even in one-child families. Perhaps there is a greater case to be made for giving an increase in relation to the first child in larger families.  The expenses will be very much the same in relation to the first child.  They are usually greater because they involve capital expenditure which may not arise in relation to other children.  I can appreciate the reason for it is that it would have cost quite a considerable amount and with the limited sums available the Minister felt it better to distribute this in the way it has been done.  If the Minister has the figures I would like him to indicate what proportion of families are one-child <Col N="1120" /> families.  I would expect they would be in the minority.  Perhaps, if the Minister has the figures he will give them to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>A fairly large additional sum has been allocated for children's allowances.  The suggestion that the allowance for the first child should be much greater must be viewed in the context and against the background of the other increases granted.  I would prefer to stick with what the Minister has done, increase substantially the allowance for the second, third and subsequent children.  We must remember that sometimes we are accused of lagging behind other countries, especially Britain, in our social welfare code, but we must also remember that in Britain there is no allowance for the first child so that this is a case where we have gone one better.  I would agree with the Minister in giving a much larger increase for the second, third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>The number of one-child families is 91,033 out of a total of 330,101 families which is roughly about 27 per cent, but, of course, they do not all remain static and eventually move on and become two- or threechild families or larger-sized families.  I agree with much of what Deputy Ryan said.  There are, of course, extra expenses involved in regard to the first child but then, of course, every family must expect to have at least one child. It is the normal thing to expect.  However, it is recognised that it is right to give some assistance in cases like that and the Government did, in 1963, provide this 10s per month children's allowance for the first child.  Obviously if this were to be increased in the same proportion as the allowances for the other children it would cost a great deal of money.  That was one of the factors that had to be taken into account.  The increase given for the second child is 14s 6d and for third and subsequent children it is 13s 6d. If an increase of 10s per month was to be given in respect of the first child it would cost almost £2 million I think the money which it was possible to distribute was distributed in the best way by giving these fairly substantial increases for the second and subsequent children.  I do agree <Col N="1121" /> that at some future stage it would be desirable also to deal with the first child.</P>

      <P>Section 9 proposes, quite properly, to extend the giving of an orphan's pension where a child is undergoing full-time education at any university college or school up to what we know as 20 years of age, in other words, to the eve of the child's 21st birthday.  I would be anxious and the Fine Gael Party would be anxious to see this go just a little further.  In cases where it is impossible by reason of the duration of the university or college course to get qualification before the age of 21, a special arrangement should be made to extend it.  I imagine the number of such cases would be few and far between but there would be cases in which children would get scholarships and in which they would be attending at university where they would be proceeding towards some particular qualification which would not enable them to qualify until after their 21st birthday.  In such cases the pension ought to be paid until the earliest date at which the child in question could have qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my own profession, most of them qualify just under their 21st birthday, some a few months afterwards. Somebody proceeding towards a BA degree or some degree of that kind must be in the minority these days.  The medical profession and I imagine as years go on, other professions, because the tendency is to have longer courses, are going to find themselves in a situation in which young people will not qualify until they are in their early or middle 20's and on that account I would be anxious if the Minister would be so disposed that he would have another look at this and see if some provision could be made so as to enable the pension to be paid until the earliest date at which people could qualify. That is the general intention of the concession being given here but we should not cut off the pension during <Col N="1122" /> the last few months or in the last year that a student might be proceeding towards the final examinations because it would be undesirable that at that stage there should be such a distraction or upset in the family circumstances which would require the student to go out to work and thereby jeopardise the years of study which had gone beforehand.</P>

      <P>It is obviously difficult to arrange this expect by reference to some age limit.  What Deputy Ryan is suggesting now is that we should try to work into it also something which would take account of the duration of different university courses.  I can see some difficulty in doing that.  Twentyone years of age was taken as a fairly reasonable age but I can see that it does not cover every possible qualification by any means.  I can only undertake to look into the possibility of making this more flexible for next year.  I cannot do it this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest problem arising from section 10 is the implementation <Col N="1123" /> of the benefits conferred by the section.  Section 10 tells us that the benefits will not come into effect until the 2nd January, 1970.  A similar provision was embodied in previous Bills. I cannot see the justification for withholding payments under the headings covered by section 10 to the 2nd January, 1970.  Why not have the same date as is applicable in the case of non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance and the other benefits in respect of which the additional payments will be made in early August? This is a matter that should be reviewed now.  That is the main objection I have.</P>
      <P>All Members of the House have had representations on this question of announcing benefits, usually in the month of April, in relation to non-contributory pensions and not paying the increases until early the following year.  That means that from eight to nine months elapse before the additional benefits are paid to those covered by section 10.</P>
      <P>Whatever about this Bill, the benefits in question should be paid at latest in the month of August, the same as the non-contributory pensions are.  Is it possible, even at this late stage, to pay the additional rates for which these people qualify at an earlier date?  A change must be introduced at some stage and there is no time like the present.  I should like to hear the Minister's justification for allowing a continuance of this procedure whereby increased benefits are not payable for eight months after they have been approved, if you like, by the House when the Budgetary proposals have been passed, which usually happens in April.  I should like an explanation for this unjust and unfair procedure which should be terminated.</P>

      <P>No question of income arises in that case.  With regard to the question of the date of payment of these increases under the social insurance scheme, it is largely a question of the administrative arrangements that are involved.  These involve such things as the necessity to arrange for the printing of new insurance stamps, new pension books and so on.  The experience is that it takes up to the end of December generally to have all these arrangements completed.  It is just not feasible to have these payments made any quicker than is done.  The practice has been to have the new payments made from the beginning of the new year, from January, but since the arrangements are not so involved in the case of assistance payments, these can be made from August.  Therefore, it is largely a question of the administrative arrangements that have to be made.  In so far as the point raised by Deputy Cunningham is concerned, this deals with the insurance benefits and the question of income does not arise in that case.</P>

      <P>There is no justification for the eight or nine months delay.  It is a reflection on the Civil Service to say that they are incapable and unable to deal with this minor problem within a lesser time.  As Deputy Tully reminded the House, there was no problem in sending out the stickers for the additional children's allowances before the election.  Why should contributory pensions and increases covered by section 10 of this measure not be paid at a date not later than 1st August, the date when the increases for the non-contributory people come into force?  It is not right to expect qualified beneficiaries to wait until 2nd January before increases can be paid.  We should argue this question strongly in the House during the discussion of this Bill because it is something that has given rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction in the past.  Admittedly, we did not get a statement from previous Ministers as to the reasons for the delay, but the present Minister has given us a reason which I am suggesting to the House is not acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested in hearing from the Minister his views in relation to the comments he made rather tentatively some few minutes ago on the operation of the contributory and non-contributory social security systems we have now.  Perhaps it is that, because the Minister's political experience in this House has been almost exclusively that of a Minister dealing with the affairs of the State, he may be unaware of the tremendous general dissatisfaction throughout the country in relation to the two separate humiliating forms of social security in operation at present, the contributory and the non-contributory.</P>
      <P>Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the capitalists in this day and age to devise a general system of social security whereby one could eliminate the £17½ million which the Minister says it costs to operate a non-means test system?  Admittedly, we would require extra revenue.  But when one considers that in this small Republic we can have an annual Budget in the region of £360 million, when we have a situation in which we have a gross national product of £1,000 million and when it is envisaged that £21 million can be spent on the adaptation of industry over a couple of years, surely this is not impossible?</P>
      <P>We have had successive Ministers of State dealing with social security systems, crying on the shoulders of the Irish nation and saying that if we abolish the means test it will cost a further £17½ million a year.  The time is long overdue when the Minister should through his Department &mdash; there are many social security experts in the Department, men of competence and of ability&mdash;recast <i>in toto</i> the social security system.  This would be greeted by the Irish people as political maturity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more humiliating for anybody engaged in politics&mdash;even those of us who are new to Irish politics&mdash;and nothing more destructive to the overall working of any political party or member of it than to have <Col N="1127" /> to go to a person in the year 1969 and say: &ldquo;If your yearly means are not in excess of £195 we can get you so much if you complete this form effectively. You will have the social welfare inquiry officer out to inspect your bank book right down the line.  We will argue the case on your behalf and, ultimately, we will get you a non-contributory pension of 25s 6d or 34s 5d.&rdquo;  We must come to grips with this problem whether we like it or not.  My colleague, Deputy Murphy, has said that he generally favours a means test; I prefer to get rid of it.  I prefer to have an open discussion in this House on the best means of getting rid of it.  I submit that the tremendous growth of insured employment in this country is one means of abolishing ultimately the means test in the non-contributory section of the population.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that those who benefit from non-contributory pensions could, by and large, make some contribution. This includes the major section of the agricultural community.  To bring them in on a contributor basis to the social security system of the State must require a complete revolution in their social outlook.  In other words, they must realise the unfairness of getting pensions without making some social contribution.  The self-employed sector of the community would, no doubt, respond if we decided to have the complete realignment which is apparently necessary.  When I exceeded the £1,200 limit I became a voluntary contributor in order to qualify for certain benefits under the social welfare system.  I see nothing different in my social outlook from the outlook which I would expect in any other Irish person in terms of making a contribution to keep himself, in effect, in benefit.  I, therefore, submit that in relation to section 10 we are back again on the merry-go-round.</P>

      <P>We could become extremely political on this aspect of the social security system.  We could shout our heads off about the raising of the turnover tax and any other measures designed to bring about this realignment.  It is within the Minister's province and competence to bring about these changes.  I have no doubt that it can be done in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with what Deputy Desmond has suggested.  It is true that I said it would cost £17½ million to abolish the means test and to change the maximum rates of payments.  I did not suggest for a moment that if I could get this £17½ million I would use it in this scandalous and completely inequitable way. Deputy Desmond is suggesting that the Minister for Finance should raise an extra £17½ million from the community, give it to the Minister for Social Welfare to distribute in the form of a socialistic system and leave the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension at the present level of 75s. and the non-contributory widow's pension at the maximum rate of 73s 6d.  He suggests that I should give the £17½ million to people whose means would debar them from getting benefits at present. That is something I could not do.  I will make every effort to get the Government to agree to extracting the maximum possible amount by way of taxation for the purpose of social assistance. As I have already pointed out, any extra money I can get will be utilised to increase the maximum rate of these payments and to extend the means scale accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be objectionable to Deputy Desmond that a means test has to be operated, but it is the only way of distributing the limited amount of money in an equitable fashion.  So long as I have anything to do with the Department of Social Welfare the money available will be distributed equitably. That is quite apart from the question of opening the insurance scheme to voluntary contributors.  The question of making it permissible for anybody, self-employed or otherwise, to become <Col N="1129" /> a voluntary contributor under the social insurance scheme is under investigation.  I consider that a desirable thing.  That is completely different from the suggestion that we should abolish the means test for social assistance.  That is something which is an unjust suggestion, with which I will have nothing whatever to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not settle today whether or not the means test should be abolished.  The first avenue of exploration should be the various ways and means in which we could substantially relieve the people of many of the hardships of the present means test.  Under section 11, we are dealing with the insurance aspect primarily.  I would like to direct my remarks to this section.  We, in Fine Gael, regard as unsatisfactory the proposal to retain in the future contributions from employees, which, by and large, are comparable with the contributions made by the employers. There is something slightly less required from the employees.  Alone in Europe, we maintain almost parity between the amount which employer and employee has to pay in respect of social assurance.  This is absolutely wrong.  We should be getting larger contributions from the employer.  We should be getting much smaller contributions from the lower-paid workers. It is well established that the greatest percentage of an employee's income which should be related to social welfare insurance should be five per cent. The figures mentioned in section 11 will result, in many cases, in contributions from some of the lower-paid workers in excess of five per cent of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, believe this is wrong.  It is fair that there should be larger contributions received from those who are better paid than are extracted from the lower-paid workers. On two counts we find ourselves in disagreement with this section.  Firstly, because the employers are not paying more and, secondly, because the lower-paid employees are being asked to pay too much.  I said absolutely that this is wrong.  In relation to our probable commitments in a European community this will not be tolerated.  It is <Col N="1130" /> one of the few blessings which we can look forward to with any certainty in the European community.  Such unjust extractions from employees will not be tolerated and much greater contributions will have to come from employers.</P>
    <P>This obligation will not be imposed for the purpose of taxing employers, as was suggested on a television programme when I was faced with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy J. Brennan, when he tried to create unease in the minds of the employers. The employer can feed back his charges through the various processes of collecting compensation for his overheads. Such methods of compensation are not available to employees.  I am surprised that the Minister has not taken the opportunity in this Social Welfare Bill of moving towards that inevitable relationship which we will have to operate in a European community.</P>
    <P>The present ceiling for social insurance was fixed at £1,200 four years ago.  A person earning £1,200 four years ago is probably earning £1,400 or more now.  As I said on Second Stage, there would appear to be a case for revision upwards of this figure.  In order to revise the figure upwards it is no longer necessary to introduce legislation, as it was up to 1965.  All that is now necessary is for the Minister to prepare a draft order and lay it before Dáil Éireann for approval.  In fact, it is now only the Minister who can increase this figure.  It is not open to Members of the House to initiate legislation on this.</P>
    <P>This insurance ceiling can be increased by a simple ministerial draft order laid before the House.  I suppose between now and the time we rise for summer recess there would not be an opportunity to do it but I hope when we return in the autumn the Minister will have the necessary draft order laid before the House.  There is no need for the Minister to postpone it for the reasons given to me today in reply to a Parliamentary Question in which he told me the purposes other than specific social welfare purposes which have to be taken into consideration in regard to the insurable limit of £1,200.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> None of the reasons advanced by the Minister is a justification for keeping the ceiling at £1,200.  If other Departments are using a ceiling of £1,200 at the moment and do not see fit to change it that is a matter for them.  We can get after individual Ministers to change it.  We cannot see any absolute reason why the Minister should keep the ceiling of £1,200 simply because other Departments are slow in moving with the times.  Therefore, we hope he will prepare the necessary draft order and when the next Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is introduced the Minister will move with the times and will see to it that the lower-paid workers are called on to pay less and the better-paid workers are called on to pay more.</P>
    <P>This, of course, can be dealt with under Governmental proposals, which the Third Programme said had been approved, where we will have wagerelated insurance contributions and profits.  We think, apart from that, the matter could be simply and absolutely dealt with in this Bill and we are sorry the Minister did not take the opportunity to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is fairly normal practice but it has been established practice here since the foundation of the social insurance scheme to have them the same.  I do not see any objection to moving away from that at all.  It would be quite appropriate that the employers' contributions should be more.  I would imagine employers in general would not object to that.  In fact, the increase in social insurance contributions usually forms a part of wage increase claims and employers generally should be prepared to accept a greater proportion of this charge, the cost of social insurance stamps.  Personally, I do not see any objection to moving in that direction.  I will look into it before the next Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> With regard to raising the limit for compulsory insurability of non-manual employees, as I said here last week I would agree that this limit is now due for revision.  It has been there four or five years and it is probable that an examination of the position will disclose it should be raised again.  As I pointed out, it has implications in so far as other Departments are concerned.  So far as this Government are concerned we examine all the implications of those things before we make decisions. That is probably why we have lasted so long.  Certainly in so far as this Government are concerned one Minister does not take a decision that affects another Department without having a Government decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is no reason, from the point of view of the Department of Social Welfare, to consider in isolation why this limit should not be raised to any given amount.  The fact is that the question of insurability under the social insurance Acts is used as a yardstick for certain other services and, therefore, the raising of this limit would have consequential effects in other Departments and those have to be taken into consideration as well. We just do not happen to operate in the manner suggested by Deputy Ryan that one Minister does things irrespective of the implications for other Departments.</P>

      <P>It would affect the eligibility of the middle income group in so far as health services are concerned. It is not alone the cost of those things.  There is also the question of the availability of private patients to the medical profession.  They also come into it.  If this limit were to be raised to a substantially higher figure, and practically every employee was to be compulsorily insured, and if the definition of the category eligible for the middle income group of the health services was not raised practically everybody would be eligible for this and, of course, that would have an effect.</P>

An applicant gets back a stereotyped form in a number of instances with something like this stamped on it: &ldquo;You are not qualified by virtue of the second part of subsection (5) of section 17 of the 1952 Social Welfare Act &rdquo;&mdash;or the 1962 Social Welfare Act, as the case may be.  That kind of information is no use to an applicant.  He does not know anything about the second part of subsection (5) of section 17 of the Act.  I should like that system to be dispensed with.

      <P>This is for another type of refusal.  Then you will have to get further information to know what constitutes a qualifying year. The applicant, in some cases a new applicant, could qualify if he had 26 <Col N="1134" /> contributions, whereas if he drew unemployment benefit some years ago he could not qualify with that number of contributions except they were put on in 1968 and he started to sign on the 1st January, 1969.  This whole matter is very complicated and difficult for an applicant to understand.  I am aiming at simplification of the procedure.  A man deemed to be self-employed during a period of unemployment under the Insurance Acts, if he earns more than 10s a day does not qualify.  However, if he has so many stamps spread over a period he does qualify.  It is, therefore, hard to follow that type of procedure.  Now, it is not so many years ago that, once you were a licensed vintner and accepted your income from that employment, you would not qualify for unemployment benefit.  I am responsible for getting that struck off our legislation.  Once you had a licence in your name, even if you did not sell two pints in the week, you did not qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>Possibly, this is not the best time to go into these details.  I am bringing to the notice of the Minister and of the House that, in so far as entitlements are concerned, we should use the most simple language possible.  By doing so, you help the applicant.  You enable him to follow the regulations so far as his entitlement, or non-entitlement as the case may be, goes.  As well as that, you save him the trouble and the time of calling on somebody to give him information or to make representations on his behalf. If refusals have to be made and if they are justified then, if they were sent out in simple language, detailing the reasons why the application cannot be approved, I think that in most cases the applicant would be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, I believe that information should freely be available at all our employment exchanges and at <Col N="1135" /> all our public offices to people who inquire as to social welfare benefits of any kind.  I am a believer in having&mdash;as of course we have so far as social welfare is concerned&mdash;public offices in our towns where people can get information on any aspect of the social welfare legislation that has been enacted by this Parliament.  I think that that kind of public information bureau system would be a great advantage.  It would free the Department from dealing with what could be termed by them, often, as unnecessary representations. However, you are bound to have such representations so long as the present system continues of, as I mentioned at the outset, informing the applicant that by virtue of subsection so-and-so of section so-and-so the applicant's claim is refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not able to agree to this section, which arises out of the incapacity of the Department of Social Welfare so to order its affairs that the contributory and non-contributory pensioners can get their increase on the one day.  This incapacity of the Minister and his Department correctly to organise its affairs leads to the ironical situation in which, in law, the non-contributory pensioner receives for a <Col N="1136" /> period a greater benefit than would be payable to the contributory pensioner, if this section here were not passed. We think it is wrong that that situation should ever exist.  We are not going to be a party to giving approval to the section which is being imported here simply to facilitate the Department which should be capable of organising its affairs so that the contributory pensioners would receive the benefit on the day on which the non-contributory pensioners receive the benefit.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, they are called upon to pay the additional tax for all pensioners and for all benefits under this Bill which require tax payments, since the day of the Budget.  They will not receive any increases until next January.  We consider that to be wrong.  They are also called upon to pay other increases&mdash;increases in rents, rates and other things&mdash;but they will not receive the benefit until next January.  This section here asks us to say that, because they are contributory pensioners, they will receive less between 1st August and January than they would if they were non-contributory pensioners.  We in Fine Gael cannot stomach that and we are not agreeing to this section.</P>

      <P>This has been the position last year and the year before as well.  It is not necessarily correct to say that the contributory pensioners involved will be receiving less than they would if they opted for non-contributory pensions.  That would have to be established on the basis of an investigation of means.  We can reasonably be sure that, in fact, it would be true only in respect of a very small number.  Neither is it correct to say that the rates of taxes appropriate to the new rates are, in fact, being paid.  The rate of tax, of course, is based only on the amount of these increases that will become payable in the current financial year and only a very small period is involved.  The difficulty in establishing whether or not these people would be entitled to the higher rate of non-contributory old age pension does not seem to be justified. There are probably very few, if any, that would, in fact, qualify for higher non-contributory pensions.</P>

      <P>Nobody was more pleased than I was when this additional allowance was introduced even in the very limited way in which it was introduced because I believe that this type of allowance should be extended.  I have said that in this House and on the local health authority down through the years because I believe that, instead of this type of allowance costing the Exchequer additional money, it will lead to a saving in so far as public funds are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a tremendous problem at present, the problem of caring for what are termed our senior citizens.  It is impossible in County Cork, and I am <Col N="1138" /> sure it applies throughout the country, to get accommodation for elderly people in hospitals and institutions. There are so many long-standing elderly patients in our district hospitals that most of them are utilised exclusively for caring for geriatric patients.  I have maintained in this House and on other bodies dealing with this problem that if we gave additional allowances to such people with a view to keeping them in their own homes it would be money well spent.  This move to give the 45s and to give the 55s from 2nd January is undoubtedly a good one except that it is too limited.  An elderly person must be residing with a daughter or a step-daughter in order to come within the scope of the provision.  It could be usefully extended because in our district hospitals it takes from £13 to £16 a week to maintain an old person. Therefore, we can see the justification for being as liberal as possible in making funds available to give our old people a reasonable measure of comfort within their own homes.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is an obligation on families to care for their parents if at all possible.  I believe a boy or girl is obliged to care for his or her father and mother in old age.  It is an Irish Christian tradition and irrespective of what funds we make available or what we do to help such people we should not lose sight of that obligation.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that financial difficulties make it almost impossible in many cases for people to care for their elderly relatives at home.  I believe that in such cases, particularly where the person is bed-ridden or incapacitated, liberal allowances from public funds should be made available and a means test applied.  I do not like means tests any more than any other Member of the House but I can visualise the difficulty of administering such a scheme without imposing limitations.  We know that money is limited.  We know that money has to be taken from one section of the people if we are to give it to another.  We know that additional funds for this or any other scheme must be got from the general body of taxpayers.  Therefore, we must be, to some extent, conservative in our approach so far as the people who are <Col N="1139" /> qualified for such allowances are concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that the people we should cater for are those in the lower income groups who could be cared for within their own home if additional allowances from public funds were made available.  I am a firm believer in giving to our elderly, incapacitated people every comfort that it is possible to give them and I would like to see this extended beyond the daughter or step-daughter and some scheme drawn up by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare and the local health authorities to deal with this major question.  We have reached the stage where it is impossible for incapacitated people to get accomodation in hospitals in some parts of the country.  The problem is a most acute one and to my mind one way of easing it is to give to deserving applicants additional financial help so as to enable them to be cared for in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I have visited people in many institutions and even in homes where they are cared for in a reasonable way, where conditions are reasonably good and where the staff are considerate, old people would much prefer to be in their own corners and in their own homes. I never met a person in a public institution who would not prefer to be living at home with a son, daughter, nephew or niece.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to reiterate my view that there should be an extension of the provisions of this Bill so as to cater for people other than those who are being catered for in this section, those residing with a daughter or step-daughter. It would effect a saving in public funds.  It would be money gainfully utilised and it would create a much more pleasant atmosphere for elderly people who could be cared for in their own homes rather than in institutions.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain whether this benefit will be payable to daughters in insurable employment and those who are not as from the same date?  This is a question I want answered, whether it is the same date for both.</P>

      <P>Tá cúpla ceisteanna agam le cur.  This is a welcome extension of the social welfare code and I merely want to ask a few questions.  This section deals with non-contributory old age pensioners.  Why January 2nd?  Could it not be brought into operation in line with the old age pension increases which will become operative about 1st August?  Does a widow who has children under the age of 16, or over that age and under 21 and are attending a post-primary school, or the old age pensioner whom she is looking after qualify for this increase if there are no other persons in the household than the daughter who is a widow and who has children living with her in the house of the old age pensioner?</P>
      <P>If this daughter or any daughter under this section has an income other than earned income&mdash;I appreciate that if she goes out to work every day she could not be regarded as a person looking after an aged person or relative &mdash;does the old person qualify in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Murphy on this section.  The section provides for an allowance in respect of a female relative for looking after an old age pensioner who is incapacitated and it was introduced last year or the year before.  It was then a very rigid provision and it was nearly impossible for a daughter or step-daughter to qualify for the allowance. That was demonstrated here by Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Social Welfare and I think he admitted that only 115 people or so had qualified for the extra allowance.  That was because it was confined to a daughter or step-daughter who had given up insurable employment and I think that during the previous five years she had to have something like 156 stamps.  In effect, it was nearly impossible for a daughter or step-daughter to qualify and a very limited number did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is highly desirable that old people should be encouraged to remain in their own homes or with relatives and that relatives should be encouraged to care for them.  The section we are now dealing with really replaces <Col N="1141" /> entirely the section in the previous Act and is wide enough, I think, to cover a niece or cousin or any other female relative that the Minister may decide to prescribe because, in the present section, the Minister will be able to prescribe the degree of relationship required as paragraph (ii) 2 of subsection (5) (a) says ...</P>
    <P>there is residing with the pensioner for the purpose of providing that care and attention a prescribed female relative of the pensioner, and ...</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister at this stage that he will not confine this to a daughter or step-daughter and that he will extend the relationship considerably because there might be many cases where an old age pensioner might not have a daughter or step-daughter available but might have a niece available.  The section is wide enough as it stands to enable the Minister to prescribe that a niece will qualify but I should like him to say so.</P>
    <P>I should also like him to clarify another point.  I do not think it is necessary that a female relative, daughter or step-daughter, should go to reside in the pensioner's house.  I hope it is intended that if the pensioner is brought to reside with the female relative in that person's house the female relative will qualify for the additional allowance.  It is necessary that should be so because it might result in the old person being brought to the house of a female relative rather than being despatched to an old person's home, or the county home to put it bluntly.  If the Minister makes his regulations in this way, not only would he be encouraging relatives to look after their old folk but he would be saving county councils and the State in general a considerable sum because it takes much more than 55s a week to maintain a person in an old person's home.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments behind the section.  It is a vast improvement on the other section under which it was virtually impossible for a female relative to qualify for the allowance.  That is conceded by the fact that the Minister is replacing the other section and <Col N="1142" /> I appeal to him to go the whole way and draft generous regulations which will not lead to wholesale abuses or payment of allowances in cases where they should not be paid but which will encourage relatives to look after their old folk either in the old person's home or the relative's home and avoid as far as possible sending old people to institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with section 16.  If a daughter is living with her mother or father, an old age pensioner, it is possible to make an allowance.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that this is right.  The new law is a little bit ambiguous.  In the original Bill the wording was &ldquo;daughter or step-daughter.&rdquo;  I suggest that a step-daughter is no relation to the pensioner. In fact, he could marry her if he wanted to, and he would not be in any trouble with the Pope or the man in the moon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> If a pensioner can prove that a daughter or step-daughter is living with him or her, he or she is entitled to an extra 25s week.  Is not that right?  An old age pensioner is entitled to have someone to look after him but I think a grand-daughter or a niece should also be included.  A daughter living with the pensioner does not have to have stamps.  I am not sure if this applies to a step-daughter because I did not have time to read the latest one because of the election.  What about people who are in the unhappy position, particularly in my own part of the country, of not having a daughter or a step-daughter but having a niece or a grand-daughter living with them?  I want to say to the Minister&mdash;I forgot to say it to him privately and I am now saying it publicly&mdash;that I think he should have another look at this.</P>
    <P>If a pensioner has a niece, a grand-niece or a grand-daughter living with him this ensures that he does not have to go into the county home.  He should get the same concession as the man whose daughter or step-daughter is staying with him.  I do not think any Deputy would disagree with that.  It is perfectly fair.  I know the Minister has done more than any previous Minister but I want him to go a little further. Where possible people should be enabled to live at home instead of having to go into a county home.  I remember a doctor saying to me on one occasion that, if we built a county home from Castlebar to Blacksod, it would be filled, and he was probably right.  If an allowance would keep people out of county homes, we should give it to them.  I am sure the rich men on the other side of the House would agree with that.  There is a new elite, a new crowd, in the country today who have no respect for the old or the enfeebled. This is a sad reflection on our times, but unfortunately we older people have to accept it.  The Minister should give every incentive possible to them to keep old people out of county homes and in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I conceive this section to be for the purpose of encouraging people to look after those for whom they are responsible and to <Col N="1144" /> endeavour, as far as possible, to keep them out of institutions.  We are all very much in favour of this and its extension I have a feeling that this could have been made even wider.  Subject to the Minister's clarification on the point, to a certain extent this seems to me to be fairly restricted, in fact, to relations.  Some speakers have said it may be restricted to a daughter, step-daughter or near relation of some sort. We all appreciate the great tragedy when an old person finds himself forced to break up the home and move away from the surroundings to which he has been accustomed all his life.</P>
      <P>This section operates in the opposite direction to keeping people in their own homes.  If a person at the age of 70 has no relatives left&mdash;everybody belonging to him may have emigrated to America or Britain or may have died&mdash;he has no choice, under this section, but to turn the key in the door and go into the county home or some other institution.  That is undersirable and defeats the ends which, probably, the Minister and those who advise him have in view.  Therefore, in a case like that, if a person has no relative and is unable to look after himself, he should be permitted to draw the allowance and get some female help even though she is not related to the old person.</P>
      <P>The section says a person must prove he requires someone to look after him. Most people who are drawing the old age pension, unless they happen to be particularly hail and hearty, need somebody to look after them.  It is undesirable that they should live alone.  The Minister could very easily extend the scope of this Bill.  I believe it would find universal agreement in the House if a person over the age of 70 who requires someone to look after him, could employ female help even though the person employed was not related. Deputy Lenehan raised the point about the step-daughter not being a relative. She would not be a blood relation but there would be some ties with the old person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the families of old people are dispersed.  They may not have emigrated but they may be living in a different county.  The parents may have daughters who are married and <Col N="1145" /> because of the husband's employment are unable to leave their environment. In such cases there is justification for paying the allowance to the pensioner concerned so that he may employ somebody to look after him.</P>
    <P>We all deeply appreciate what it means to an old person to break up his home and go into an institution, apart from the more materialistic view of what it costs.  It costs about £16 a week to maintain a person in an institution. The sum of money required to deal with this situation would cost the country very much less than if these people go into an institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give this problem his full consideration.  It should not be hard to check on cases where an old person gets someone to look after him.  There is nothing simpler. Everybody for miles around, particularly in rural Ireland, knows if somebody is living alone or has somebody living with him.  The Minister should give this problem his full consideration.</P>

      <P>This is a very good section and it is worthy of our wholehearted support.  I also agree with other Deputies who said it should be extended. I am in favour of this section because it encourages our people to keep their old or incapacitated parents or relatives at home.  Any additional help we can give to encourage the keeping at home of these people is money well spent.  It costs anything from £10 to £20 to keep our old people in county homes or other institutions. We all know that if the relatives of old people got anything like half of that sum they would only be too glad to keep them at home.  It is also agreed by everybody that old people are much happier in their own surroundings, and I quote from Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village:</i></P>
      <P>And as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue</P>
      <P>Pants to the place from whence at first he flew,</P>
      <P>I still had hopes my long vexations past</P>
      <P>Here to return and die at home at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of an extension of this <Col N="1146" /> scheme in order to keep old people in their homes and keep them out of county homes where, unfortunately, far too many of them have to go at the present time.</P>

      <P>This applies both to contributory and non-contributory pensioners. It is intended to operate from 2nd January.  It was brought in in January last year.  It is intended to apply to a prescribed female relative and this makes it possible to extend it beyond the categories of daughter and step-daughter.  Admittedly, it will still have to be a relative; a step-daughter will be considered a relative for this purpose at any rate.  I have no doubt that all Deputies would like to see this considerably extended&mdash;in fact made payable to every old age pensioner&mdash;but that does not happen to be feasible.  There is a considerable extension of it being made in this year and it may be found both desirable and feasible to extend it further in future years.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that this provision was very rigid intially, but of course it was introduced initially to deal with a specific problem, to deal with the case of a daughter who left insurable employment because it was necessary for her to stay at home to look after an aged parent and who, although she had sufficient contributions to qualify for either unemployment or disability benefit, could not receive either of these because she was not fulfilling the conditions. She could not be held to be seeking employment.  Neither could she qualify for disability benefit.  It was to deal with that case that this provision was brought in originally.  It is now being extended to cover a prescribed female relative, irrespective of whether or not she left insurable employment or ever was in insurable employment. That means that a new aspect is introduced in that an inducement is being given to people to keep their aged relatives at home rather than have them go into institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This really developed out of a decision to deal with a particular problem. It may be desirable to extend this in the future but this is as much as it is possible to do at present.  It is a considerable <Col N="1147" /> advance.  My interpretation of the section is that it will apply equally in the case in which the old age pensioner goes to reside with the prescribed female relative for the purpose of receiving full-time care and attention just as it applies in the case of a prescribed female relative who goes to reside with an old age pensioner.  There is not a means test in the case of the female relative.  The condition precedent is that the old age pensioner must be receiving full-time care and attention and the fact that the female relative who provides the care and attention receives some unearned income of her own will not, in fact, be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, when the Bill was discussed last week I was unable to attend and I should now like to comment on the resolution.  Over the years I have made my opinion on land bonds quite plain.  Everybody knows that land bonds are out of favour in this country and that many people have suffered heavily as a result of this system being introduced for the payment of land acquired, often by compulsion, from holders of one kind or another and in a number of cases from smallholders.  We know that within the past four or five years land has been bought under this system <Col N="1149" /> and that the land bonds then issued have now depreciated in value by 25 per cent.  The present price of 6 per cent land bonds is in or around 75. Certainly it is less than 80 per cent. It means that land bonds worth £1,000 paid a few years ago to a smallholder for his farm are now worth approximately £750 or £770.</P>
      <P>I highlighted the position as far as land bonds were concerned in a particular case which was discussed over a period in this House.  My view is that such people should be compensated, that they are entitled to comensation, that they are people of slender means and that people who were paid in land bonds within the past number of years have lost heavily.  Every one of us has had representations from such people, many of whom did not understand that the bonds were likely to depreciate in value.  Indeed a sizeable number would not have understood what the system entailed at all.  They were told: &ldquo;We are buying your land for £1,000 and we will give you bonds equivalent to £1,000.&rdquo;  The next thing they knew was that the bonds had fallen from 95 to 90 to 85 and to 80 and now they are less than 80.  Even 7½ per cent land bonds are selling at or around 90 so what is the position of the 4½ per cent or previous issues?  The whole system should be changed and a person from whom land is acquired, whether by consent or by compulsory methods, is entitled to justice.  When people were given land bonds they were not told that their value was likely to depreciate in the not too distant future and as a result people have suffered.  In south-west Cork those concerned are not people of affluence but people who had no other source of income except that from the holdings which they agreed to sell in some cases while in other cases they were acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister's statement on Second Stage and it was not possible today to get it here in the House and, therefore, I do not know whether the system is going to continue and we are going to force people to sell land and then pay them in land bonds. I understood that there was a changed outlook and I was glad to hear it and to hear that in future the Land Commission <Col N="1150" /> would pay in cash for land.  It may be some time before we have another opportunity of discussing land bonds and on this occasion I should like to hear the Minister's views, to know whether it is proposed to compensate people who have suffered heavily through depreciation, whether it is envisaged that the regulations would be changed in order to avoid this position and that where land is acquired the people will get some assurance that their bonds will not depreciate. Otherwise this system should be scrapped.  It is unfair that a public Department should deal this way with a section of our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose section 1 and I do so because of the many complaints of hardship and loss that have come to my notice over the years as a result of paying for land in land bonds.  Probably there is no Deputy who has not had this experience. Everybody who has land to sell objects to payments by way of land bonds.  I was not here for the Second Stage of the Bill which went through in a very expeditious manner.  In fact, many Deputies who would have liked to contribute did not get the opportunity to do so.  I do not know what explanation the Minister offered for seeking permission to create £15 million worth of additional bonds for land purchase.  I suppose the Government <Col N="1151" /> intend to purchase more land for distribution and, perhaps, the price of land has gone up and, therefore, the means to purchase land is required. This is a form of barter, a form of barter that is unacceptable to anybody I have come across whose land is being taken for division.  It is unacceptable because of the reasons given by Deputy Murphy, that very often there is rapid deterioration in the value of these bonds.</P>
      <P>There is also in the Bill a proposition that the Bank of Ireland come into this and these bonds are transferred to the Bank of Ireland.  Say a man who gets £10,000 for a farm owes the Bank of Ireland £10,000, will the Bank of Ireland accept £10,000 worth of bonds in respect of this debt?  The answer clearly is that they will not. Therefore we are pretending to be paying a price for land that, in fact, we are not paying.  I would say that there is quite a large element of confiscation in this method of buying land and that it leads to endless delays and objection on the part of people who have land for sale.  I could safely say that most people selling land to the Land Commission would accept a much lower price if they got cash for it and it would be much easier to carry out the various transactions in relation to the purchase of land if we had cash to offer for it.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked a question here as to the amounts of money that were being paid by way of bonds and by way of cash and was told that approximately £½ million was paid by way of cash and the balance £1½ million was paid by way of bonds. This in itself creates a lot of difficulty because there are all sorts of allegations that certain people are singled out for special treatment and that they get cash, that the friends get cash and those who have not influence and friends are paid in bonds.  I do not know exactly how people are selected for cash payment but I assume that they are selected because they are selling, perhaps, a smallish area of land, that they are poorish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a person with, perhaps, a large farm but, also, a large debt in the bank.  How is such a person <Col N="1152" /> to rid himself of this debt if he is paid by way of land bonds for his land?  This is a serious difficulty that arises in the system by which we pay for land by way of land bonds.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to create more and greater difficulties because, obviously, we intend to increase our operations and we intend to create a greater number of dissatisfactions as a result. I ask the Minister why, instead of paying in land bonds, the Government do not simply borrow the extra money required and overcome all the difficulties that arise and eliminate all the hardships and loss that people suffer. There is no doubt that there is a large element of confiscation in this because of the rapid deterioration in the value of the type of bond that is used and which it is proposed to use in an increasing way if this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>I should just like to hear what the Minister has to say as to why this is not done.  It would save endless difficulty and delay and many more people would be prepared to sell their land to the Land Commission if they knew that they would get cash for it.  I believe that there would be people coming forward and offering their land to the Land Commission whereas at present they are hiding from the Land Commission and trying to use all the secret devices known to them so that the Land Commission will not know that they are in the market until they have sold privately to some other purchaser. In fact, in many cases, people do not get the full value of their land because they are afraid to go to public auction because if it is a holding suitable to the Land Commission, the Land Commission immediately step in and say that they will put their foot on the land and the owner cannot move.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought before the House the case of a widow whose land was taken.  The arrangement was that she would be paid in land bonds.  The Land Commission set that farm for 12 months and it took more than 12 months to settle the legal difficulties in establishing title and in making all the other arrangements necessary before the purchase finally went through.  Two things happened during that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> The interest on the land bonds increased by one per cent but the Land Commission insisted on paying at the price arranged a year earlier.  During that year or 14 months this lady got no income whatever from the land and no income from the letting made by the Land Commission, who took the money from the letting, and no income from the bonds.  The only explanation the Minister could offer me and the House was that the interest was, in fact, accruing to her credit and that she would eventually get it, but in the meantime that lady suffered the total loss of income during that period.  I give this as an example of the many hardships that can occur arising out of this system of purchase of land by land bonds.</P>
    <P>I want to object to that system as strongly as I can.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the situation before he insists on putting this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>It is very entertaining to listen to Deputy Clinton on the subject of land bonds.  I should like to point out for the benefit of Deputy Clinton and the people on the far side of the House that it was not the present Government who invented land bonds; it was the old Cumann na nGaedheal crowd who in 1922 invented this method of confiscating land.  They produced these bonds and left people at that time without any option.  If they did not take the bonds, they got nothing at all.  They had no way out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Government introduced this land bond system.  That was the method for the purchase or confiscation&mdash; I prefer the word confiscation&mdash;of land at that time.  If people who sold land did not take bonds, they had no other way out than to take two jumps for themselves, like the Labour Party are taking today.  We are told today that it is wrong.  We are merely carrying on along the same lines except that we are trying to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the case <Col N="1154" /> of the poor landholder who has to take land bonds and who cannot then cash them at the proper price.  Of course, that is not true.  Any of the poor people who have to sell land today can get cash for it.  We all know that.  Deputy Clinton knows that as well as I do.  He knows that it is not necessary to take land bonds at all.  I do not know what one would get for land bonds today.  It is said that they are going down in price.  I do not believe that.  People who live in my part of the country see the tremendous increase in the value of land.  I could not imagine one of these people being silly enough to believe that there could be any reduction.  It is possible that, with all the fiddling that you people on the far side of the House go on with, that might happen. For instance, we had one of your Deputies trying to get hold on a holding there and trying to get away with murder and then coming to the Land Commission and trying to get them to buy it.  Do not ask me to name him.  We had that kind of thing going on but I do not think that there is a great deal wrong with the method of buying land.</P>
    <P>It has happened, for instance, that an Egyptian came into this country and offered a fantastic price to a Deputy or to somebody for his land and afterwards it has happened that this smart Alec has got the Land Commission to step in and buy that land at the same price.  Deputy Clinton and Deputy L'Estrange are not listening to me now. They come in afterwards and ask the Land Commission to buy that land at the same price.  We all know that unless the Land Commission clap down the order and clap it down in time&mdash;Deputy Murphy knows this as well as I do&mdash; there is not a lot they can do about it. They must go before the auctioneer and the auctioneer can have a whole set of fake bidders in front of him.  I have seen this happening.</P>
