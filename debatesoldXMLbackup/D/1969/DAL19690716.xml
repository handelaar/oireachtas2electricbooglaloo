    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in the light of revised recent British estimates on cost of entry to EEC a similar reassessment has been made as to the costs involved should Ireland be accepted for full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen recent speculative press reports on the likely effect of entry into the European Economic Community on Britain's balance of payments.  No official detailed calculation of the effects of all the factors that would be operating on Britain's balance of payments in the first few years after entry has, however, been published recently.  A firm assessment of the effect on the Irish balance of payments would depend on the terms which would be negotiated for our entry and also on the long-term arrangements to be made by the community for the financing of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that we have no idea what the ultimate cost of enry to the Common Market would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have.  We have been keeping in touch with that. We have published one White Paper. We have been keeping it under constant review and we feel that, overall, it will inure to our advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach <Col N="632" /> any idea of the likely increase in the cost of living figure with the consequent increase in salary and wage demands and then the change in the competitive position which we now have in relation to industrial and agricultural goods following entry into the Common Market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of his statement in the Dáil on 8th July that there are countries that call themselves neutral but our neutrality is not of the same nature as theirs, he will state what the nature of our neutrality is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a question on this subject on the 9th May, 1968 (Official Report of Dáil Éireann, Volume 234, No. 9 &mdash; columns 1278 to 1280).</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his Government are deliberately de-emphasising neutrality in order to prepare the public mind for eventual entry into a group of States with a common foreign policy generally regarded as incompatible with neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I indicated to the Deputy a few days ago that we have no traditional policy of neutrality in this country like countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Austria, who have declared themselves to have permanent policies of neutrality.  Under the Constitution, we can make up our minds as to our neutrality in certain circumstances, and Dáil Éireann will decide in the light of the circumstances prevailing.  If the Deputy wants me to spell out the circumstances I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say this.  So far as we are concerned, if there is a question of neutrality in a situation involving, for example, a war between atheistic communism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the way of life we know &mdash; freedom of the individual and the Christian way of life&mdash; then, in those circumstances, we in this Parliament, I believe, would not be neutral, nor would the people of Ireland permit us to be neutral.</P>

      <P>We cannot have a debate on this.  I have allowed two supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has been so good as to answer this question in a certain amount of detail, perhaps I have a right to a supplementary on his statement.  I should like to put him the question: would he not agree that neutrality in the ordinary acceptance of the word, means a refusal to enter into military commitments and does not necessarily mean indifference to the character of the internal regime of opposing groups of States, as appeared surely from Ireland's neutrality in the last war, when it could not be considered that Ireland was indifferent to the character of Nazism &mdash; at least I presume not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our neutrality in the last war was determined by our own circumstances rather than the existence of Nazism or anything else in any other country.  It was determined by the division of our own country.  May I read the answer to the question to which I referred?  It was given by me on 9th May, 1968, in reply to a question put by the Deputy's colleague. It is to this effect:</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides in Article 28.3.1º that war shall not be declared and that the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude to a war situation would fall to be determined as the necessity arises.  As we are not members of any military alliance we are not committed in our attitude towards any future war.  Any decision to become involved would, of <Col N="634" /> course, pursuant to the Constitution, be subject to the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>That is still the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give a full statement of Government policy in relation to the long-term future of Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, in view of the considerable concern felt by many people in County Meath about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this question arises from the recommendations in the FitzGerald Report relating to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  This report sets out the principles which should govern the future development of the hospital services and I accept these principles as being the best means of ensuring that we will have an effective hospital service in the future.  The report has also made suggestions as to how these principles might be implemented in different areas.</P>
      <P>The framers of this report, excellent though it is, could not have been expected to present a perfect blue print. Modification based on practicable financial considerations and on the basis of making the best possible use of good existing facilities will be inevitable and can be made without departing from the general principles of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that before coming <Col N="635" /> to a final decision in relation to any area I shall examine the position in that area in the light of views already submitted by health authorities or other interested bodies or which may be submitted in the future.  Where necessary, I will meet deputations.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I must repeat something which I have already said.  If the prospect of recovery, or the rate of recovery, of any sick person can be markedly improved by changes on the lines recommended, no Deputy in this House should find himself in conflict with such changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been a number of serious accidents in the vicinity of Navan and that they were successfully treated in Our Lady's Hospital?  These people would have died if they had had to travel to Drogheda, Tullamore or elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps are being taken as a matter of urgency to meet the present shortage of qualified nurses and, in particular, to encourage married nurses to return to the practice of their profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated yesterday in reply to a question from Deputy Clinton, special measures have been taken for the stimulation of nursing recruitment in the four local health authority areas where a shortage of nursing staff has been encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> These concessions include the award to permanent nurses of special salary increments, up to a maximum of five, in respect of post-graduate experience gained elsewhere.  Also, in the four areas of special difficulty, married nurses are now awarded normal annual increments up to the maximum of the salary scale whereas heretofore, being temporary, they stayed at the minimum irrespective of the length of their service.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for decision by other health authorities, depending on local conditions, whether these concessions should be applied in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is doubtless aware that the recent arbitration award sanctioned for nurses raised the maximum of the salary scale for a staff nurse, the basic grade, from £879 to £985 a year retrospective to 1st June, 1968.  In addition, nurses are now paid two special long service increments of £35 each on completion of 15 and 20 years service, thus raising the maximum annual salary to £1,055 at that stage.  Nurses engaged on midwifery, paediatrics, fever, TB and theatre duties have had their allowances increased from £22 and £28 to £40 a year.  Again, a new allowance of £40 a year is now payable to nurses engaged on duties in geriatric units, long-stay hospitals, county homes and intensive care units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total cost in respect of increases in disabled persons' maintenance allowances arising out of the Budget; if he is satisfied that the charge is appropriate to local rates; and if he will give consideration to the cost being a central charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost in the current financial year of the increases in the allowances for disabled persons announced in the Budget is estimated at £390,000.  I am satisfied that the normal arrangements for financing health expenditure should apply to the additional cost of these allowances. Under these arrangements less than half the cost is met from rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the rate in Donegal is £5 3s 6d in <Col N="639" /> the £ and that this increase will add a further 26/- in the £ to the rates?  Is he satisfied this is a proper way to finance such a scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A White Paper on Health Services has been published.  As the Deputy well knows, in counties like Donegal and my own constituency in Monaghan, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the cost of all services is paid from centrally found funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a block figure is given each year.  Will the Minister take into consideration this new increase when he is giving the block grant to County Donegal at the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the question of the effect on the rates to the community is subject to constant study by the Department of Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government has made a number of statements on the question of transferring the whole of the health charges from the rates.  He has said that to carry out the promises made by Fine Gael during the election campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must appreciate that in the western counties the ratio of this type of person is much higher than in Dublin.  This means an added burden on the rates in counties like Donegal and Monaghan, as the Minister knows well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the effect on the rates is very much related to the area of agricultural land in any county.  In my county where there is a considerable grant for the relief of rates on land, the percentage, taken as a whole, borne by the ratepayers is low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, it might help the House to appreciate how well it was advertised if I give the full history of the indications of the termination of the scheme.  The first indication was given at the end of August, 1968.  At that time it was publicised that the latest date for receipt of applications would be 3rd June, 1969, and that applications received after that date would not be considered.  On 15th May last, a reminder press release, followed by an advertisement in the daily and provincial newspapers, restated the position &mdash; that the scheme would end on 30th June and that the latest date for the receipt of applications was 3rd June.  At the beginning of June it was decided to extend the closing date until 13th June and a press release was issued on 5th June to this effect. In practice, applications up to 17th June were accepted and 272 completed application forms were received between that date and 30th June.</P>
      <P>It is now proposed to accept these for consideration.  This, I think, is fairly indicative of the extent to which we have gone to try to accommodate not only those who came in after the published dates but of the number of occasions on which we published the closing dates so that there should be no mistakes on the part of any producer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statement already issued by me on this matter which is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Local Government has determined the appeal by <Col N="646" /> the Green Property Company Ltd. against a refusal by Dublin Corporation of planning permission for redevelopment of properties at 44-45 St. Stephen's Green, 18-19 Hume Street, 46-49 St. Stephen's Green and 1-2 Hume Street.  Permission for the development proposed by the Green Property Co. Ltd. has been granted by the Minister subject to conditions limiting the floor area exclusive of space used for parking of cars, for tanks and for mechanical and heating equipment to a maximum of 16,000 sq. ft. on the sites of 44-45 St. Stephen's Green and 18-19 Hume Street and to 63,000 sq. ft. on the sites of 46-49 St. Stephen's Green and 1-2 Hume Street.  Further conditions require the provision of not less than 50 and not more than 80 car-parking spaces, access to and egress from the car-parking area to be by way of Bell Lane only, the streets facades to be on the existing building line and not to exceed the height of the coping of the facade to No. 50 St. Stephen's Green and the height of the penthouses not to exceed 9 feet over parapet level&mdash; the penthouses to be located at the eastern end of each building and to be not less than 15 feet from the facade to Hume Street.  The reasons for the conditions are to avoid overdevelopment of the sites and consequent injury to the amenity of the area and the values of neighbouring properties, and to provide limited off-street car-parking facilities in the interests of road safety. Before arriving at his decision the Minister gave long and careful consideration to the complex issues involved in the appeal.  He had regard to the evidence tendered in writing and at the oral hearing of the appeal which took 23 hours to hear, and to the report of his Inspector on the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister is cognisant of the civic design importance of Hume Street and appreciates the concern of those anxious to ensure that the amenities of the area are preserved. He was obliged, however, to give due regard also to the fact that a considerable amount of redevelopment of St. Stephen's Green had <Col N="647" /> already been permitted, that an outline permission for the redevelopment of portion of the site under appeal had been granted by the Dublin Corporation as far back as May, 1966, and had not been the subject of any objection by way of appeal.  The developers hold this permission and could prepare detailed plans for approval based on it if they so desired.  There was also the fact that some of the houses on the site had already been demolished making redevelopment a necessity while others were in such poor structural condition that preservation would be costly and unattractive economically.  In these circumstances he felt that the permission sought, should be granted subject to the conditions referred to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The permissions for the new office development already on St. Stephen's Green were given by the Dublin Corporation and were not appealed to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister if he and his colleagues are aware of the disquiet caused by the flagrant disregard of the draft development plan for Dublin city and his cynical reversal of the planning decision of the now defunct Dublin Corporation in favour of the Green Property Company?  Furthermore, in view of the circumstances surrounding the Minister's decision &mdash; he has no concern with the responsible and informed opinions of bodies interested in the preservation and conservation of our essential social environment &mdash; would he give the House all the information in his possession in regard to this matter, particularly from the point of view of the total surrender on his part of all the essential planning prerequisites to the Green Property Company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I have had regard to all the considerations, including the fact that valid outline permission for portion of the site had been given and was not appealed by any of the bodies to which the Deputy referred, and it was, therefore, a legal permission; and I have also had regard to the fact that the provisions of the draft plan were <Col N="648" /> changed since that time and to the implications of that change in so far as Dublin ratepayers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this decision on the part of the Minister represent the opening of the floodgates for the complete disappearance of St. Stephen's Green, as we now know it, and, secondly, is this not giving to this development company an enormous opportunity for capital development and the creation of a capital asset from the point of view of land speculation which is bound to follow on this decision? Surely, with the shortage of housing and flat accommodation, or even Government office accommodation, together with the fact that the Government themselves own some of the property, the Government or the local authority are the correct people to develop this area, if it is to be developed rather than left as it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of this opening the floodgates for the disappearance of St. Stephen's Green. This refers to only a small part of St. Stephen's Green.  A considerable amount of redevelopment of the area has already taken place on foot of permissions granted by the planning authority and not appealed to me by anyone. In so far as Government policy in regard to the building of office blocks is concerned, that is not a matter for me. So far as I am concerned, I think the Government's policy not to engage directly in office block building is the correct one.</P>

      <P>While allegations in regard to the appointment of rate collectors are made from time to time actual evidence of malpractices has not been forthcoming.

      <P>Do I take it that the Minister's policy is only to negotiate in conjunction with Britain, that Ireland is not going to negotiate independently with regard to its entry into the EEC?  Would he not take into consideration the fact that the advantages that we gain from entry to the EEC are largely agricultural as <Col N="660" /> against the British initiative, which is largely industrial and, on the basis of that fact, does he not consider it desirable that Ireland should negotiate on its own as a separate individual, sovereign nation?</P>

In these circumstances in view of the importance of ensuring that our qualifications are accepted in other countries, has he made sure that all these regulations in draft and when finalised are communicated to the relevant professional bodies here?

Further, at the time, I can assure the Minister, the late Mrs. Barnes had correspondence from people who were prepared to come forward to prove her son's innocence.

    <P>It is necessary with this type of legislation to draft the Bill mainly by way of amendments to existing Acts. The explanatory memorandum which was issued with the Bill has, therefore, been made as informative as possible and I trust the Deputies will find it helpful in interpreting the various amendments.  The Budget increases in the field of social assistance will give an extra 10/- a week to all existing non-contributory old age, blind, widow and orphan pensioners making the maximum personal rate of old age and blind pension £3 15s a week and the maximum personal rate of widow's pension £3 13s 6d a week.  The increases in the personal rates of pension will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case to give additional rates at the bottom of the scales which will be payable to persons whose means are outside the present limits for pension.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistsid <Col N="671" /> ance for persons in urban and rural areas are also being increased by 10s a week for the recipient and by a further 10s where there is an adult dependant. The maximum rate will then be £3 1s 6d for a single person and £5 17s 6d for a married couple resident in an urban area; outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £2 15s for a single person and £5 9s 6d for a married couple.  These increases of unemployment assistance at the maximum will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The rate of children's allowance for the second qualified child in each family will be increased from 15s 6d to £1 10s a month and the rate for the third and subsequent qualified children from £1 6s 6d to £2 a month.  The rate for the first qualified child will remain unchanged at 10s a month.  As the Minister for Finance announced in the Budget Statement, adjustments of the tax free allowances under the income tax code in respect of the second and subsequent children in families will, to some extent, offset the increase in rates of children's allowances for the children in families which are liable for income tax.  However, the larger families not so liable will gain substantially from the increases in children's allowances &mdash;a four child family will get £6 a month as against £3 18s 6d at present and a six child family will get £10 as against £6 11s 6d at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new grant of £100 to be payable on a multiple birth of three children and £150 on a multiple birth of more than three children.  This will be in addition to any monthly children's allowance which the family may receive in respect of those children, the rate of which in any such case is double the normal rate.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions will come into operation at the beginning of January next and will provide an extra 10s a week for recipients of old age (contributory) pension, widows' (contributory) pension, orphans' (contributory) allowance, disability benefit, <Col N="672" /> unemployment benefit and maternity allowance.  There will also be an additional 10s a week for an adult dependant.  A single old age (contributory) pensioner will get £4 2s 6d a week and a married couple £7 12s 6d while a widow without children will get £3 15s a week.  The personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit will then be £3 15s a week for a single person and £6 17s 6d for a married couple.  Certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable where unemployment continues after 156 days are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas.  As assistance rates are being increased from the beginning of August next, these particular rates of unemployment benefit are also being increased from then.</P>
    <P>To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefits and pensions, an increase in the social insurance contributions payable by employers and employees is necessary. The increase proposed in the rates of social insurance contributions, where all insurance benefits are covered, is 3s 9d a week, with lesser increases where only some of the benefits are covered.  The increase of 3s 9d in the ordinary rate of men's contribution will be shared by the employer paying 1s 11d and employee 1s 10d and the total contribution will then be 25s 1d a week.  Consequent on the increases and improvements in the social insurance system generally being provided in the Bill, it is proposed to deal similarly with the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases proposed are 10s in the rates of the main weekly paid benefits and allowances with proportionate increases in other payments. These changes will not involve any charge on the Exchequer as all benefits under the scheme are met out of the occupational injuries fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only.  An increase of 1d in these contributions will be necessary to meet the cost of the increases.</P>
    <P>The overall weekly employment contribution payable in respect of men in ordinary industrial or commercial employment will, from January, 1970, be 28s 3d made up of 25s 1d in respect of <Col N="673" /> social insurance, 2s 2d in respect of occupational injuries insurance and 1s in respect of redundancy payments.  Of this, the employer will pay 15s 5d and the employee 12s 10d.  In the case of women in such employment, the overall weekly contribution will be 26s made up of 23s 8d for social insurance, 1s 7d for occupational injuries insurance and 9d for redundancy.  Of this the employer will pay 14s 4d, the employee 11s 8d.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate of voluntary contribution covering widows' and orphans' pensions only will be 8d making it 5s 3d and the increase in the contribution which covers also old age (contributory) pension will be 1s 6d, making it 10s 10d.  A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Last year, a new benefit for incapacitated old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, and for contributory widow pensioners aged 70 and over was introduced.  The benefit originally consisted of an increase of pension of £2 5s a week in respect of a prescribed female relative where the pensioner is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and is living alone or has no other adult living with him capable of looking after him.  It is proposed in the Bill to modify the scheme as from the beginning of January, 1970, so as to remove the requirement that the prescribed female relative must have given up insurable employment.  The Bill also provides power for the general conditions of the scheme to be laid down in regulations.  This will supplement the powers already in the scheme to prescribe the female relatives who qualify and the regulations which I intend to make will enable the increase of pension to be paid even where the daughter or step-daughter never left home.  The rate of payment is also being increased to £2 15s a week under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another change affecting both social insurance and social assistance schemes is designed to assist widows and those having care of orphans in the education of the children.  This involves the raising to 21 years of the age limit for orphans' pensions and for qualification <Col N="674" /> for the increases of widows' pensions in respect of children, where the child continues in full-time education.  The present age limit is 16 in the case of orphans' pensions, widows' pensions and old age pensions under both the contributory and the non-contributory codes.  In the occupational injuries scheme, where the new age limit will also apply in the case of orphans and the children of widows and widowers, the present age limit is 18.  Up to 1966 a person receiving old age (contributory) pension or widow's (contributory) pension was disqualified for receiving the corresponding non-contributory pension.  In that year statutory provision was made to enable the contributory pensioners mentioned to opt for the appropriate non-contributory pension, if they satisfied the conditions for its receipt and it would be of advantage to them to do so.  The necessity for this arose because, as a result of increases in non-contributory pensions, some of the higher rates of these pensions exceeded some of the lower rates of contributory pensions. From August next when non-contributory pensions are increased until January next when contributory pensions are increased, cases will arise where the non-contributory pension would be temporarily more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension. It was never the intention that the provisions of the 1966 Act should operate in such circumstances and the Departmental machinery is not geared for short-term switching from one pension to the other and back again.  There is a provision in the Bill, therefore, to prevent such switching where the advantage would be a temporary one only.  The right of a pensioner to switch where the advantage would be permanent will not, however, be affected.</P>
    <P>A non-contributory old age pensioner who is detained in a mental hospital cannot at present get more than £1 of his pension as pocket money and then only if the hospital authorities think he is capable of using money. There is provision in the Bill to remove this limit of £1.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any greater detail at this stage as I feel sure that the explanatory memorandum will have given Deputies a good picture of <Col N="675" /> the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It might, however, be helpful to Deputies if I were to summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side there is £3,071,000 for old age and blind pensions, £507,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, £1,280,000 for unemployment assistance, and £5,278,000 for children's allowances, the total cost being £10.136 million in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer. There will, of course, be a recovery of some £400,000 of this by way of adjustments in the income tax code in respect of children.  The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £6,969,000.  Allowing for an increased annual income of £5,255,000 to be raised from the increases in rates of contributions, the cost to be met by the Exchequer will be £1,714,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending the Bill to Dáil Éireann and I ask for speedy and favourable consideration of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a most inadequate measure.  If its purpose is designed to improve the standard of living of the less fortunate members of our community and to put them on a level consistent with 1969 costs and living standards this is yet another attempt to add a few more patches to the social welfare patchwork quilt which is threadbare in many parts, which lets in the cold and certainly does not keep out the rains of misfortune which afflict many people in our community. A fair indication of the gross failure of our State welfare schemes is the fact that nearly £2½ million yearly are voluntarily subscribed by people out of the goodness of their hearts for distribution through voluntary agencies to poor people in this country.  Another fair test is the fact that in urban areas nearly 1,750,000 free meals a year&mdash;<Col N="676" /> sometimes what are called the penny dinners, when the penny or twopence charged is available&mdash;have had to be distributed.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to say that if the State welfare schemes were sufficient to maintain proper standards it would not be necessary to distribute so much to supplement the State scheme to maintain the mere existence of life.  We think it is unfortunate that the Government's approach to social welfare should be spelt out in the <i>Third Programme: Economic and Social Development</i> which was published in March of this year, in a way which indicates their anxiety to rely yet again, and forever more, on charitable organisations.  The Government stated in that Programme:</P>
    <P>The Government have no desire to encroach on private efforts, including those of voluntary societies, but rather welcome the contribution which these activities make to social welfare.</P>
    <P>This may be a fair statement of Government policy, but it is one which we in Fine Gael repudiate for what it suggests. We consider it entirely wrong that the State should be trying to wash its hands of the responsibility which lies on it as the controller of our society to so distribute the income and wealth of this community that nobody need suffer in the way in which thousands of our people are obliged to suffer at the present time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is certainly not the implementation of any social philosophy because the Government have shown themselves to be devoid of any social philosophy, of any social conscience. This Bill, like most other welfare Bills brought before this House by Fianna Fáil, is simply an exercise in vote catching.  It is something done for the purpose of trying to persuade the people that a benevolent Government are giving something out of the Government's benevolence.  The social welfare code of any country should be a conscious and deliberate reorganisation by society itself of its own resources so that nobody suffers unnecessarily, so that the many inequalities which mankind is called on to suffer under, imposed by nature <Col N="677" /> or by man, are reduced as far as it is feasible to reduce them.</P>
    <P>The social welfare code of Ireland is, to say the least of it, a disappointment to anybody who considers what is the function of a social welfare code and what ought to be the considered primary obligation of any Government to achieve.  The outgoing Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Joe Brennan, when he was talking on the Budget, said the increases promised in the Budget, and now proposed in this Bill, were a performance by Fianna Fáil in one day of what the Fine Gael Party promised to do over five years.  He spoke after me, so it did not fall to me then to indicate just how wrong he was.</P>
    <P>Such increases as were given this year, which are a little more than has been the custom of Fianna Fáil to give, would certainly not have been given if it were not for the most detailed statement of welfare policy ever published by any party in this country which Fine Gael made on the 16th January last. But what is given in this welfare Bill is only one-sixth what we in Fine Gael hoped we would get an opportunity to do during our first four years of Government from 1969 to 1973.  Even the Government's own figures, as announced in the Third Programme, show that the Government's target for that four year period is £30 million less for welfare expenditure than the figures which were offered by Fine Gael.  When we offered our figures here we were told we were proposing something which was impossible, something which could not be achieved, something which in the Taoiseach's own words was &ldquo;pie in the sky.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite this, within a matter of months the Government which denounced the Fine Gael proposals as unworkable proceeded to perform in the way which Fine Gael said was feasible.  Therefore, if proof was required of the feasibility of the Fine Gael programme, this is it.  The increases which are given here have been achieved, and are possible of performance, without a collapse of the whole economic, financial and social system, such as we were promised if Fine Gael ever got the chance of doing what so <Col N="678" /> badly needs to be done that is, to make up for the last 12 years of neglect in social welfare matters.  I know in his reply the Minister will probably once again indicate marginal, notional or nominal increases in welfare payments, indicating that the increases which have taken place in both the assistance and insurance schemes are greater than the increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We do not regard the cost of living index as a fair test by which to judge standards of social welfare which applied in 1957 and should apply in 1969.  The gap between the level of income of the welfare classes and the standard of living of the rest of the community has widened drastically.  In any country which allows the widening of the gap between welfare payments and the standard of living social injustices will grow.  That is what has happened in our case and it is something we will have to take radical steps to overcome.</P>
    <P>There are many points in the Bill which one would like to discuss in some detail but they are probably matters for Committee Stage.  However, there are some important issues which I think we should discuss on this Stage. It is now four years since the £1,200 a year limit was fixed for insurable employment and in the meantime there have been several increases in wage levels.  If £1,200 a year was the proper figure to adopt in 1965 and if there is to be a limit, quite clearly that should be substantially increased in 1969.  We are very disappointed the Minister did not take the opportunity in this Bill to increase the ceiling from £1,200 to at least £1,400.</P>
    <P>So far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, we do not believe in having any ceiling on the level of insurable employment.  We believe as a larger percentage of our people are moving out of the self-employed to the employed category, as the State and public authorities are getting more and more information about individual people's incomes, as people are becoming more and more reliant on public authority in several ways for benefits and income, it is possible to have insurance for everybody.</P>
    <P>The Government stated in their programme <Col N="679" /> for development that they were going to consider the remuneration limit for compulsory insurance for non-manual workers.  We think it is stupid to retain in 1969 a figure which was considered adequate in 1965.  We believe that the simple method of bringing about a temporary improvement by, if you like, an arbitrary increase to £1,400 should have been adopted in this Bill.  The Department of Social Welfare ought to be capable of devising ways and means of doing away with any limit whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We are also disappointed that the opportunity has not been availed of in this Bill to introduce wage-related payments and benefits.  Why is it that in this, as in many other aspects of welfare, Ireland must be the last in Europe to do the right thing?  Why is it that we must drag behind everybody else? Why is it that, particularly in relation to welfare, we will do nothing until it has first been tried out in Great Britain?  What was the purpose of achieving our independence?  What is the purpose of having our own separate Government and institutions of State here unless we are prepared to study our own needs and answer our own needs according to our own means, without having to wait for Mother England to show us her example?  If we do, in relation to many welfare matters, we shall, like England, be behind all the rest of the progressive democracies.  But even England has found herself, in recent times, forced away from the totally wrong basis for insurance payments and benefits, a basis which is related to what the lowest income-earner can afford to pay and a basis which determines what an unemployed person will get when he is unemployed by what the lowest income-earner is able to contribute while he is working.</P>
    <P>We should have wage-related benefits and payments.  There is no difficulty whatsoever in doing this other than the reluctance of the Department of Social Welfare to change.  For years past, it has been no more than a begrudging paying agency for the Department of Finance, concerned only with giving as little as it can to as few people as it can get away with giving anything to. <Col N="680" /> Unfortunately, when the present Minister was in the Department of Social Welfare before, the Department showed little anxiety to get away from that appalling practice and image that it has.  I am sorry to say that, from the nature of this Bill, we apparently cannot look forward to receiving anything better.</P>
    <P>Between 1957 and 1968 the amount paid by way of social welfare doubled but that is nothing extraordinary and is nothing of which a government can be proud at a time when incomes of other people in the community were increased by a greater multiple than two. It is certainly not something which is particularly to the credit of the Government when you realise that the amount which employers and employees were obliged to pay during the same period for welfare benefits quadrupled.  This indicates that what has been happening here is that the State has been reducing its contribution.  The State has been slipping away from its obligation to assist the less well-off members of the community and has been turning the full responsibility over to the workers and employers.  This is a wrong trend. What is particularly erroneous is that, while this is taking place, employees are required in Ireland to pay a much greater share of the cost than they are asked to pay in any other European country.  We ought to be capable and I believe we are capable of determining our own social welfare standards and of working out our own practices and that is what we should be doing without looking over anybody else's shoulder to see what is being done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For several years past, in the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare, the Government have strongly criticised us on the Fine Gael benches when we pointed out that there would be a need for radical change in the social welfare code if Ireland ever became a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>We were told that we were arguing from figures which were not comparable with those which operated in other countries.  Mind you, to the extent that figures in other countries include many people who were injured in the last <Col N="681" /> war, it was a fair criticism but that was a criticism not against our figures but rather something in the nature of a condemnation of the Government themselves here.  The Government's <i>Third Programme: Economic and Social Development</i> does, as it so often does, acknowledge the veracity of what Fine Gael were saying.  It states that there will be a need for a re-assessment of our whole social welfare code in the event of our becoming a member of the EEC.  The interesting thing is that, in Paragraph 52 under the Welfare chapter, the Government state that the assistant services do not call for fundamental re-examination of policy but involve serious financial and budgetary implications in view of the costs involved.  But they state that, in their view, they do not call for fundamental re-examination of policy.  Yet, two pages later, we find that a re-examination of our general standards will be required if we join the EEC.</P>
    <P>Mind you, I am not one of the people who are enthusiastic about our membership of the EEC.  I believe it will bring far more problems than benefits, even though membership of it may be unavoidable in the event of our largest customer going in there.  At least, however, it will confer one great benefit on our people.  The government of the day, reluctant though they may be, will be obliged substantially to improve the welfare code because there is a clear obligation under the Treaty of Rome&mdash; which the Government have until now refused to accept or recognise as existing but presumably they do recognise it now that the Third Programme is published &mdash; to maintain in all member nations of the EEC similar social standards so that, in all countries, all employees are paying a similar amount towards welfare services, so that in all countries the costs of welfare services are similar and so that no country can succeed in the economic or financial race by avoiding its social responsibilities. This then, perhaps, is one of the benefits we can look forward to.</P>
    <P>One can only hope now that the question of membership of the EEC is being reactivated, that the Department of Social Welfare will jump into the second half of the twentieth century. <Col N="682" /> This will be a novel experience for it.  I can appreciate that it will probably cause a shudder.  However, that they will have to do, if we are not to find ourselves in serious difficulties which could certainly cause trouble in the course of negotiation and which might mean that we would be left outside when other countries would go into the EEC because our welfare services were not up to the standard required.</P>
    <P>We are glad the Bill will provide for payment of non-contributory pensions in respect of orphans and qualified children of widows who are undergoing full-time education between 16 and 21 years of age.  This is something we in Fine Gael have advocated for a long time.  It is something which is certainly no more than common justice. Goodness knows the amounts which will be paid are grossly inadequate but it was certainly wrong, inadequate and all as they were, to take them from the widow who was trying to educate her boy or girl after 15 years of age.  We are glad that this very necessary reform is now to be implemented as from 1st August.  Similarly, we are glad about the suggestions we had been making for some time, namely that the payments to daughters or to step-daughters looking after pensioners should not be dependent upon a person giving up insurable employment.  This is a recognition of what most of us know, that where daughters or others look after elderly people they frequently do so for so long that insurable employment does not arise in relation to them.</P>
    <P>May I mention here, Sir, a problem which is arising in this modern age where people are tending to marry, particularly in urban areas, at a much earlier age, at an age which in many cases means that one or other of the parties to the marriage does not have 156 insurance contributions at the time they get married.  One result of this in a couple of cases which have come to my notice, is that the bride did not get a marriage allowance.  Perhaps, the Department will shudder at the idea of paying a marriage allowance to somebody who has not got the full 156 contributions but I feel that we must allow our welfare code to move with the <Col N="683" /> times and if girls are now getting married in their teens and without having three years of insurable employment behind them the State ought to recognise this and give the marriage allowance, which is probably needed more by such young people than by people who might have been in insurable employment for a longer period.</P>
    <P>Another rather tragic instance has also come to my notice where a young husband was killed in a traffic accident. Both he and his bride were in their teens.  She did not have, and he did not have 156 insurance contributions. Although the young widow now has a child she does not qualify for the contributory widow's pension nor does the child qualify for the contributory orphan's pension.  As she is relatively handy at needlework and dressmaking she is not getting any income whatsoever from the State.  This is something the Minister should look at and if he is not prepared to give the full maternity grant or the full widow's pension in such cases at least justice would be done if such people were paid benefit related to the number of contributions which they had made.  The number of cases, I suppose, would be very few and on that account this would not impose greatly upon the resources of the State.  As in all cases where injustice is done or where hardship is suffered, we should be prepared to suffer whatever little inconvenience or cost may be involved.  The cost, spread over the remainder of the community, would be absolutely negligible.</P>
    <P>The Bill helps to emphasise also that the benefits are not benefits coming from a generous Government giving them out of their own resources.  The Finance Bill reminds people that the taxation which is necessary to improve the maintenance of income for less well-off people can only be paid for by the remainder of the community.  I do not think that is wrong or something that the remainder of our community are unwilling to accept.  I believe our people are prepared to accept the burden of looking after the less well-off and in any modern society in which the citizens appreciate the obligations that they have to one another people are <Col N="684" /> only too glad to do this as long as they are given the necessary lead by the Government.  I feel the tragedy in this country is that the Government are behind the people.  Instead of leading the people as they ought to be in welfare matters the Government are dragging their feet.  The people are quite willing to do more but the Government are reluctant to harness the willingness of the people.</P>
    <P>This Bill emphasises the fact that not only are we dependent on the taxpayer to pay benefits but we are also dependent on the workers and the employers. The increase in the insurance stamp will be 3s 11d a week, 3s 9d in respect of unemployment and disability benefit and twopence a week in respect of occupational injuries.  I am quite interested to note that as little as a penny a week in respect of occupational injuries from employee and from employer will yield an increase of 10s in the benefits paid under the occupational injuries code.  Yet it takes a great deal more apparently to offer similar increases under the other insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the inability or unwillingness of the Department of Social Welfare to remedy what is surely a glaring injustice which is tending to arise year after year under which the non-contributory pensioners receive their increases on the 1st August and those who are paying for the benefits must wait until the 1st of the following January before getting any increase at all.  The irony of this is surely underwritten in statutory form when the Minister has to come along in this year, as in other years, and ask us to approve of a section in the Bill which denies to contributory pensioners higher pensions which would be their entitlement if they abandoned the contributory pension and took the non-contributory pension instead.  It ought to be possible to work out a system under which the contributory pensioners would not have to suffer that yearly disadvantage. When there is a will there is a way.  The tragedy is that there appears to be little will in the Department of Social Welfare for change, little anxiety on the part of Ministers for Social Welfare to develop a modern welfare system <Col N="685" /> which would be concerned with the welfare of the people who are supposed to be helped rather than the convenience of the vast bureaucratic machine.</P>
    <P>For very many years social welfare has been among the last of the Government's priorities.  We were promised five years ago a programme for social reform comparable with the programmes for economic reform which had previously been announced.  What did we receive when the long awaited programme was announced?  Nothing, save promises for the consideration of this, that and the other thing.  Perhaps, the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare indicates that this examination will now receive earnest attention.  If that is so, we welcome the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary.  So far as Deputy John Geoghegan is concerned we wish him every success and happiness in his appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What we need to do is to develop a comprehensive welfare code, to have a family welfare fund, so that in no case is the income of any individual cut simply because of the number of people in a family, so that we will have a comprehensive national insurance system, so that so far as modern techniques permit and the ingenuity of man can remedy, nobody will suffer unnecessarily the inequalities and hardships which without organisation will be the lot of men, but organisation can improve these things.  The will to do so can improve them.  If man can get to the moon in 1969 it is not asking too much of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to stretch a little to give our poor people a little of the wealth which is around us and is not being fairly distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Geoghegan on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary. This is an important appointment <Col N="686" /> because, as I know it, the Department of Social Welfare is the most inefficient Department in the Government. Many people must avail of its services and, as Deputies, we are all aware of the complaints against the Department which is oriented towards obstructing people and preventing them from claiming what are justly their rights. The Department have adopted a negative approach to everything.  They are not positive or helpful and do everything to obstruct people attempting to claim benefits.  More than any other Department this Department must be indicted for obstructing claims.  That is why it is important to have a Parliamentary Secretary who will examine the problem and see what measures must be taken to gear the Department to meet the demands of modern times.</P>
      <P>I say this in passing.  I hope that even the telephone service in the Department will be improved because the Minister himself must know how bad it is.  People constantly have to telephone about social welfare cheques which they do not receive on time. These are sometimes four or five weeks late.  It is not as if we were dealing with other people; we are dealing with those who are ill or incapacitated and who need the money very badly.  They are deprived of it.  Because of this I should like to see this Department, more than any other, streamlined to meet demands and able to cater immediately for all the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>The Government cannot boast of the fact that they are paying out tremendous amounts of money in social welfare benefits.  I maintain that we have the lowest level of social welfare services in western Europe.  A glance at the figures for the Common Market countries will show how bad we are in providing social welfare benefits. Our children's allowances are absolutely disgraceful when compared with countries like Belgium, Holland or other Common Market countries.  I do not think the Taoiseach can honestly say that our social welfare services are equal to those of any Common Market country.  The fact is that they are not; they are very much inferior to those of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that the Minister <Col N="687" /> would have taken this opportunity to remedy the flaws and anomalies in the present Social Welfare Act.  These flaws have been there and apparent for a number of years.  They were brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare on numerous occasions.  He had the opportunity to bring in amendments to remedy these defects.</P>
    <P>I shall mention one or two and I refer first to the widows' contributory pensions.  This is a burning question with the widows concerned.  First, they receive a contributory pension as a result of contributions made by their husbands whose stamps provided for it but when the widows go to work to provide for their families they pay full insurance contribution and receive only half the benefits if they are ill or incapacitated.  This is a glaring injustice and should have been remedied in this amendment of the Social Welfare Act.  It is more important than anything else that widows who pay full social welfare contributions by virtue of the fact that they have the widows' contributory pension do not receive full social welfare benefits when ill. The Minister should make every effort to amend the existing Act and remedy this injustice.</P>
    <P>There is another flaw in the Act.  It concerns employers who are expected to stamp employees' cards.  The employee trusts the employer to ensure that the card is stamped each week but has no way of knowing whether the employer stamps the card or not.  The money for his contribution is taken from his pay packet and he trusts his employer.  Like other Deputies, I have seen many cases in the past few years of companies going into liquidation without cards being stamped.  The employee is deprived of unemployment benefit and his wife loses maternity and holiday benefits and so on.  This is a grave injustice to employees.  The Minister leaves the onus on the employee to take action against the employer. This may take months or even years.  I have a case which is proceeding for three years and the man concerned has had no satisfaction yet.  He must take his employer to court, engage a solicitor and pay full expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> I know that the Department may act against an employer but only after the employee has failed to do so or has not succeeded in winning the case. Only then will the Department Act. The obligation should not be on the employee.  The Department have an obligation to see that the employer stamps the cards and these cards should be submitted more frequently.  Where an employer fails to stamp the cards the onus should be on the Department to take action.  The employee should be relieved of all obligation in the matter and should be given full benefit because he has paid his contribution towards stamping that card.  This is one amendment I should have liked to see included in this Bill.  These flaws have been evident for a number of years and should have been remedied.</P>
    <P>I should have thought something imaginative would come from the Department such as an arrangement whereby employees would contribute towards the stamp according to wage or salary.  Here we see the employee's contribution goes closer and closer to that of the employer, whether the wage is £10 or £20 per week.  There is need for graded contributions by employees. There are only a few shillings in the difference between what the employer pays and the employee pays.  This is very wrong.  Employees should not have to pay so much.  We shall have to fall in line with the Common Market countries in providing for contributions graded according to salary or wage.</P>
    <P>The present injustices in relation to the non-contributory and contributory pensions are shown up very glaringly in this Bill.  The contributory pensioners do not receive the increase until January, 1970, and the non-contributory pensioners received it in August.  I do not think it would have cost much more money to provide both increases at the same time.  In many cases the non-contributory pension exceeds the contributory pension and because of that people have opted for the non-contributory pension for a few months to get the few extra shillings. There is provision in this Bill to prevent that happening in case they might get a few extra shillings.  It <Col N="689" /> should be pointed out very clearly here that there is a need to synchronise the benefits and have them both payable at the same time.  You cannot blame people for looking for a non-contributory pension for a few months when it is more than the contributory one. The Minister is taking steps to see that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with a daughter or a step-daughter who is giving full time care and attention to an incapacitated old age pensioner.  I know many cases where sons have to provide that service and I would have thought that we might have included them in this provision so that they could benefit from it.  It is not unknown for sons to have to provide this service for their aged parents.  I should like to see this altered accordingly.</P>
    <P>Just yesterday I heard the Minister for Finance say he had asked the Revenue Commissioners to be flexible in their assessment of the work of artists and writers.  The Minister should say the same to the Department of Social Welfare about cases which come up for assessment.  I came across a case recently of a widow who was homeless.  She had a non-contributory pension.  She sought a job as a caretaker at £1 a week and a free room. An inspector from the Department of Social Welfare called and looked into her case.  He said that with £1 a week she had £52 a year, and he assessed the room which was provided free, at 1/a week or £2 12s a year and, because of that, her pension was reduced by 17s per week.  This meant she was working for 3s per week and out of that she was paying for her stamp. This is the kind of rigidity there is in the Department.  I approached the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brennan, about this and he said there was nothing he could do about it, that the regulations were there.  I should like to see a little more flexibility in the application of these regulations.  As I said before, the Department should be trying to help people to obtain what is due to them and not be trying to obstruct them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see provision in this Bill for an allowance to be paid to a relative of a pensioner who is incapacitated when the relative was not previously <Col N="690" /> employed.  There are many cases in this country where daughters have given up their time and given up their lives to looking after their parents.  They never worked and, because of that, they failed to benefit under this scheme.  I am glad to see that from January next the Minister proposes to remove the requirement that the relative must have given up insurable employment.  I saw a case recently of an old age pensioner who had £3 5s a week and her daughter was living with her.  They were both living on a total income of £3 5s a week.  Due to the regulation the daughter was deprived of this allowance. Malnutrition was so evident that this woman went into hospital every eight or nine weeks for a transfusion at a large cost to the State when it could have been provided in proper social welfare benefit.  It is time we had this provision included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to children's allowances, I think it might be wrong to assess the allowance on the fourth child and to consider just the first child when the other children have ceased to qualify.  There have been a considerable number of complaints about this matter and I am wondering why the Department are so rigid about it.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this problem.  I should like to have seen provision in this Bill for an extension of the payment of children's allowances when the children continue in full-time education.  I would ask the Minister to consider this in relation to some of the amendments he proposes to bring in.  I am sorry it was not provided already in the present amendment?</P>
    <P>Our attitude to social welfare is wrong.  I do not think we should say we cannot afford to provide proper social welfare services for our aged and disabled people.  I do not think it is enough to say we cannot afford it. I do not think it is good enough to see people suffering from malnutrition because of the petty amounts we give them and then to argue that we cannot afford more.  We should consider first the need and make sure that we provide for it.  We can provide for less essential projects and programmes.  It is up to us to bring into this House a <Col N="691" /> Bill which will provide proper social services for the people who need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole approach to this problem of providing for the under-privileged seems to me to be one which is still dominated by completely archaic notions and ideas.  It is about time that we changed our whole attitude to it.  I asked a question earlier today about the likelihood of an old person being able to get by on £3 10s or £3 15s or whatever it is the Minister chooses to give.  The Minister replied and was apparently satisfied that it is possible to live on as little as £3 15s a week with the present cost of living in Ireland.  I doubt if anyone would agree with him particularly if they have to try to live on that amount themselves.</P>
      <P>During the years it increased by small amounts, eventually to reach the astronomical sum of £3 10s per week, but any increases were simply moneys paid to relate in some way to the increases in the cost of living because of the failure of successive Governments to institute any serious form of price control.  Only by a proper system of price control can we ensure that whatever money is paid to people is worth receiving.</P>
      <P>The general trend from direct taxation to the insurance principle, mentioned by several speakers, has been an interesting evolution in the whole fiscal policy of successive Governments in recent years.  It was particularly notable in the earlier radical days of Fianna Fáil when the policy was to try to get serious redistribution of the community's wealth by putting the emphasis on getting money for services such as education, health, social welfare, from direct taxation.  Under the direct taxation system the wealthier people paid the most and consequently they carried the greater burden.  In the view of the Labour Party it is quite right that they should carry the greatest financial burden for the provision of services for the less well-off among us, but that policy is now being departed from in very many aspects of our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Ryan in one breath saying that this insurance <Col N="692" /> principle is being depended on more and more and in the next proposing, as they do in Fine Gael, that the health scheme shall be based on the insurance principle.  This is merely another way of ensuring that money is being provided by the salaried white-collar worker and the wage earner and allowing the wealthier class to escape what I consider their just commitment in a community such as ours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned yesterday that in Ireland as much as 60 per cent of taxation comes in the form of indirect taxes.  I understand this is the highest in Europe and is simply a process whereby the not so wealthy pay for the very poor and the wealthy get away fairly scot free.  The practice of taking first of all the employee's contribution to the scheme is obviously making sure that he will pay for anything he will get.  One of the other illusions is that there is such a thing as the employer's contribution.  Of course, this is not so because what the employer does is that he simply takes part of the price of the goods he is producing for sale, be it ¾d, ¼d, ½d or any other amount, and he uses that increase in price in order to retrieve what is euphemistically called the employer's contribution.  This is seen in microcosm in the well-known Guinness welfare system, in which the Guinness family lay on various benevolent schemes, pensions and so on, at the expense of the pint drinker&mdash;the consumer. The Guinness family get wealthier and wealthier and get great credit for having provided these services which, in fact, are paid for by the consumer.  This is the practice we have now adopted in the community in order to leave the wealthy minority untouched for taxation purposes; we have adopted the extensive use of this so-called insurance principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer's contribution is paid by him but it is passed on to the employee who pays it by way of direct taxation, if he is in the taxable groove, which most of us are nowadays.  He pays further indirect taxes in the form of wholesale and retail taxes, and he pays rates.  There are five or six different ways in which a person gets what are frequently miscalled hand-outs from the State.  He pays for these services which considerably reduces the burden of serious direct taxation on the very wealthy class.</P>
      <P>The proposal for extension of this into the health services is simply an extension of the general principle. Those of us who believe in the socialist approach are convinced that where there is a general acceptance of the principle of public ownership, these services will be paid for by the wealth which is created from the services.  The person is paid directly in wages and, indirectly, services are provided, the profits from which go to a small minority so that the total product of a person's work goes directly in wages and indirectly in the form of social services. One of the catchcries directed against socialists is their disregard for private wealth.  We believe private wealth should be distributed in the form of social services&mdash;education, health, care of old people and so on. Yet every Minister for Finance and Minister for Social Welfare who asks for money for such services has no compunction in telling all of us that he will take part of the money we earn in the form of taxation and redistribute it to provide those services.</P>
      <P>If we said we should like to take £40 million or £50 million which the Guinness family own and distribute it in the form of old age pensions, disabled pensions, help for the blind, for education and so on, we would immediately be accused of being communists. We would simply be doing something on a big scale which the Governments do continuously on a small scale, and inadequately on a small scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting thing about this <Col N="694" /> whole concept of the welfare society is that it has not led to any serious redistribution of the real wealth of the community, particularly in Great Britain where, since the introduction of the welfare society the total wealth held by a minority&mdash;I think it is a 7 per cent minority who hold about 74 per cent of the wealth&mdash;has increased by something like £113,000 million in spite of the so-called redistribution of wealth which has taken place under the welfare state.  Therefore, all the Minister is doing is a sort of an accountancy juggling job in which he transfers money from the pockets of the relatively lower income group into the pockets of the very lowest income groups.</P>
    <P>The care of the old people here is particularly scandalous.  I have protested against it for many years.  I have stated on many occasions, and I am prepared to restate it, that I believe our old people die of hunger on the £3 15s or whatever it is they receive per week.  I am quite certain that if a serious scientific investigation was carried out on the nutritional needs and the state of malnutrition of the majority of old people living at home, particularly living alone, it would be found that they are suffering from severe malnutrition. I base this primarily on my own experience of seeing them and primarily on my own experience of knowing what you can buy for £3 15s a week, and also on papers published by doctors in England who showed that old people living in the London area on the allowance paid there, where it is much higher than here and where many of the prices of essential commodities are lower than here, suffered moderately severe or severe malnutrition. We are failing in our duty if we refuse to examine the serious consequences of handling to these unfortunate people this money once a week and then forgetting about them for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>My approach to this whole problem of the care of the old is not at all to suggest to the Minister doubling or trebling their old age pensions.  I do not think that is the answer.  If he could try to arrange an extension of domiciliary care services for old people, he <Col N="695" /> would do very much more for them than he does by giving them an increase of five shillings or ten shillings a week from time to time.  There are many different kinds of services required in their homes by old people, particularly those living alone, and by disabled or blind people.</P>
    <P>Recently we carried out an investigation into this problem and sought information all over the world about the care of old people.  It transpired that the best geriatric services in the world were in Nottingham, England, and they are run by a man called Doctor Macmillan. At the wish of an old person the local authority are able to lay on 29 different services, medical and nursing care, domestic help, help with allowances, social assistance of one kind or another, chiropody, people running messages, social visiting, clubs, all the different requirements of old people in the community.  We have a tiny microfilm of it in Kilkenny where Most Rev.  Doctor Birch attempts to deal with such problems.  It is probably the nearest we will get to it in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My approach to the care of the old would be on those lines rather than helping them to meet the cost of living by increasing the weekly allowance. I suppose it would take at least £9 to £10 to cover the cost of rent, clothing, sickness.  Some of them, in spite of the statement of the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, the other day are not beneficiaries under the medical card system, so obviously the food, rent, medical services, recreational needs and other small comforts they may require are not met at all out of the £3 15s. I do not know what the appropriate figure would be for the provision of proper health services for these people.</P>
    <P>Some old people are put into mental hospitals as if they were psychiatric cases which in many cases they are not at all; they are simply social problems. One could be harsh about it and say the relatives are just dumping them there and being unkind about them, but I do not think that is completely true.  If the Minister's Department would look into this whole process of helping not only the people who want to stay out of institutions but the <Col N="696" /> people who want them to stay out, sons, daughters, and other relatives, they would find they would get much more help from the community in keeping these old people out of places like mental hospitals where the cost of keeping a patient is £9 to £10 a week. Therefore, at a rather low level of our services it still costs that amount of money to keep an old person in such an institution.  It is probably the lowest figure at which you could keep an old person even in his home, which would make a good case for the suggestion that the £3 15s paid is grossly inadequate.</P>
    <P>Consistently over the years when questions have been asked in relation to substantial increases in old age pensions one has had the recitation of the total cost.  Every Minister for Social Welfare I ever had anything to do with had plonked down in his seat having given me some astronomical figure as to what it would cost, another £10 million in taxation.  Successive Ministers seem to feel they have discharged their responsibility to the community when they say it would be much too costly and it could not be done.  One gets the same answer from the Departments of Education, Health, and other social Departments.  It seems to me that they are indicting the whole economic system in which they believe in claiming we cannot afford to educate our young people, we cannot afford to look after the disabled or the blind or to care for old people, to house people and so on.</P>
    <P>It is this plea of poverty, if we are to take it seriously as the unanswerable case, that converts most of us into profound socialists.  Certainly it has done so in my case.  It has confirmed me in an unchangeable belief in the whole socialist concept for the organisation of society.  The Government are, of course, correct when they say, as the Minister says: &ldquo;That is all we can pay.  We cannot give any more.&rdquo;  They are completely factual.  It is not the purpose of private enterprise capitalism to provide proper care for the old, the disabled or the blind.  That is not the function of private enterprise capitalism.  Its function is to create wealth and it does that.  How <Col N="697" /> successive Ministers can continue to adhere to this sort of pseudo-socialist philosophy which creates a situation in which the old must go hungry and neglected, suffering from malnutrition, or end their days, quite unnecessarily, in mental hospitals is something that I personally cannot understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of Minister for Social Welfare is one of the most important in the Government.  The Minister carries on his shoulders the onerous responsibility of looking after the interests of those who are unable to look after themselves.  All of us have the duty of looking after those who cared for us when we were too young to care for ourselves.  The responsibility of looking after the old is a grave responsibility.  It is one we must not shirk.  Would anyone here argue that we are at the moment providing the underprivileged in our community with the comforts they deserve? Are we even providing them with the essentials of life?  This Bill is a good Bill as far as it goes.  My grievance is that it does not go far enough.  The provisions are inadequate, very inadequate. If we fail in our duties and responsibilities towards the aged and the incapacitated future generations will look at us with coldly critical eyes because of that failure.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides an increase of 10s for old age pensioners, bringing the total pension to £3 10s.  I believe that is wholly inadequate.  I have had experience of working in Dublin, in the west and in the Midlands and I have met a broad cross-section of our society.  I have met people eking out an existence on the pensions we provide. They are living below the bread-line, not on it.  The extraordinary thing is that increased taxation imposed in the Budget comes into operation almost immediately while increases in pensions to the underprivileged, the old, the blind, the incapacitated, are deferred to a much later date.  But the people in receipt of these pensions have to meet the increased taxation in the interim without any compensation of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in children's allowances under section 7 are praiseworthy.  These <Col N="698" /> increases will help to relieve cases of hardship.  I welcome the provision for an allowance to a daughter, who has never worked outside her home, when she is looking after an incapacitated old age pension parent.  This may possibly lead to old people being looked after at home instead of being incarcerated in some institution.  Some allowance should be made, too, in the case of an incapacitated old age pensioner who is living with a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law.  That would also help to keep old people in familiar surroundings and amongst their own friends. The matter is worthy of consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Donogh O'Malley increased from 10s to £1 the amount payable to persons in county homes and other institutions.  The institution takes the balance of the pension.  This amount is not sufficient and the increases granted under this Budget should be paid to those people.  This Bill is all right as far as it goes but there is a lot of ground which requires to be made up urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many of my colleagues on these benches, I feel that while one welcomes the various palliatives in this Bill, nevertheless, one must say that one is surprised at the failure of the Government.  One does not want to make a catchcry of continual failure allegations against the Minister and his colleagues but after 12 years in office and almost half a century of political power the Government continually fails to exercise even an elementary sense of imagination in terms of recasting the social security structure of the State.  By a master stroke of imagination the Irish people had children's allowances two years before the English and we had a wet time insurance scheme which was somewhat unique but apart from these we slavishly followed Britain and are now far behind any of the normal security systems operating in more sophisticated countries in Europe.  This does not reflect any great credit on the Fianna Fáil party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike my colleague Deputy Dr. O'Connell I draw a sharp distinction between the internal attitudes of Departmental staff and policy frameworks <Col N="699" /> they are obliged to work within and implement.  Therefore, I would strongly suggest that, notwithstanding what was said yesterday afternoon about the quality of Irish life by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the acid test in any Republic, so-called, is the extent to which we are prepared to devote money to social security.  We now have well over £100,000 million in terms of gross national product in this State, in the context that we have a national Budget running into £400 million but yet we find that in a Budget of this nature all we can manage to squeeze out is an extra £5 million or £6 million for essential social security systems.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I hope the Minister will drop the phraseology &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo;.  I do not particularly favour this terminology, this concept of a sideways charity to the public from Parliament, and I feel that it is preferable to call it our national system of social security, which embraces the whole range of benefits for the people.  It is of crucial importance that we try to think in terms of raising the quality of life and at the same time appreciate the fact that almost 17 per cent of the population, or one-sixth of the total population, are now in receipt of weekly payments under our social insurance and social assistance systems scheme.  Also, there are about 350,000 families in receipt of children's allowances in addition. This constitutes a major sector of the population and it is not unfair to say that we have operated that system with very little innovation, very little sense of the urgency of change. What has occurred in the last ten years has more than warranted the necessity for introducing major changes.  If one wanted to analyse the extent of Government and national concern for the system of social security one can take just the expenditure on the Government side.  I do not know if the Minister has given these figures but certainly we have learned them for ourselves. The expenditure on social welfare represented 19.1 per cent of total tax revenue in 1965-66; in 1966-67 it dropped to 18.6 per cent and in 1967-68 it dropped to 17.6.  Therefore, we are not devoting more of our national <Col N="700" /> resources, more of our tax revenue buoyancy to the social security system. The figure for 1968-69 shows a further drop to 16.6 per cent.  Admittedly, it has received some slight upsurge in the recent Budget but overall it cannot be said by any responsible Government or Minister arguing across the Cabinet table and trying to obtain money for those in greatest need that we have obtained some growth in terms of allocation to social security from tax revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne and the last speaker from the Fine Gael benches quite rightly referred to the utter impossibility of many recipients living on these social security benefits.  Perhaps, it is within the traditions of this House that one goes to town on the inadequacies of the benefits but I do not think it can be repeated often enough because many of us never had to live on £3 10d a week or to see a widow or one's wife on £3 13s 6d a week.  But it is because we have not had to go through this exercise that we can fob it off and say: &ldquo;You worked it out in the context of a national system of social security and all will be well in the cynical review of the quality of Irish life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that in September and October of last year the number in receipt of contributory and non-contributory pensions was 224,000 people. Of those, 6,600 had pensions of less than £2 a week and 91,000 had pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, of £2 to £3 a week.  A total of 105,000 had pensions of between £3 and £4 a week and 30,200 had pensions of £4 to £5 a week while 17,800 had pensions of £5 to £6 a week.  A total of 50 persons had over £7 10s per week.  At least one-half of the 224,000 were in the £3 to £4 range which certainly does not reflect any credit on the Government or on the social conscience of the State.  I do not think that one needs to expose to public gaze for the Minister's edification or, indeed, for his staff, the grave social hardship that exists in these cases.  There is a popular assumption that in the constituency that I represent, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there is widespread affluence but in the course of my political canvass there we met many pensioners who, due to social traditions, <Col N="701" /> were not aware of what they were entitled to.  This is a fact that I will refer to later on.  In many instances they were living lives of quiet and desperate poverty in the hope that, perhaps, something would come but in practice they knew that very little would come because very few people cared very much about them.  They live in hope with the memory of relative opulence in the past, with nice faded curtains on their windows shading the cup of tea and relative poverty behind.  These are the realities in many areas of Irish life where people do not particularly wish to display their poverty or to go careering off to a Dáil Deputy to get something which they know quite well they will never get during the short span of their lifetime.  We do not need unduly to stress this, particularly from Labour Party benches, but it must go on record that these are the realities of life in 1969 in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would suggest also to the Minister that in Ireland we are facing a considerable geriatric explosion.  It has been described as such by Dr. J.J. Flanagan whom I heard recently addressing Dún Laoghaire Old Folks Association.  He is the consultant geriatrician to St. Kevin's.  He said that there was a considerable prospect of a geriatric explosion, as he put it, on the Irish scene and that it was now estimated that in 1981 there would be 372,000 people in the State aged 65 and over.  It is not particularly to the credit of the social attitudes of the Government that they have done very little forecasting and very little anticipation of general needs and of the fall-out from this geriatric explosion which is forecasted.  With the longer span of life, greater medical resources, the advances of medical science, the growth of assistance generally, it was to be expected that this would occur but I do not see any signs of a sense of urgency galvanising the Government benches in anticipation of this major challenge facing the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There has been available both within the Department and to the Government a fairly considerable amount of internal evidence which would have warranted some initiative on the Government's part in relation to the social <Col N="702" /> security system.  It is now the best part of five years since we had this extremely important analysis by Desmond Farrelly, an officer of the Department, in his publication <i>Social Insurance and Social Assistance in Ireland</i>.  This publication exposed the general system to the Irish people. Desmond Farrelly pointed out that in many areas of Europe and in Britain wage related social security systems have been introduced which certainly do not require any emphasis on our part.  Yet, we have seen no such attempt here apart from a rather casual, rather cursory, rather dismissive, reaction from the Minister yesterday.  For example, when I suggested to him that the current limit of £1,200 was far too low, was in need of upward revision, and so on, the Minister replied that, as indicated in the <i>Third Programme: Economic and Social Development,</i> the question of social security was being examined.  They spent the best part of nine months careering around the country at the State's expense and the best part of five or six months arguing the pay about the reactionary proposal of the Minister for Justice in relation to the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>I would strongly suggest to the Minister that it would be the hope that Irish public life and those of us in this House would not be continuously disenchanted by some of the cod-acting that has gone on in the past few years on the Government benches, that at least he would consider setting up a select committee of the House on social security.  The former Deputy MacEntee destroyed the Select Committee on Health.  Certainly, he will not be around to destroy the committee on social security, if the Minister considers this to be a feasible proposition.  In view of the complexity of the social security system and the tremendous ramifications that are developing, it is a rather difficult, almost impossible exercise for Deputies to stand up here and give detailed expositions of their views for general consumption and to have a 20minute reply by the Minister at the end of a debate.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the committee system for this House, particularly in relation to such an important social aspect of our economy.  I would hope <Col N="703" /> that a select committee would be set up.  If that is not done I would suggest the setting up of a commission of inquiry into social security.  We could have one on income taxation; we could have one on growth centres; we could have one on industrial training; we could have them on every conceivable aspect of industrial and social life.  Yet, we have not had one on the system of social security and it would be a useful innovation.  I do not think the Minister's staffs would find the burden unduly heavy.  I am quite certain that many of them would welcome such an innovation in ministerial thinking at this point of time.  One of the major things to be considered by such a commission or such a select committee of the House would be the introduction of wage related system and the particular difficulties that we would be faced with in Ireland.  The current systems in operation within the Department could usefully come under review also.</P>
    <P>In view of the manipulation&mdash;and I use the word reservedly&mdash;of the social security system of the State by many members of the Government, it is a popular assumption fostered very diligently by many Government Ministers, that by some form of representation electors will receive that to which they are statutorily entitled, that they will receive it more expenditiously, that they will receive it in slightly greater measure and more effectively if representations are made to the Department through a Minister on headed Dáil notepaper, that then the slot machine will act all the quicker in looking after the constituent, be he of the Minister's constituency or of any other constituency.  It has been a singular and unfortunate aspect of Irish life that down through the years all parties have tried to avail of this myth in relation to the availability of social services.  It has certainly lowered the standards of public life.  It has had one major outcome, that is, it has managed quite effectively for a good many years to keep the Fianna Fáil Party in power.  I suggest that one of the ways of curing this would be an extension of the information services available to the electorate from the Department.  I am conscious of the fact <Col N="704" /> that any elector can receive without any great difficulty a copy of the summary of the social insurance and assistance services which is written, as it must necessarily be, in legalistic style, with tabulation and official terminology. We are grateful for the information and for many explanatory leaflets which are also available but the public service media should be utilised.  It is not enough to insert in a national newspaper a complex, cryptic, rather short explanatory advertisement illustrating changes.  There should be in many areas advise bureaux for the benefit of the public.  The television service should be used as a public information service to indicate to people that as of right, and not due to any political intervention on the part of a local political representative, they can obtain these services.  I hope that in the course of the next four years the Minister will undertake this urgent necessity of bringing home to people their basic entitlement and giving them effective public assistance.</P>
    <P>The other aspects of the Bill have been covered by many of the speakers but I wish to refer to the general assumption on the part of the Minister and on the part of many of his colleagues that, since there has been a substantial increase in children's allowances in the Republic, it automatically follows that everything is superlative in the European context and that, in practice, we should be profoundly grateful.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that although the rate per month, if one might use the term, for a three-child family in this country is now £4, as far back as the 1st January, 1967, in Germany, it was £4 10s and £6 15s for low income families; in Belgium it was £19 8s at the same date and in France the rate is now £21 10s for a three-child family. The rate in Italy is £9 15s and even Luxembourg can manage £12 6s a month.  If we wish to make another comparison we can add the Netherlands where the rate is £9 18s.  One would think from all the political hruhaha of the Taoiseach that we had a magnificently advanced social service system well above that of any other régime.  We are about at par with the <Col N="705" /> United Kingdom.  Certainly, we cannot suggest that we deserve any major credit in respect of the changes that have been brought about with regard to children's allowances.</P>
    <P>However, the allowances we are providing are in many ways a tremendously valuable social assistance to large families in particular, but I think the measure could be used more extensively on a selective basis.  I know there are certain objections to the concept of selectivity&mdash;I personally have an open mind on selectivity&mdash;but I think a lot would depend on the approach to the question of selectivity.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that there should be a reconsideration by the Minister in respect of special allowances for registered blind persons aged 18 and over. I am sure the social conscience of our people would be aroused in a very sympathetic way towards these persons. I have no doubt that this question is worthy of re-examination by the Minister. I say this in the hope that the Minister will not prove to be as obdurate in relation to these persons as he has been in other respects.</P>
    <P>The increasing burden in respect of social security stamp charges is a matter of growing importance at present. These are by no means a diminishing factor in industrial costs.  I would point out however that, although these charges appear to be relatively heavy, they are certainly not as heavy as the charges in Britain.  As stated in the introductory speech this afternoon, the overall weekly contribution payable in respect of men in industrial employment will be 28s 3d from January next. In Britain the figure at present is 83s 7d.  There is quite a substantial difference between the two figures, notwithstanding the fact that in Britain selective employment tax accounts for almost £2 10s of that charge.  I suggest that Irish employers and, indeed many Irish people, have the relative advantage and that is a factor which we cannot ignore.  The figure of 83s 7d in Britain is made up of 28s 7d in respect of social insurance while 1s 11d is paid towards occupational injuries and 1s 3d towards redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>The one major reservation we must have about our contribution is the fact that it is a flat rate contribution and is <Col N="706" /> in no way related to the general ability of the industrial worker to pay.  This factor must be borne in mind.  I must add that the employer in Great Britain pays 65s of the total amount and, therefore, the worker pays approximately 17s 8d.  But these figures are becoming increasingly wage related and I have no doubt that the Irish system will get completely out of balance unless the Minister introduces this particular provision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest that the Minister might consider giving increased allowances to the many voluntary organisations who look after old people.  I know that there is a sum of about £75,000 available for such organisations, but the Minister might consider giving an increased subvention, even if it involves some form of accountability on the part of such organisations.  Many of these organisations&mdash;some in my own constituency, like the Dún Laoghaire Old Folks Association, the Sallynoggin Old Folks Association and others&mdash;put a tremendous amount of voluntary effort into looking after the needs of old people and are doing work which cannot be too highly commended. If the Minister could see his way to giving a greater national subvention to such organisations, I am certain that the money would be well spent.</P>
    <P>The points I have made in regard to this Bill, therefore, are a request for a commission on social security or, alternatively, a Select Committee of the House and a request that this be done as urgently as possible, otherwise we will have to meet here on an annual budgetary merry-go-round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the problem of the payment of widow's pensions to farm widows.  I understand that, in deciding whether such a person qualifies for this pension, her means are computed on the basis of the rateable valuation of her land.  I have been looking through the social welfare handbook to find out more about this matter but I have not been particularly successful.  I should be grateful, therefore, if the Minister could give me any further information as to how the means of such widows <Col N="707" /> are computed.  Pending the Minister's reply and subject to it, I suggest that there may be some injustices in this area.  For instance, I know of a woman who did not qualify for a widow's pension although she had a number of school-going children and 25 acres of rather bad land.  I should be interested to know if the rateable valuation level above which one does not qualify for a widow's pension has been raised recently.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact, that with a steady increase in the optimum economic farm size, the amount which one can earn on a farm with a valuation of £40 is considerably less in real terms now than it was ten years ago, I would ask the Minister whether, as the rateable valuation figure has been upgraded, he could take that into account. I would ask him whether this change in the income one can expect to derive per £1 of rateable valuation can be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I should like also to endorse Deputy Desmond's suggestion that a Select Committee of the House should be set up on social security.  It is my belief that Select Committees of this nature could perform a useful function and could assist the Minister considerably.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also drew attention to the exercise of what could be described as &ldquo;pull&rdquo; by politicians in relation to the obtaining of social welfare benefits.  I would commend to Deputy Desmond and his colleagues the Fine Gael policy in this regard, which is that we should set up a Citizens' Advice Bureau.  I believe such a bureau would go a long way to ensuring that people were not deceived into believing that politicians held all the power in regard to these matters and that the people would realise the full extent of their rights.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should give the setting up of such a bureau favourable consideration in consultation with the other members of his cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my desire to prolong this debate.  I have a few points to make.  Much of the ground has already been covered.  Some reference was made earlier to obstruction. <Col N="708" /> I hope it is clearly understood that there is no desire on the part of the Labour Party Deputies or on the part of the Fine Gael Deputies to obstruct this Bill.  Rather, we are expressing our deepest interest in it.</P>
      <P>Despite the smallness of the Labour Party in this House, I must remark that there have been continuously more Deputies on the Labour Party benches and on the Fine Gael benches than there have been on the Fianna Fáil Party benches throughout this debate.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary to dwell on the inadequacy of our level of social welfare payments, even at the increased rates. This point has already been made some years ago by Professor Kaim-Caudle who pointed out, at a time when I think the old age pension was 57s 6d, that a jail prisoner would be sustained on a more expensive diet than the old age pensioner could live on at that figure.  Despite the increases which have taken place there have been parallel increases in the cost of living, making that statement of Professor Kaim-Caudle essentially true still.</P>
      <P>In relation to the children's allowances increase we can assume that, in the case of what Deputy Desmond referred to as the average three-child family, where the parents of that family indulge in such permissible working class luxuries as the occasional pint of stout or packet of cigarettes, the increase in children's allowance will be rapidly eaten away by the increased expenditure due to the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Desmond's statement in relation to the &ldquo;tied&rdquo; concept of social welfare benefits.  Professor Kaim-Caudle has pointed out clearly how this could be done.  Mr. Anthony Coughlan, Lecturer in Social Administration in Trinity College, Dublin, also pointed out how it could be done in the pamplet <i>Aims of Social Policy</i>.  It seems to me quite ridiculous that these matters of increased social payments should be the subject of annual political debate and argument and that unfortunate people, who are least in the position to exert pressures on behalf of themselves, should look with hope and expectation to essentially political decision-making to see whether <Col N="709" /> or not a few more shillings are coming their way.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this sort of payment could not be tied to the cost of living or to the regular wage rounds. I should like the Minister to look at this again.  The same applies to payments to all people on fixed pensions, such as the retired gardaí, civil servants or widows.  They should not be made an annual budgetary football.  The possible loss of political kudos to any Party from these marginal increases should be waived.  We should try to devise a system by which the increases are automatic.  It seems ridiculous in our society that, in effect, those who can exert most effective force by strike action of one kind or another, like the maintenance strikers earlier this year, are the ones who can gain results, and that the people who cannot exert force must tag along behind and write pathetic letters pointing out the weakness and inadequacy of their incomes.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to the means test tables which appear in this Bill. One does not have to be a socialist to have the deepest misgivings about the principle of the means test.  It penalises those who by their thrift have put something behind them during their working lives.  This means test is, also, a matter of incredible complexity.  I often wonder if a serious study has been made of the cost of administration of means test structures of the kind outlined in the table on page three of this Bill by comparison with the cost to the State of the abolition of the means test.  In that extraordinary table on page three of the Bill there is quite an incredible catalogue of human misery.  One reads about the means of the pensioner being &ldquo;nil&rdquo;, or &ldquo;exceeding nil&rdquo; but &ldquo;not exceeding £26 5s&rdquo;.  There is a reference to an income exceeding £26 5s but not exceeding £52 10s, and so on at roughly £20 intervals.  This places one whole category of human beings in the invidious position of being judges of their fellow men's pitiful little incomes.  On the other side, it abolishes at a stroke the kind of privacy in our private lives which everyone in this House would regard as a natural right.  We speak of freedom and of free society and of <Col N="710" /> dignity and, as Deputy Desmond says, of the quality of life, but for every person for whom it is necessary to make a return of income under that kind of means test table, dignity, privacy and freedom have, effectively speaking, been abolished as if such a person were in a concentration camp or in a gold fish bowl.</P>
    <P>I like to regard myself as a realist, even if I do not happen to be a member of the self-styled party of reality. I recognise that machinery such as that of the social services cannot be altered in a day.  But while we must maintain these means-test, pauper, social welfare services, could we not at least maintain them with a little more dignity than the unfortunate recipients enjoy at the moment?  I am thinking now of the delays which seem to be necessary from time to time.  Perhaps it is merely a delay of days before signing-up periods but such days can be days of importance to people on the bread-line level, which many of these applicants are.  I am thinking also of the mothers whom I saw queueing outside one tiny post office in West Finglas.  They were waiting to collect their children's allowances, they were very cheerful because it was summer. What would it be like to queue for those payments in a rainy November or December morning?  I would like the Minister to look at the question of how these admittedly small facilities, which we in the Labour Party do not think are adequate, might be extended to these people in an atmosphere of some dignity and comfort.  They are their rights.  If I may pay my colleague. Deputy Tunney of the Fianna Fáil Party, a compliment, I know that he is similarly concerned about that aspect, and is worried about the inadequacy of the Finglas Post Office. But this is more than a problem in one constituency.  I am not speaking of one post office or of one incident.  I am speaking about the question of preserving an atmosphere of dignity in which people could receive what is their right, not a hand-out to which they are entitled because they are told they are somewhat inadequate in the race of life.  They are receiving a right.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to a further way in which they could be reminded <Col N="711" /> of this right, and I would support Deputies Desmond and Bruton here. It has never been made adequately clear to the people by the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments that the kind of things which are agreed in this House are to be had by the people as of right and they need not bow their knees to anyone, whether a Deputy or not, in order to get these rights.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, people can obtain booklets on these subjects, but they do not obtain them.  It is necessary for them to show the initiative of seeking them out; those are the very people who, because, through no fault of their own they are deprived of the opportunity for education and self development, are the least likely to seek those rights and to understand and demand them. If Government Departments can produce, just before election time, glossy, simplified brochures on the educational benefits awaiting the people of Ireland, they can produce comparable, simplified brochures on their social rights.  In supporting Deputy Desmond and Deputy Bruton I suggest that all of us try to make a self-denying ordinance against the kind of thing they referred to; an illusion of patronage which has lowered this country, and has given to the working people particularly the servile illusion that they must come cap in hand to some intermediary in order to get what are their rights.  That is what the Reverend Dr. Harty pointed to recently.</P>
    <P>I know there are vested interests for keeping things as they are.  I am not implying for a moment that the utilisation of the present system of pseudopatronage is confined to the Government benches.  It is not, of course. Great and famous practitioners have graced every side of the House.  One of the reasons for the absence of Deputies listening to this debate at the moment is no doubt that many of them are sitting scribbling away furiously telling people how they can get them blue cards, this card, that card, the other card for benefits which are in fact their legal right.  The Department of Social Welfare should undertake an educational campaign to try and ensure <Col N="712" /> that our people are told that such limited benefits as we offer to them are their benefits as of right and not as the function of their inadequacy or failure in life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to congratulate Deputy Geoghegan on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare. I consider this Department to be rather important in our society and I hope his appointment portends something better to come.  Unfortunately, it has been the experience of many of us who serve on local authorities that the attitude of the Department of Social Welfare to the problems of the old, the problems of the underprivileged, leaves a lot to be desired.  I hope the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary in this the Nineteenth Dáil will improve matters in this respect.  After all, we are dealing with the underprivileged sectors of our community.  It is those people more than anyone else whom we should represent, because it is they more than anyone else who need our protection and care.</P>
      <P>I welcome the various increases in pensions and benefits, even though they are small and even though they do not add up to anything like the benefits and pensions which are available in most West European countries.  Indeed, it has already been said here today that we are perhaps lowest on the scale of social security benefits in Western Europe.  It is wrong to play about with pensions and social benefits.  This year they have been made an election gimmick. They were announced in the election Budget but they will not be available in some cases until August and in other cases until next January. This is very poor treatment; it is very wrong of the Minister and the Government to adopt this attitude in regard to those benefits.</P>

    <P>I welcome the new grant for multiple births and also section 16, which deals with increases for incapacitated old age pensioners who have a daughter living with them.  Those increases are badly needed.  I would ask the Minister and his staff, however, to adopt a more flexible attitude in dealing with such problems as appeals.  An increase of <Col N="713" /> 5s was given the year before last to old age pensioners but a pensioner I know, just because he had an apple tree in his back garden, was deemed to have an income and did not get the 5s increase. This type of narrow-minded approach to what I consider important matters is wrong and I condemn it here. I would ask the Minister to ensure that a more flexible attitude is adopted in his Department in this respect.  I want to complain also about the attitude in employment exchanges.  The people who are on unemployment insurance are not being dealt with in a proper and gentlemanly fashion.  It is wrong for them to have to queue up.</P>

      <P>The Bill we are considering here refers to increases in certain payments, such as unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance. I know there are many unemployed people who have been dealt with like animals rather than human beings, under the various Social Welfare Acts and I condemn this here now.  I am annoyed that the Minister should interfere in a speech which I am trying to make constructive and helpful rather than negative.  I should like to continue, if I may.  I would welcome the setting up of information centres throughout the country to deal with the many problems involved in getting social welfare benefits, unemployment benefits and children's allowances. This would be of great benefit to people who at the moment come to Deputies and local councillors for information and help.  It is the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil régime who have propagated the idea that benefits and pensions are a matter of political patronage.  It is not so.  This is a right under the Constitution of our country and it is about time it was brought outside politics.  Perhaps a good way to take it outside politics would be to establish information centres <Col N="715" /> throughout the country.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
      <P>We are apparently hell-bent for EEC.  I should like to make the point that under the treaty which established EEC, social security systems or schemes in each country will more or less be equal and, also, the movement of labour between countries will be free.  We are a long way behind the European countries in matters of social welfare.  I should like to support Deputy Desmond&mdash;indeed, I had intended to mention it myself &mdash; that a select committee of the House be appointed or, alternatively, a commission of inquiry be appointed to investigate our whole social security and our whole social welfare scheme.  The Government in their <i>Third Programme: Economic and Social Development</i> accept that there will have to be major revision of these schemes.  The proper way to do it is by the establishment of a commission or a select committee.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would recommend to the Minister some system to include the self-employed within our social security network.  There are many small farmers, shop-keepers and even harbour board pilots who do not come within the present scheme.  I recommend that some system be devised to bring these within the network of our social security system.  While I welcome the Bill, I think it is far from what we should have in this Christian country.</P>

      <P>You have the door. Let us go back over the history of social welfare.  I will ask the geniuses on the far side of this House to answer a simple question.  Before Fianna Fáil came into office, was ever a Social Welfare Bill put through this House except the one put through by the British Government in some house around here in, I think, nineteen hundred and what was it, when the first <Col N="717" /> old age pension was given?  Until Fianna Fáil came in again there was never a social welfare Bill put through in this country except that British one and, God knows, even in the worst of times, the British gave us 10s and the Cumann na nGaedheal Government took 1s off that.  Is that not true?  Is there anyone over there on any side who can deny it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody over there who can deny it.  They know it is the truth, and that is that.  From that date, no government in this country except Fianna Fáil has put through an effective social welfare Bill. It is remarkable that the front bench of the Labour Party are not here now to hear me say that in six years when they had control of social welfare in this country they gave an increase of 2s 6d a week to the unfortunate social welfare people of this country and let nobody try to deny that fact.  If you want to be mud-slingers, you can start it and you will certainly find your match here.</P>

      <P>I think these people should take their beating and should not try to walk over me here now when I get up to make my speech.  It has been fired at us that this was a political gimmick, that these increases were given as a political gimmick.  They were not.  First of all, we did not know that there would be an election at the time at which these increases were going to be given.  The people of this country are no fools.  Remembering the record of Fine Gael in 1931, they made damn sure to put us back to implement the terms of the Budget.  They knew that if the Opposition got back this legislation would never go through, these increases would never be given and there would be no reason for them to get up here today trying to blackguard this Party because the increases are not greater.  The increases are at least three times what the Opposition thought they would be, and that is what has got their goat.  We all know that.  We must be honest and realistic about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least it is a happy augury for the future that we have reached the point at which we are able to give these increases. Let us think of the years from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1956. We know the type of social welfare increases which were given during that period, do we not?  Certainly the people of the west of Ireland do.  They have very good reason to know and they have not forgotten.  I know that in this big town nobody appears to know whether a Dublin man is doing anything or not and these people probably do forget and have short memories, but <Col N="720" /> the people of the west did not forget. The simple fact is, and it must be faced, the people of this country have given us a mandate; they have told us that what we informed them we would do before the election in connection with social welfare is what they want.</P>
    <P>The people of this country are no crowd of mugs at all.  They will not be influenced one way or another by geniuses who come out with fictional doctorates from certain universities or who get certain degrees by not drinking tea, by drinking water instead, as we know and we have seen, or by geniuses who masquerade as economists who have BA degrees.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the children's allowances for large families have not been improved more than they have been.  The Minister referred with some pride to the fact that a family of six will now get £10 a month as against £6 11s 6d formerly. £10 a month as an allowance for a family of six children does not make any great impression on me.  A similar family in Britain would have children's allowances of more than double that amount.  I am not one of those people who believe that we are a poor country and Britain is a wealthy country. There is a great deal of evidence the other way round.  We allow many extremely wealthy people to pay no income tax in this country and that <Col N="721" /> suggests to me that we are a very welloff country indeed.</P>

      <P>Having expressed my regret that there is not a proper system of children's allowances here, I admit that £10 a month is better than £6 11s 6d.  But has it a greater purchasing power than £6 11s 6d had when that figure was introduced?  I very much doubt it.  We need only give it a little while and it will have less value than the £6 11s 6d.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is that I regret to note the large contributions required from women relative to men.  I am speaking on the pay of women relative to men.  This is a matter on which there have been questions asked in the House in the last few days. In fact, it is a matter&mdash;if I might make a bow to Deputy Lenehan and talk about the election&mdash;that came up a good deal during the election, and quite rightly so.  I believe that in this country we treat women extremely badly.  Here we have proof of it in print.  The Minister in his speech said that the contribution for men is to be 28s 3d from now on and the contribution for women is to be 26s.  Is anybody on that side of the House&mdash;they were very talkative a few minutes ago &mdash;going to tell me that women's wages in this country compare on the basis of 26s a week for women to 28s a week for men?</P>

      <P>It was suggested that the increases in children's allowances were not given because there was an election coming up.  I am not particularly interested in whether they were or not.  What I am interested in is that this was not done a number of years back.  Whether it was done because of the elections or not does not matter a great deal.  It is now being done.  To that extent the Minister deserves credit.</P>
      <P>I notice there is an admission in the Bill, a perfectly proper admission, that there should never have been adopted in this country an allowance for one child.  I shall not use the language that was used on that side of the House, but I do not know who thought up that idea.  An old lady will have a cat around the house.  You will see the bachelor with his dog.  Surely to goodness two married people who have one child have something that is a source of enjoyment to them.  I do not believe that any genuinely Christian country should give an allowance for one child.  If that had not been done the necessary money would be available to provide for the families in which I am interested, the families of four, five and six children, the families that really should be provided for.  It is unfortunate that we can not go somewhere nearer the allowance in Britain, where it is £1 per child per week.  The allowance here is going up to £2 a month, about 9s a week.  That compares very badly with the allowance in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France and in other European countries, when you get really large families you get very large allowances. On the few occasions that I have been on the Continent I did not notice any great affluence among large families: they were reasonably well off.  In this country, large families have been very shabbily treated in relation to children's allowances up to this Bill, which is at least an improvement, provided that the value of money remains the <Col N="723" /> same.  There, I come back to the question of the increase in the cost of living last year.  The cost of living index was supposed to go up five per cent last year; of course, it went up by something like 15 per cent: everybody knows that.  The official figures suggested five per cent but, after all, sterling was devalued 14 per cent, export prices went up 15 per cent and import prices went up by the same amount.  Yet, we were told that the cost of living index went up five per cent.  I took great care to examine the question in the middle of last year and I found all kinds of commodities were rapidly going up in price.  This is all an attempt at some kind of very short-term analysis of the figures in the Bill.  This does not mean that I do not welcome the Bill and that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are not to be congratulated on it&mdash;they are, of course.  I should, however, like that when the matter is again under consideration the position of women would be considered and also the position of large families.</P>

I ask the Minister to consider that point seriously and, if possible, give power to the county council to allow those people a few shillings a week.  It is particularly unfortunate to see such people, in the different towns where such homes exist, standing on the street corners seeking a halfcrown or the price of a drink when, perhaps, if they got 10s or 15s a week it would make all the difference to them.</P>

      <P>One thing must stand out in all the contributions that have been made from the Opposition benches and that is that the obvious fact that the magnitude of the exercise in redistribution of income that has taken place this year has been completely ignored.  This Social Welfare Bill makes arrangements for an increased allocation this year of £17.102 million in a full financial year to the various income maintenance services operated by my Department.  It results in an increase in the percentage of total national income devoted to social welfare of from 7.7 per cent to 8.4 per cent, based on the estimated national income from the current financial year and, of course, an estimate of the total social welfare payments that will be made in this year.</P>
      <P>The estimated increase in the national income for this financial year over the last financial year is £103 million, so that what we are doing in this Bill is arranging that 16.6 per cent of the estimated increase in the national income will be devoted to the income maintenance services operated by my Department.  I think that by any standard it must be agreed that this is, in fact, a substantial redistribution of income to make in any one year.  I do not know if there was ever a similar percentage allocated in one year before now but it is certainly a substantial increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, and I think a number of other Deputies also, maintained that what has been done this year does not, in fact, compensate for the increase in the cost of living even in the past year.  The fact of the matter is that, in the 12 months to mid-May, 1969, which is the latest date for which the consumer price index figure is available, the cost of living rose by 6.9 per cent and the increases that have <Col N="726" /> been given in the social assistance and social insurance schemes this year range from 13.8 per cent to 17 per cent.  So that in this year alone, there is obviously a substantial improvement in the rates of payment in all the income maintenance schemes over the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The increase for the old-age non-contributory pension is 15.4 per cent. For the old age contributory pension it is 13.8 per cent.  For the widow's non-contributory pension it is 15.75 per cent.  For the widow's contributory pension it is 15.4 per cent.  For the disability benefit or unemployment benefit for a single person it is 15.4 per cent and for the disability benefit or unemployment benefit for a married couple it is 17 per cent.  This is all against an increase in the consumer price index figure of 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is similar to what has been happening over the whole period of this Government's term in office. As we have been reminded, we have been in office now continuously for 12 years.  In mid-May, 1957, the consumer price index was 11.5.  In mid-May, 1969, it was 171, giving an increase of 54.75 per cent, over that 12-year period, in the consumer price index. In the case of every single one of the income maintenance schemes, the increase has been spectacularly more than the increase in the consumer price index.  I say in every one of them, because this Government, unlike the alternative Governments we have had, have, in almost every year, dealt with the whole range of the income maintenance services and have increased them all.  We have ensured that they have all gained over the cost of living, unlike the performance of the Opposition when they had control of the Government and, in particular, when the Labour Party, were in charge of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>During those two periods of government there was never an occasion on which all the income maintenance services were dealt with.  One solitary increase was given in each of those two periods but given only on a selective basis, and dealing only with certain of the social welfare services.  Others have never been touched by any hands excet those of Fianna Fáil.  They have <Col N="727" /> been introduced by Fianna Fáil and every subsequent development of them, both extensions of scope and increases in rates of payment have been given by Fianna Fáil.  One of the schemes which has come in for the greatest amount of mention by both the Opposition parties, the children's allowances scheme, is a completely Fianna Fáil scheme which might never have existed so far as either of the Opposition parties were concerned when they were in government.</P>
    <P>As I said, the increase in the cost of living during our period of office has been 54.75 per cent.  The non-contributory old age pension in that period has gone from 24s to 75s, which is an increase of 212.5 per cent.  In addition to extensions in scope, to extensions of the means scale; to such things as the addition to the scheme of allowances in respect of dependent children and to the provision of free electricity, free travel and so on, the actual cash payment has increased by 212.5 per cent in a period when the cost of living increased by 54.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have been saying, unlike the two Opposition parties, we appreciate that there is something more in social welfare, and that there are other income maintenance services which need to be dealt with as well as the non-contributory old age pension.  I quite appreciate that it is mention of the non-contributory old age pension which evokes the greatest reaction in the public mind.  That does not mean that it is justifiable for a Government to ignore the other sections of the community that also have to depend on social welfare provisions, as both of the Opposition parties did when it was their responsibility to deal with them.</P>
    <P>We have arranged that the rates of all the income maintenance services have increased relative to the cost of living.  The Opposition might like to forget that there are such things as unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, for instance, as they did when they were in office.  I am not prepared to forget them.  These people require to have their position improved as the economy of the country improves as well as the non-contributory <Col N="728" /> old age pensioners.  Certainly while I am Minister for Social Welfare I will insist that that happens.</P>
    <P>In so far as unemployment assistance is concerned, the rate for a single person in an urban area has increased from 18s to 61s 6d, which is an increase of 241.7 per cent.  In a rural area it has gone from 12s to 55s 6d, an increase of 362.5 per cent.  In the case of a recipient of unemployment assistance with an adult dependant, the increase has been from 28s in an urban area to 117s 6d, an increase of 319.6 per cent.  In a rural area the increase has been from 20s to 109s 6d, an increase of 447.5 per cent.  In the case of a recipient of unemployment assistance with an adult dependant and four children, the increase has been from 38s when we took over to 157s 6d in an urban area, an increase of 314.5 per cent and, in a rural area, from 28s to 149s 6d, an increase of 433.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-contributory widows' pensions the increase in our period has been from 22s 6d to 73s 6d, an increase of 226.7 per cent and, for a widow with four children, the increase has been from 36s to 113s 6d, an increase of 215.3 per cent.  All this was in a period when the cost of living has increased by 54.75 per cent.  So, the social assistance payments have outpaced the cost of living since we took over in 1957 by at least four to one.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that they have yet reached a satisfactory level but I do say that under a Fianna Fáil Government arrangements are made to ensure that these people take part in the general increase in prosperity that follows from Fianna Fáil's administration.  What we do is that each year at Budget time we make the necessary arrangements to ensure that that happens.  There has been this continuous and gradual improvement in the position of every recipient of social assistance relative to the cost of living during Fianna Fáil's 12 year period of office.</P>
    <P>The position is somewhat similar in regard to the social insurance schemes. With regard to unemployment and disability benefits the rate for a single man <Col N="729" /> in 1957 was 30s.  It is now 75s, an increase of 150 per cent.  For a married person in receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit, the rate in 1957 was 45s.  It is now 137s 6d, giving an increase of 205.5 per cent.  For a married man with four children the increase has been from 61s to 189s 6d, an increase of 210.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the case of contributory widows' pensions, the increase in the case of a widow without dependants has been from 30s to 75s, an increase of 150 per cent, and for a widow with four children from 46s to 129s 6d, a percentage increase of 181.5.  An innovation since 1957 has been the contributory old age pension which did not exist, nor was it contemplated, prior to Fianna Fáil getting back into office. That additional benefit was introduced in 1961 so that the social insurance benefits have since 1957 outpaced the cost of living by more than three to one.</P>
    <P>We cannot be complacent about the levels of any of these rates of payment but there is ample evidence that it is only under Fianna Fáil that real improvements have been made.  No new services have been provided except by Fianna Fáil.  Since 1957 an annual exercise has developed of making arrangements at Budget time to ensure that the recipients of social welfare benefits of every class take part in the general increase in prosperity.</P>
    <P>One of the results of this is that the expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of national income has been increasing because of the Government's attention to this matter.  Contrary to what Deputy Ryan alleged, this Government have a social conscience and they have proved this not by words but by actions.  Because of that, expenditure on social welfare has been increasing and increasing relative to national income.</P>
    <P>In the last year of Coalition Government, expenditure on social welfare was 6.4 per cent of national income. In 1969-70, based on the estimated figures for expenditure and national income, it will be 8.4 per cent of national income, and this despite the fact that in 1956-57 we had a combination <Col N="730" /> of two factors tending to raise that percentage.  We had the highest ever level of unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the highest ever level.  Fianna Fáil have that record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the highest ever level of unemployment and, therefore, of inflated expenditure combined with a reducing national income, both factors tending to inflate the percentage which expenditure on social welfare represented of national income. In the 12 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have had continuously rising national income, continuously rising expenditure on social welfare and an increase in the percentage of expenditure on social welfare from 6.4 to 8.4 of national income.  This is ample evidence that Fianna Fáil not only take care of the fundamental requirements of ensuring that the economy expands but that they also arrange to ensure the optimum distribution of increased production in the country.</P>
      <P>In face of this evidence, to say that this Government are devoid of a social conscience but that the Opposition parties have this conscience is the limit of effrontery and hypocrisy.  It is not difficult for anybody to draft a document, such as the phony Just Society document, and to list what is desirable to do, but to implement all these proposals is a different thing. That is what Fianna Fáil have done and the present Budget is an outstanding example of the implementation of this social conscience.  I do not think there is any point in referring to such ridiculous statements as that of Deputy Ryan that this is an implementation of the Fine Gael programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a continuation of what has been consistent Fianna Fáil policy as has been demonstrated during the years.  As Deputy J. Lenehan pointed out, there is not any social welfare legislation on the Statute books except what was there from the British or what has been produced by Fianna Fáil.  Any expanded or new services have been provided by Fianna Fáil, <Col N="731" /> often in the teeth of opposition from the two parties opposite.</P>
      <P>However, the fundamental point is that the capacity of the people to provide the money should be increased, and Fianna Fáil have made sure that happens.  Each year we arrange to collect an increasing proportion of this increasing prosperity for redistribution to the section of the community who, for one reason or another, are unable to play an active part themselves in the greater production, but to promise increases without reference to economic growth, as the Opposition parties do, is a complete fraud.</P>
      <P>The question of the £1,200 limit for compulsory insurability of non-manual employees was raised.  This figure was introduced four years ago and as I pointed out at the time it has been the practice to relate this figure to the preceding figure and to try to cover a few years in advance as well as whatever deficiency has come about since the last figure was fixed.  I agree that the time has come to have another look at that figure and in so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned there is no reason why there should be any limit on this figure, but the fact that the yardstick of insurability under the Social Insurance Acts is used for other purposes is the only difficulty as far as my Department is concerned.</P>
      <P>We had, of course, the usual and to be expected so-called comparisons with other countries.  We had the cry &ldquo;Why must we be the last European country to do this?&rdquo; This is completely wrong. We have not been the last European country to introduce any of these schemes covering various contingencies. It is a typically inaccurate Fine Gael denigration of this country to allege that the whole approach of the Department of Social Welfare has been to give as little as possible to as few as possible, but the facts completely disprove this.  The facts show that any new scheme which has been introduced has been introduced by Fianna Fáil, and every extension of existing schemes has been carried out by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give a brief run over the various aspects of existing and new <Col N="732" /> schemes which have been introduced even in Fianna Fáil's last 12-year period in office but this would take up too much of the time of the House.  I am not really interested in a recitation of what has been achieved in the past, but I just want to demonstrate to the House that this overall improvement in the allocation of our resources to social welfare has been taking place consistently. It is not true to say that the amount of contribution in the form of social insurance stamps here forms a higher percentage of expenditure than in any European country.  On the contrary, the figures show the amount of State participation in social security is highest in Ireland of all the countries in Europe.  I quote from Table 9 in <i>The Cost of Social Security, 1961-63</i> which was published by the ILO in 1967, which shows that the extent of State participation in Ireland was 67.7 per cent as against the next highest which was the UK, 47.1 per cent; Iceland 45.6 per cent; and the lowest, Switzerland, 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have any figures for employers' contributions in those countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not got them.  But, as I think Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out, it is the consumer who pays it all eventually anyway in any country whether you have a socialistic system or not.  I do not see any virtue in an excessive amount of this being raised by way of general taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that part of what he said, that the total cost of social security is paid eventually by the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I do not see any particular virtue in raising it by way of general taxation rather than by way of contributions to social insurance stamps.  It is a fact that the percentage contributed by the State here &mdash;contributed of course by the general <Col N="733" /> taxpayer &mdash; to social insurance benefits is considerably higher than in most other countries.  I do not see why that position should not be changed and that we should not have a more normal relationship as between the amounts contributed in the three different ways to the cost of social insurance.  There may be a case for increasing the employer's proportion rather than the employee's. I would be inclined to go with that idea myself.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the delay in meeting the payments, as Deputies know, this is due to the technical arrangements that have to be made and the fact that new arrangements have to be made for the issue of new pension books and the printing of a new social insurance stamp.  All these things take time and it has been found that to do the job properly it takes until August to deal with the social assistance scheme and until January to deal with the social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A Fianna Fáil Minister was far better than that.  Within days of the general election he restored, by telegram, the shilling that was cut by Mr. Ernest Blythe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was merely restoring something the previous government took away.  It did not involve the complicated technicalities that are involved in giving a positive increase, which is what Fianna Fáil have been doing.  It is not true, as Deputy Dr. O'Connell alleged, that the Department of Social Welfare is &mdash; I quote him as accurately as I can &mdash; orientated towards obstructing people from obtaining their rights.  Certainly, when I was in the Department of Social Welfare previously I made every possible effort to bring it home to every social welfare officer in the country that the positive aspect of his job was much more important than the necessary aspect of ensuring that payments were made only in accordance with the laws that were passed by the Oireachtas.  That is something that has to be done in the interest of equitable distribution of a limited amount of money, but I made it quite clear that any officer in the Department should consider it a much greater dereliction of duty if anybody <Col N="734" /> failed to get something to which he was entitled rather than if somebody got something to which he was not entitled; that I completely deprecated the approach that the claiming and allocation of any form of social welfare payment was to be looked upon as a contest between the social welfare officer, on the one hand, and the claimant, on the other hand; that the approach should, instead, be to see if the law, as enacted by this House, could embrace the particular case of the person who was claiming benefit.  I intend to ensure that that attitude persists and that it continues to be recognised that the most important function of the Department of Social Welfare is to ensure that everybody who is entitled to benefits will obtain them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne continued where he left off four and a half years ago with this suggestion that by departing from the archaic principles on which we are alleged to rely benefits of a desirable amount could be provided.  I am well aware that there are Deputies who consider it an archaic approach to accept that expenditure must be related to production, that real improvement in social welfare must depend on increased production, and that increased production requires continued investment and reasonable taxation levels.  The experience has been that economic disaster follows from failure to appreciate this.  Whether it is archaic or not that has been the experience, and it has also been the experience that in these conditions it is the weaker sections of the community who suffer most.</P>

    <P>I do not think that anybody on this side of the House has ever approached this matter of income maintenance payments on the basis that they were gratuitous handouts from the Government. Of course, they are not.  They are simply an adjustment of the national income in favour of people who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to acquire their due share of whatever level of prosperity there is, and there is no question of charity involved that I can see.  It is merely a question of social justice.  I think everybody on this side of the House would like to see the levels of <Col N="735" /> payment under the different schemes substantially increased, but we are faced with the practical position in which they can, in fact, realistically be related only to the overall level of earnings and, whether you have a socialist régime or any other kind of régime, these payments can only be paid from the people's earnings and can only be related to them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that for Deputies who would like to see these payments substantially increased what Deputy Dr. Browne describes as the &ldquo;recitation of cost&rdquo; is rather boring and frustrating, but, unfortunately, when one is in a position in which one has to deal with these things rather than just talk about them the matter of the cost is a very relevant one, indeed, and one which cannot be ignored.  Both Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Corish found that when they were members of a Government and were not able to produce anything even approaching our performance in regard to these social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>Some of the payments the Deputy's Government could not touch at all and the Deputy's Government certainly could not produce anything approaching the relatively spectacular increases in these payments over the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede to Deputy Desmond that this Bill does not demonstrate any great flights of imagination by the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is because we have found that there is no point in imagining you have more money than you actually have and there is no point in imagining that the community can provide more than they can.  Even yesterday it was, I think, fairly generally agreed that the level of taxation on the community was just about as high as it could be.  The Opposition parties are free to imagine what they like.  They are free to imagine that these payments can be increased at will. But the people are not prepared to accept that; the people have had experience of what comes of accepting <Col N="736" /> that type of approach and they are obviously not prepared to take the risk of a similiarly irresponsible approach again.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that our social welfare system is far behind the social welfare systems in other European countries.  I know that Opposition Deputies fondly imagine that to be so and, because they would like it to be so, they have apparently come to believe it.  The fact is that we have substantially complete coverage of the various contingencies that are looked upon as being appropriate to cover by income maintenance schemes and the major problem so far as we are concerned is to increase the rates of payment under these schemes and, possibly, also to remove some anomalies and increase the scope in some cases.  But the major problem is to increase the rates of payment and this can only be done according as the national income is increased. This, as I have shown, Fianna Fáil have been consistently doing and doing in a way which has not inhibited further economic growth.</P>

      <P>A substantial number of whom went out under the Deputy's Government.  So far as that is concerned, we have reached the position now where, for the first time since, I think, the Famine, the total population in the country is at last increasing, and has been increasing for some time, perhaps, at a slower rate than we would like, but definitely increasing. There is still a certain level of involuntary emigration, but even that has improved and, so long as the country is spared another Coalition experience, we can expect to continue in that way.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, well known that the introduction of wage-related benefits is, in fact, contemplated.  My predecessor made that clear on a number of occasions and I do not see why Deputies should advocate now something that has, in fact, been decided upon.</P>

      <P>In so far as children's allowances are concerned, this is, of course, as I have already pointed out, a scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil and developed only by Fianna Fáil.  In making comparisons with other countries, such comparisons are valid only if one compares like with like.  In some of the countries mentioned what are classified as children's allowances are actually part of the wage structure and are paid not by the government out of taxation but by the employers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of the assessment of farm widows' means.  It is not true to say that these are based on the valuation of the farm.  The means are taken to be the yearly value of profits which she receives either from the working of the farm or from the letting of the farm and the rateable valuation does not enter into the picture at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Thornley advocated that increases in social welfare payments should be tied to the cost of living. I think the figures I have given show that it certainly would not be to the advantage of the recipients of social welfare had this been done in the past. I do not agree they should be tied to the cost of living.  I think instead there should be a conscious allocation of increasing national income to social welfare recipients irrespective of increases in the cost of living and that, even if the cost of living does not increase in any particular year and the national income does, this exercise in the redistribution of income should take place because we are all agreed, I think, that the rates of payment are not yet at a satisfactory level and there is need to increase them relative to the cost of living.</P>

      <P>The one thing which convinces me that a Deputy has no real interest in social welfare and social justice is when he advocates the abolition of the means test because there is no other way of equitably distributing a limited amount of money among deserving people other than by having a means test.  When Deputy Dr. <Col N="738" /> Thornley advocates that the means test should be abolished what he is advocating, in so far as the present position of social welfare is concerned, is that the Minister should raise an additional £17½ million and allocate this to the Department of Social Welfare and that this £17½ million should be utilised, without giving one penny increase to those who are most in need.  If Deputy Dr. Thornley succeeds in getting the people to accept his philosophy, then he can proceed, if he can get £17½ million extra, to utilise it to give it to the people who are not in as great need as others, to utilise it without giving one penny increase in the maximum rate of the old age pension, in the maximum rate of unemployment assistance and in the maximum rate of non-contributory widow's pension.</P>
      <P>That may be Deputy Dr. Thornley's philosophy.  He may think that would be the proper way to utilise an additional £17½ million but I do not and while Fianna Fáil are in office and while I am Minister for Social Welfare if I can get £17½ million I will not utilise it in that way.  Deputy Dr. Thornley can wait until such time as he can persuade the people to accept his philosophy in order to perpetrate this monstrous injustice on people who are in need.  I will certainly have no part of it and I immediately lose interest in the contribution to a debate such as this of any Deputy who advocates such a short-sighted and inhuman approach as Deputy Dr. Thornley did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been described by Deputy Collins as an election gimmick and the Budget was described as an election Budget.  There must always be a Budget preceding or succeeding a general election.  So far as this Government are concerned we feel that the responsible thing to do is to introduce the Budget before dissolving the Dáil, to face up to the task of imposing whatever taxation appears to be necessary and to do that before the election rather than do what the Opposition do, run away from their responsibilities, dissolve the Dáil before <Col N="739" /> the Budget and leave the mess to be cleared up by the incoming Government. We introduced the Budget at the usual time and the Budget consisted of the normal exercise that Fianna Fáil have been carrying out at Budget time over the past 12 years, of an assessment of the capacity of the community to provide money for different social welfare services both in my Department and in others and of making the necessary fiscal arrangements to collect that money whether by way of insurance contributions or by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>That is what we did this year, what we did last year and what we did every year and what we will continue to do and if Opposition Deputies think that that renewed evidence of Fianna Fáil's social conscience was partly responsible for their failure in the general election, well, that cannot be helped.  We introduced the Budget at the proper time and then dissolved the Dáil in response, it can be said, to appeals from Opposition Deputies.  Indeed, one of the inducements held out was by the leader of the main Opposition Party that he would act as chauffeur to the Taoiseach for his journey to the park to ask that the Dáil be dissolved.  The Budget was introduced in the normal way and at the normal time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in children's allowances for a family of six children to £10 a month does not make any impression on Deputy Dr. O'Donovan but the increases in the allowance does make a considerable impression on the taxpayer because it is costing £5.278 million which is quite a considerable amount.  Because the children's allowances scheme is such an expensive scheme, covering as it does the whole population, it is difficult to make adjustments to it as often as to the other social welfare schemes.  Of course, the level of children's allowances has to be considered in conjunction with wage increases and with increases in the other social welfare schemes and also in conjunction with the fact that the rates of payment to other social welfare schemes are increased in respect of child dependants as well.  There is no point in trying to allege that because children's allowances may not <Col N="740" /> have kept pace completely with the cost of living the recipients of them have suffered in their standard of living to that extent.  Of course, they have not because wages have increased and the other social welfare schemes have also increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Previously I was making the point about the composition of the Senate of the National University of Ireland and suggesting that since in October next they will have been in office for five years and since efforts at University reform have been going on for more than two years they will have had the opportunity in those years to have dug themselves in. They will be in a position now to influence the outcome of the final settlement in regard to NUI and our whole university problem very much.  They are, in fact, experts at digging in and resisting change and they will have been in office for five years.  They will have had a great deal of warning of what is to come.  In fact the inadequacies of the Senate of NUI have contributed in large part to the present university crisis that exists.  They are inadequacies that cover the whole range of university education.  I do not propose to detail them now but we will have an opportunity later to go into them.  There have been inadequacies in the whole policy in regard to the number of graduates from various faculties and a failure in planning so that we turned out to quite an extraordinary degree doctors, and members of the other professions, for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not tailor our university output to our national needs and we have not been able to harness the university as a power house of ideas which would serve to solve many of the national problems which are not political but technical ones.  If we think of the university as an area bounded by the sea, an extremely complicated area, <Col N="741" /> and if the university by the origin of that word is something which, by the very word itself is meant to cater for every aspect of life, then the failure to bring together the different strands of the nation into a single university has damaged all the strands of the nation and made them less able to understand each other and to contribute the specific virtues they possess.  We have not had the training to get these different bits of the nation to live together through a university.  We have not had reforms in regard to the sort of professional graduate who would be much more responsive to his duties to the country as a whole.  I would lay that particular charge before the medical and legal professions, and to some extent my own veterinary profession, because this is the failure of university training.  Many of these professions are concerned only with the price for which they will sell their services and but little concerned with the contribution their expertise can make to the national well-being.  This seems to me the great reason for not leaving the Senate intact.</P>
    <P>Above all, there is the failure to make the universities in their own structure as democratic as they should be.  The current cry is, of course, for democracy for students, participation by students in the running of the university. They have an unanswerable right to such participation and some of the foolish things they do they might be less inclined to do if they could contribute in a constructive way to the university. That right does not extend only to students.  Perhaps it extends more profoundly to subordinate levels of staff.  We have a structure which is stifling the younger, less senior members of staff and is not enabling them to contribute to the limit of their ability to the development of the university as a whole.</P>
    <P>The essence of the argument for the rapid passing of this Bill is that since the thing is going to be drastically reorganised let us leave the Senate as it is for the moment prior to the reorganisation. But, that Senate is going to have a major influence on the sort of reorganisation that comes and, personally, although I do not wish to discuss <Col N="742" /> the merger at this moment <i>per se</i> or any other way, I want to see the breaking up of the entrenched power blocs in both the universities in Dublin which are resisting change, very often in the interests of their own faculty or their own position inside their own faculty.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the opportunity of re-electing and also the use of the nominations, which is of 13 out of 35 people, should be taken to change the composition of the Senate now to bring it more into line with opinions now than they were five years ago.  There have been five years of immense change.  If we are to have the overdue university reform, then we might well start, rather than finish, by having the greatest possible change in the composition of the Senate itself and for that reason I think this request on the part of the Minister is ill-advised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald suggested in the course of his contribution that if this legislation goes through in its present form for the purpose which he attributed to the Minister the Senate will lose the authority it holds because, in fact, it will not then be holding office according to due process of law.  This, I think, underlines the essential difference between my approach to this Bill and any such Bill that comes before us and Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's in that, as Deputy Dr. Thornley pointed out, the essential function of this House is that, in fact, the due process of law is created here and anything that is done by us is done with that responsibility and in that regard.  I speak as somebody who did have the opportunity of going through university but other than that has no special association with a university at this time.  I speak as somebody whose regard for the universities and the part they have in our community is influenced by the effectiveness of their contribution to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our function here is to discharge that responsibility and, of course, in doing so, to have due regard to the university institutions themselves, to the staffs, to the students and to those who may be in a transient way more associated with them now than we are.  This is a basic principle as far as the discussion <Col N="743" /> of this Bill is concerned.  We cannot, therefore, accept the thesis which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has put forward that we would, in fact, in some way interfere with the autonomy of the university, would tread where we have no right to tread and would do better to let the developments within the university continue at their own pace and in their own time.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested, in fact, that the Senate in their request to the Minister, were, in fact, attempting to legalise an illegality, an illegality which apparently they were guilty of by thinking that they could extend their own life by order.  One does not wish to be picking on words in any debate in this House.  None of us would like to be cross-examined too closely for anything we might have said if the general intent is clear but, when you couple that with the suggestion that we are not acting, to a certain extent, in due process of law here, it becomes clear that there must be a basic misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>If the Senate of the National University applies to the Minister to extend the life of the present Senate, there is nothing inherently illegal in that, nothing in fact, that is in any way associated with an illegality and there is certainly nothing illegal in our giving them such extension as is in the interests of the university&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to assist the Deputy at this point &mdash; I think he has misunderstood me.  The suggestion I made, and it is open to correction by the Minister if I am wrong, is that having quite legally and properly sought an extension by order, the Senate, unaware that this could not be given, allowed time to elapse where they reached the point where it was impossible for them to have an election according to law and what they had requested as a matter of something that was a good idea became something they had to have because they got themselves into an illegal position. That is the point I was making.  Perhaps, I did not make it sufficiently clear.  On the question of due process of law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald may not have had an opportunity just immediately of getting the correct reference but I do not think the Senate had got themselves into an illegal position.  In any event, no illegality could have arisen before October of this year.  So, there is no question of our trying to legalise an illegal situation.  Suggestions of that sort would best be left outside the scope of the consideration of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a fear expressed, not only by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, that we might undermine the moral authority of the universities and the governing bodies.  All of us appreciate that our function is, in fact, not to undermine, but in many ways to supplement and assist them and their students in discharging their function.  To suggest that we could undermine their authority by any legislation of this sort, which is, in fact, a temporary measure, goes beyond the bounds which the public are prepared to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had suggestions, in fact, that this was an attempt to perpetuate the Senate of the National University and, eventually, the Senate of the National University was being spoken of as a self-perpetuating body.  I think Deputy Bruton used that expression.  This is neither an attempt to perpetuate nor to give power of self-perpetuation.  I am not aware of any definition of &ldquo;perpetuation&rdquo;&mdash; an expression which was very widely used in this debate &mdash; which could properly be applied to what the Minister is, in fact, doing, and that is, extending for a limited period, for as brief a period as may be feasible, the Senate of the National University so that the proposals which the Commission on Higher Education are at present considering and which will involve reorganisation of our universities, can be implemented.  We must have regard to the reality of the situation.  In this case in particular we must have regard to the reality of the situation existing, especially in Dublin, between the staffs of the various universities and <Col N="745" /> the departments of the universities, who to some extent appear to have contrary interests.</P>
    <P>These contrary interests may have emanated in some way from the proposals to affect the rationalisation and merger of the two universities in Dublin.  The important thing to realise is that, unlike what Deputy FitzGerald says, there are developments occurring within the university which would indicate that we will have four separate universities in future rather than the proposal that emanated from the commission &mdash; a proposal which we hope and strongly believe the Government are committed to implementing&mdash; if not in its exact form at least in outline &mdash; a proposal that the Irish people are waiting to see implemented.  If we are to be influenced by the developments occurring within the universities themselves we shall not be discharging our responsibilities.  In UCD there would appear to be some doubt as to whether the faculties of law and medicine should be allowed to go to Trinity College in a merged university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>The Chair would point out to the Deputy that, while a relevant reference to the merger might be in order, a discussion on the merger is not in order.  If there were any such proposals, they would have to come before this House before a change could take place and that would be the opportunity for a discussion on such a merger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept with respect the ruling of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I would point out that my comments are related to the comments of Deputy FitzGerald, who went much further on the merger than I have done in my contribution.  However, I also accept that the Chair had frequent difficulty with Deputy FitzGerald on that particular occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy FitzGerald had difficulty with the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he had the same difficulty as I am now experiencing. At any event, proposals for reform should to some extent emanate from the staff and students, but not entirely. What the Minister wishes to do is to <Col N="746" /> give us an opportunity of extending the life of the Senate of the National University so that this House and all associated interests will be able to ensure that apparent developments within UCD &mdash; developments which are contrary to the essential interest of the nation &mdash; are in some way guarded against and that, perhaps, the gift of persuasion may prevail to ensure that those who are most opposed in that college will soften their opposition.  We have been told that nothing will happen this side of Christmas, or indeed this side of the following Christmas.  However, I hope what we are doing here will tend to expedite the developments so necessary in the university structure here in Dublin and, indeed, throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty that Deputy FitzGerald had on this Bill in trying to discuss this proposal without commenting in some way on the merger proposals but I trust that the Chair will show some degree of leniency and understanding provided one does not discuss it, to use a hallowed expression, <i>per se.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Chair will point out to the Deputy that discussion on any proposed merger cannot be allowed at this stage.  If there are any such proposals the matter would have to come before the House but, in any case, it is not appropriate to this Bill that a discussion should take place on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in introducing this Bill that the period of office of ths Senate will be comparatively short.  It is the hope of all of us that it will be comparatively short. Each of us in this House and elsewhere will use his influence and good offices to ensure that the Senate, whose life we are now extending, will not be required to sit as a separate Senate of the National University for too long and that the reorganisation and re-structuring of the university system, which so many of us are waiting for, will be effected expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some copious notes derived from the copious comments of Deputy FitzGerald.  I now must discard them. Each of our universities has the obligation <Col N="747" /> to expand, despite the fact that some Deputies seem to think that Trinity College has no such obligation. Each university has an obligation to cater for the community.  I trust that any views that may be expressed in this House with regard to our universities will be expressed with that essential qualification.</P>
    <P>Lawyers may be very much concerned with the structure and system of the courts, but they are not entitled to think that the courts are there for lawyers.  Lawyers are there to help the functioning of the courts in implementing the administration of justice in precisely the same way as university staffs are there to implement the programme on higher education.  They may be in some ways the instrument of this education but they are not and should never think that they are autonomous of the community.  One view expressed here was that the university staffs are those who are basically concerned, but in fact this matter is the equal concern of each one of us.</P>
    <P>One rather amusing suggestion was made &mdash; perhaps not seriously &mdash; which is quite contrary to anything that we understood of Fianna Fáil.  It was suggested that this was an attempt to get the Hierarchy off the hook, to relieve them of the embarrassment of lifting the ban on Trinity College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wishes to point out that this is grossly irrelevant at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been aware that Fianna Fáil could be credited with introducing any kind of legislation designed to relieve the Hierarchy of embarrassment: on the contrary, I thought that one of our abiding sins was the fact that we did not consult the Hierarchy sufficiently often.  Without intending any offence to the Hierarchy, perhaps this was because their thinking was not in line with Fianna Fáil attitudes.  At any rate, it is amusing to suggest that this may have been the purpose of the proposals which are in some way concerned with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust I will be forgiven if, apparently, I am using Deputy FitzGerald's contribution as my text but in many <Col N="748" /> ways it is a good basis on which to comment.  Deputy FitzGerald suggests that there is a dangerous situation within the university and that if the life of the present senate is extended things will be very serious in the university next autumn.  I recall Deputy FitzGerald making precisely the same observation in the other House during the course of the Local Authority (Higher Education) Grants Bill.  He said that, if the students who were then in the university, did not also get the benefits of the new grants which first year or new students were entitled to, we would have as a direct result of that a dangerous situation, almost a revolution, in the university that autumn.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has not proved to be too good a prophet in that connection.</P>

      <P>I trust that his forebodings in this connection will be equally unrealised.  Whatever else was the source of problems in UCD last autumn, I do not think it was related to that fact.  It was related, as any person reasonably familiar with the situation will agree, to the internal situation of the university itself.  I am glad to hear this matter has been attended to by those directly concerned, even at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have nowadays changing ideas of what a university represents and what representation various groups are entitled to.  These are not changing ideas in the sense that they are new ideas, as has been suggested here.  They are not new ideas of the meaning of a university.  In this country particularly the basic conception of what universities represent has been forgotten.  We are expected now to greet with applause and surprise the fact that we now have staff-student committees and very effective communication, so effective and delicate that we should do nothing here to upset this delicate communication. Surely this type of communication and these developments were always the essence of a university?  If we are concerned here with upsetting what is long overdue in the universities, then we cannot discuss the first sentence of any proposal relating to the universities.  I <Col N="749" /> would hope that the universities would understand that this proposal here is an earnest of the Government's intention to ensure that the reorganisation of our university system will be effected as quickly as possible.  This measure is being introduced because it did not seem worthwhile to have a new election of a body which would hold office for only a comparatively short time. This is the first step on what will be for us all a very exciting journey in the final realisation of the re-structuring of our universities, enabling them to fulfil their fundamental role in the community.</P>
    <P>I wish to come back to the point made that we were casually perpetuating an ancient order.  It is a gross misconception to suggest that this is being done casually or that we are doing so without the interests of the university and the interests of the community in our minds.  This is anything but a casual perpetuation of an ancient order.  It is a very considered extension of the present order with a view to an early introduction of the new order which all of us wait for so impatiently. As Deputy Dr. Thornley has said, education will be one of the most important topics of the Nineteenth Dáil.  It, and other topics, particularly those concerned with social development, will be important.  Those in universities should not be too sensitive to any suggestions from this House emanating from people who represent the community.  They will understand that the suggestions are made by representatives of the community in that capacity.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of universities, which is so often spoken about so loosely, is like any other autonomy.  It is subject to the discipline of the society of which it is an essential part.  No one in university, staff or student, belongs to a special class to whom special standards should apply.  Lecturers and students belong to the community in a certain institution and the same standards of integrity of argument and of effectiveness in the discharge of their responsibilities will be applied to them as will be applied to every other member of society in any other job.  If this Nineteenth Dáil opens the gates of all the universities and of all the institutes <Col N="750" /> of learning, physically and mentally, and, as Deputy Keating has said, if it is able to rid these universities of the power-entrenched blocs and cliques, it would be benefiting the community and, <i>ipso facto</i>, the universities themselves. This will find a large measure of agreement in this House.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is in the vanguard of this type of development.  However, he appears to be far behind community thought on this subject if his views on this Bill can be taken as an adequate expression of his own views.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dr. Thornley and Deputy Keating expressing their views, because both of them are associated with universities.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister will resist the pressures that will arise in consultation, or otherwise, after this Bill has been passed.  I am equally sure that the Minister will take every opportunity of consultation.  The first place in which consultation should take place is in this Assembly, having regard, of course, to the fact that all those concerned at various stages should also be consulted.  The pressures which Deputy Dr. Thornley referred to were the pressures of some entrenched interests of UCD particularly which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald in some way was endeavouring to protect.  We will, I hope, accelerate the tempo of decision making.</P>

      <P>Having heard some members of the Labour Party, I found a new form of affection for their Lordships, the Hierarchy, The Labour Party have been happy to advertise this new form of protection.  Maybe its members are entitled to that after some of the questions raised about them.  Deputy Dr. Thornley raised a question recently about the students themselves.  The students may be conships <Col N="751" /> cerned about this Bill.  They may feel that we are perpetuating something and they may be wondering when they will know whether or not they will be doing their final examinations in a new University of Dublin or doing them in their existing universities.  They may ask whether they will be subjected to examinations on the courses they are now studying or whether they will be expected to study new courses in a reorganised university structure.  All of us could assure Deputy Dr. Thornley that, unless the Minister and his Department and even this House experience a mental blockage of a type unprecedented even in this House, whatever the outcome the students need have no fears that they will be compromised. I say this without consultation with the Minister, his Department or anyone else.  If there is a reorganisation consequent on this Bill, the students can be assured that their interests will not be compromised, whatever other interests may be compromised in some small way along the line.  It is almost certain that the structure in the National University is not adequate to meet present day demands, much less the future demands which a reorganised structure may involve. That is not to say that this is not the most effective and expeditious thing we can do at this time&mdash;to extend the life of the Senate for a limited period so that in its time there will be a new creation which will be more representative and which will commend itself to everybody in this House.  Reforms may be desirable, and if they are, I am quite sure these reforms will get full support from all parties here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to reassure Deputy Thornley that the relevance of the University is something which is increasingly becoming part of the attitude of every Irishman and Irishwoman, particularly in relation to their children and their prospects.  Deputy Thornley was worried that there are some children in Dublin at present for whom a university may never be relevant and that possibly the only association they will have with education after the primary level is in an overcrowded secondary school.  The <Col N="752" /> important thing for all of us to fix our determination on is that the university will be just relevant for those very people, that no longer will it be relevant for privileged people alone.  The Local Authority (Higher Education) Grants Bill, to give it its full title, has gone a long way to ensure that it will be those young boys and girls, who are the very stuff of the nation, for whom the university will be relevant from now on and not for those who have long family associations with the various chairs and various departments.  It no longer has relevance for those interests. It has a relevance for all the children of the nation.  Because of that, I certainly commend this Bill to the House so that the Minister, the Government and this House can get on as quickly as possible with implementing the proposal for a reorganised university which all of us so impatiently wait for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first how much I agree with so much of the previous speaker's contribution, in particular his reference to this sacred cow of the autonomy of the university.  This has been built up meticulously over a long time, like the idea of the untouchability of the university, no matter what it does.  One of the facilities which the university graduate has is to create words such as those.  These people have become the mythmakers in our society because they dominate the society in all the professions&mdash;law, medicine, architecture, engineering, and particularly journalism. They make use of those words, words which most of us have to shy away from, with all their meaning, words and phrases such as the autonomy of the university, the right of freedom of the press, the wonderful work the voluntary hospitals do and the necessity of being very careful about the idea of the merger.  All of those phrases, if they are carefully examined, do not really need to be regarded with such fear and circumspection as they would like us to regard them with.</P>

      <P>I have no special person in mind.  I am talking about the general policy of the national newspapers in any community.  They are the mythmakers.  They constitute the postgraduate education of the primary and secondary schools in relation to our attitudes and ideas.  Therefore, they are a particularly important group in our community.  I am speaking about journalists in general.  I am not talking about any special journalist at all.  They form many ideas.  That is their purpose in our kind of society.</P>
      <P>I claim the right to speak on this issue because it has come before us and also because I have the honour, with Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Moore, of representing a constituency in which two universities, TCD and UCD, are situated.  I also claim the right to speak because I have been a student in both colleges.  I was in TCD 30 years ago&mdash;and I do not think it has changed very much since then &mdash;and I was in UCD five or six years ago.  I would very much deprecate the perpetuation of the Senate as proposed in the Bill.  The whole record of the governing control of University College is not very unlike that of TCD.  There is very little to choose between them. Behind this cloak of autonomy they have really gone on as they please and done as they please without any criticism from anybody.  Fortunately, they have now come to the Dáil and they must hear what we say.  As Deputy O'Kennedy suggested, we can criticise them if we wish since they have come to us for support, sanction and help in their time of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall, as Minister, facing such a situation in relation to the voluntary hospitals, which I feel are run in a small way on similar lines.  They needed help.  I gave them help on my conditions.  My conditions were a predominant position in relation to the board of the hospital, making it into a voluntary local authority hospital.  I feel those people must learn to understand, if they are looking to us for any kind of help at any time, or if, in particular, they are spending money, that we have a perfect right here to criticise them.  I make no apology at all as a politician for interfering, although perhaps that is too strong a word, but <Col N="754" /> certainly for commenting and criticising their behaviour in relation to their responsibility in regard to their university, in regard to the functions and the use of the university and its record in relation to the community and the community needs in the 50 years since we have had control of those institutions.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a very frightening similarly between the function of the university and the misuse of both universities in the last 50 years and the misuse of television in relation to the mass viewer in our society&mdash;these terribly powerful instruments of change in the community: the university and television.  The university is grossly misused and now, as far as one can see, in the same way in creating attitudes and in creating outlook, television is following out much the same pattern in relation to the mass of the people.  However, the discussion is about the universities and I will keep to that point.</P>
    <P>One time I felt a great regret, where a person's education ended at 14 years in the primary school and 15 or 16 years in the secondary school, that they had lost the opportunity of going to the university and to that extent they had missed very much in the creation and moulding of their personalities, their outlook and so on.  After a while, of course, I came to realise that, if a person goes through any of the universities, the chance of his surviving other than as a highly skilled technocrat with a very specific and narrow function to discharge his responsibility as doctor, engineer, architect, barrister, lawyer, or whatever it may be and of becoming fully rounded in his true education, in his philosophical outlook, in his approach to life and the purpose of living, in his role in society, in his attitude to the community and in his responsibilities to the community was in question.  That is the boy from the primary school, the secondary school, the boy from Bolton Street, Kevin Street or any of these other places. Plumbers, carpenters, dentists, lawyers, architects, doctors, engineers&mdash;in the narrowest sense of the word, we are all equally technocrats.  This is a failure of the primary schools, of the secondary schools and, above all, of the universities. <Col N="755" /> They had us at a time when we had plenty of opportunity for thinking, meeting one another for discussions, inter-debate, for consideration of these important roles, our important roles in society.  Instead of offering us this wonderful world of real higher knowledge, of full understanding of one's role as a human being in the community, we were merely converted into being this expert in a very narrow field, of being a doctor, or whatever it might be.</P>
    <P>That is one of the truths which many young people are beginning to understand more fully than my generation understood them and they are beginning to resent that fact.  They are beginning to resent the fact that, as professional people, they are being slotted into a particular role which will bring them, from the cradle through to the grave, in relative comfort and security from want, hunger, and all the rest of it.  But they are finding that that is not enough from life, that they must get a lot more if they are to be really contented people in themselves.  That I believe has been the great failure of our universities in our community.  It was their responsibility to create the kind of person who as Deputy Keating said, would understand that he had a special role in our society; that whatever we were to do, in the fifty years when we have had our freedom, that was a unique and a special problem. The solution was unique and peculiar to the Irish people themselves.  The universities have simply turned out people who have adopted a very narrow and selfish role in society and have perpetuated more or less the kind of society which we took over 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>The general role of the university was to create individuals&mdash;professionals&mdash;who, in the British sense, would service a colonial empire at the time.  As has already been mentioned we turned out a completely unnecessary number of doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects quite irrelevant to the special needs of our own community itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the institution of the Senate, its record has been that it has governed this university in a particular way which has eventuated in the university's becoming a source of considerable trouble in recent years.  It has a record in relation to its behaviour, documented extremely well in the Kenny Report, in which, for a number of years, it completely ignored its powers and its authority under its constitution.  The House will probably recall the episode in its creation of a number of posts which it had no right to create at all&mdash;assistant lectureship posts and the lectureship posts, and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the Senate has a responsibility to the Governing Body.  The Governing Body also created professorships and assistant lectureships and the Senate made little or no attempt to supervise this kind of activity and allowed this kind of activity to continue.  To that extent, in my view, it did not discharge its responsibilities to the community.  As was pointed out at that time, considerable public money was involved.  There was this extraordinary system of appointments.  There were clear overtones or suggestions certainly of nepotism, of unfair practices, in relation to the making of appointments&mdash;putting forward one individual to the appointing board, and so on.  Obviously, this was not the behaviour of people who had a true sense of their responsibility to the community which was providing the money to pay for the running of the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this Senate has not discharged its responsibilities to the community in a responsible way and in my view does not deserve to be perpetuated. Certainly, on its record of refusal to recognise the statutes, the Constitution, the laws under which it should have governed its own actions, it certainly is in no position to lecture <Col N="757" /> the students who recently showed a similar disregard for what they were told were their legal responsibilities and the rights of the university to be regarded as the final arbiter in matters of discipline and behaviour and practices and attendance at lectures and behaviour at lectures and so on.  The Governing Body of UCD has lost any right to respect by the students and in my view they are simply not fit to govern.  Looking at the matter in the broader sense, which the Ceann Comhairle asked me to leave and which I suppose we shall discuss at a later date, of the true purpose of the individual in the university, they have failed and even in the narrow sense of the administration of a university they have failed.  For that reason, in my view, they do not deserve to be perpetuated as a responsible organisation.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of the merger&mdash;I am not going to discuss it in any detail &mdash;seems to me a particularly superficial solution for problems which go very much more deeply than anybody appears to have given any consideration to&mdash;certainly, up to the present.  It seems to me to be a business arrangement to rationalise the services in two universities rather like two businesses coming together in a merger in order to save personnel or save expense or to make things more efficient.  However, it did not, it seemed to me, have the basic objective of creating a university which would discharge its true function to the community of turning out young men and women who would be prepared to serve the community, to make serious contributions to the very difficult social, economic and financial problems which we certainly have in the country.</P>
    <P>The approach to the merger was simply that of two universities coming together to form one bigger university and to carry on much as before.  In regard to the whole business of appointments, I do not think there is much to choose between the two of them&mdash;the Knights of Columbanus predominantly in University College and the Freemasons in Trinity College&mdash; and the two of them going on together presumably sharing out the different jobs to suit themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to develop the points beyond that.  It seems that the whole question of the breakdown of this proposal resolves itself very much into any comparable type of breakdown which we often see referred to as the who does what disputes of the trade union movement &mdash;and little more than that.</P>
      <P>As to the idea of student representation on the new governing body or the new organisation which will control the universities, I have not the same enthusiasm that most people seem to have or the same belief that if we get predominant student representation on any governing body we will thereby solve all the emotional conflicts and difficulties which exist in the universities. This is part of the mythology which is being built up about the true reasons for the dissatisfaction and dissent which we have found in recent months in Ireland.  To a considerable extent I believe that much of the student unrest here was imitative, that it was not basically a serious conflict on social issues, a certain unrest, a certain discontent and that there is a failure to analyse in any great depth the reason for this unrest and discontent.  The truth is that the student of today is the professional of tomorrow, the person who has accepted the <i>status quo,</i> who has accepted the standard, who has ceased to question social injustice in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ninety-five to 98 per cent of the products of universities end up in one or other of the two conservative parties, accepting the establishment as they find it and refusing to change it.  I see no reason why the present generation of students, 95 per cent of them, will not do precisely the same thing.  I feel it is to miss out the reality of the failure over the years in Ireland to democratise the universities and to open them to everybody who is intellectually capable of going into the universities.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald seemed to wish to disown the fact that there might not be a sort of bourgeoisie in University <Col N="759" /> College which there is in Trinity College. Of course, there is in both colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that I do not think it will solve, as has been suggested by other Deputies, all our problems if we simply import a number of students in to become the governing body of our universities just as it will not solve our trouble to perpetuate a body such as the Senate.  I think we have a right to say what we think will help and what we think will not help.  I believe that the only thing which will solve the whole university crisis is when we have the student body in the university representative of the total community and not of a minority within the community.  That can only be achieved by extending free education to the universities in the form of scholarships based on intellectual capacity and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the governing body I believe that the junior staff have a right, naturally, to a say in these things but the junior staff of today is the senior staff of tomorrow and is likely to become just as involved in the exploitation of the inequities of university life as the others when they have the opportunity. Similarly in relation to the senior staff they obviously should have representation. I believe that the Dáil must have representation of some kind.  I believe also that the trade union movement has a right to representation in any kind of university structure so that we have a very much broader representation of the community than this precious, private enclave of the universities, whether Trinity or University College, <Col N="760" /> Galway, Dublin or Cork.  I feel that they have failed in the job we gave them to do 50 years ago.  They have had 40 to 50 years to create the true university which we wanted to see here and they have failed to do that.  Now they have come to us for help and I believe the help should be given on our terms.  It is not so important&mdash;certainly in the past it has not been so important&mdash;what Trinity College do in relation to their education.  They gave us a narrow, technical education and nothing more but it is very important what happens in relation to UCD because it happens to supply the majority of professional and technical expertise in all aspects of our lives, the different professions including, if Deputy Dr. FitzGerald will forgive my saying so, the journalists, these people who shape opinions and, of course, the legal people who form such a high component of one of the Parties and, to a growing extent, the other party and, therefore, the people who make our laws and so decide whether society will continue on in its fixed monolithic unchanging pattern of life left to us by the British or whether we create a completely new one which is unique and peculiar to our needs.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will seriously consider the desirability of not perpetuating this Senate.  If there is any way in which he can avoid doing it I sincerely hope he will because it certainly does not need to be perpetuated in this very responsible position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one brief comment on this measure.  In welcoming the new Minister we in the Labour Party can certainly give interim approval to the particular continuation of the Senate itself.  My only comment is that the fact that we may not particularly oppose the measure proposed by the Minister does not necessarily give an indication that we would not wish him to go further and to recast the general setting of the Senate within the university structure.  In particular we hope that this is a short term measure he has sought from the House and that he will utilise the breathing space now given to him to undertake a far more radical, perceptive and greater in depth review generally <Col N="761" /> of the university system as a whole within the educational structure of the country.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on us that while we have a Senate of a university we do have also a growing multitude of educational structures in the country. We have a primary system, a vocational system, a secondary system, a secondary tops system.  We have, in addition, comprehensive, tentatively proposed, schools throughout the country and superimposed on this at the university level we have more regional colleges of technology and then we have technical colleges themselves.  In a nation of our size where it should be possible to manage our educational system in a far more rational and constructive manner one begins to haggle at the further imposition and superimposing of more forms of educational structures. Therefore, I hope the Minister will&mdash;I think it should be his first task&mdash;bring about in the educational structure more dramatic and general rationalisation measures than we have seen in this Bill.  This can only be done by involving the universities in a far greater measure of public accountability.  They have lived so far in their own relatively isolated and one might say isolationist attitude within the educational structure. They survive and they obtain from the taxpayers very substantial annual subventions and, nevertheless they seem by virtue of their senior position, their superior academic positions and so on, to wish to be of it in terms of taxpayers' subventions but not part of it in terms of public accountability so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the particular attitude of my Party and I have no doubt the Senate will be getting some cold shivers, either in a reconstituted form or in a continued form as in this Bill, by the time we in the Opposition have fully conveyed our views to the Minister.  Therefore, with this additional comment on our part in regard to education, it is our wish not to oppose this measure but there will have to be quite dramatic re-thinking particularly on the part of the academic staffs and the Senate of the universities in terms of future educational development.  This is not very evident at present.  The worst <Col N="762" /> characteristics of academic life were shown in the reaction to the merger proposal.  The continued equivocation of the previous Minister and his attempts to be all things to all men on all occasions in relation to the merger certainly did not give the academics much ground to be more constructive than they were.  Nevertheless, the overall mess that emerged during the merger discussion reflected little credit on the previous Minister and on some of the staffs directly concerned.</P>
    <P>I have no special love for the autocratic by-product of the national university system, the Senate as such, and I feel very strongly that the whole university system needs a considerable overhaul.  It always amazes me that the ordinary Irish worker must work a 40-hour week and is paid so much per hour and that our universities are closed for 30 odd weeks of the year whereby one of the most costly and valuable national resources lies idle while the occupants, both staff and students, proceed on their conventional and rather lengthy withdrawal from academic life.  I say this with due reference to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald because he has no difficulty in occupying his extra-university time.</P>
    <P>I submit that the extent of academic research, subvented, authorised and encouraged by the university Senates has been, in many respects, quite marginal. I feel that when I have to face in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire an overcrowded class of 50 young children being taught by one national teacher or a great shortage of secondary school places and when one visits in the summer holidays the empty Irish universities one feels that the scales of social priority are a bit cock-eyed in the year 1969.  Likewise, I urge the Minister to consult with the Senate in the hope that, perhaps, he would get the Senate itself and its members, most of whom have very little appreciation, in my opinion, of the growing industrialisation of the country and the need for a very different orientation of future education and development, to fuse in the near future and get into line with the development of the regional colleges of technology and the regional colleges themselves.  It would be an absolute scandal and a total waste of national resources if we <Col N="763" /> spent millions putting up nine regional colleges of technology while our universities sit on the sidelines developing a separate stream without direct involvement. This cannot be allowed even if we have a national budget of £400 million per year from which we spend an ever-increasing proportion on education.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also encourage within his own Department more forthrightness on the part of many of his officers.  I was very pleased to see Mr. O'Connell particularly coming out and making his views known without any reticence and standing over them as a public officer, giving public expression to his views as he thought fit and not being crucified except by the former Deputy Dillon who, of course, has &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; about public servants which may not necessarily be shared by all of us.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister's development unit, his own planning unit, although sparsely staffed and not given as full a break as it should get in many areas of educational research, particularly research into what precisely happens in universities, will be enabled to function properly. He has my full sympathy as Minister in trying to find out what happens in the universities particularly in terms of expenditure.  I hope he will get full backing from the Dáil on this occasion.</P>
    <P>These are my personal views.  I have no doubt that within three or four years the Minister will bring in many educational measures which I hope will transform our educational scene.  I have no doubt that with Deputy FitzGerald on the Fine Gael side and Deputy Thornley on our side as Opposition spokesmen we shall have a constructive attitude from the Opposition. I hope, therefore, that the work which was begun and urged on by the Labour Party in 1963 when we published our educational policy document, &ldquo;Challenge and Change&rdquo; at a time when free education was not fashionable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What struck me very forcibly in the debate on this Bill is the ability of certain academics in the course of discussion to make relatively simple problems sound very complex.  In fact, they make them appear as almost insoluble.  That being so, I find myself in replying having to refer to matters to which I would not normally refer.</P>
      <P>This, I would have thought, is a simple enabling Bill.  It permits the Government to accede to the request of the Senate of the National University of Ireland to extend its period of office for one year.  I have no doubt that in the circumstances it is a sensible and practical measure.  I should like to clear the air for the Deputies opposite.  This Bill has not been brought into the Dáil for the purpose of legalising the position in relation to the Senate election due to an oversight.  In fact, the Senate has still got time, if it so wishes, to give the necessary three months notice. It is brought in because, as I said a moment ago, I feel it is a practical measure in the circumstances, particularly in view of the proposed dissolution of the National University of Ireland.</P>

      <P>No.  I had hoped, and I say this very seriously, that Deputy FitzGerald would endeavour to get away from the Fine Gael mentality of running away from difficulties and latching on to what may appear for the moment to be a popular stand, but I find that this erstwhile protagonist of the merger who had, I may say, on many occasions pointed out the need for it in order to serve the real interests of higher education now tends to blow hot and cold whenever the whip is cracked, and I am not just referring to the Parliamentary Whip either.</P>

      <P>It is in line with the Fine Gael policy on many aspects of education because I can remember not very long ago in this House when we introduced a new matter in relation to education the Fine Gael Party at that time claimed we had stolen the policy from them but, as soon as the sharp breezes began to blow, they scurried for cover and I am afraid education ran a <Col N="766" /> rather poor second to political expediency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows that.  Deputy FitzGerald attacked the present structure of the National University of Ireland Senate in unequivocal terms as undemocratic, unrepresentative and unwieldy, and then proceeded to demand that a new election be held on the same structure.</P>

      <P>Surely it would be more sensible and reasonable to cater for what appears to be in the Deputy's mind in relation to adequate staff and student representation on college councils, to wait for the introduction of omnibus legislation in this regard? I think myself that would be a justification for the present interim Bill. When queried by Deputy de Valera as to why he could possibly want a new Senate election to take place on the structure which he so roundly condemned, the only reason Deputy Fitzgerald could give was that there would be new faces in the new Senate, as if this were a justification in itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>He also mentioned the fact that the governing body of UCD now intended holding elections and said that the reason why they had not held elections previously over the past two years, was that they believed when the merger was first announced that it would take place quickly and there would be no need for elections. I am sure the Deputy is not so naive as to believe that a responsible body so close to the government, as it were, of the university could at any time believe it was possible to have such a complex matter dealt with very quickly. I have no doubt that there are other reasons why the governing body may have decided to proceed with elections this year, and I am sure no doubt that Deputy FitzGerald is well aware of what they are. <Col N="767" /> He suggested that the Senate would lose its authority if its life were extended and that all sorts of troubles would ensue.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that the fact that the life of the governing body was extended was responsible in any way for the troubles which took place this year?</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the creation of social divisions which would arise if certain faculties were to go to Trinity College.  I would imagine that one of the benefits to be gained from the merger and from the university grants scheme is that a fair cross-section of Irish life would be represented in both colleges.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's strongest argument against the merger related to what he termed the lopsided allocation of faculties.  I will not anticipate the advice I may get from the Higher Education Authority but I will say this much&mdash;the allocation of faculties as proposed on 6th July, 1968, was largely in keeping with what less than three months previously had been proposed by the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  This is a body with which I believe Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley are closely associated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened quietly and patiently to the Deputy and I assume I have the right to reply.  Arising from this, if, as Deputy FitzGerald said, there was such unanimity against the merger on the part of the staffs of UCD and TCD, why did the Irish Federation of University Teachers on 10th April, 1968, put forward submissions in relation to the allocation of disciplines and subjects which did not differ in any substantial way from the proposals announced subsequently by the Minister in July of the same year?  I put it to Deputy FitzGerald that his opposition to the latter proposals is of comparatively recent growth and for reasons best known to himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald also spoke about moves that are afoot which rule out the possibility of the merger going through in the foreseeable future.  My information is that, apart from some vague talk on the part of individuals or groups, no practical alternative has been put forward by anyone to the proposals of 6th July, 1968.  He also spoke of co-ordination of the facilities by the two independent universities.  He may be an optimist, but I have considerable doubts as to whether this would function.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley took the same line as Deputy FitzGerald of agreeing to the Bill because there was a legal necessity for it.  I have already explained that is not so.  The Deputy then went on to refer to our policy as one of delay and deferment.  I believe in the democratic process of discussion and dialogue to solve problems.  I wonder what would the Deputy have to say if we rushed the University Bill through without consultation.  Perhaps I should not say I wonder, because in fact I know.  He would call us arrogant, though that word seems to have gone out of vogue since the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thornley then went on to <Col N="769" /> make a number of statements, unaware perhaps of the facts but obviously not very concerned by them.  He stated that the announcement of 6th July, 1968, was made without any consultation whereas, in fact, it was made only after months and months of discussion with representatives of UCD and TCD. He spoke of the Higher Education Authority and stated that nobody knew what their terms of reference were when, in fact, the terms of reference were published.  I have here a copy of them which was published on 15th August, 1968.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Thornley's reference to the Higher Education Authority, one of the reasons for the present Bill is the desire not to do anything which would anticipate the recommendations of the Authority.  Until I have received them, I cannot tell what they will contain.  Certainly, they will affect very much the university structure in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I was interested&mdash;perhaps I may be excused if I say I was a little amused &mdash;by Deputy Keating's statement in regard to the Bill.  He spent a considerable time trying to make the Fianna Fáil Government responsible for the Senate of the National University.  Considering the fact that the Act under which the Senate of the National University is constituted was passed in 1908, and that the Government have the right to nominate only four members to that body, the Deputy will have considerable difficulty in proving his point.</P>
    <P>One further point I should like to stress when dealing with accusations of delay.  We are at the present time engaged on what is going to amount to a complete reorganisation of higher education in this State.  Let there be no unnecessary delay but at the same time let us take all the steps that common prudence demands to ensure that our reorganised system will be the best that we can possibly make it.  To that end we will require the assistance of every person in this House and outside it who has a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>I should imagine if the particular suggestion made by the Deputy were discussed at a meeting of the Senate of the National University of Ireland, though I would not expect gales of <Col N="770" /> laughter from such an august body, I have no doubt there would be considerable deep throated chuckles because, while the NUI Senate may have been criticised on many occasions for many things championing Fianna Fáil has not been one of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the merger, or perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;merger&rdquo; which is now an emotive word, but rather the formation of a unified University of Dublin, while it does not arise for discussion under this Bill it should not be assumed for a moment that it is dead. What is, in fact, happening as I mentioned earlier is that detailed recommendations from the Higher Education Authority in relation to its implementation are awaited.  I favour the careful consideration of all the problems. They are many and varied, but I feel that it is clear to everybody that our first and basic aim must be to get the greatest possible return from our resources.  We cannot afford, educationally or financially, to duplicate the very costly services now required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be glad to have constructive advice from any quarter.  The authority is, I know, anxious to have all points of view, particularly those that are constructive and capable of practical application.  Those whose interests lie in the development and expansion of our educational system will have my full co-operation.  There may be those who for selfish or other ulterior motives endeavour to hold on to what they have and in the process obstruct our efforts to provide a more rational and more efficient higher education service. I would ask these people to think well about that they are doing.  In education, at all levels, it is not the Minister, the teachers or others associated with its administration who are the most important people.  The really <Col N="771" /> important people are the students.  We must try, all of us, to approach this problem from a fully objective viewpoint, and not to allow our personal involvements to cloud our judgment because as I said earlier what we decide now will determine for many years to come the future of higher education.</P>

Usually, on the introduction of the Finance Bill or during the Budget debate, we were informed of increases in postal charges, but now in this section&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;the Minister is proposing to take unto himself, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the right to increase charges for postal packages.

This is not so.  The position is that, up to now, I, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if I wanted to get an increased charge, say, for postage, had <Col N="772" /> to get the Minister for Finance to move this and implement it on my behalf.  The only change that is taking place from that point of view is that any statutory instrument that does not involve finance&mdash;the Minister for Finance is of this opinion and I share it &mdash;should be implemented by me.  In the same way written into section 2 is a provision that if I wish to make any change which does involve finance I must get the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>

Now the regulation is made by me, having submitted it to the Minister for Finance and having got his permission so to do.  That is the only change.  Up to now I had to prevail upon the Minister for Finance to do this and he did it.  Now, after getting his permission, I do it.

It provides for the transfer of the powers under sections 4 and 82 of the Act of 1908 to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance in regard to financial aspects.  Section 4 of the Act of 1908 empowers the Minister for Finance, as the successor of the Treasury, to make by warrant regulations for carrying into effect postal arrangements with foreign States; and section 82 of the 1908 Act gives general power to the Minister for Finance, again as the successor of the Treasury, to make by warrant regulations with respect to any matter which is authorised or required by the Act to be effected by Post Office regulations.

      <P>The position is that 50 per cent of the total mail posted in Dublin on any given day arrives into the sorting office in Sheriff Street between 4 o'clock and 6.30 in the evening and it has to be dealt with at that stage.  If it were possible to leave printed matter, bills, circulars and so on, that are paid for at the cheaper rate, over until the following morning for sorting and despatch that would enable us to give a faster treatment to what we call &ldquo;first-class mail&rdquo;, the closed letter with the sixpenny stamp.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is not logical for my Department to make arrangements to take in 200 or 300 temporary sorters between 4 and 6 o'clock in the evening. It has to be balanced out.  Indeed, the trade union concerned would be very much opposed to our taking in temporary people for two and a half or three hours and it is with a view to spreading out the work properly over the day that we have brought in this provision.  The postal sorter works what I describe as unsociable hours.  During the ordinary standard day we want to be able to channel the volume of work spread over an ordinary standard day in order to suit the majority of the staff.  It is not a question of understaffing. Even if I were to look favourably at this idea of taking on an additional 50 or 100 extra staff to cover the period between 4 o'clock and 6.30 p.m. the results would defeat the purpose because people would be in each other's way.  There would be a certain degree of immobility.  The whole idea of this is to stagger the sorting and the best way to do that is, I think, to take the power to enable us to defer this second-class mail until the following morning.</P>

By and large, we <Col N="779" /> welcome section 4 because it will undoubtedly get rid of excessive late afternoon and late evening work by postal staffs while still ensuring that the bulk of the mail posted is delivered the following day.  Mail can be sorted on an early morning sorting for late afternoon delivery in the big urban blockage areas, postal surplus-wise.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I asked the following question of the Minister for Local Government:</P>
      <P>the reason for his decision to permit office blocks at 44-45 St. Stephen's Green and 18-19 Hume Street and at 46-49 St. Stephen's Green and 1-2 Hume Street, Dublin to be erected by a firm (name supplied).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The name of the firm is the Green Property Development Company Limited.  I feel that the Minister's response to the questions put by me and by Deputy Dr. Browne was less than frank, that his reply was evasive <Col N="781" /> and is open to question in the public interest.  The Minister and the public at large are fully aware that Dublin Corporation refused permission to the Green Property Development Company Limited to redevelop these particular properties.  The general grounds for refusal were that the particular plan submitted did not accord with the extended draft development plan for Dublin city as envisaged at that time.  I would point out to the Minister that the draft development plan clearly set down that all the properties in Hume Street had been listed for preservation under schedule B of the plan, with the exception of Nos. 1 and 10 Hume Street which had been listed for schedule C. I would further remind the Minister that notwithstanding the democratic decision of Dublin Corporation to refuse planning permission he ignored this quite democratic local sanction arrived at after the most careful scrutiny and careful consideration by the now defunct Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Once again, the Minister set himself up, quite wrongly, and quite open to question, as almost the total arbiter of what is desirable for the future social and physical environment in our capital city.  This is something which I deplore and on which the Minister should give more elaboration than he gave in his reply today.  I respectfully submit to him, through the Chair, that we have seen an almost total surrender on his part on virtually all the essential points of the appeal by the Green Property Development Company to the Minister. The sanction by the Minister both in scale and in character most certainly was not a judgement in keeping with the concept of the Planning and Development Act, 1963.  The Minister conveyed, I think wrongly, an impression of general limitation in the permitted density that he indicated.  In the first instance, the phraseology of the original Government statement was somewhat misleading.  He conveyed the impression of a restriction of the total office area to blocks of 16,000 square feet and 63,000 square feet.  In fact, the company is generally acknowledged to have obtained the maximum possible density, but this is by the way.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the <Col N="782" /> consideration indicated in his answer this afternoon as to the provision for 50 or more car park spaces and so on, access to and egress from car parking areas by way of Bell Lane and these general pre-conditions certainly do not in any way override the general principle that, where a local authority after due deliberation rejects an appeal by a company and more particularly as that authority is not now in existence or in a position to revoke and rescind the decision of the Minister granting that appeal, it is very much open to question that the Minister should act in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Minister showed contempt for the responsible and informed views of bodies concerned with general architectural preservation and the future social environment of Dublin.  I do not hold any brief for nor am I a member of An Taisce or the Dublin Civil Group or the Irish Georgian Society but I maintain that these bodies had an interest and had expressed their viewpoints right down from 1966, when the sudden demolition occurred in a sector of the properties after outline planning permission was obtained and, overnight, we had this exercise set in train.  I suggest that the Minister ignored the responsible comments of these organisations and in that, I suggest to him, he acted contrary to the public interest.  We must receive some explanation from the Minister in relation to an assurance which allegedly was given by the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons.  I have no firm basis of quotation for it but I am assured and I would like to find from the Minister if, in fact, he gave this assurance that future development would be in line with the Dublin civil plan and if, in fact, he now stands as having somewhat repudiated the general sympathy of Deputy Gibbons in relation to the representations he received on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I would stress to the Minister the broader and more important aspects of this decision.  I consider it an indictment. It is a positive and a questionable encouragement to any developer from abroad or internally.  I am not concerned with the ethics of any developer coming in from outside Ireland <Col N="783" /> at this time but I do suggest that the Minister is openly encouraging developers to flaunt the decisions of local authorities, to speculate, as they did speculate, £200,000 odd and risk very substantial sums of money in the hope of the Minister's liberal, political&mdash;I will say political&mdash;interpretation and the expectation on their part of an ultimate favourable reaction from the Minister on appeal.  This is the kind of speculative gambling which will place on the records of his Department quite questionable precedents and ones which will open for future successors in his office or in terms of case histories for planning appeals and so on, aspects which it will certainly be difficult to apprehend.</P>
    <P>I do not particularly set out to attack the Green Property Development Company. It could be any company.  It could be native or it could be foreign. It is the general principle of the question involved.  One must say that there has been in relation to the Green Property Development Company the particular involvement of the late Mr. Marcus Leaner, former Chairman of the Allied Land and Investment company of London.  Admittedly, the man has died.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on his particular activities but he was one of the leading speculative London merchant bankers engaged in land speculation, who came here when the going got rough in Britain and when there was no capital gains tax in operation in Ireland&mdash;something we in our Party have repeatedly called for.  One can come to Ireland, invest as much money as one wishes and then leave with a tax-free gain. With no land development tax in operation in Dublin as would operate in London, with no rigid restrictions in operation in Dublin as would operate in London, then, quite frankly, the Minister seems to have been fair game for what happened on that occasion and, certainly, in my opinion, succumbed to the representations made to him.</P>
    <P>It is said that there were State properties involved within the properties concerned.  I will give only one case where that is alleged: No. 19 Hume Street.  One must ask the Minister <Col N="784" /> who authorised the sale of those properties and could the Minister, in relation to any State legal involvement in respect of those properties, say did anybody authorise the sale of the ground rents relating to those properties prior to their eventual occupation by the Green Property Development Company.  One must ask explicitly for far greater detail than we got in the brief repetition of the Minister's statement here.  One must ask for greater elaboration in the public interest from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the disquieting aspects which we must point out.  This is not a small speculation.  If one takes an area of 200,000 square feet, and works it out at 30s a square foot in rental, one talks in terms of rentals of £300,000 per annum and if one multiplies that by ten one reaches the figure of £3 million which would be a nice figure to collect in terms of the sale of that property following the expenditure of, say, £1 million to build the place and another expenditure of, say, £¾ million to purchase the land&mdash; not a bad picking, I would say, for anybody with the money to become involved in that kind of operation, provided one had some assurance, some anticipation, that one would not be caught on the question of planning permission in regard to that development. It automatically brings into question the involvement of the State, the extent to which the Cabinet was involved in this decision, in view of the involvement of the other areas in St. Stephen's Green, government-wise, and that is something in respect of which we are entitled to more general explanation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Dublin Corporation, now being extinct, does not have the normal powers and circumstances to again overrule the Minister's decision on this matter.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that were Dublin Corporation now in existence, within a matter of days, the Minister's decision to grant the appeal would, in fact, be further rejected by that corporation. It is my considered opinion that the effect on the public representatives no longer in formal office and, indeed, the effect on the staff of local <Col N="785" /> authorities whereby a Minister acts in such a cavalier manner can only be disappointing.</P>
    <P>It would be futile for me to speculate that the city commissioner, Mr. Garvan, will be given the opportunity to overrule the Minister in relation to this particular appeal because if he were to do this he would undoubtedly find himself redundant within a number of hours.  Therefore, the only protection that can be had is within this House and it falls to us to endeavour on the Adjournment of the House to provide that measure of protection.  The whole procedure with regard to planning appeals in this country is coming in for very serious public criticism.  It is a procedure which cannot be tolerated and is one which would not be accepted in any democratic form of local government.  It certainly is a procedure which must give rise to more than just a measure of disquiet.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with what the Minister said in his report to the effect that he would have regard to the evidence tendered in writing, to that given at the oral hearing of the appeal, which took 23 hours to hear, and to the report of his inspector on the proceedings.  In some respects I think the Minister has been maligned for some things that developed in public life purely perhaps because of temperamental reaction by him on some occasions.  I suggested to him this afternoon that he could satisfy us on the questions we have raised here by placing the evidence tendered in writing and the full report of his inspector on these proceedings in the Library of the House, together with the details of the appeal by the Green Property Planning Company, so that our fears could be allayed or confirmed, as the case may be.  But in the present situation we have a public obligation to raise the matter.  With that I let it rest in the hope of a more constructive and more general elaboration on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the appeal made by Deputy <Col N="786" /> Desmond.  The Minister, when speaking this afternoon, seemed to be suggesting that there was no alternative to the decision he had taken.  It seems to me that this was facetious.  He seemed to be saying that we must have office blocks and that they could only be put in this particular place.  I do not accept this.  There are many parts of the city where these blocks could more easily be sited.  They need not be sited in that one part of the city which needs and merits preservation.</P>
      <P>It would be desirable for the further development of our city if office blocks were built in those areas which are decaying and where there is nothing of architectural merit to preserve.  It is untrue to suggest that there is no alternative use for these houses.  Anyone who knows anything about property in this area knows, first of all, that there is a tendency for property to be recovered and improved in character. There are streets of Georgian houses in this area, some of which have been allowed to decay to some degree but which are now increasingly being purchased by people for use in their existing form and shape as offices and without in any way damaging their exterior appearance or, indeed, in many cases without affecting their interior appearance either.  I know of houses changing hands in this particular Georgian area of Dublin for sums of up to £30,000 and the purchasers are willing to spend a further £20,000 or even more on them in order to convert them into office accommodation within their existing form.</P>
      <P>If we maintain the ban on the pulling down of those houses and the building of office blocks in their place, this particular area will be maintained and people will pay a price for them appropriate to their value and will maintain them.  There is no question of there being no alternative to this proposal as suggested by the Minister.  He seems to me to be suggesting that in some way the pass has been sold by certain developments that have taken place in St. Stephen's Green and that, therefore, one could not object to this further development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a point on this principle that, if one part of an <Col N="787" /> area is developed in this way, it follows that the adjoining area can be developed in the same way.  If that principle is carried to its logical conclusion, the entire area will be nibbled away and the area destroyed.  The property I am talking about is now related entirely to Stephen's Green. Some of the houses are, of course, in St. Stephen's Green, but the impact of this development will be to destroy Hume Street, which up to now has been completely preserved from its entrance to St. Stephen's Green up to Ely Place.  This is unique in so far as it is the only small street of its kind in Dublin which still remains; to connive at its destruction at this stage would be a criminal act.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask, too, for more information about the assurance given by Deputy Gibbons; what is the position about this assurance and whether we are correctly informed about it? Every interest concerned is up in arms about this subject; it is not simply a question of some group of enthusiasts. An Taisce, the body whose function it is to have regard to these matters, are interested; Bord Fáilte have been interested also and Dublin Corporation have, of course, backed up An Taisce's proposal by treating as an area requiring preservation the area which it is proposed to develop.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he should not connive at the destruction of part of our heritage for the benefit of speculators who have no interest whatsoever in this country except an interest to make money out of it.  There was a time when Fianna Fáil were concerned with the preservation of the heritage of this country.  I would have thought that the Minister belonged to that element in the Party that is still concerned with preserving what we inherited in the past, so it is disappointing that he, in particular, should connive at something that will destroy our heritage for the benefit of people from outside the country who have no interest in this country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us more details as to the ownership of these properties.  Are some of them still State property, owned by the State or <Col N="788" /> leased by the State?  Have any of them been sold recently and, if so, to whom?  If they have not been sold, is it proposed to sell them?  If they are leased at the moment, for how long are these leases to run and is it proposed to dispose of them before these leases run out?  We are entitled to the facts in regard to this matter.  The Minister cannot shrug off his responsibility by saying that he is merely the Minister responsible for planning and that they are owned by the Minister for Finance.  He is well able to get the information required and it is up to him to find out the position as to the ownership of the houses.</P>
    <P>I make an appeal to the Minister, which may be the last appeal in the circumstances, to see that this part of the city is preserved.  If these houses are pulled down, the damage will be irretrievable.  I cannot believe that the present Government wish to go down in history as the Government that connived at the destruction of our capital city and of so much that is of value in it.  It does not seem to me that there can be any benefit to Fianna Fáil in acquiring that reputation for philistinism. The party ought to be concerned with their reputation as well as being concerned with the interests of the city and the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a Dubliner and he ought to be as personally concerned with this matter as others of us are. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider this matter and will realise how irretrievable the damage would be. There are many things that the Government can undo if they turn out to be mistakes and all Governments make mistakes but there are certain things that cannot be undone and this is one of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply today explained the position fairly well.  The fact is that there existed a valid outline permission in respect of portion of this site. The announcement of the planning objectives of Dublin Corporation in regard to this particular area and these particular houses was made after that outline permission was granted.  The fact is that these bodies, which have <Col N="789" /> been described here as watch-dogs on behalf of the public, were asleep on the job at the appropriate and critical time and that the permission given was not appealed at a time when it could have been effectively done and when it was, in fact, practical to preserve these houses.  The fact is that the planning authority apparently, at a time when they contemplated adopting a planning objective to preserve some of these houses, actually gave permission for the demolition of these houses and the re-development of them.  That permission necessarily involved demolition. The fact is that this demolition was carried out while the so-called watch-dogs, who are now trying to cover up their inactivity by bogus attacks on me, were asleep and did not carry out what has been described here as their function of protecting the national heritage at a time when this could have been effectively done.  It was not done and these people are trying to cover up their own dereliction of duty and are trying to blame me for their own mistakes.  What I was asked to do was to try to undo the damage that had been done, not by me, but by the planning authority with the connivance of these people who are now lauded to the skies and who are parading themselves as watch-dogs.  They were asleep at the appropriate time when they could have prevented the demolition of part of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am being asked to require somebody to reconstruct these houses which have been knocked down and to put into proper condition houses which have been declared to be dangerous buildings by the Dublin Corporation. I am being asked to impose on the retepayers of Dublin a liability for substantial compensation in respect of this valid permission which was granted, and there was a reasonable assumption arising out of that permission and before these planning objectives were made public that this type of development was appropriate to that particular area.  It is an unreasonable request and when the Deputies opposite say that they have no doubt that the elected members of Dublin Corporation would revoke this permission I am prepared to concede that is probably true.  But is also true to say that, having done <Col N="790" /> that, they would then refuse to strike the rate providing the compensation that would be awarded in a court of law.</P>
    <P>I am being asked to undo the damage that was caused and that was not objected to by these watch-dogs in An Taisce and Bord Fáilte and by all these people who are now behaving in this irresponsible manner.</P>

      <P>It is now too late.  I have listened to all the insinuations of Deputy Desmond and his colleague without interruption.  They got 20 minutes between them.  The Deputy is not now prepared to allow me ten minutes to reply to these allegations which he has been making here.  This is a tactic which has been deliberately developed by the Fine Gael Party of raising matters on the Adjournment, taking their full 20 minutes, and then trying to prevent me from replying by their disorderly interruptions.  It is a tactic which can succeed.  If Deputy Desmond does not want a reply to this then he need not have it.</P>
      <P>The position is that part of this site has been demolished on foot of valid permission granted by the planning authority, and not granted by me.  This permission was not appealed by any of these people who parade themselves as watch-dogs on behalf of the citizens. They did not take the appropriate action at the appropriate time.  I am being asked to perpetuate this eyesore in St. Stephen's Green and to make a meaningless decision to preserve semiderelict buildings.</P>

      <P>At least four houses are covered by the outline permission. Three have been demolished.  Four of the other houses are in bad condition and some, if not all of them, are in a dangerous condition.  I have been <Col N="791" /> asked to do something that it is just not feasible to do.  I have as much respect for Dublin city as anybody else. I did not say, as Deputy FitzGerald alleged, that I believed office buildings were necessary and that this was where they should go.  I said no such thing. I have a personal dislike of the expenditure of scarce capital resources on this type of building when I know that capital is in short supply for what I consider more essential purposes.  I am not entitled to take my personal prejudices into consideration because this is not a planning consideration. It is not a fact that St. Stephen's Green is a Georgian square.  It is not a homogeneous Georgian square.  There are buildings of many different types in St. Stephen's Green.  Demolition and development is taking place all around St. Stephen's Green.</P>

      <P>This development is taking place not as a result of appeals to me but as a result of decisions made by the planning authority and not appealed by any of these bodies now conducting this bogus agitation&mdash;An Taisce, Bord Fáilte and so on.  They have not appealed any of these decisions.</P>
      <P>It is not a fact that Hume Street is a homogeneous Georgian street.  Anybody would agree that the most prominent building in Hume Street is the hospital and that is not a Georgian building at all.  There is no reason why other buildings should be more out of line with the Georgian buildings than the hospital building itself is.</P>
      <P>The point is that the apparent attempt to preserve this area came far too late and if there is any considerable loss of amenity to the citizens of Dublin I certainly do not take responsibility for it.  The outline permission was granted by the planning authority and it was not appealed by anybody.</P>

      <P>It was after that that the objective of preserving some of these houses was published by the planning authority.  If anyone knew that it was to be an objective to preserve some of these buildings, surely it was the planning authority who should have known it?  If they wanted to preserve them, why did they give outline permission?  If An Taisce or any of these bodies wanted them preserved, why did they not appeal at that stage?  Why did they wait until the damage was done?  It is quite obvious that it is unreasonable to expect me to undo the damage that had already been done if, indeed, any substantial damage at all is involved.  I cannot see that this affects Ely Place very seriously at all.  The whole objective appears to be not to interfere with Ely Place.</P>

So far as I am concerned, I have no wish to see this office block development proceeding at all.  The outline permission was given by the planning authority and it just was not a feasible proposition to undo what had already been done.  The majority of the remaining houses were in bad condition and the mere making of an order by me would not secure their restoration and preservation.  Neither would it provide the money required by way of compensation.</P>
