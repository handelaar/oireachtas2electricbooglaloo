    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government will begin negotiations with the European Economic Community for a partial preferential trade agreement on the lines of the one existing between the Community and Israel pending the formal entry of this country into the Community; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's aim is full membership of the Communities at the earliest possible date.  As the Deputy is aware, the question of enlargement of the European Economic Communities is under active consideration at the moment.  I see no merit at this time in our being diverted from our main objective by searching for an arrangement such as Israel is seeking even if it were appropriate in our case, which is doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is, of course, aware that Israel already has an agreement, which has just expired and they are now seeking an extension of it.  Would the Taoiseach have regard to the serious difficulties that may arise if what has been proposed in Brussels this week were to occur?  It has been suggested in Brussels that there might be a lapse of time between Britain's entry into the Community and Ireland's entry, and in such circumstances does the Taoiseach not think a partial agreement would reduce some of the ill-effects which would fall in such a period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any lapse of time between Britain's entry and Ireland's entry.  The suggestion was created as a result of an interpretation of the remarks of the Dutch Foreign Minister.  I think he was surrounded by newsmen, at that stage, who were asking him a lot of questions. I think either the question or the answer was misinterpreted, because since then the Dutch Foreign Ministry have confirmed that it remains their policy to ensure that the opening and closing of the negotiations will be simultaneous.  They do acknowledge, as a matter of practical necessity, that it may be necessary to give some priority to British negotiations in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reply and in view of some of the conflicting reports as to what has happened in the Hague in the last two days, would the Taoiseach say whether or not there has been any communication from our representatives in the Hague on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last hour I received this message from our representative, through the Department of External Affairs, confirming the attitude of the Dutch Foreign Ministry, which we always understood it to be, that negotiations with the four applicant countries would open simultaneously and that entry should also be simultaneous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any idea as to when these talks might begin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the result of yesterday's talks are disappointing from our point of view and that there is a growing possibility, in view of the large turnaway of public opinion in Britain, that Britain may withdraw her application for membership?  In the light of <Col N="167" /> the remoteness of our accession to the Community would the Taoiseach not agree that a review of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is all the more urgent?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any danger of the British withdrawing their application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of what the Dutch Foreign Ministry have said, a decision in respect of our application would depend on the action of the six member countries together, rather than on the action of one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have concentrated on the Dutch because we have no information from the other member countries that they have changed their minds about simultaneous entry.  As I have already said, the Dutch Foreign Minister may have been misinterpreted, but the Dutch Foreign Ministry have clarified their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any further organisational progress has been made since he last spoke of developing trade relations <Col N="168" /> with the Eastern European countries to correct the balance of payments deficit with these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions have been commenced with several countries of Eastern Europe in regard to trade. As a result, an official delegation will visit Bulgaria this month for more detailed talks, including, possibly, the question of concluding a trade agreement. Further discussions are also expected to take place with the other countries concerned but no firm arrangements to this end have yet been made.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage what results may be obtained from these moves, but it is, of course, hoped that they will lead to increased exports of Irish goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the time has arrived to take firm steps to correct the alarming imbalance in the trade position which exists between ourselves and all these countries, where we are importing far in excess of what we are exporting to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been taking steps.  While the imbalance is still substantial, the surplus against us has halved in most of these countries in the past 12 months.  I think that is good progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say whether it is correct that legislation was passed over five years ago empowering the Government to restrict imports from these countries if they did not buy products from this country to a similar proportion; if there is such legislation has that legislation been used as a threat; and, if so, has any progress been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been used as a threat in some cases, but as the Deputy will appreciate most imports we take from these countries are primary products or raw materials for our industry.  It would be disadvantageous to our exporters and our manufacturers if they were not given access to the cheapest raw materials possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>Input-output tables have been compiled in respect of the year 1964, and an official report containing these tables will be published within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The time-lag in publication is not any greater than in those other countries which do not compile annual input-output tables.  The compilation of the basic transactions table is a formidable task which cannot be commenced for a particular year until the final results are available for the various statistical inquiries such as census of industrial production, national accounts, <i>et cetera</i>.  Many subsidiary inquiries are also necessary to provide the substantial extension in detail which is a feature of the input-output tables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1960 table was found not to be of sufficient detail to warrant its publication as an official document but the details were published in the Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland and in lecture notes of the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have regard to the fact that the geriatric problem is multiplying and that a larger proportion of the population are likely in future to be compulsorily retired, thereby increasing this problem? Would he, therefore, consider the high desirability of giving this priority in any social programmes the Government may have?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is twofold&mdash;first of all the necessity for establishing as far as possible arrangements for domiciliary care by which as many old people as possible can be kept and attended in their homes and out of institutions and then to deal with the problems of the growing numbers of persons who will live longer and those at the age of 65 and over who will retire.  There has been an interdepartmental committee on the care of the aged which has made most valuable recommendations, one of which is on the teaching and helping of old people to live in retirement.  That will be considered with many other proposals, some of which I would say will be given their priority in connection with this matter which is also of importance.</P>

      <P>Recent inquiries from a selection of health authorities and voluntary hospitals in regard to the question of difficulty in recruiting radiographers, revealed that, apart from one case, no real problem had arisen in filling permanent posts.  However, there has been difficulty in some cases in filling short-term locum appointments.</P>
      <P>The school of radiography, at St. Vincent's Hospital, has an annual intake of eight students.  This number will, I understand, be increased to 12 when the school transfers to new quarters at Elm Park.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion in the question that no married woman is employed by Dublin Health Authority in a hospital medical post is not correct.  I understand, however, that it is only exceptionally that the health authority employs married women in such posts.  This accords with the general and traditional practice in the local service where permanent appointments are not open to married women and temporary appointments only when no other suitably qualified candidate is available.  A change in the present practice would involve a major policy decision.  For the present I do not think this is required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the Dublin Health Authority have a great many married women doctors temporarily employed.  Other authorities have too. The reason is, I think, that they are able to get married women or widows with comparative ease.  Naturally, I will keep this whole matter under review. If it became quite clear that there were insufficient doctors and married women were available who could fill the posts, I would naturally consider them in the same way as married women teachers are considered at the moment.  I am not aware of any problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain areas in which married women doctors find it difficult to get employment under local authorities.  Is there any reason why they should be put at the bottom of the list?  Is there any reason why, in an area under-populated with doctors, the Minister would not consider giving employment to married women doctors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice generally is that unmarried women and widows are employed.  If married women are required they are appointed under special conditions on a temporary basis.  There has been a change in the case of teachers.  I will keep the matter under review.  Naturally, married women doctors would be employed if there was an acute shortage.</P>

      <P>Since her appointment in 1949 she has, of course, gained considerable experience in the performance of her duties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the particular needs of my Department are under examination at present.  So far as the hospital regions are concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that the staffing requirements including nursing appointments, must be considered in the first instance by the regional hospital boards when they are established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that the interests of nurses, who form a very large proportion of the hospital service, should be properly catered for, would the Minister ensure that each regional hospital board will employ a number of nurses and will he further ensure that the complement of nursing officers in his Department is increased to cater for the needs of nurses so that this country will not find itself in the crisis facing other countries in which there are now insufficient nurses?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health what proportion of hospitals <Col N="181" /> afford their nurses an 80-hour fortnight; and if he will now have all necessary steps taken to ensure that hospital and public health nurses will not be required to work in excess of these hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any local health authority hospital operates an 80-hour fortnight for nursing staffs.</P>
      <P>The question of a further reduction in the working hours of nurses is a matter for negotiation between the County and City Managers Association, on behalf of the employing health authorities, and representatives of the nurses.  Should my sanction be sought to any settlement, I shall be happy to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got any information about any question of a hospital employing nurses on an 80-hour basis.  As the Deputy knows, the working hours were reduced to an 85-hour fortnight in 1966.  In some areas it has been found difficult to recruit the extra nurses necessary to implement the 85-hour fortnight.  Having reached a 42½-hour week we have been making progress in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the question of negotiating shorter hours outside the normal negotiating machinery?  Are we to understand that it would be open to the county managers to concede this without requiring the involvement of the Minister, as was apparently believed necessary in 1966?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's difficulty is, as the Deputy knows, that whereas we do very often express sympathy with suggested improvements in conditions, if the Minister starts to pre-decide any particular issue of this sort he would be in great difficulty and it might result in distortions of policy or distortions in improvements which are not related to those of other serving officers in local authorities.  The Minister has to take a reasonable attitude. <Col N="182" /> He can certainly encourage certain improvements but for the Minister to say in advance that he will approve of a particular condition or change in the character of service on every occasion would be most undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what variations exist between the giving of credit for nursing service in the same grade in Ireland and abroad; if he is aware that much discontent is caused by the unequal application of scales; and if he will ensure that full incremental credit is granted in future for all service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Standard practice in the local authority service is that an officer taking up duty for the first time enters the appropriate salary scale at <Col N="183" /> the minimum.  In response to recruitment difficulties, departures from the standard practice have been authorised for certain grades, including nurses.</P>
      <P>A general-trained nurse who accepts a permanent appointment is granted incremental credit, up to a maximum of five increments, for previous postgraduate experience in a recognised hospital.  This concession applies also to permanent serving nurses.  Incremental concessions to married nurses in the service of local health authorities have been detailed in reply to an earlier question.  I have no information about the position obtaining abroad. Present indications are that extension of these concessions is not warranted, but I will keep the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that experience in nursing is invaluable no matter where it is used and that it is doing a serious disservice to Irish nurses who want to return from abroad to state that they will not receive credit for the experience they have gained abroad?  Would the Minister not end, once and for all, the ridiculous position of depriving nurses in the public service of fair conditions of service by relating their conditions entirely to the rules which apply to other local government officials who quite clearly could not get experience in foreign countries equivalent to the experience which nurses have?  Would he not also have regard to the fact that it is a great advantage to our hospitals to be able to avail of the experience which nurses can get abroad and who should be encouraged to return by removing all the inhibitions and disadvantages which now apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter would have to be considered along with all the other changes which have been made in the past and which are being made currently.  There is a considerable claim for increased remuneration for nurses and that would have to be taken into consideration in relation to any increments which are granted.  It would be most inadvisable for me to commit myself on any matter when there are a <Col N="184" /> number of claims with the County and City Managers Association at present. It would be inadvisable for me to commit myself on any particular matter when various claims are coming forward. I am sure they will all be considered sympathetically by the authorities. There are some 290 general trained nurses, employed in a temporary capacity at the moment by the Dublin Health Authority, who have refused permanent employment although they were offered five increments.  That is another problem.  Not all nurses want to be employed permanently for various personal reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that a consultative council or other committee is needed to examine the question of accommodation for hospital staffs.  Much has been already done in recent years to provide new accommodation and to improve existing accommodation.  A very substantial building programme to that end is in progress and a further substantial programme has been approved and is in planning.  In regard to nurses alone, places for no fewer than 459 are being built at present and planning is in progress for a further 745.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

If the Minister is not prepared to set up a consultative council, would he have a thorough investigation made so that the needs can be properly assessed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>We are constantly examining this matter.  In the last ten years some 2,000 places have been provided by way of accommodation for nurses, or are in the process of being provided, or are at the planning stage.  I think honestly that that is real <Col N="186" /> progress.  We have spent a considerable amount of money on this matter. If the Deputy likes to ask a question about the amount of capital spent in the last ten years, he will find that in relation to the total hospital programme we have been doing our best to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps are being taken to implement the International Labour Office recommendation to undertake systematic measures to apply and extend work study and occupational research and job analysis in the nursing field; by whom such work is being done; and the results achieved to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No recommendation has been made by the International Labour Office specifically on work-study, occupational research and job analysis in the nursing field.  The Deputy's question may refer to the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> meeting on conditions of work and employment of nurses, convened by the International Labour Office and which was held in Geneva from 6th to 11th October, 1958.</P>
      <P>That report, which covered in a general way most aspects of nursing, was submitted to the governing body of the International Labour Office and a decision was taken at the 141st session held in Geneva, in March, 1969, to transmit the report to member countries for circulation to the employers' and workers' organisations concerned. In so doing the governing body made it clear that they were not expressing any opinion on the content of the report.</P>
      <P>Copies of the report when received in my Department were circulated to the following organisations: (i) The County and City Managers Association, (ii) The Hospitals Commission, (iii) An Bord Altranais, (iv) Irish Nurses Organisation, (v) Workers Union of Ireland, (vi) Irish Transport and General Workers Union.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I have decided to set up in this Department a work study unit for the benefit of hospital services generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain <Col N="187" /> why his Department stopped the City and County Managers Association and stopped the Hospitals Commission from carrying on such an investigation and undertook, several years ago, to set up the kind of unit which the Minister is now promising?  Why did the Department abandon such an investigation? Will the Minister now ensure that this investigation is put in train immediately with a view to seeing whether or not, by increased efficiency, an 80-hour fortnight could be given to nurses without additional cost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about a specific condition.  We have asked An Bord Altranais to examine a number of matters in relation to conditions of employment of nurses including the nurse-patient ratio.  They are undertaking that study.  I am afraid I do not remember the list of things we have asked An Bord Altranais to study.  In addition, I am starting in my own Department a work study section in order to see if hospital costs can be kept to a minimum, consistent with good service, and, above all, to see how far nurses can be enabled to do their work with less difficulty and less burden upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the urgency of a work study on the nursing profession?  At the moment, in certain specialist hospitals in Dublin, nurses have to prepare meals for patients.  This has nothing to do with what they were trained for.  Many hours of a nurse's day are spent in doing ancillary jobs which bear no relation to the skill of nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know the answer to that question.  I cannot get involved in this kind of controversy.  The Deputy should know very well that An Bord Altranais have not agreed to the employment of nurses known as state enrolled nurses, who have a lower degree of training than present registered nurses.  Many hospitals employ additional aides whom they cannot describe as nurses and who do work not as skilled as that done by nurses who are properly registered. This is a varying position throughout <Col N="188" /> the country.  It would be quite impossible for me to decide that a second grade of nursing could be employed, without the consent of the nursing profession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the dental services made available by the health authority in County Donegal are inferior to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>A senior dental officer was appointed by the health authority in September, 1967, to organise and improve its dental services.  This was the only whole-time dental officer then employed by the health authority.  Meanwhile, three further whole-time dental officers have been appointed and, in addition, 12 private dentists in various parts of the county provide services on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>Estimated expenditure by the health authority on dental services in the current financial year is £27,850.  This is substantially greater than the corresponding figure, namely £8,765, for 1967-68, and compares favourably with the provision made by other health authorities for dental services in the present financial year.</P>
      <P>Thus, within recent years, there has been a considerable improvement in the dental services provided in County Donegal and the health authority is endeavouring to improve the services further by the appointment of additional whole-time staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that parents generally are concerned and feel that school-medical inspections are run down at certain times of the year because the people controlling and organising the school medical inspections are fully alive to the fact that all the inspections made will not be dealt with.

The best thing to do is to be quite frank about it and to say that there is an immense list of objectives in my Department and one of them is an improvement in the dental services.  Having regard to the cost of the health services and hospitals services as a whole, there must be an element of priority.  We attempt to look after all the urgently needy cases for dental care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

It is true that there are arrears of people waiting for dentures.  There is a scarcity of dentists in the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fruit garden at the Botanic Gardens, which was designed over a hundred years ago, is being replaced by one designed on modern lines for student teaching, and this involved removal of old trees and plants.  There is also a routine movement of plants from the quarantine station at the gardens, and exchange of plants between the gardens and other scientific institutions, public parks and well-known private gardens. Plants from the Botanic Gardens are also made available for special teaching purposes and for decorative purposes at, for example, exhibitions and important functions.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the improvement of the gardens is kept continuously under review and, in fact, many new features have been developed in recent years, for example, a new fern garden has been constructed, parts of the rock garden have been re-designed and the lawn gardens and other parts have been improved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by Deputy Timmons related to the price for serviced and unserviced land in each area where land was acquired and would cover land acquired compulsorily or by agreement.  This information is not available in my Department in the form requested by the Deputy.  Neither is information available as to average prices paid for land in each of the past five years as requested in Question No. 29.  The reason is that since 1965 housing authorities have been authorised to acquire individual sites for housing <Col N="197" /> purposes by agreement without my sanction.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 57 of the Health Bill which is the one which provides for the supply of drugs and medicines and medical and surgical appliances is, like many other sections of this Bill, grossly inadequate.  It does very little to meet much less cure the principal shortcomings of our existing provisions for drugs, medicines and medical and surgical equipment.  So long as we continue the present system of requiring over 70 per cent of our people to pay the full cost of drugs and medicines or medical and surgical equipment, so <Col N="204" /> long will we continue something which is economically crazy and medically untenable.</P>
      <P>True, if a person is obliged to undergo a long and expensive treatment and is aware, as he seldom is aware, of a right to plead hardship and to prove hardship, he may now under the Bill receive some assistance, but the nature and extent of that assistance is entirely within the discretion of the local authority.  In many cases it is not given; in some cases it is.  There is no certainty that two cases will be similarly treated.  We in Fine Gael would prefer to see a national health insurance system which would ensure that everybody, without regard to means, would receive drugs and medicines at half cost.  The people who at present enjoy drugs and medicines at no cost at all of course would continue to enjoy their drugs and medicines without charge, but the remainder of the community could receive them at half cost.  This is medically necessary because if we do not do this we will perpetuate a practice which, at enormous public expense, is crowding our hospitals with people who need not be there.</P>
      <P>The reason we are the most hospitalised country in the world is twofold. On the one hand, we have dispensary doctors, particularly in urban areas, unable to handle the huge number of cases which they are called upon to attend.  They are obliged to refer people to hospital so that they may be attended to there and so that they may receive drugs and medicines without any difficulty and without any charge. On the other hand, the present high rate of hospitalisation is due to the fact that people are required to pay the enormous cost of modern drugs and medicines for themselves and their families; they keep postponing consultation with their doctors and their illness becomes more acute and as a result they require hospitalisation which could have been avoided if they had had adequate and timely consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high cost of modern drugs and medicines people not infrequently fail to purchase the prescription prescribed for them by the <Col N="205" /> doctor.  Sometimes they will purchase only part of the prescribed medicines and drugs with two very serious consequences. The first consequence flows from the fact that most prescriptions need to be completely consumed if they are to be of benefit.  If they are only partially consumed the second state of the patient may be worse than the first.  The second consequence is the inflow into hospitals of people who need not be there.  It is essential that no difficulty should be put in the way of giving considerable assistance to people who have to undergo long courses of treatment with drugs and medicines.  It is seldom, if ever, that the cost of drugs and medicines outside hospitals exceeds the cost of maintaining the person in hospital.  If the person is put into hospital the drugs and medicines will also have to be acquired.  It is much sounder economy and it is more humane medicine to provide massive assistance towards the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>I am not unaware that the greatest rate of growth in medical expenses in the last ten years has been under the heading of drugs and medicines.  This is attributable to two causes: first more people are availing of their rights to receive assistance in meeting the cost; and, secondly, the prices of drugs and medicines are multiplying beyond all previous experience.  Whether that is directly and fairly attributable to the cost of research or to other factors is difficult to determine, but it is fair to query why it is that we in this State are called upon to pay prices for drugs and medicines far in excess of the cost of equivalent drugs and medicines in the Six Counties, Britain and elsewhere.  It cannot be due to the fact that the research work is peculiar to Ireland because most of the research work done by the large medicine and drug manufacturers is conducted abroad and the cost of that research is spread across the world, and it should not be proportionately any greater in Ireland than anywhere else.  We are aware that our drugs and medicines are subject to an unfair purchase tax which does not apply to drugs and medicines prescribed for animals, but human beings have to pay <Col N="206" /> this unjustified purchase tax.  We are called upon to pay between 25 per cent and 100 per cent more for our drugs and medicines than obtains elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I presume under any scheme the Minister might propose that a national list of prices for drugs and medicines will be drawn up.  I think it is important that the Department of Health should take much greater care about the cost of drugs and medicines.  It appears there is a great deal wrong here.  It is because of the excessive prices and the lack of State assistance for the great majority of our people that we have the ridiculous position of having a health pyramid turned upside-down.  Ninety-five per cent of our Health Bill relates to hospitalisation because we have a crazy system which pushes people into hospital in order to relieve the case burden of the doctor and in order that the people may get the drugs and medicines they would be unable to get free if they were not in an institution As medicine can do more and more for us it becomes more expensive, but it is cheaper in the long run to pay for this kind of care outside the hospitals and institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 57 is not going to achieve the necessary reduction in demand for hospital accommodation.  The section repeats once again the Fianna Fáil fable that hardship is not caused to people in the middle income group or in the upper income group in regard to medical expenses.  I think it is true to say that there are very few cases in which the cost of providing drugs and medicines does not cause hardship and does not cause a lowering of family standards even for a short time.  A prescription may cost 30/- or 40/- and taking that amount of money, even out of a middle income pay packet, in a week causes some lowering of standards, and if this is repeated for a month it means a serious loss.  It has to reach almost crisis proportions before any relief is given under the heading of income tax if a person is paying income tax.  There are many families who are not regarded as being entitled to a medical card and who <Col N="207" /> are not regarded as suffering from continuous hardship which would justify assistance in meeting medical costs, and they suffer real hardship. Very often necessary family expenditure has to be postponed in order to pay for urgently needed drugs or medicines; or a competition arises between necessary expenses and, I am sorry to say, all too often the expenditure which suffers is the health expenditure. This is something which should not arise in any Christian community. Necessary health expense should be the first priority; it should not conflict with any other reasonable family expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is also a danger where inadequate subsistence is provided for expensive drugs and medicines that people will resort to home cures which may accentuate the difficulty and will certainly not relieve the disability but which will result in ultimate very heavy expense.  This is something we should all be trying to avoid.</P>
    <P>The section also requires that people who are not entitled to full eligibility must prove hardship before they receive assistance.  We consider this to be degrading and we also believe that it increases illness.  This is the kind of thing which prevents a person&mdash;as the Voluntary Health Insurance Board says &mdash;being ill with ease because you cannot be ill with ease if you are concerned about the tremendous cost.  Requiring people already ill, or their families, to process their family circumstances through the local authority and the local health board is something people should not be called upon to do.</P>
    <P>The section is, of course, welcome to one extent in that we hope it will do away with the appalling conditions that people have had to endure in urban dispensaries where they are obliged to attend at an early hour in the morning to get their medicines within stated hours.  The result is that mothers with young families have to bring their children along to the dispensaries, wait for two or three hours and not get a prescription, and then have to come back again on another day.</P>
    <P>At least, it is proposed to allow the <Col N="208" /> drugs and medicines to be supplied through the ordinary retail chemists. We consider that that is an advance, but we express some concern about the inadequacy of the consultations to date with the pharmaceutical profession.  We know that there has been some, but we would urge upon the Minister to bring these consultations to a conclusion as quickly as possible in order to ensure that we do not again experience what we experienced in 1953, that is, the machinery for the operation of a health service without having the personnel willing and anxious to operate it.  It is essential that we have the full confidence and co-operation of everybody&mdash; doctors, nurses and pharmacists&mdash;and we will get that only by having adequate consultation.</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is our general observation on the section.  It is a disappointment. It could have achieved more.  We believe that it has been wrongly conceived, that it was conceived on the basis of the false premise that hardship is not caused to most people in the provision of medical aid.  That, we are satisfied, is wrong.</P>
    <P>The reason why the Department take this view is that the figures on which they make this wrong conclusion are 18 years out of date.  If I am right, they base it on a household inquiry made in 1951-52.  The cost of drugs and medicine has developed in an entirely different way over the last 18 years and the development of the techniques and knowledge of medicine has also changed immensely over the last 18 years.  We think it is utterly unworthy that we should now be bringing in a Health Bill, which the Minister believes will operate for the next 20 years, on the basis of information which is even already out of date, which might even have been inaccurate in 1951-52&mdash;I am not going to argue that; I am not in a position to argue it, not having made the necessary analysis&mdash;but, it is fair to assume the basis has little relationship to our present day problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that we are making progress.  I do not think I need go over all the arguments on <Col N="209" /> the Second Stage in regard to this section. Deputy Ryan will have the opportunity when the regulations are issued to make further comment about this. The position is that we do propose that for the whole of the middle income group it will involve only the single examination of eligibility and not a special examination of eligibility of any section.  We do propose that the minimum amount, which will be the amount that will be recoupable, will be clearly expressed in regulations understood by everybody and the amount above which people will be subsidised for their drugs will be quite clearly stated.  A figure of £2 a month was mentioned by my predecessor.  That, of course, will have to be examined again and revised, possibly, in the light of present circumstances.  In actual fact, we are using the household budget survey of 1965-66, which is near enough to today to enable us to draw some useful conclusions in regard to expenditure on drugs and medicines. According to that survey a household earning £20 to £25 a week was spending roughly 2s 6d a week on medicines and drugs and some 45/- a week on drink and tobacco.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is proposed to have what will be an advance in the attitude we adopt towards drugs purchased by the middle income group. Up to now, as the House knows, there is a question of contribution because of hardship, now arranged by health authorities.  When this Bill is passed it will be based on an actual figure of expenditure on drugs and appliances per month above which the cost will be met by the regional health boards, and I think this is an advance.  I hope there will be other advances in the years to come as the nation grows in economic strength.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this is a Committee Stage discussion and the House has already expressed its views at great length on the Second Stage and there can be further discussion when the regulations are being considered.  As the Deputy knows, there is also some income tax relief to people with very heavy illness expenditure in a year, which has been announced on two successive occasions by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> The negotiations with the Pharmaceutical Association are going ahead steadily.  I do not see any reason to suppose that they will not be concluded satisfactorily.  We will do our best to provide a formulary of drugs which can be regarded as a useful guide to doctors in that they will be given some indication that they can purchase drugs of a particular kind, of good quality and with whatever are the necessary constituents in the drug, perhaps at a cheaper price in some cases than purchasing from another source where quality is no better and where the price would seem to be excessive.</P>
    <P>The whole business of processing of prescriptions and the issue of payments will be done by a central bureau using a computer, which will reduce the administrative costs as far as possible. We think that the result will be that, although inevitably it will be more expensive to issue drugs through retail chemists, it will be of great advantage to the people concerned.  They will no longer have to get their drugs in dispensaries, with all the long waiting described, I think correctly, by the Deputy.  They will be able to get their drugs at a chemist's shop.  As to the price at which the drugs will be sold in respect of those who have medical cards, the Deputy can be assured that because of this increased turnover of business to chemists we will be able to make a reasonably good bargain with them and the price that will have to be borne by the taxpayer and the ratepayer will not be excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express our great dissastisfaction with sections which contain a persistence of the old poor law idea of means test type medicine. We disapprove of them, not, as I have said many times, on doctrinaire, ideological grounds, but simply because we believe they will continue to lead to the two-tier type medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change in even 20 years is dramatic in regard to this whole business of drugs and charges for drugs.  I remember the great clarion call 20 years ago was in regard to doctors' bills.  That, funnily enough, would not be such an attractive call nowadays because what really frightens people is <Col N="211" /> not so much doctors' bills as chemists' bills and they are very much more costly a component of any illness these days than they were even 20 years ago. With the cutting down of this service to this pitiful poverty stricken offering made to the unfortunate people in the provisions of the Bill under eligibility, even if they had made a greater range of drugs available to people free of charge, that would have been a great advance indeed.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that ill-health is unpredictable. The duration of ill-health is unpredictable.  One cannot predict who the patient will be.  Is it the breadwinner, the mother, one of the children? What type of illness will it be? What will be the cost of the drugs?  It is trying to introduce order into a completely chaotic set of imponderables when the Minister says that they will fix on some sum and that that will be a sum which will mitigate, reduce or even eliminate hardship in any set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>It simply cannot be done.  This is the most costly component in any health service and, because it is the most costly component, it is the most important component.  For that reason the attempt to standardise the charge will not eliminate the hardship that must inevitably be involved when a family is faced with serious illness.</P>
    <P>This also creates very serious dilemmas for the doctors.  I have known general practitioners who, faced with serious illness in patients, found themselves with very costly antibiotics on the one hand, and relatively cheap but reasonably valuable medicine on the other hand and, out of the kindness of their hearts, they felt themselves compelled to prescribe the cheaper medicine. That is a scandalous dilemma in which to put any doctor.  That situation should never arise.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in the world as to the type and quality of service that should be available, namely, the best procurable.  The Minister keeps telling us we must discuss this within very narrow confines, but we must discuss the matter in the light of the question as to why he is not able to offer the <Col N="212" /> best service.  The Minister is the most consistent advocate of private enterprise. If private enterprise is so good why has it failed to produce the money to ensure that everybody is provided with the quality of health service the Minister would expect, to which he and everybody belonging to him has a perfect right in time of medical need. He is not providing this for the ordinary people.  Of that I am quite certain.  The only way in which such provision could be made would be by going back to the 1947 Fianna Fáil Health Act.  That was not perfect, but it was a fine piece of legislation and it would be infinitely preferable to anything proposed in this Bill.  Even the proposals of Deputy Ryan in relation to a contributory scheme would be an advance on the proposals in this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us figures and made comparisons: 2s 6d on drugs and medicines and 45s on drink and tobacco.  Human nature being what it is, people want their simple pleasures. They work hard for them.  No case can be made for this on foot of the amount spent on drink and tobacco.  No case can be made for depriving anybody in time of need of the quality service the individual should get.  I do not know if the Minister fully appreciates the enormous strides that have taken place, particularly since the war, in regard to chemico-therapy and antibiotics.  The latter are produced at very great cost. The coloured bottles are gone.  Now the most valuable drugs are available to help an individual in time of illness, but they cost a great deal in research and production and, because they do, the end product is costly.  But there should be no inhibition of any kind on any individual in time of illness.</P>
    <P>The Minister is shortsighted in his approach because, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, there will be this fear of illness, this fear of the chemist's bill, a greater fear than the fear of the doctor's bill now.  Because of that there will be the fear of going to the doctor to find out if there is something wrong; because of that there will be delay and, because of the delay, the more serious will be the condition and, the more serious the condition, the longer the <Col N="213" /> patient will be disabled and, the longer the disability, the more the disability will cost.  It is extraordinary that we should as a society make such claims to being wealthy and prosperous and, at the same time, have this inhumanitarian approach to illness.</P>
    <P>I read the report on child care the other day and it was stated in that report that the basic principles of the school health service and the child welfare service have not changed fundamentally since 1920, 50 years ago. How can the Minister pretend that he is now introducing progressive or radical legislation in regard to health services?  It is all part of a pattern. There is a gradual movement away by the Fianna Fáil Party from the people, the people who gave them the power, and rightly so, in the early days. There is a failure to build houses, a failure to provide jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point that in section 7 (1) the patient referred to will merely be a substitute for the previous blue card holder and that, whereas the abolition of the blue card is a very good thing, we are still categorising the patient; we are giving some patients completely free medicines and then we go on to subsection (2) where, in order to obtain any medicines at a reasonable cost, one has to make a separate application to the health board involved.  This is an even worse stigma than exists under the present system.  We are still going to divide our patients and in the doctor's waiting room they will be divided between those who have completely free appliances and drugs and those who have them at a reduced cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a dreadful stigma associated with having to ask the doctor, who might be a next-door neighbour: &ldquo;Would you mind not giving me the bottle you gave me last week as I cannot afford it?  Would you give me a cheaper one?&rdquo;  The doctor may reply that the cheaper one will not suffice and ask the patient if he would like him to write to the health authority requesting medical assistance for the patient.  This is what is happening. People are not getting the proper medicines because they cannot afford them. Subsection (2) is most important and it is totally inadequate because it will not get through to the people who really need these drugs.  There will <Col N="215" /> always be a certain hard core who will look for things to which they are not entitled but the people who are entitled to them will not, because they are too reserved, make the application. Recently, I had the experience of attending a woman who was dying and who could not afford her medicines. When she was asked to make representation to the health authority she explained: &ldquo;Oh, no, if I did my husband would kill me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have three letters here seeking assistance for drugs from the health authority which just arrived today. On average, I write a hundred letters a month for patients to try to help them obtain drugs at a reasonable cost.  These are people who are on the fringe and who do not qualify for completely free medicines, drugs and appliances.  There is a stigma attached to making this separate claim, to being dragged down to the authority and undergoing a third degree about one's income to see whether one should be provided with drugs for one week, two weeks, or a month at a reduced cost.  As I said, this is totally inadequate. What we suggested was that this should be done on an insurance basis. Obviously our recommendations were not acceptable and, failing that, then all drugs should be made available to 90 per cent of the people at half price.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister referred to the income tax allowance for any hardship caused by the purchase of drugs.  This allowance arises after the purchase of £50 worth of drugs for one person in the family.  If a man has a wife and six children and each of the eight require £30 or £40 worth of medicine the man is still not going to get the allowance because it only relates to one person.  In this sort of case the man is tempted to cross the borderline of justice and get the chemist to give him the bill in one name.  Instead of paying the full retail rate, with his income tax allowance being considered, he would be getting the drugs merely at the health authority purchase price.  All this could be overcome by introducing a system whereby all members of the public get drugs at half price.  This is <Col N="216" /> the only realistic approach and the only approach whereby you can treat patients outside hospital on a long-term basis.  The alternative is to transfer patients on ISA forms to hospital specialists when they will be able to purchase the drugs at the nominal charge of 2s 6d.  Of course, once again they will have to queue up for long hours in the hospital and be subjected to certain stigmas.  However, we know that by putting them down on the long waiting lists we can get some of the more expensive medicines for them. Even though there is a system whereby expensive medicines may be made available, the system is not functionally efficient from the medical point of view. Financially, perhaps, it is.  What is happening is that patients in the lower income group who do not qualify for free service are unaware of the other benefits available and they will only take half a bottle of an expensive antibiotic and put the other half in the fridge to keep it there until someone else is ill.  Recently, I had a case where two teaspoonfuls of a very expensive antibiotic were given to a child just to see if it would tide the child over the illness.  The resultant complications from inadequate therapy like this can be very severe.  In one family recently all four children had to be taken to hospital, and are still there, since resistant organisms developed because of inadequate treatment due to the fact that the people could not afford the anibiotics.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan and Deputy Browne said, the doctors in Dublin are not expensive.  It is something for which we can be very grateful.  The general practitioner here has the lowest charges in Europe.  People no longer fear, as possibly was the case in 1947, the doctor's charge; what they are really afraid of is the chemist's bill. They will take anything at all rather than go to a chemist.  The opposite to that is that when you give a prescription under the present system&mdash;and this does not change it any&mdash;the parents are inclined to repeat the prescription, to go back to the chemist and ask for the same bottle for Johnny as was given to him on a previous occasion although, this time, he might be suffering from a completely different <Col N="217" /> ailment.  The family cannot afford the combination of doctor and medicines, with emphasis on &ldquo;medicines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing to make everything completely free to the destitute section of the population.  We must bear in mind, however, the gross lag in the provision of appliances and drugs for certain prescribed diseases or disabilities of long standing.  Children suffering from spina bifida can now be saved.  Yesterday, the Minister said facilities are available.  He asked a Deputy if he had a specific case in mind.  At 2.30 p.m. I had left a child who was dying.  Over the week-end I applied for assistance for it.  The child is still in a very bad condition.  It is 18 months old.  The mother had not had any free medicines or appliances for that child; nor was she aware of any until I was consulted in a dual capacity.  The National Council for Spina Bifida, which is in process of being set up, would greatly appreciate the immediate provision of free drugs and appliances for this type of patient.</P>
    <P>A figure of 2s 6d was quoted as an average expenditure on drugs.  There are many things at the chemist's shop which are essential for health and which may not be included in this figure although, at the moment, I shall not dispute it.  I do not see the relevance of the figure of £2 for drink and cigarettes apart from the fact that so much seems to be spent on cigarettes, which we all now know beyond doubt do promote illness, yet neither the Minister nor his predecessors attempted to introduce any legislation whatsoever to restrict the advertising and sale of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the availability of medicines at the chemist's shop will change anything.  People who have had to queue at dispensaries for medicines will not have the same accommodation at the local chemist's shop where there are not such facilities for waiting. Many people, too, will be asked to return to collect a prescription when it has been filled.  All of these factors will give rise, I think, to a certain amount of hardship.</P>
    <P>An important omission here in local medicine is the provision of these drugs <Col N="218" /> free of charge on a 24-hour day basis and at week-ends.  There is nowhere in Dublin where a prescription can urgently be filled after the chemist has closed.  There is no dispensary where an eligible person can collect drugs which may be prescribed in the middle of the night and which the attending doctor may not have in his emergency bag.  I urge the Minister to make provision for the establishment of a centre, or certain centres, in Dublin which will be open to the public on a 24-hour day basis for the filling of emergency prescriptions. With the improvement in the standard of medicine in this country and, indeed, all over the world, there will be increased side effects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal briefly with the figures the Minister gave to justify his argument.  In my view, they undermine his argument and assist the Fine Gael argument.  He says that, in 1966, the average expenditure on drugs and medicines was 2s 6d a week.  That is an argument in favour of entering into an insurance scheme in which, on payment of a premium of 2s 6d a week, drugs and medicines would thereafter be available free.</P>
      <P>Statistics should be repudiated entirely in medicine.  While of assistance in determining the finances, they have little relevance to the human beings involved.  It is no consolation to a person who is dying, a person who is chronically ill, or to a person who is in pain, to be told that statistically they have no significance.  They have great significance in the eyes of their Creator and in the eyes of their fellowmen and their families, and in their own eyes.</P>
      <P>It is not adequate to say that statistics show that their average expenditure is only 2s 6d a week and that, because statistics prove that, they will not get assistance towards meeting their bills which in some cases are £2, £3 and £5 a week.  You could argue that there should be no such thing as fire insurance if you used the same argument as the Minister has used. The average loss occasioned in households by fire insurance is 5s a week.  Is this an argument against fire insurance? It is not.  It is an argument in favour of it.  People should be encouraged to insure so that the community, by each person paying a little, insures their less fortunate neighbours against the immense cost involved in fire insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis of a health insurance scheme which would provide, if not free, at least subsidised drugs and medicines, would be that the community, by paying a small amount, would insure any family or any person against having to pay an undue amount such as £2 and £3 a week and more for drugs and medicines. I think the difficulty the Minister is in is that he and his colleagues got themselves in a strait-jacket in opposing the Fine Gael scheme.  I have with me a cutting from the <i>Irish <Col N="220" /> Press</i> of 4th April, 1965, in which the Minister, who was then Minister for Transport and Power, is reported as objecting to the poll-tax system Fine Gael wanted to bring in, a system, which he said was ludicrous.  I think he has got himself into that difficulty and he and his colleagues are now unable to get out of it&mdash;the difficulty of assuming that they could not accept what was proposed by their opponents, when their own figures go to establish the justification for our scheme.  Our scheme was to provide a subsidy of 50 per cent of the cost and that would be 1s 3d a week and not the 2s 6d mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The figures given justify all we have said.  Therefore, we urge upon the Minister to use the same statistics, if he considers them respectable, as the basis of a system which will provide a comprehensive subsidy for drugs and medicines which the two medical speakers in this discussion, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. Byrne, have emphasised are the principal cost in medicine today.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is an enabling section in some respects, and particularly the subsection which would allow the Minister to specify the particular long-term chronic conditions which would be entitled to free service without a means test.  I endorse what Deputy Dr. Byrne has said about spina bifida.  We must take into account the kind of assistance which it is necessary to give to children who suffer from that ailment.  Assistance must of necessity be applied immediately and it is not the kind of condition which tolerates delay.  Therefore, we believe that the benefit should be applied without any hestitation.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that in recent times provision has been made for diabetics, and quite rightly so.  There is another condition which also imposes considerable and continuing expenses, that is, the condition of epilepsy.  I would urge the Minister when he is drafting the regulations to bear these conditions in mind.  I can sympathise with the Minister if he does not want to prepare an exhaustive list at this stage but those two cases are certainly worthy of mention.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad to examine any such list.  I would point out that under this section we could have a contributory scheme.  The section does not forbid a method of contributions to be used.  We are simply arguing on the fact that the health boards would have the power to give the whole of the cost or a proportion of the cost of drugs and, having reached Committee Stage, I would ask the House not to continue to repeat arguments of a Second Stage character. This section of the Bill could permit 100 per cent of the drugs to be paid for by the health board to the middle income group.  There is nothing to stop that.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to welcome the section so far as subsection (1) and subsection (3) go but subsection (2), to put it mildly, is somewhat ambiguous.  Some of the phraseology used is, to my mind, rather confusing.  It provides:</P>
      <P>When a person with limited eligibility, or a person with full eligibility who does not avail himself of the service under subsection (1), satisfies the chief executive officer of the health board that, in respect of a period and to an amount determined by regulations made by the Minister he has incurred expenditure on drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances which were obtained on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner ...</P>
      <P>How exactly will he satisfy the chief executive officer?  There is a section in the existing health legislation which, as far as I know, enables the chief executive officer, who would be the county manager, to allow drugs to certain persons who had incurred the expenditure. What exactly is the difference in this section?  What is the difference in this so-called enabling legislation?  How is a person to prove to the chief executive officer, any more than he could prove it before, whether he is entitled to drugs or not?  I am not dealing with subsection (3) which I accept fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person goes to a general medical <Col N="222" /> practitioner and the practitioner prescribes for him.  He incurs considerable expenditure with the local chemist or whoever it may be.  Then he discovers that he is unable to meet his commitments and he applies to the chief executive officer who, of course, is the county manager, for payment of the bill.  That is the position at the moment.  If anyone comes to me and says: &ldquo;I have been attended by my doctor.  He prescribed such and such a drug.  It is extremely expensive.  I cannot afford to pay for it&rdquo;&mdash;as a public representative I am in a position to make representations to the county manager to pay the bill.

      <P>There are a few points I should like to mention.  We know that tuberculosis patients are given free treatment but we have in the country today a number of ex-TB patients who are suffering from the after effects of TB with chronic bronchitis, fibrosis of the lung, and they have acute exacerbations every year, every winter.  By virtue of the fact that their TB is not active they are not given any treatment.  These people need treatment.  They need broad spectrum antibiotic treatment of their acute bronchitis that recurs.  I have fought in vain for so many of these patients. The reply always is that the TB is not active and nothing can be done for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about this because they are as fully in need of treatment as are active TB patients.  These are the end results of TB.  I should like to have the Minister's views about these cases.  Will he provide for those cases?  The other cases are diabetics.  I know there is provision for the free treatment of diabetics but what is forgotten is that <Col N="223" /> diabetics also suffer from concurrent illnesses and vascular disorders.  They are very prone to infection but they are not provided for&mdash;the mainly antidiabetic therapy.  Am I out of order?</P>

      <P>Regulations will have to be prepared under section 57, and all those can be debated on the Estimate. This is an enabling section, and in regard to the tuberculosis posteffects described by Deputy Dr. O'Connell those in the middle income group will, in the case of 99 per cent of such persons, know that they are in the middle income group.  Knowing that, they can take a doctor's prescription to the chemist who will know they are in the middle income group and that a given proportion of the cost of the drugs per month or per week will be defrayed by the health authority. It will no longer be a question of the vast majority of cases not being certain whether they are in a hardship category or not.  There will be other cases of patients with long term disabilities, matters which we can examine, such as those mentioned by the Deputy in relation to conditions associated with diabetes or some other disease.  All those can be looked at in relation to the long term disabilities where quite evidently the patient cannot be certain that he necessarily will qualify for long term disability except in the case of diseases which have actually been published and are known to everybody such as spina bifida, hydrocephalis or one of those.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister <Col N="224" /> clarify the point made by Deputy Dr. O'Connell?  He was doing so but his last sentence got a little muddled. In the case of associated illnesses, the TB patients, the associated mobility of the ex-TB patient, the diabetic, the epileptic and the mentally defective people, even though these would be prescribed diseases and you would make drugs available free to them for the specific illness which they suffer from, will you make drugs free to them for any associated illness?  They have a higher incidence of associated illnesses, chest infections, vascular diseases et cetera than the normal population.  You could provide that once they are in the category of a permanent or long term illness they would be covered for all illnesses from which the patient may suffer where this is a permanent or long term disability.</P>

We can have all that out and I shall be far better equipped to mention specific maladies, and we shall consider all the things that have been raised by all Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is making debating points with Deputy R. Ryan or not, but he said something about this being potentially a contributory scheme.  We could all make that point but I would be obliged if the Minister would clarify what he means.  I would clarify it in this way: that no matter what <Col N="225" /> scheme is brought in, whether it is the kind we would like in the Labour movement, a free no means test scheme, or this type of scheme where you have the old poor law Victorian type health services brought in, it is a contributory scheme in so far as the money comes from the rates, from direct or indirect taxation or it comes in the forms I spoke about before, national health insurance contribution and other kinds of payment.  Would the Minister tell us what he means by contributory? I know what Deputy Ryan means by contributory.  The Minister makes it quite clear in section 43 that there are certain conditions for eligibility and each person here is specified as a person with or without full eligibility or partial eligibility, and this is then referred back to a person who cannot afford to pay, and so on, in legal jargon.  However, to suggest that it is the same type of thing that I have in mind as a contributory scheme or that Deputy Ryan has in mind as a contributory scheme means to me that the Minister does not know what he is talking about or he is playing politics. If it was a scheme on the lines Deputy Ryan suggests he would be quick to tell the public; if it was on the lines we in the Labour Party would implement, if we had the power to do so, I am quite sure he would tell the people.  He should be more specific on that point.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the long-term illness.  This makes tremendous demands on any family: there are the emotional demands as a result of the fact that a person is chronically disabled; there are the physical demands of knowing there are nursing duties that must be performed by the person looking after the ill person; then there are the financial demands, money going out day after day in respect of somebody whom they love and want to have around but who is a constant burden.  Would the Minister even in regard to subsection (3) provide, as his predecessors did in relation to diabetes, that in relation to any long-term illness such as spina bifida and disseminated schlerosis, the person would be eligible for free treatment? This would be some concession to the genuine concern expressed by all Deputies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take it that we shall be as generous as possible in regard to these long-term illnesses, but we have to await the regulations. I was not trying to play politics. If the Deputy reads section 57 (2) he will see that it would be possible in theory to pay 50 per cent, 75 per cent, 85 per cent or even 100 per cent of the cost of these drugs.  There is nothing to prevent the Government introducing a Bill into the House which would provide for contributory schemes with either flat rate payments or payments on the basis of the income of the person.</P>

      <P>My predecessor dealt with the general question of our attitude towards the middle income group on Second Stage.  I have spoken about it at considerable length on earlier stages of the Bill and I have noted all the comments made by Deputies in my own party and all the objections made by Deputies in the Opposition parties.  All I have said is that I thought we were making some progress in regard to ensuring that people in the middle income group would be able to get drugs at a reasonable cost or at low cost under long-term disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether or not we have a contributory scheme, whether we lower the rates or raise the taxes, does not arise on this section and I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would agree that the method of raising money does not arise on this section. When the regulations come before the House Deputies will be pleased or disappointed, depending on which side of the House they come from, with the actual amount that we propose to pay people already classified, marked and registered in the middle income group towards drugs which they buy for ordinary illnesses, and the many varieties <Col N="227" /> of long-term illnesses; that will all come before the House for discussion. It is impossible for me to commit myself further except to say that my predecessor made a rough guess that he thought that any expenditure above £2 might apply.  We do promise a substantial contribution, and no longer will the middle income group have to apply to see if they can be regarded as a hardship case if they want to get a contribution towards their drug expenditure. When this Bill is passed they will know what they can get in relation to ordinary diseases and specifically in relation to long-term illnesses.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions.  The section we are dealing with is largely subject to regulations and the Minister has said that an opportunity to discuss these regulations will be given on the Health Estimate.  My first question is: how soon after the passing of this Bill does the Minister anticipate he will put these regulations before the House?  The second question relates to the fact that these regulations require the sanction of the Minister for Finance in subsection (4) and, therefore, even if the Minister issues certain regulations, which one debates in the Health Estimate and accepts, is it not possible that they may not obtain the sanction of the Minister for Finance and as a result the regulations may not become fully operative?</P>

      <P>Again, the Deputy misunderstands me.  I was trying to relieve Deputies' minds.  They expressed their belief in a contributory scheme on this section as though the section was so written that there could never be a contributory scheme.  A contributory scheme is being examined by the Government at the present time.  We could introduce a contributory scheme and funds available for that scheme could be used to implement section 57, subsections (2) and (3), and as a result relieve the middle income group from paying a portion of the medicine costs. Deputies should not imagine that in agreeing to this section they are agreeing there will never be a contributory scheme or that rates and taxes will continue to be levied in the same way.  This is an enabling provision and if all enabling provisions are going to take an hour to be passed, this moderate measure will never be accomplished.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister is helping himself by being so impatient with us.  We have waited 20 years for this legislation and we can wait a little longer, particularly as it is not that much better and the public will not be that much better or worse off when it comes in.  In the 1953 Act there was a clause which gave the right to look for supplementary health grants or a subsidy in relation to middle income groups.  Does the Minister think it is correct in this Bill that application should be made to the chief executive officer instead of to the chief medical officer?  It is rather a delicate situation for a person who is ill to have to go along to a layman and explain his position.  I think it would be more appropriate for him to go along to the chief medical officer because ideally it would be better for doctors to deal with these matters.  I have found the clause in the 1953 Act practically useless as far as my own constituents are concerned. One has to attempt to build up a case <i>post factum</i> after the illness and it is very difficult to do so.  I have got no value from this clause as far as any representations which I have made on behalf of my constituents are concerned.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 58.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 58 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 58 provides that:</P>
      <P>A health board shall, in relation to persons with full eligibility and such other categories of persons and for such purposes as may be specified by the Minister, provide without charge a nursing service to give to those persons advice and assistance on matters relating to their health and to assist them if they are sick.</P>
      <P>We would urge that the Minister would expand this and give us an indication, if he would be good enough, of the categories he has in mind.  We feel that this kind of service should be given to all aged persons, to all retired persons and that their means should not come into this at all for the reasons which I referred to at Question Time today.  In the light of experience of the Dublin Health Authority region there is a clear case for giving immense assistance to aged people, particularly, when in urban areas today the elder citizens tend to become more remote from the younger members of the family who are forced by reason of the growth of the city and so on to live very far away from their aged parents. That has produced a tremendous problem in the care of the aged.  In the ordinary natural run of events the expectation would be that the younger would look after the elder members of the family, but in the modern more complicated days in which we live the younger people are frequently not available because they do not live within reasonable distance of their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical problem, for instance, in Dublin is that 90 per cent of people wanting public housing have been forced to take it on the north side of the city which has put them anything up to half-a-day's remove from their parents who have been living on the <Col N="231" /> south side of the city for generations. This has helped to make more acute and more difficult of solution the problem of elderly people of all ages, of all conditions and of all social backgrounds. We feel that these people should receive tremendous assistance. We believe that a great deal of this assistance should be given before people are distinguishably infirm because quite frequently we can prevent our elder citizens becoming infirm if they are adequately supervised and assisted in advance.  One of the greatest problems, for instance, is the difficulty which elderly people have with their feet and the provision of chiropody and home nursing and home care and home visitation would certainly prevent a lot of these elderly people from becoming house-bound which in itself multiplies many of the difficulties of old age.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, need to emphasise the importance of keeping elderly people in the community, of keeping them out and about so that they do not develop the physical and psychiatric problems that are almost inevitable if they become house-bound.</P>
    <P>Section 59, perhaps, deals more with the element of home help and we will come to that in a moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 58 and 59 could almost be taken together in regard to what I say in reply to the debate on section 58.  It is the object and policy to do our utmost to provide domiciliary care for all those in need.  There are very good proposals in the report on the aged poor and we have had proposals in regard to domiciliary care in the mental illness report and also in the mental handicap report and in our own Department we have been investigating this matter continuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as public nurses are concerned, 580 posts have been filled and there, are about 600 in all to be appointed.  We have had many nurses retrained and there are 250 nurses who will have been trained by the spring of 1970.  For the lower income group, the public nurses, without charge, provide all domiciliary nursing.  In the <Col N="232" /> middle income group they do domiciliary midwifery care, care of the aged, nursing of the chronic sick, domiciliary after-care of patients discharged from mental hospitals and the care of mentally-handicapped children maintained at home; and in the higher income group we also provide nursing care, domiciliary care, after-care of patients discharged from mental hospitals and the care of mentally-handicapped children at home and also domiciliary care in this group to the extent that the nurses' duties in relation to the lower and middle income groups permit.</P>
    <P>I am very keen, and so are the officers of my Department, on the public nurse undertaking health education and hygiene education, on becoming a friend of the people where she lives, on being able to persuade people to go to a doctor, people who are not going to the doctor very often because they are afraid to go, allowing a malady to become more and more serious because they are not actually bed-ridden by the malady.  All of that work is very important.  There is also immunisation, maternity and child welfare and the school health service to continue and public nurses will be taking part in the extended child health scheme in which we hope every child of pre-school age will have at least two good examinations, not only at the child health clinics that we now have but also through a service to be provided by a number of practitioners who will see these people in their surgeries.</P>
    <P>That is all linked with the inevitable development of social workers and home help.  Home help will obviously have to be carefully considered and as to how far it should be linked with voluntary associations.  I believe a great deal of this work in regard to home help can be done better through voluntary associations.  Tremendous work is being done in Cork and Limerick and the health authorities are giving subventions to those bodies for a wide variety of social services and health services of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>So, the answer is that we do intend to develop domiciliary care in health for a wide variety of conditions and we <Col N="233" /> regard it as of very great importance in the coming years to keep people out of hospitals, to look after them at home.  There are many matters still to be examined coming before us in the report on the aged poor.  Some of them are very evident to us already.  Some of the proposals are more definite and succinct and will be examined not only by myself but by the Minister for Local Government.  Deputies can take for granted that we do regard this aspect of the health service as of very great importance.</P>

      <P>In section 58 I see a great pitfall for the nursing profession in that they shall provide free of charge a nursing service and give advice.  The Minister has suggested that many old people might not go to a doctor because they might be frightened to go. They would be frightened for no reason.  Here we have a nurse going to these people and advising them regarding their health.</P>
      <P>With regard to assistance on matters relating to health, we still at this stage have had no consultation between the nurse and the doctor.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows very well that the nursing service will operate under the auspices and direction of, first of all, a superintendent nurse in each area and, secondly, the county medical officer.  It is inconceivable that nurses would do anything over and above what would be regarded as desirable by the medical profession. The Deputy can put the whole thing out of his mind.  The medical profession are well able to defend themselves against any attempt by nurses to supersede the work of doctors. In fact, nurses are already doing what is provided here, and doing it quite successfully, in full co-operation with the local medical practitioners.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not get so angry about this because he is being advised by someone who presumably knows what he is talking about.  A conflict can arise between a doctor and a nurse.  A nurse who is left on her own a good deal can come to feel that she is as good as or, perhaps, better than the doctor because of her experience and there can be conflict. This is a practical point.  It could be a practical issue.  If the Minister were to put in a clause &ldquo;in accordance with the advice given to her by the practitioner in charge of the case&rdquo; that might meet the point.</P>

      <Col N="236" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 59 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 58 and this section dovetail into one another.  The position at the moment is that there are some services provided for the care and support of the aged which are not treated as eligible for a State contribution. There is the chiropody service, the old folks clubs, the provision of meals on wheels, a service of immense benefit to the elderly and one which contributes significantly to reducing the demands for institutional accommodation. In the Dublin region, for instance, for the first time in 30 years the point was reached this year at which there was no longer a waiting list for entry into the geriatric institutions. The position is getting out of hand again now for another reason. Because of the less challenging nature of geriatric care nurses are finding the work unattractive and the result is that there are now a number of units in the geriatric section closed because of lack of nursing personnel.  The way in which to overcome this problem, apart from giving the nurses better conditions of service, is by providing a community social service which will maintain as many as possible in good health in the community.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I have some reservations about the final words in section 58, although I see that something like them exists in the 1947 Act, which says that the assistance of nursing care should be given only if people were sick.  In the 1947 Act the health authorities were entitled to assist sick persons. We must get away from making it a condition precedent to nursing attention that people should be sick.  The last section did endeavour to get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which we cannot over-emphasise.  Section 59 is a move in the right direction, to provide a service at home for sick and infirm persons.  I think it is a new section and one we greatly welcome.  I expressed some disappointment on Second Stage, and I do so again, that it does not go further.  At present the Dublin Health Authority, and I am sure other authorities, provide home care and domestic help in cases where mothers are confined <Col N="237" /> to hospital, perhaps, because of a confinement or for some other reason. It may be that that could be done under this section because the children would be regarded as dependants of sick or infirm people.  Of course, a confinement is not a sickness or an infirmity if it concludes with a happy birth.  Perhaps, it is so regarded but I do not know the statutory basis for that.  Assistance is also given by way of domestic help where widows want to go to work to provide an adequate income for the family and which would be impossible if there was not some domestic help to give, say, a midday meal to the children.</P>
    <P>The section, as drafted, would not allow that assistance to be given.  It might be open to the board to continue to give that assistance in the future as in the past but there is the difficulty that at the moment the health authority could send in domestic help and receive no help from the State for doing that but make it a total charge against the ratepayers.  This is charged completely against the rates and it is proper that the community should provide some service if we do not, as we should, provide an ample widows' pension, either contributory or non-contributory, so that widows can go out to work.  This cannot be done without disruption in the home.  Under this section the authority will not have discretion and will not be able to go one penny beyond the authorised expenditure. I fear that there may be a possibility of a termination of this essential service in urban areas where families are becoming divided, where the old family obligations cannot be performed because of the physical distances between the young and the old and so on.  There should be an enabling provision inserted and this should be considered before Report Stage so that assistance could be given to families without requiring as a condition precedent to such assistance that somebody should be sick or infirm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Ryan on this matter.  It does appear as if these people are excluded.  This is a very important section and one about which I have been concerned.  There is a great need for providing home help, particularly in relation to infirm <Col N="238" /> persons.  One of the great scandals in our society which is referred to infrequently, usually by heads of psychiatric hospitals, is the number of old people to be found in mental hospitals, and who are put there simply because they are old and nobody wants them but in theory because they are mentally disturbed.  This has been a reflection of our failure to deal with this very sad and very great problem in our society.  Because of the high level of emigration of the very best and the very active, of those between 18 years and 40 years, we are left with the very young and the very old.  We have an excessively high proportion of old people, which is one of the by-products of emigration over half a century.  Not only have we not dealt with emigration but with this consequence of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all it is most important that we should try to keep old people out of hospital.  Knowing the computerised mind of the Minister on matters of finance and statistics even if he looks at this from that lowest of motives, the financial one, the community would be saved a lot of money if we provided organised and co-ordinated community services directed particularly towards the old in addition to those mentioned by Deputy Ryan. Most of us know of the work being done by Dr. Birch in Kilkenny in an attempt to mobilise the emotional, spiritual and physical resources of the community.  I came across this problem many years ago in tubercular cases where the mother was isolated in hospital.  It was a problem which I am afraid we did not solve.  One proposal I remember making was that it was something which was specifically designed for visiting religious orders who could go into houses three times a day to prepare the meals, get the children out to school, or help a widower or a disabled or infirm person. Whether the people involved were religious or lay it would be a very fine Christian work.  Those of us who work in our constituencies know of the many people who would be greatly assisted by a serious and significant development of such obvious services as the meals on wheels, or the laundry <Col N="239" /> service, or domestic help, or assistance from somebody who would tell them what benefits they were eligible for, or the chiropody service to which Deputy Ryan referred.  Recently we had a look at this problem in the Dublin Health Authority.</P>

      <P>The Labour Whip must have been withdrawn from Deputy Donegan.  What appeared last week to be the successful substitution of Deputy Cluskey for Deputy R. Burke as a Whip for the Fine Gael Party seems to have been shortlived in its success.  His undoubted spectacular success in getting a Fine Gael man to co-operate with them in order to deprive me of the right of dealing with this very important motion has not lasted beyond the one day.  However, it was no doubt edifying to see how successful he was in getting Fine Gael Deputies into the House when Fine Gael themselves failed to get a seconder for their own motion on the preceding day.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> With regard to this motion, which calls on the Government to take a certain line of action which it is contended will result in eliminating the long and expensive process at present necessary before houses can be constructed, I think it has amply been demonstrated that it was not seriously intended.  Despite the fact that we have this list of the full membership of the Labour Party down as sponsoring it, the objective was not&mdash;as it appeared to be&mdash;to convince the Government that there was available to them this miraculous way of constructing houses.  Although it ostensibly called on the Government to take this line of action, every possible stratagem was utilised to prevent the responsible Member of the Government from indicating whether or not he had been convinced by the combined persuasivness of the whole Labour Party of the advisability of taking this course of action.  Indeed, I am sure I was not the only person who was looking forward to this demonstration, even if it was a unique demonstration of concerted action from the Labour Party, both from the new Doctors who have come into the House in this Dáil and also from the scattered remnants of the former Labour Party who survived the advent of the new Doctors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to everything that was said here in this House: I listened to every Deputy who took part in the proceedings&mdash;except of course the Deputy who formally seconded the motion and immediately sat down: he had not anything at all to say.  I do not like suggesting that it was not genuinely intended; I do not like suggesting that it was intended more as a political gimmick and as an effort to encourage the <Col N="241" /> irresponsible elements who have been trying to cause disruption and who were so decisively rejected by the people last June rather than as a serious effort to convince me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This effort to convince me was not in fact made.  I was hoping that somebody would put forward some arguments to show that this remarkable theory, that the long, tedious, laborious and expensive process which has hitherto been involved in the provision of houses can, in fact, be eliminated. I think, in view of what has happened, one must ask oneself the question whether or not this was genuinely intended.  Lest there be any Deputies on the Opposition Benches who are really genuinely concerned with this matter and are taking it seriously, I should like to outline some of the present difficulties in actually providing houses as distinct from talking about them.</P>
      <P>First of all, you cannot provide houses unless you have sites.  A site must be acquired either by the usually fairly lengthy process of acquiring it by agreement&mdash;in which case one very often meets people who are quite obdurate and who insist on extracting the last possible penny from the local authority&mdash;or possibly by going through the process of compulsory purchase which also, because of the necessity to comply with the terms of the Constitution, is a rather lengthy process. However, without a site, whether or not you declare an emergency, in my opinion you cannot build houses: at least, I have not found a way and unfortunately nobody here tried to show me that this could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you get the sites, they must be developed and, before that, they must be surveyed.  The lay-out must be planned and a contract must be obtained in order to carry out the development. After all that is done, house designs must be prepared and, again, tenders must be obtained, a contract placed and eventually building can commence.  That is the only way the Government know of providing houses &mdash;and I do not know that any other <Col N="242" /> Government have discovered any other way.</P>
    <P>I think that this motion would lead us to believe that there was some other way.  I had expected to be told about it since it was calling upon me to adopt this other way of declaring a housing emergency.  Apparently this could get over the different frustrating steps that have to be taken at present and this time-consuming procedure. The thing about this&mdash;I know the Opposition would like to ignore it&mdash;is that on each of these steps, not alone it time consumed but expense is incurred. This business, that unfortunately affects those who are engaged in the provision of houses, can be ignored by irresponsible people such as those who put down this motion.  Money is required.  This can be brushed aside by people who take this irresponsible approach but unfortunately the Government cannot afford to brush it aside.  Like every country in the world &mdash;even those on the other side of the Iron Curtain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am concerned about is what we say in our motion, that there is a crisis in regard to housing but the tenor of all the speeches I have heard from the Members on that side and from the Minister is that there is no such crisis and they are well satisfied with the progress or the lack of progress that there is, well satisfied to <Col N="249" /> have thousands of families in this city and in this country without homes.  It may not be a crisis for the members of the Fianna Fáil Party but it is indeed a crisis for the people who are concerned.</P>
      <P>So far in this discussion the emphasis appears to have been on Dublin because, I suppose, the Deputies who spoke were from Dublin.  While the situation in Dublin is the worst, I should like to remind the House that the crisis also exists in many other places outside the city of Dublin, in the towns and in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is the same in towns in my constituency.  In any case every Deputy must know there is a crisis in housing.  I guarantee that, particularly in these winter months, many of the approaches that are made to the various Deputies and Senators are on the question of the lack of housing.  I defy any Deputy here to say he is not approached many times during the week, or whenever he or she holds a clinic, on the availability of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  As far as the city of Dublin is concerned we have conflicting figures.  I suppose one of the best estimates of the number of houses needed may have been given by Deputy Seán Moore because he was honest enough to disregard what is described as the approved list, which suggests there is a need for something like 4,750 houses, and say the actual number of houses needed in this city is something like 8,000.  Whether it is 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000, the fact is that there are these thousands of people here who want houses badly but who have no prospect of getting them within the foreseeable future.  These figures in regard to housing requirements have varied from speaker to speaker, but we must recognise that there are thousands needed and that there is a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can waste time in this House by comparing the record of the present Minister with that of a Fine Gael Minister or a Labour Minister.  This can be a very amusing exercise, and I could <Col N="250" /> protest in this House, and rightly so, that it was a Labour Minister who had the best record for housing.  In any case these statistics that are thrown from one side of the House to the other make no impression on the people without homes of their own, and there is nothing that has been said recently by members of the Government, either tonight or any other time, that will give any hope to these people that they will be housed within a reasonable time. All we hear from the Minister at Question Time is that efforts are being made.  He may be right when he says that, but the reason for our motion is that we believe that the effort is not sufficient and that a bigger effort should be made.  That is the reason we say there is a crisis and why an emergency must be declared.</P>

      <P>The Minister would not be in a position to know whether there was a crisis in housing when on his own admission in this House, in reply to a question by me, he said he did not know the number of applicants who are on the waiting list for houses in the various local authorities. If he does not know the extent of the problem, how can he deal with it? At least he could give us the result of the housing survey that was carried out by the local authorities about five years ago; we could even go on those figures and consider the number of houses that have been built since then, and the number that have been knocked down, in order that we might know what the actual problem is. There is no use in the Minister doing what he is wont to do: place the responsibility on the local authorities.  His attitude is: when the record is good in certain places he wants to claim credit, but when it is bad he wants to blame the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Dowling, maybe rightly so, congratulated the Minister on the erection of the Ballymun flats.  If he can do that in Ballymun, as Deputy Joe Dowling says, why can he not show the leadership he should give and ensure that a similar number of residences will be built throughout the country?  There is no point in my talking about the record of this Government because as far as housing is concerned it has the worst record in Europe, on either side of the Iron Curtain.</P>

I ask that not alone should we declare a housing emergency but that we should tackle the problem as though it were a real emergency in the same way as Fianna Fáil did, shortly after the last war.  On that occasion they were successful.  We ask them now to declare the same sort of emergency and to ensure that the resources will go to meet the greatest social need, that is, houses.</P>
      <P>In the last two weeks we have had discussions with the trade union movements about this problem.  They want to co-operate in an effort to provide houses; they want to be re-directed&mdash; naturally, they do not want to lose income or status&mdash;to build houses for their fellow workers.  The Minister has admitted that materials are no problem We have been told that there is no shortage as far as money is concerned, but the Labour Party do not believe that in order to acquire money for housing the Government should have to go into competition for money at the same rate as it would have to if it were engaged in some industrial project. We believe this is a social need. We believe, as is the practice in Scandinavian countries, that money should be allowed to come to the local authorities at very much reduced rates of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that Dáil Éireann should concern themselves with the most dejected, dispirited, disheartened, depressed and confused people in our community and that they should particularly concern themselves with finding ways and means of improving the lot of the 12,000 old age pensioners living on their own, and who, living on their own, have to depend entirely upon such pittances as they may receive from the State.  We believe our society is prepared to meet the cost of providing for old age pensioners a pension of not less than £5 per week.  It is to that that we in Fine Gael are committed&mdash;a non-contributory old age pension of £5 per week to be paid at the age of 67 immediately for men and 65 immediately for women as a first step to making the pension available for all at 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that retirement contributory old age pensions should be increased by at least half and that the qualifying age should again be reduced to 67 for men and 65 for women.  We believe this is necessary in order to give to our elderly citizens the minimum required to keep body and soul together.  But that is dealing only with the known old age pensioners, the known 12,000 who are living on their own, with all the old age pensioners who are known to be in difficulties. It does not deal with the countless thousands who are living in uncovered and unknown misery, misery which could be relieved and which ought to <Col N="259" /> be relieved if only we would develop our social services and, instead of pretending the problem does not exist, find ways and means of, first of all, bringing the problem to light and then remedying it.</P>
    <P>This is where we must very severely criticise the Minister for Social Welfare who has refused time and time again to bring into the Department of Social Welfare even one qualified sociologist. The truth is that even the most experienced and well-meaning Minister, or official, or, indeed, Member of this House, is only an amateur in problems of a social character and the problems of a social character are so difficult of resolution, sometimes so difficult of ascertainment that it requires all the techniques and all the skills which the science of sociology can apply to them in order to resolve them.  There have been a number of on-the-spot investigations by charitable organisations and by sociological sections in our universities and each one of these investigations has disclosed a degree of misery and a number of unassisted people far beyond what was believed to exist. There is no use legislating to provide benefits unless steps are taken to ascertain the number entitled to such benefits and unless steps are taken to bring the benefits to them.</P>

      <P>The facts of the case speak for themselves.  Why is Ireland the worst country in Europe, not from a financial or an economic point of view but from a social welfare point of view?  We have this outrageous performance of the galoots of the Fianna Fáil Party being sent in here to try to prevent a reasoned, sensible discussion on the plight of the old age pensioners. This is just an indication of their whole attitude which is one of trying to collect votes by seeing how little they must give to hold on to power and not how much they should give to relieve the abject misery, the loneliness and the ill-health of old people.  If we could bring that discussion to the sensible level on which it should be discussed then by pooling our resources we might be able to do something for the care of our aged who are more deserving of the help of the community.</P>
      <P>We are asking not only for an improvement in the financial level of assistance, which is important, but we are also asking for a substantial improvement in the provision of home help and meal services.  These are the kind of services which could do a great deal more for old age pensioners than even nominal yearly increases in the financial allowances given to them, because many elderly people are incapable of spending the money they get, incapable of spending it in a way beneficial to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What these people require in many <Col N="262" /> cases is the advice and assistance of people who could bring to them benefits which their monetary allowance would not allow them to purchase for themselves.  We ask the Government to make a special effort, with massive contributions, to support the innumerable voluntary organisations which are prepared to give of their charity, their time and their energy but who are unable to give the necessary help without financial assistance.  We should ensure that the people who are charitably disposed and who are prepared to help our senior citizens should be able to devote their energy and their time to this end and that they should not be required, as they are at present, to go begging in the streets, running a series of raffles and other money gathering operations in order to bring vital assistance to elderly people in our community.  What we should do is subsidise these voluntary services with all the financial aid which is necessary to match their effort in order to give a worthwhile service.</P>
    <P>We are lucky in a number of areas in Dublin and in Dún Laoghaire in having very useful and very beneficial organisations which provide meals on wheels and home care but so far we are only scratching the surface.  We need to do a great deal more if we are to help our people adequately.  Fine Gael believe that we have a humanitarian obligation to do this which overrules any monetary disadvantage or any financial embarrassment which any of these things might involve for the Government of the day.  In case that argument is not persuasive enough we believe we should appreciate that by the provision of adequate home meals and meal services, by the provision of domiciliary care, by the provision of home visitors, a community can keep their elder citizens in good health without sending them into costly institutions. One pound invested in home help or in meals services will yield many pounds profit by reason of the reduction which would be brought about in institutional care.</P>
    <P>We have more of our elder citizens in institutions than any other country in Europe.  We have, admittedly, a higher percentage of elder citizens because of our very high emigration rate of able-bodied <Col N="263" /> people some of whom in their closing years return to Ireland, but even allowing for any discrepancy which there may be in the relationship between elder citizens and the rest of the community we still have a much higher percentage of elderly people in institutions. This is indicative of the fact that our old age pensioners are suffering real hardship and because they have not sufficient to maintain themselves with an adequate diet and ample clothing they fall into ill-health and have to receive care in institutions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Department of Social Welfare have moved in the right direction in recent times in that they have provided worthwhile fringe benefits not only in relation to the provision of meals on wheels and so on but in regard to free travel and free electricity. These benefits have been of immense value.  A case comes to my mind as I speak of a lady who is not eligible for the non-contributory pension because she has some small investments, the value of which, of course, is depreciating each year.  Her plea is that she be given not a pension, which she is not seeking because her income is just above making her eligible, but that she be given free travel.  She says, and I believe she is right, that her ability to travel to see her relatives and friends is what is keeping her going.  She is 74 years of age and she still rides a bicycle from Rathmines to Glasnevin twice a week.  She says that her capacity to do this cannot last much longer.  This unfortunate lady is then likely to degenerate into little more than a vegetable and she will be confined to her one room in Rathmines as she has not the income to pay for bus fares twice a week.  This is an illustration of the kind of assistance we should be giving to these people in order to allow them to lead a full life and relieve their misery and their loneliness.</P>
    <P>Loneliness is one of the greatest problems and one of the prime factors which contribute to the disintegration of people in old age.  Loneliness leads to a whole host of problems.  We commend this motion to Dáil Éireann and we ask the House to concern itself with the plight of old age pensioners. <Col N="264" /> This is something which nobody in his sane moments is going to dispute and we anticipate that we will get the unanimous support of the House for this motion.  That is all we ask, to help these old age pensioners, particularly those living on their own, with substantial improvements and with the various fringe benefits that could be given to them to maintain them as useful citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak now.  Every Deputy, irrespective of party will, deep down, agree in principle with the suggestion in this motion.  Deputy Ryan outlined the situation pretty thoroughly and there is very little that I can add to what he said but while the magnitude of the problem of our aged is generally appreciated, unfortunately, there is very little specific knowledge available about the actual problem.  The lack of proper sociological research into the problem of the old age pensioners and into other social problems is a serious setback.</P>
      <P>In appending my name to this motion, I was influenced by the fact that a voluntary group in Limerick city undertook a survey some time ago into the unmet needs of elderly people living alone in Limerick city.  The survey was conducted by the Ignatian Sodality attached to the Church of the Sacred Heart in Limerick which is run by the Jesuit Fathers.  The report of the survey was subsequently published in booklet form.  It pinpoints dramatically some of the problems of old age pensioners, particularly of those living alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one member of the voluntary <Col N="265" /> group who carried out the survey was a qualified sociologist and therefore it was limited in scope.  A total of 64 people were interviewed as a result of a questionnaire which was sent out to 100 people.  The survey revealed that 80 per cent of the old age pensioners interviewed were dependent on the old age pension&mdash;their only income; 11 per cent of them, in addition to their old age pension received contributions from voluntary services and a further 12 per cent, in addition to having the old age pension, had income from savings and investments.  The stark fact is that 80 per cent of those interviewed had no income other than the old age pension. I do not conclude that the figure of 80 per cent which emerged in the Limerick survey would apply throughout the whole country, but it indicates a serious situation.  Just imagine the type of existence these unfortunate persons must endure if they are living alone and are solely dependent on the old age pension.  Each person interviewed was asked how often they could afford a square meal which, for the purpose of the survey, was a meal which included meat, potatoes and some vegetables. Only 50 per cent could afford a square meal each day.  A further 38 per cent could afford a square meal only twice weekly.  A further ten per cent could have a square meal less often than once a week.  The report points out that one old person in ten has a square meal less often than once a week and can reasonably be presumed to be hungry and in fact to be dying of slow starvation.</P>
    <P>These facts emphasise the need for a new deal for our old pensioners, particularly those living alone.  Tremendous work is being done by voluntary groups.  Deputy Ryan referred to the voluntary groups who are doing excellent work in the city of Dublin.  I wish to pay tribute to the many people and the various organisations in my own city of Limerick who, likewise, are doing tremendous work in helping the aged, in trying to make life a little easier for them.  However, voluntary effort is not sufficient, I fear we have left too much to voluntary effort in this serious social problem.</P>
    <P>The same survey examined not merely the income of the old age pensioners in Limerick but also their <Col N="266" /> housing conditions and their health and medical problems.  According to the report, of the 64 people interviewed over 50 per cent had more than one illness.  Only four per cent of those interviewed at that time were in hospital or had been there in the previous three months.  A further 28 per cent had been out-patients; 50 per cent under medical care.  Thirty per cent had bad eyesight and 15 per cent were hard of hearing.  Sixty-six per cent of those who were ill said they would welcome a visit from a medically-trained person but only a small percentage were having such visits.</P>
    <P>The Government are now beginning to recognise the need for home care. I understand that there is provision in the Bill for nursing and home care. We must approach the problem of our old age pensioners in a realistic manner.  They have been left for far too long to eke out a miserable existence, dependent in most cases on the various voluntary organisations who have done a tremendous job.  There is a need for more surveys of this type. I admit that it is very easy to generalise. It is very easy to be emotionally aroused when one speaks of the needy and under-privileged sections of our community.  It is only when we tackle the situation on a factual basis and publish and study the results of work such as that done by the voluntary group in Limerick that we can realise the magnitude of this problem.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will take due notice of this motion.  I do not think it is a motion which should give rise to any political acrimony.  As Deputy Ryan said, it was a deplorable state of affairs that when he stood up a short time ago to propose the motion he was subjected to interruptions and barracking from across the House.  This motion was put down in good faith and with the intention of focusing proper attention on the problems of old age pensioners, and particularly those who are living alone.  I have pinpointed the problem by quoting from the survey which was carried out in Limerick city. I am sure every Deputy in the House is familiar with the problems of the aged and that we all agree about them. Therefore I second the motion and I <Col N="267" /> sincerely hope that the Minister will accept it and that something will be done to alleviate the plight of these unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>This is a motion which, naturally enough, will get the support of every Member of the House. It should have been non-contentious. Nevertheless, when Deputy Ryan started to speak on this motion he accused the Fianna Fáil Party of a number of things.  I think his most scandalous suggestion was that we, in the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole, have not interested ourselves in the problems of the aged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question brought up by Deputy L'Estrange, who continues to embarrass his party by bringing up political matters about the absense of Ministers and so on, we have here a junior Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I should like to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary. It is only fair to say that as Deputies we who deal with the Department of Social Welfare receive answers with great efficiency and great speed. I should like to pay special tribute to him because this is an occasion on which I believe a matter like that arises.</P>
      <P>The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is concerned about the plight of old age pensioners, particularly those living on their own and calls for substantial improvements in their pensions and the provision for them of a comprehensive home-help and meals service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell in his usual fair manner mentioned a sociological survey which was conducted in Limerick. It is a tribute to these people that, in fact, they did conduct a survey.  That <Col N="268" /> is what community effort is all about. In doing so Deputy O'Donnell actually suggested&mdash;and I know he meant it because it is a fact&mdash;that there is a Bill going through Dáil Éireann at this very point in time to deal with this motion, namely, the question of home care and home nursing.  That surely is an answer to the suggestion that this party are not interested in this problem.</P>

      <P>If I may make a number of points about the increases <Col N="269" /> in pensions which were given to recipients of social welfare, in nine years out of the past ten years increases were given to social welfare recipients of one kind or another.  When I use the words &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; I use them in the sense of social security.  Surely that shows an awareness of the problem which this motion allegedly presents?</P>
      <P>As public representatives we are fully aware of the marvellous work done by the voluntary bodies in various areas around the country.  If I might mention one in particular in my own constituency, it is the Dún Laoghaire Old Folks' Association.  Last Sunday 600 people walked from the car ferry terminal on a circuitous route of eight miles to do some good for the old folk in that area.  In that one effort they collected £600.  This is the sort of community effort which gives a great amount of hope and a great sense of security to those people.</P>
      <P>Of course there are old people living on their own.  I do not think it needs a sociological survey to make us realise that.  What we on this side of the House are now doing is ensuring that these people are attended to, that they will receive care, that they are made aware of the fact that they are part of the community in which they live, that they are our senior citizens, and that we have an obligation and a duty to them.  I believe we on this side of the House are discharging this obligation to our senior citizens as best we can within the limited means at our disposal.</P>
      <P>I refute any suggestion that this party are not interested in the plight of these people&mdash;unfortunately made a political plight by the Fine Gael Party in their various statements, with the exception of that made by Deputy O'Donnell who is, as I have said, a fair-minded Deputy.  We are well aware of a social lack in many areas but we are the only party capable of finding a solution to the problems presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to go back to the question of the work being done in the community by the voluntary organisations. No praise is high enough for the work these people do.  Indeed, apart from the situation prevailing in relation to old people living on their <Col N="270" /> own, has the House given any consideration to the position of those people who have no homes to live in, those people who have rejected society?  Have they ever considered the work done by the organisation known as the Simon Community, an organisation which operates in the city of Dublin between the hours of 11 o'clock at night and 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, an organisation which is operated by young people?  We hear a lot of condemnation of young people but these are young people, students, civil servants and people from all strata in the community.  They are aware of the social problem which prevails.  Not only are they aware of it but they do something practical about it.  The Simon Community deserves the greatest praise from this House.  They go from door to door, almost literally, around the city.  I do not suggest that the community as a whole has done nothing at all for the unfortunate people whom they attend to&mdash;the unfortunate people who have rejected society and, as a consequence, have probably become addicted to alcohol or have some such unfortunate sociological problem.  This work is being done by young people in our community.  Every Deputy must be in favour of the sentiments of this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about domiciliary care for sick and infirm persons and, where there are dependants, the amendment Deputy Ryan proposes, and which I support on behalf of the Labour Party, to include widows or widowers.  I was making the point that the lack of care given to old people in our society, which is a very big problem for various reasons, is probably the most shocking manifestation of our indifference to human suffering which is to be seen in the country.  In a country in which there are many manifestations of indifference to human suffering to be <Col N="271" /> seen, whether it is in relation to the health services, housing, emigration, unemployment, I think the lack of care of our old people is likely to be the greatest single indictment of our appalling callousness as a nation professing Christian virtues.  This provision is, as I have suggested to Deputy Andrews, long overdue, from 1932 until 1969, 37 years.  The fact that we are now getting to the stage where we are saying in a Health Bill that a health board may make arrangements to do these things is its own eloquent evidence of the indifference of the Government to this problem over the years.</P>
      <P>Putting it at its lowest&mdash;because we have got to the stage in Ireland, as a strictly materialistic and hedonist society, in which all that matters is money and what you can buy for it&mdash; it would save the Government money if we were to provide this type of domiciliary care service.  Putting it at its highest level, we would be caring for people who are unable to help themselves, people who have given everything they could give to the creation of the society we have here, for better or for ill, but who can now give little or no return for whatever we can do for them.  Therefore, this makes great demands on our idealism, and it is possible that, because there has been so little of that in our society over the last half century, so little has been done in that regard.  As I say, I was concerned with this years ago in the tuberculosis question, and I feel that at least one worthwhile job would be done in encouraging the religious orders to take on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of the widower referred to in Deputy Ryan's amendment.  Quite often one finds that a man is left with four or five young children on the death of the mother and he is in an utterly helpless situation. I know of families in which there are children of one, two, five, six, seven years of age, and so on, each one practically completely dependent on the unfortunate widower.  Leaving aside the appalling emotional problems which are created by the loss of the mother at an early age, when the children are young, the physical problems which the <Col N="272" /> widower has to face are enormous.  It would be a most valuable provision in the Bill if some service could be provided to help this person to keep the family together.  Most men in such circumstances are helped by relations, but frequently the relations have their own worries and after the first few months the effort dies and the person is left on his own.  If this service were available it would avoid sending the children to an institution which creates even greater emotional problems for the children.  The same applies to the widow.  I am one of those people who do not believe that a married woman with a family should go out to work.</P>

      <P>I am not pursuing that point.  I am simply saying that it does arise in this case that the woman with a family should not be forced to go out to work, as she is frequently forced to do in our community.  It is very cruel and heartless to force the average widow to make a choice between going out to work to try to keep her family in the home and sending them to an institution, which again results in serious emotional disturbance for the children. Anything that can help the widow in those circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I welcome the proposals that are being made in relation to the sick and the infirm.  Would the Minister, <Col N="273" /> in relation to the health board, feel it necessary to say that a health board shall make arrangements?  He should be very much more directive in his approach to this problem in order to make many more of the local authorities provide these essential services which should have been provided a long time ago.</P>

      <P>I understand that section 54 (2) of the Health Act, 1953, is not being repealed and that section 59 (1) and (2) can be applied to it, and that home help can be given to persons who, although they might not be sick themselves, would have to have institutional care unless they could not otherwise be provided for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Between now and the Report Stage I shall ask the officers of the Department to look at this again to make quite sure we have got this correct.  We do intend to have home help available for such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear to the House that even Great Britain, which has twice the income per head of ourselves, has not come near a solution for solving the home help problem. They are only able to take care of about half of the people who need this kind of help.  It is estimated that there is demand in Britain for a home help service for 8.5 per cent of the aged living in private households.  This is partly due to the difficulty of getting staff and it is partly due to other reasons that I need not go into.  We are going to go ahead with this.  Not only for statistical cold-blooded financial reasons, as suggested by Deputy Dr. Browne, but for entirely human reasons&mdash;irrespective of the savings that can be made&mdash;we believe in keeping people out of homes as much as possible.  We believe these homes will be required in the future as the number of people over the age of 65 who continue to live longer increases because of the discoveries of new <Col N="274" /> drugs and even possibly because of the effect of chemotherapy on a long-term basis on the dreadful disease of cancer. We do therefore intend to develop these kind of services.</P>
    <P>I should also say that, although I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that some elements of our society are affluently selfish, the Report on the Aged Poor revealed that a tremendous amount is being done by voluntary organisations all over the country. Such organisations provide outings for old people, chiropody and similar services as well as the service provided by the meals on wheels organisation.  A great many old people's organisations are growing up, such as these in Cork, and collaboration between the various voluntary organisations, the local authorities and the State is needed.  This could be done by the setting up of a national council for consideration of the aged poor, which would act as coordinator in the exchange of ideas. Many problems have to be solved such as whether or not home helps should be full-time or part-time; should they all be paid and should we have highly trained home helps; and should we have people willing to give their services freely to help find people to do this work.  Not everyone can or wants to do this type of work and not everyone has the ability or time to do so. There is also the question of avoiding unnecessary overlapping and excessive expense through all the various services operating for people who are psychiatrically ill but who can be kept at home by these social workers.  There is also the question of whether home help officers should be directly appointed and paid for by the regional health boards or whether they should be paid for by voluntary organisations. This is a very complex business and we are going to go ahead with it as fast as we can afford to do so.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that my own priorities in regard to the health services are in keeping young children healthy by the development of the child health service and in looking after the old people and mentally handicapped people, particularly the mentally-handicapped people.  We have not yet sufficient places for the mentally-handicapped <Col N="275" /> but we are beginning to reach the end of that problem.  The number of places completed and the number in course of completion amount to 1,400 and this almost fills the requirement of the mentally-handicapped.</P>
    <P>I feel most sympathetic about this matter and I would assure the House that section 59 will be used in the best way possible.  The matters referred to by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Ryan relating to an amendment which was considered out of order will be examined and if we feel there is not sufficient and not definite commitment to be able to give aid of this kind to the class of people they have mentioned we will put in an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This is a very good section.  Unfortunately, the amendments on it have been ruled out of order at this stage.  The present situation with regard to home helps is far from satisfactory.  There are a few voluntary and religious organisations providing home helps.  The Minister has already said that these voluntary groups are doing tremendous work in this field but the work which they are doing is not getting to the root of the problem.</P>
      <P>One of the main causes for having to introduce this section into the Bill is because of the malnutrition of the aged.  Elderly people are not getting sufficient nourishment in their diet and as a result of this some of them have been deprived of vitamins essential for brain function.  This has resulted in their premature admission to mental hospitals which is one of the reasons why this country has the highest percentage of its population in mental homes and mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides for the assistance and maintenance at home of a sick or infirm person.  The infirm will, of course, relate to the number of mentally defective cases which we have.  Many of these cases have resulted from improvements in our medical skills, the saving of premature infants with a high rate of mental deficiencies and a low IQ rate and the psychiatric treatment, <Col N="276" /> which has been so successfully applied in health authority areas, resulting in the open door method of treatment. However, this has added to the number of people who are at home sick and infirm.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will appreciate, this section of our population will always increase regardless of the facilities provided. We have got to be prepared for a gradual increase in the number of sick and infirm persons in our society.  The meals on wheels organisation, which the Minister has stated he would include in a home help service, does excellent work.  At the moment we have public health nurses engaging themselves in jobs such as lighting fires, cooking meals, washing clothes and washing patients which has nothing to do with their nursing duties at all.  All this work can be done by a home help.  It is very time-absorbing for a public health nurse to have to cook a meal or make a pot of tea for these people.  It is not in the best interests of the efficient execution of her duties.  It is one of the problems we have in our area.  Very often nurses who are doing the home help service are sent on messages.  In charity, they cannot refuse but it is a great waste of skill and time.</P>
    <P>A very noted doctor in this country has said that it was not a good day when antibiotics were discovered because they prolonged the life of so many infirm, old people who had suffered strokes and who normally would have passed on but who are now being kept alive for many years oblivious to their circumstances and surroundings.  It is an excellent thing to provide a home help service for these people.</P>
    <P>I note the wording in the section is: &ldquo;... may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of sick and infirm persons or their dependants&rdquo;.  It does not say &ldquo;maintenance of dependants at home&rdquo;.</P>

It can mean that they can have it completely free of charge for three days a week or for six days a week.  There are many interpretations.  The easiest one is that one would have to make a contribution if required to the wages of the home help but I would prefer to see here that any home help which it is necessary to provide for sick or infirm persons or their dependants should be provided completely free of charge.</P>

      <P>It is of vital importance to the nation that the health of the people should be carefully guarded.  I have frequently referred in this House to the question of mentally handicapped children.  I live near a very fine hospital outside Sligo which is doing marvellous work but which, unfortunately, is unable to admit all the cases that seek admission.  I have on many occasions been asked to make representations to have a person admitted but, of course, there is no need to make representations to the matron who is anxious to deal fairly with everybody on the long waiting list. It is only when a vacancy arises that she can accept another patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather astonishing that there should be so much talk about the <Col N="278" /> building of luxury hotels while we fail to provide adequate accommodation for mentally handicapped children.  The family that cannot find a place for such a child suffers severely as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are county homes overflowing with aged persons as the result of the fact that home service is not available.  We have frequently emphasised the fact that if an allowance were given for the maintenance and care of these people at home the old people would be happier. As Deputy Dr. Browne has said, when these people are put into a county home they are remembered for about six months and after that it is only if some person sees them in the county home that one knows whether they are dead or alive.  Home help should be given to aged persons.  There is a general feeling that nobody cares about the aged.  Taxation has become so heavy that even very good families have been forced to agree to a father or mother being sent to a home simply because home help is not available.  At <Col N="279" /> estimates meetings members of local authorities are told of the expense involved in maintaining a patient in an institution and have often pointed out that these persons could be maintained at home at much less cost.  That is the kernel of the problem.  If an allowance were made the aged could be maintained in their own homes.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that this process is likely to make considerable progress over the next five years because of the work of voluntary associations and because of the continuous growth of local community feeling.  The Deputy need not worry about the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  He may be certain that in the next five years this concept will expand greatly and, because the communities themselves have been and are doing a great deal of work themselves, they will be only too glad to have the necessary assistance from the local authority subsidised by the State.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, referred me to the wrong section of the 1953 Act or else he misunderstood the purport of my remarks and my intended amendment.  I am concerned, <Col N="280" /> as are others here, with the provision of assistance to enable a widow or a widower, as the case may be, to keep the children in their own home.  That is perfectly feasible if someone comes in for two or three hours, cooks the main meal and does the cleaning; the widow or widower can come home from work at the end of the day and put the children to bed.  The section of the 1953 Act to which the Minister referred me provides that where a person is unable to provide shelter or maintenance for himself and his dependants he will be eligible for institutional assistance and that means shelter and maintenance in the county home.  That is not what we want.  That breaks up the home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section. It is a very laudable thing to have a home help service and, in providing this service, the Minister is reflecting the policies we have been advocating for a very long time indeed.  As my colleague, Deputy Dr. Byrne, said earlier a great deal of the work which will be carried out by the home help service is at present being carried out by public health nurses.  They are asked to prepare meals and clean homes, and so on.  This will be a great relief to them, the more so as not enough public health nurses have been appointed.  In one area in which, according to circular No. 27, there should be three nurses, in actual fact, there is only one.  In <Col N="281" /> arranging this home help service I sincerely hope the Minister will not allow the kind of understaffing which has happened in the case of public health nurses to occur in this service.  There are so few nurses in some areas that there is no one to relieve them and they cannot get any proper holidays. I also hope there will be no difference in conditions.  In the case of the public health nurses some have much better leave than others.  Some areas lag behind. I hope this will not happen in the case of the home help service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something on which medical colleagues could advise us, but it seems to me that the provision of medical, surgical and nursing services for infants up to the age of six weeks is inadequate and the period should be extended.  My proposal of six months might impose a charge on State funds and is, therefore, not in order and the Chair had no option but to rule it out.  Nevertheless, I press the point that six weeks is inadequate. There are expenses following on the birth of a baby.  Some capital outlay has invariably to be incurred, not so much, perhaps, in the case of the second and subsequent children as in the case of a first baby.  There are expenses which impose a certain hardship, one people gladly shoulder, but the State could go a little further than six weeks and I would urge the Minister to extend the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make.  First, the position is at the moment that the mother and her baby are discharged from hospital within seven days and the family doctor with whom the mother is registered sees the mother during that period.  At the end of the seven days he is paid for his post-natal visit.  On the other hand, if he sees the <Col N="282" /> mother outside a certain date, after the birth, he is not paid for the visit.  There is something wrong about this.  There has been a certain amount of cheeseparing and in the past I have suggested that this post-natal visit should be defined as one occurring within seven days of the mother being discharged. In other words, she would spend roughly a week in the hospital, then she would return home and would then be visited by her medical practitioner. Some practitioners do this, not in every case, but at a time of convenience, perhaps, when they are passing the house, while at other times they may be called in and they are not paid for this visit.  By altering the regulations to stipulate within seven days of being discharged from the hospital would encourage the practitioners to visit both the mother and the baby and there would be this extra care for the infant.</P>
      <P>If a doctor sees a baby who is five weeks old and he finds that the baby has some defect will that baby be treated by the health authority even though it may be eight weeks before the baby gets to hospital?  If the defect is found before the six weeks' period arrangements may not be made for the baby to be hospitalised until after that and will the health authority accept the responsibility in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The six weeks limitation here on mothers and children is purely one by definition referring to perinatal death, and is in entirely for classification reasons.  This is the only logical reason why this should be put in here.  Those of us who are in general practice have had the experience of trying to get a five weeks old baby back into hospital.  You may have to wait for a week.  The maternity hospital will not take the child back because when they do it will be six weeks and one day old.  In the case of my own son, which I shall never forget, he took ill approximately four hours before he was six weeks old and there was consternation about whether they would get him into hospital before he was six weeks.  We come up against this arbitrary age limit on numerous occasions in the field of medicine. This limit could be extended without <Col N="283" /> any necessary charge on the health services because the child, if he is fully eligible for maternity services, is almost certainly entitled to full eligibility under section 57 for free drugs, etc., and hospitalisation.  I do not think that the free treatment under section 61 should be limited to six weeks.  I do not think we should limit this at any stage because, as Deputy Dr. Gibbons pointed out, there are many occasions when you refer a child under six weeks to hospital by the time a cot or a bed is available the child is over six weeks.  It is introducing bureaucracy into a very important section of medicine, namely, the perinatal stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support both previous speakers in the suggestion that the Minister should have another look at this.  This matter should not be determined by a bureaucratic decision of this kind.  Six weeks, six months, six years&mdash;who knows when the child will be fit for discharge? Surely, it should be a medical decision when the mother is ready for discharge, at the discretion of the practitioner or the hospital?  At least that should be allowed to the people concerned.  Hospitals are not going to keep patients in hospital unnecessarily. This should not be restricted to a six weeks' period.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not fully appreciate it but a decision of this kind can condition decisions affecting people's health and can condition things like bed usage and facilities in quite a remarkable way.  Fees paid, say, for domiciliary midwifery care could quite radically change the incidence of domiciliary midwifery.  For instance, the voluntary health insurance system is institutionally orientated and tends to increase the number going to hospital although they may not need to do so but simply because it will enable them to benefit from the scheme.  The Minister should be careful before fixing a period of this kind and he should try to leave it as open as he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into this matter to see if there is something which restricts a child who comes to <Col N="284" /> the notice of the maternity doctor that from a maternity point of view the child requires to be kept in hospital for a period of over six weeks.  I gather that the section is based on the fact that in the ordinary way a maternity doctor considers that, form the point of view of immediate post-natal service, he is finished with the child of six weeks.  This may be out of date. We will look at it and see if it should be made slightly more flexible.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dr. Gibbons I will look into this question, about which I am afraid I know nothing, of encouraging the practitioner to visit the child within a certain period.  I was not aware that there was this difficulty. The House is aware that children of the middle income group and in the medical card group if they have real disabilities discovered either after birth at any time, or at birth, can get free treatment in hospital and the payment of drugs.  That would cover a number of cases of this kind.  I do not feel completely bound by the six weeks and so I will look into the matter.  To tell the truth I have not had any complaints of children suffering from this cutting off at the six weeks, partly because those with medical cards continue to have free service.</P>
      <P>We intend to set up child health services and to have a special examination of all children at six months of age.  Section 64 (1) will provide for this.  There should be at least one other examination.  Some Deputies have mentioned the rather grim facts about defects discovered in schoolchildren which should have been discovered at an earlier age.  We intend to have these two examinations before the child is six years of age.  I shall have a look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment was ruled out of order as it might impose a <Col N="285" /> charge on State funds which is clear when one seeks to increase the maternity grant from £8 to £20.  The increase from £4 to £8 after a long interval of years would not seem to indicate a genuine effort to make the maternity grant of any worthwhile value in this day and age.  We are supposed to be legislating for the years ahead.  In fixing this sum of £8 by statute there is not much expectation that it will be amended for very many years to come.</P>
      <P>When the figure of £4 was fixed for the maternity grant, the pint of stout cost 1s 2d.  It is now 3s 2d&mdash;up or down one penny depending on the location of one's drink.  The grant has not kept pace with the price of celebrating a birth and it has little real value in relation to the maintenance of the infant, much less the mother. As the grant is deemed to be for the purpose of assisting the great event of bringing a new being into the world, I believe it should be made something worthwhile: even £20 is not a great deal but it is certainly a great deal better than £8.  What is the actual amount paid under this head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If we raise the grant to £20, it would cost nearly £250,000 over and above the cost of the increase from £4 to £8.  Again, this is a question of priorities.  I could spend the money better at the moment on other more needed services, such as child health services.  I understand the convivial spirit in which Deputy Ryan related the grant to pints of stout.  I am told that one can get 50 pints of stout for £8.  The Deputy will agree that a great many hard-pressed mothers would probably spend this grant not only on a little stout, perhaps, but on more essential things.</P>

In view of the many other services we want to provide, it would be as well to leave the grant at £8.  Perhaps we can increase it later when circumstances are more favourable.</P>

      <P>In the case of a family in the lower income group where there may be as many as ten children and where the mother is going into hospital for a further confinement, there can be a lot of disturbance in the family and very often the dispensary doctor has to put some of these children into an institution while the mother is having a baby.  Home help might possibly overcome this problem.  The grant of £8 in respect of each child born is supposed to offset some of the expenses attaching to childbirth but it is utterly inadequate.  I should prefer to see the really hard-pressed members of our community receive a higher maternity grant and its withdrawal from those who do not really need it.  Think of the cost of clothing the child, of a cot, a pram and the other incidentals.  A grant of £8 would not go very far towards meeting the expenses.  It would buy <Col N="287" /> less than 32 packets of cigarettes.  It is not an awful lot to welcome a new child.  Perhaps the number of people to be entitled to the grant could be limited so as to enable more money to be given to those who would benefit?</P>

      <P>We view with considerable disappointment the introduction of the Victorian assessment of need in relation to the provision of milk.  We have just spoken about people with full eligibility, people in the lower-income group and people who it is understood are destitute or nearly destitute.  Section 63, however, requires a new means test to apply to the provision of milk for children under five years of age.  They will not receive free milk unless it can be established that their parents &ldquo;are unable from their own resources to provide the children with an adequate supply of milk&rdquo;.  This is very close, indeed, to the poor law test of &ldquo;a person who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide the necessities of life&rdquo;.  Milk and milk products are essential for children under five years of age.</P>

      <P>The section provides:</P>
      <P>A health board may make arrangements for the supply of milk to expectant mothers with full eligibility, nursing mothers with full eligibility, and children under five years of age whose parents are unable from their own resources to provide the children with an adequate supply of milk.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy see my point?  Full eligibility gives free milk to expectant mothers and nursing mothers but not to the children of people who are entirely eligible for other services unless it can be established that they &ldquo;are unable from their own resources to provide the children with an adequate supply of milk&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk is a very costly item today. Milk products are provided for in subsection (2).  They can also give the benefits which can be obtained from <Col N="289" /> the direct consumption of milk.  The point is that the larger proportion of families in the Dublin region who have medical cards do not eat butter, because they cannot afford butter.  They spread margarine very thinly, but they do not eat butter.  It might, in fact, be a great benefit to the farming community if people who are entitled to full eligibility and their children were to get free milk.  It is something that should be done.  It is done in a very large number of European countries.  I do not know of anywhere it is not done, and I know several where it is. A dairying country like Ireland which has a surplus of milk ought to be glad to provide it in this way.</P>
    <P>We are concerned here with a Health Bill and with health matters.  Building up the bone structure and the health of our children is an investment in the future, and it will save medical costs later.  We should not have undernourished children in our community. I believe that this requirement that they must prove inability to provide milk from their own resources is too severe a test, and an unnecessary test which we ought to do away with.  If people have medical cards they should get free milk as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Ryan on this, but does the Minister seriously intend to restrict the provision of milk to people who cannot provide milk from their own resources?  The first five years of a child's life are most important years.  The finest food of all is milk.  Therefore, if the Government are seriously concerned for the welfare of young children it seems to me that every effort should be made to see that young children up to the age of five years have free access to milk and other vitamin-producing substances such as orange juice.  Both the warring countries of Germany and Britain during the war years gave priority to nursing mothers of course and, in particular, to young children in regard to all those essential supplies and high food content supplies, particularly milk and the vitamin foods of one kind or another.  This was a wonderful thing.  The Minister should look at the section again to see if there is this qualification suggested by Deputy Ryan.</P>

      <P>I will look into it again.  In the short time I have been Minister for Health it was not possible for me to examine everything in the vast panoply of services provided.  I honestly have not looked into the milk service yet.  I am told by the Department that if we say &ldquo;children under five years of age whose parents are unable from their own resources to provide the children with an adequate supply of milk&rdquo;, we are more likely to get the really necessitous people provided with milk.  The way it works out in relation to budgeting for food in comparison with full eligibility status is that you may find people who are outside the full eligibility class but who still cannot afford to provide milk.  It is actually in the interests of the families to leave it this way.  Perhaps in view of the increase in the cost of milk and the general changes in the patterns of consumption, we ought to have another look at this.  I absolutely agree with the Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  We must do the utmost we can to make quite sure that no family suffers through a lack of the provision of milk, which is one of the essential and excellent foods.  I will look into it again but I am told at the moment that it would be better to leave it this way and that more children would get milk if we leave the section in its present form.</P>

      <P>In my short time in this field I feel that there is not a sufficient number of people coming forward for this service.  The needy people do not always present themselves to go through red-tape and, in some cases, unavoidable humiliation, subjective as it may be in certain cases, to enable them to obtain free milk and other free things which are going.  I feel personally from my own experience that, were this milk made free to every child under five years of age, the Minister might find that not everybody would be claiming it and in this way we would be assured that all the needy children got milk and there would be no need for the Minister to worry in this regard. Otherwise, I feel that only the needy children whose parents are aggressive enough to come forward for milk will <Col N="291" /> get it.  Once again, the section of people to whom I have referred previously on other sections, the shy and retiring individual, and the proud person who does not want to be subjected to a means test, will not benefit from this Health Act.  These people will be neglected in this Bill and I feel that the provision of free milk for all children under five years of age would be a good thing.  I am glad the Minister is to look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a significant change between the 1953 provisions and the present ones.  I would be grateful if the Minister would say why the change has been made.  Under the 1953 Act it is provided that, where a health authority are not satisfied that an adequate health examination is available for the pupils attending a school in their functional area, which provides elementary education and is not a national school, the health authority may, by order, direct that this section shall apply to the school. That is the section providing for school health examination and treatment, but the test under the 1953 Act is the satisfaction of the health authority as to the adequacy of health examination in a school which is not a national school.  Now we are proposing in this Bill to provide that the health examination shall not take place unless the governing body of the school so <Col N="292" /> requests.  This seems to me to be a retrograde act which could arise where the health authority is not satisfied in regard to the health condition of children or the adequacy of examination. It would appear we are proposing to divest health authorities of the power to direct such examinations.  I am a person who is entirely on the side of the freedom and the rights of the individual, even where the individual is acting contrary to his own interests, but the right of a parent or guardian not to undergo the examination still exists and would still exist even if the health authority could direct the holding of an examination in a school. The Minister may have good reason for the change, but I should be glad if he would explain why.</P>

To what extent&mdash; again we have this old question of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;will they be required to provide satisfactory accommodation? If services are provided at all surely they should be provided under satisfactory conditions from the point of view of the child and the doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy probably knows, in some of the newer schools in the country there is a proper room where these examinations can take place.  In other cases the conditions for examination of the children are not satisfactory, and the doctor does his best, aided by the public nurse who is appointed to the area.  Later on we intend to make more provisions for the training of teachers to watch out more closely for certain neurotic conditions which they will not attempt to analyse but they will know something about the children who might be selected by the doctor and the nurse for prior examination.  In fact, some kind of selective examination is essential because the burden placed on the medical fraternity by the school examinations is tremendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated, the pre-school examination will take place at other prescribed places which could include general practitioners' surgeries or dispensary surgeries as distinct from child health clinics which have been the only places where children under six could be examined up to now.  That will be a change for the better.  Subsection (4), I understand, is hardly ever likely to be used in that no school manager of an ordinary national school refuses to give examination facilities, at the present time in any event.  In regard to the elementary school which is not a national school and is, therefore, privately owned, there was a section <Col N="294" /> in the 1953 Act under which you could compel a private school to have a school medical inspection of the children. Apparently it was not considered possible to make use of this and we feel we shall get along much better if we ask for their consent and encourage them to permit examination. I have not the slightest doubt they will do this, so gradually the school examination system will begin to apply to elementary schools that are not national schools.  In fact, there are already examinations in a great many private schools, as the Deputy knows, and this is merely extending the facility.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with subsections (2) and (3).  All our people are enjoying the medical examination at national school level, it is not confined to any particular group, but I am wondering whether or not the Department of Health are aware of the fact that in national schools today the tendency is for a child to leave at an earlier age than he did before.  Formerly we thought of a child leaving a national school at the age of 14 and as a result a child enjoys these services.  Most children are now leaving national school at the age of 12 plus and in some cases we find children who are educationally entitled to leave at less than 12.  It would appear to me that we are taking away from the parents of those children a very commendable service which they have enjoyed to date.  It may be said that the ideal situation would be that those children at the age of 12 should have the service of their own doctor; but the middle income group, who are contributing heavily in their rates to the health fund, will be deprived of these services when the child reaches the age of 12.  I do not think it should be confined to national school or elementary education.  I think a case can be made for making this service available to children until they reach the age of 14.</P>

I should like to know if there is any provision in the Bill for the assurance that the treatment prescribed will be carried out.  I have in mind such things as speech defects, hearing defects, early indications of autism and possibly symptoms of epilepsy.  Very often the <Col N="297" /> child will be prescribed a certain treatment but the mother will not bother to go ahead with it.  We are giving a completely free service to the fully eligible section, but the fully eligible section has the highest incidence of diseases such as epilepsy and diabetes.  The fully eligible section is not the most stable section.  For reasons best known to themselves they do not even bring their children down for vaccination.  What I should like to know is, if I, as a practising doctor, discover a child has a certain hearing defect, is there any way in which the parents can be compelled to ensure that these defects will be remedied by the treatments available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I agree entirely with the Minister that this is one of the clearest sections of the Bill? The purpose of it is to prevent situations which have arisen in the past in which the health authority have sought to conduct medical examinations in schools and have not been provided with proper facilities for doing it and have had to do it in corridors or classrooms that have not been cleared of desks and other things.  I agree with the Minister that the number of occasions on which it might need to be used are few and far between.  It is to provide an authority for the health board to carry out a medical examination efficiently in the event of their coming up against an unreasonable manager or headmaster and it is better left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I would ask the Minister to have a look at subsection (3).  I would much prefer to see a marriage of subsection (3) of section 19 of the 1953 Act and subsection (3) here.  The decision as to whether or not an examination is conducted in a private elementary school should not rest solely with the governing body of this school.  Perhaps it would be better also not to provide as we did in the 1953 Act that a health authority had to be satisfied that the examination and treatment in school was inadequate before it even sought the right to go in but simply to provide in the Bill that a health authority may apply the section to an elementary school which is not a national school and to provide for consultation and for the kind of agreement which the Minister anticipates would be given in most cases.  I do not know why it is necessary to make an order as the subsection suggests but there may be some administrative reason for that but if it is proposed to carry out the examination in an elementary school why not carry it out without the formality of an order being made by the board?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are again proposing in this Bill, as we did in the 1953 Act, to provide dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility. I notice that the word used here is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and not &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which does appear to impose an obligation on a health board.  I am surprised that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has not been used although the Minister has said that that is supposed to mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the rather Gilbertain situation at the moment that we are aware that we have failed to provide the dental, ophthalmic and aural services to which people were entitled under the 1953 Act and, being so aware, we proceed to write solemnly into this Bill that which we know we are not already doing.  This seems wrong.  I would much prefer that the Minister would take his courage in his hand and acknowledge that we would not provide dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and instead provide that we would very definitely provide these services for certain sections of the community and provide stepping stones to enable us to cross to the position in which we would provide them for larger sections of the community.  The present position in which we detect dental, ophthalmic and aural defects and, having detected them, have a waiting list of up to two years and more for treatment is deplorable in the extreme and I think it is wrong morally that Oireachtas Éireann should be purporting to confer an entitlement to services at a time when it knows it is not in a position to provide these <Col N="301" /> services at all.  The 1953 Act has never been any more than partially implemented so far as these services are concerned.  We appreciate the need to provide these services all right but we have to do something really drastic if health boards are to be in a position to provide the services which we say here they shall provide.</P>
    <P>We have, for instance, at the moment national school children who are entitled to get free dental treatment and in order for those children to receive free dental treatment we should have 500 dentists looking after them.  The fact is that we have only 120 public authority dentists, so that we have only about one-quarter, or less, of the number of dentists necessary to provide the health services which the 1953 Act said were to be provided and that is 16 years ago.</P>
    <P>Again, a similar position applies in relation to ophthalmic and aural services and the Minister has acknowledged that we have had waiting lists of up to two years for hospitalisation where surgical attention was necessary. An effort is being made to cut down on this but such a situation should never have been allowed to develop.  We must anxiously apply all the energies of the new health boards and regional hospital authorities to ensure that the present backlog of work is attended to with the minimum of delay and that similar situations are not permitted to arise again.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we should be trying to programme our rate of advance towards providing these services and I would instance the example of Norway where it is incumbent on a health authority to attain certain predefined stages of development within certain periods of time.  There are measures available to make health authorities account for their failure if they do not provide them.  But health authorities as such are not to blame. It is our whole national approach to the provision of these very essential services which has been so very defective. Dental defects, ophthalmic defects or aural defects are all very serious.  We were talking earlier today about the need to declare an emergency in relation to another public service.  Perhaps, <Col N="302" /> we should realise the need to regard these as emergencies as well.</P>
    <P>I would recall the fact that TB, diphtheria, polio, would never have been eradicated if approached with the same seeming indifference that we now apply to defects of a dental, ophthalmic and aural nature and, therefore, with all the sincerity that we can command we urge upon the Minister to ensure that we provide full care for teeth, full eye care and full ear care for everybody in the community who needs it and is not in a position to pay for it so that we can prevent situations arising, such as now arise and must be known to many people, where people have teeth extracted, have an impression taken for the false teeth and have to wait two years before they get them.  At that stage the teeth do not fit the mouth which has been left without any kind of teeth for two years.  This is a very urgent service and, because we are conferring entitlement here, we must not think that we are also conferring the means of achieving the object aimed at.  We must ensure that the means of achieving these rights are attained within the least possible time.</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties in prescribing optical apparatus or optical treatment for elderly people is their inability to make their way around the city.  Would the Minister consider providing some form of transport?  There is transport available in the health authority at the moment.  Will that be included under subsection (1) of section 65?  Elderly people are unable very often to make their way to the specialist hospitals and subsequently to the opticians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical matter mainly.  I do not think there is anything to prevent visits to the elderly in their own homes.  I would encourage such visits.  I am told that there is difficulty in some cases because one cannot transport the equipment required to the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend to improve the dental services.  I am absolutely frank with the House: the dental service is far from perfect.  There are not enough dentists.  In some areas there are not enough private dentists even though <Col N="303" /> they could earn a very good living. The number of dentists in the public service has increased by 20 per cent in the last two years and the amount spent has increased by 40 per cent. But that is still not sufficient.  We should go on expanding the service as quickly as we can.  Deputies will have seen proposals for improving the ophthalmic and aural services.  These will be introduced according as the finance is made available.  The ophthalmic service is not bad.  The aural service is reasonably satisfactory, though there is room for improvement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 93:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 30, line 25, before &ldquo;premises&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or assist others in providing or maintaining&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to make it quite clear that not only may a health authority provide, under this section, this specific service itself but it may assist others in providing or maintaining such a service.  Health authorities are, in fact, assisting many voluntary bodies in the provision of this service but the section, as drafted, would appear to limit this activity to the health authority itself and that, I think, would be most undesirable. Not only should a health board provide and maintain premises, workshops, farms, gardens, materials and equipment for the purpose of rehabilitation but it should also be able to assist others in providing these facilities.  Perhaps &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; includes assistance to others to do this but, in case there is any doubt, I should like to see it written in clearly because, if it is not, we may be in some difficulty later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assistance of many voluntary organisations in this most commendable work is something which no public authority will ever be able to replace.  Because of that every encouragement should be given to organisations doing this invaluable work. I think the effect of the section is that the provision of assistance is for <Col N="304" /> the purpose of training disabled persons.  There is no provision for sheltered employment subsequent to training.  Not only should the health authority train the handicapped but they should make the training meaningful by providing employment opportunities after training.  If that is not done the handicapped may find themselves trained but unwanted, trained without any opportunity of using that training.  From an economic point of view that would be complete waste. Worse still, people would have had their hopes built up and, deprived of worthwhile employment, their distress would be great because their hope would be dashed to the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the point that the rehabilitation service is more or less tied by reason of the fact that there is no extended provision in the shape of grants for these, shall we say, school leavers to continue in training and it would be a pity, in the light of this progressive legislation with regard to rehabilitation, if we did not have a scheme to enable those discharged to become fully rounded and trained for whatever calling they may wish to follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) is excellent. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That is most encouraging. I interpret this to mean that a health board will make available the service necessary for the training of the disabled and not that they may make it available.  This is really an excellent section.  It is tackling the problem at its roots.  We have numerous voluntary organisations attempting to rehabilitate people and they are doing an excellent job within the resources available to them.  We must bear in mind what I have already stressed, that the percentage of our population which is disabled is going to increase and continue to increase.  The epileptics, diabetics, people suffering from spina bifida, congenital heart diseases, the mental defectives and the psychiatric cases which we are keeping alive are all going to increase and, therefore, I am delighted to see this section, that each health board will provide a rehabilitation service.  I should like to see provision also that any disabled person who <Col N="305" /> is entitled to social welfare benefits should be allowed retain them after being placed in suitable employment. We must bear in mind that the time these people would spend in employment is not generally as long as that which a normal human being would spend.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that section 25 of the Bill combined with section 65 of the 1953 Act will give the health boards adequate power to achieve what is envisaged by the Deputy's amendment We intend voluntary bodies to continue and to be aided by health grants from the various local authorities, supported equally be State grants.  In regard to sheltered employment where the person has to continue employment in a workshop under abnormal circumstances, as distinct from being in an outside factory, if help is required because the person cannot earn enough by his own industry, then there are powers to provide aid in that connection.</P>

    <P>I can assure the House that we intend to develop this kind of activity as fast as possible.

      <P>It seems to me that the combination of the sections to which the Minister referred would not enable <Col N="307" /> a health authority to give assistance to a voluntary organisation for the provision or acquisition of premises. Section 65 of the 1953 Act enables a health authority to provide premises for use by another body but sometimes the best assistance that can be given is to provide a contribution towards the cost of premises to be acquired by one of these other organisations.  It might sometimes slow up things if it was said &ldquo;the premises must be provided by us and the service cannot be provided until we provide the premises&rdquo;.  Perhaps, the Minister will have another look at this matter to ensure that a contribution could be given by way of cost rather than the actual provision of the premises, which might not meet all cases.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary.  The National Health Council, on which the medical profession is very strongly represented, must, by statute, be consulted in the making of regulations under the Health Act.  A requirement for consultation is of little use in a statute unless there is good will between the body affected and the consulting authority.  We have innumerable consultations with the medical profession.  If the members of the National Health Council felt that they themselves were not entirely adequate to deal with what they regarded as some very serious proposal in relation to the operation of this Bill they would very quickly get the associations particularly involved to ask to see the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 95b:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Regulations made by the Minister under this section shall make provision for the employment of medical officers in psychiatric services on a sessional basis and the designation as consultant psychiatrists of properly qualified medical officers engaged in such services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This contains two components.  The Minister is probably long enough in office&mdash;I realise he has been a short time in his present office&mdash;to know that in relation to the psychiatric service he is dealing with a very difficult problem.  It is not uniform in any way, in its qualities or defects.  He will probably have to apply himself to it with an enormous amount of dedication over the years during which he hopes to be in office.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister knows that the designation of consultant is really in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Mental Handicap, in their report at page 131, recommendation 190.  The whole pattern of the officers in the mental hospitals has changed.  The old days are gone when the medical superintendent was appointed primarily as a farmer, and, secondly, as a clinical psychiatrist.  We now have more emphasis on the clinical side, and less emphasis on the administrative side and certainly less emphasis on the ability of the medical superintendent to look after the farm. I doubt that the Minister will have any great objection to this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the psychiatric service there is, of course, much greater cross-fertilisation <Col N="312" /> clinically with the voluntary hospitals and the status and standing of the individuals in the voluntary hospitals, and the nomenclature of the individuals in the voluntary hospitals should be applied appropriately to the local authority hospitals.  I am not a great defender of the local authority health services. I have in many ways criticised the voluntary services.  I do not think anyone will deny&mdash;and I certainly will not deny&mdash;that the prestige of the voluntary services has been higher than in many aspects of the local authority services.  I should like to go on hurriedly and say that the quality of service provided in many parts of the local authority service, in the county hospitals, the regional hospitals, the clinics, and so on, is of the highest possible standard.  Wonderful work has been done also in relation to infectious diseases, and so on.  There is equally no doubt that the quality of service in the voluntary hospitals is particularly high.</P>
    <P>What we want to do is to take the best from the local authority service and the best from the voluntary hospital service and merge the two, and try in that way to get the best possible joint service for the community as a whole.  Working as they do side by side with the voluntary hospital service, I think it is only rational to accept that consultant status will be accepted for the psychiatric service run by the local authority as it already is accepted for the psychiatric service run by the voluntary hospitals.  As I say, it is also in line with the recommendation in the report of the Commission on Mental Handicap.  I think the Minister is sympathetically disposed towards many of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>There are other points which I will not raise at this stage.  It is possible that the Minister is already in agreement with me and, for that reason, there is no point in my introducing other supporting points in substantiation of this proposal.  I want to go back to the other component of this amendment, that is, the sessional basis.  May I make haste to say that, as an individual, I do not agree with the idea of the sessional basis.  I have always believed in the full-time medical officer.  I do not <Col N="313" /> believe in private practice or this kind of thing, but I am simply an individual in the service and I would not dream of trying to impose my own personal views on a group of individuals.</P>
    <P>I put it forward for this reason.  The Minister is finding it very very difficult, indeed, to staff the psychiatric hospitals. I think there are something like 140 vacancies, about 60 of those are occupied by temporary staff, and about 18 of those have the basic DPM qualification.  The Minister is finding it particularly hard to staff the peripheral hospitals, the hospitals out in the provinces, with high quality and good level personnel.  There are plenty of good level people in them but they are grossly overworked and are carrying an unfair burden.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which the Minister's predecessors got around this&mdash;and I include myself&mdash;was by allowing private practice.  As I have already said, I believe in the full-time concept but, as Minister for Health, I accepted the realistic situation that a generation of doctors had been put out by the medical schools who believed in this type of practice, whether on a sessional basis or private practice.  Therefore, it would have been absurd and futile to ignore that reality, and I accepted the principle of private beds and private practice in certain instances for the local authority doctor, in order to attract into the local authority service the quality of man I wanted for the community.  I knew he would not come in as a full-time salaried officer.  I knew he would come in&mdash;and many of them did come in and are giving excellent service in the local authority service&mdash;if they had either private beds or private practice.  As a by-product of this I got the service which I wanted for the community from high-level and high-quality practitioners, surgeons, physicians, anaesthetists and gynaecologists.</P>
    <P>I would put it to the Minister that of the two, sessional as opposed to private, there is a greater danger in giving permission for private practice in so far as you can give a basic salary to an officer and he can then carry on a private practice.  We have the old dichotomy of interests which we find in <Col N="314" /> general practice and, again&mdash;I made the case for this earlier and I do not want to repeat it&mdash;the need for a one-level service which can be established only by a fee for service, or direct payment, or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>Where there are two types, private patients and public patients, there are two qualities of service.  The better the doctor is the more likely he is to be drawn away by his private practice from his local authority practice.  It is very difficult to curb this.  There may be a genuine need for him.  He may be of a quality that is badly needed by the people who can afford to pay him. There is this division of interest which eventually will lead to the officer in the local authority service probably spending much too much time in his private practice and much too little time in his public practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor&mdash;and I think he is too&mdash;was inclined to accept the reality of this situation in his proposal on the fee for service principle in the new general medical service.  On the other hand, on the sessional basis the health authority know precisely what they are paying for.  The usual thing is to divide the week into 11/ 11ths and a person does 9/11ths or 3/11ths or whatever it may be.  It may be two sessions a day or two sessions a week or five or six sessions, whichever he chooses, but the health authority know what they are paying for.</P>
    <P>They know they are getting value for money because a person has to be there for a specific period and has to attend full-time at health authority work.  For that reason I think it is a safer device for the Minister if he is not going to have a full-time officer. If he must attract high quality personnel into the psychiatric service, it would be wise for him to move over more towards this idea of a sessional basis rather than a private practice basis also as there is this interchange between the voluntary private and the public local authority hospitals.  He already has accepted the principle of the sessional basis where he uses a private voluntary psychiatrist in the local authority service.  That is already in operation, so he is not creating a precedent; the precedents are already <Col N="315" /> there.  For that reason it is not in any way a great break away from what is already accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are certain occasions when a health authority may require limited service from specialists within the service. In this way they could avail not only of the private voluntary type doctor, specialist, or consultant whom it already uses, but also might make use of their own specialists or consultants by being able to employ them on a sessional basis.  I recommend this subsection to the Minister as an attempt to help him to deal with what I happen to know is going to be his greatest single problem, the upgrading of the psychiatric services.  In some areas they are extremely good.  In Dublin they are improving at a very rapid rate, and in areas down the country they are at an extremely high level.  However, there are other areas in which they are regarded as being fairly backward.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that this is a quick and a very good way out and, if I may say so, a way in which we can obtain the services of some of the best qualified people in this field to work for the benefit of the community.  I have found from my own personal experience that those who were employed on a public capitation basis and had also a private practice, gave no preference to the private patient over the public patient. I might go as far as to say from my short experience of working with consultants employed on a sessional basis in the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals that, if anything, they seem to give service to the public patients way above what they are giving their private patients.  I would fully support the employment of doctors on a sessional basis.</P>

      <P>That does not arise on this section at all.  We have already dealt with the possibility of local inquiries into the discharge of duties by servants of health boards.  Health boards no doubt will arrange for an inquiry into the employment of a psychiatrist who is a lunatic.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with everything that Deputy Dr. Browne has said.  As he probably knows, we have not used a brake on the recruitment of psychiatric staff; in fact we have not turned down any proposals for psychiatric staff for several years.  We gave encouragement to the recruitment of extra medical staff and agreed to many proposals for the improvement of the Dublin psychiatric service.  We also took the initiative in the encouragement of the establishment of a chair of psychiatry in Cork and Galway. We do not need the amendment to examine everything that has been recommended by Deputy Dr. Browne. I can assure him that under existing provisions we can examine the method of the employment of psychiatric staff and the description of their posts. There is a committee now sitting considering means of improving recruitment of psychiatric staff and it will almost certainly make recommendations in regard to the matters raised in the amendment.  The Medical Association and the Medical Union have also submitted a memorandum to us and to this committee and they make recommendations also on the lines that have been suggested in the Deputy's amendment.  I quite agree with him about some of the nomenclature of officers employed as psychiatrists. The Deputy will be interested to know that this memorandum will be discussed on 17th December, the memorandum which embraces proposals which relate to everything the Deputy has been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I absolutely agree with him about the psychiatric services being provided on a sessional basis by private psychiatrists when this fits in with the general plan.  When the regional hospital boards get going one of the main <Col N="317" /> objectives behind their activity will be trying to integrate the voluntary hospital services and the public health services to a far greater degree than ever before.  At the same time we do have to have regard to the fact that there are many full-time posts that ought to be filled.  We have given a grant for postgraduate teaching to psychiatrists.  All these matters will be discussed some time in January at a general meeting of all resident medical superintendents, officers of my Department and other persons at which all the recommendations of the mental illness report&mdash; which I am sure the Deputy agrees with me was an excellent one&mdash;will be examined to establish priorities, to see how the improvements in the recommendations of the report that have already been adopted are working, and in order to go over the whole of this problem which has become very urgent.  I agree with everything the Deputy says.  We still have to realise the importance of mental sickness.  I suppose it is true to say that, if you asked six people what they meant by sickness, five out of the six would still think only of physical sickness.  There is some change coming over that, but we shall have to do a great deal on the line suggested by the Deputy for the improvement of the psychiatric service. However, I am glad to say no amendment is required in this regard.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me to change the present position under which persons injured in road traffic accidents are entitled to avail themselves of the hospital services in the lower or middle income group without any liability to refund either the hospital or the doctor falling on the insurer.  The Deputy has mentioned it and other Deputies have drawn my attention to it.  We have found that the only way we can deal with this matter is to approach it rather differently from what was first of all suggested.  We <Col N="318" /> could include a section which would specifically allow health boards and doctors to recover charges from insurers in respect of eligible persons treated in road accidents.  I am told it would be very difficult to draft a positive provision which would not be open to evasion, particularly in cases where compensation was paid without admission of liability.  We are going to use the provisions set out in subsection (2) of section 69, which provides that:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may provide for any service under this Act being made available only to a particular class of the persons who have eligibility for that service.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this subsection is to allow for a deferment of the general application of the service and it is based on a corresponding section enacted in 1954.  I am advised that it can also be used to make a provision in the regulations which would exclude from eligibility to hospital services any person injured in a road traffic accident unless he could establish to the satisfaction of the chief executive officer of the health board that he had not received or would not receive damages or other compensation in the nature of damages from any person in respect of the injuries received.  I think the question of liability in the case of road accidents will be more satisfactory and flexible in this way. The person injured in a motor accident will be sent the bill for the hospital services and it should be quite easy for him to prove whether he can furnish evidence that he is insured and that the bill can be paid by the insurer.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement.  I have been pressing the Minister for some time to do this and I am sure he will forgive me if I express a few reservations and make a few suggestions with regard to the method.  Under the old Workmen's Compensation Act if a worker applied for compensation one of the queries on the form was: &ldquo;Is a civil injuries action contemplated?&rdquo;  and if that was the case it then required the worker to furnish the name and address of his solicitor.  The effect of that was that the Department could keep in contact with <Col N="319" /> the solicitor who was formulating the civil claim for compensation and in due course if compensation was made then his compensation was repaid.  While I agree that it is proper to present the bill, I think the health authority should, on such presentation, have a note of recommendation to the person affected to refer the bill to his solicitor if he was formally to claim for injuries and, if he was not formally making such a claim, to contact the health authority and explain the circumstances. I think it would be wrong to put the injured person in fear that they would have to meet the full bill.  An explanatory note would be in the nature of an encouragement to these people to present accounts to their solicitors in order that the matter could be included in the claim.</P>

      <P>This section aims at clearing up the legal problem with respect to the removal of bodies found in public places.  There has been confusion about the legal responsibility in this respect in the past.  Sometimes there was a long and undesirable delay in the removal of decomposed bodies to appropriate premises.  I do not want to go too far into these tragic circumstances, but this section puts it on the health board to clarify arrangements for removing such bodies to appropriate premises.  We do have to get the consent of the Minister for Justice because of the question of registering subsequent criminal or other legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>I think the difficulty stems from the fact that the body may be decomposed or in an objectionable condition, but much of the difficulty arises because of the objection to use ambulances.  It has been argued that ambulances are for the removal of live people and not dead people.  At one time it was obligatory on publicans to receive bodies.  One famous place was called &ldquo;The Morgue&rdquo; and another was called affectionately &ldquo;The Dead Man's&rdquo;.  These names still obtain.  I think that obligation was abolished by a liquor Act.</P>

    <P>(5) (a)  Section 31 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934 (which empowers a Justice of the District Court to issue a search warrant in certain cases), shall apply to the possession of a substance to which regulations under this section relate as if it were a drug, substance or product referred to in the said section 331 and the regulations were made under that Act.</P>
    <P>(b)  Section 32 of the said Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934 (which empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant in certain circumstances), shall apply to an offence under this section as if it were an offence under that Act.</P>
    <P>(6)  This section applies to any substance which may be used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of <Col N="322" /> any human ailment, infirmity, injury or defect, or for the modification of any human physiological function, and which, in the opinion of the Minister, produces or is capable of producing depressant, stimulant or hallucinogenic effects on the human central nervous system.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to enable the unauthorised possession of certain classes of drugs, which are liable to abuse and which do not come within the scope of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, to be made a punishable offence.  The Garda have made representations to us from time to time, as have Deputies, that the absence of such powers in relation to drugs such as the amphetamines and LSD has been hampering their efforts to deal with the problem of drug abuse.  The Government have already approved of the preparation of legislation to deal with this matter as part of the much wider measure in relation to the control of drugs and poisons generally the drafting of which is at present in hand and which I hope will be introduced into the House as early as possible next year.</P>
    <P>I thought we must do something about the drug abuse in the interim period and that some appropriate action should be taken as a matter of urgency with a view to containing the present problem of drug abuse.  So we decided to take the opportunity afforded by the present Health Bill to introduce this provision as an interim measure pending the preparation of the more comprehensive legislation to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, already, unauthorised possession of narcotic drugs, such as opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, hemp, cannabis and a number of synthetic narcotics, pethadine, methadone, <i>et cetera,</i> is an offence.  Other drugs which are liable to be abused in the same way as the narcotics and some of which may produce physical or psychological dependence are controlled only to the extent provided for in the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, which were made under the Health Acts.  The drugs covered by the regulations include the amphetamines, barbiturates and tranquillisers. <Col N="323" /> The controls prohibit the retail sale of these substances to the public by persons other than pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists, druggists and registered druggists and then only on the prescription of a doctor, dentist or veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>We are now about to introduce even more stringent controls over the availability of amphetamines following consultations which I have had with the medical and allied professions and other interests involved.  These additional controls will help to reduce still further the opportunities for obtaining supplies of these preparations for illicit use.  There must be a provision to enable us to make unauthorised possession a punishable offence.  This will enable the Garda to deal with persons who have such substances in their possession for intentional misuse irrespective of the source from which they were obtained.  The section will enable me to make regulations prohibiting the possession of specified substances of a kind to which the section applies except by persons or classes of persons in circumstances and under conditions specified in the regulations. The enforcement of these regulations will be a matter for the Garda Síochána but I should make it clear that the powers of the Garda will be the same as their existing powers under the Dangerous Drugs Act in connection with the prosecution of offences under this Act.</P>
    <P>In the wider measure we intend to introduce and recommend to the House procedural changes which may simplify the task of the Garda in dealing with any offences and the House will have an opportunity of examining these as soon as the Bill is introduced in the House.  This is yet another step in the number that we have to take to reduce the consumption of dangerous addictive drugs.  The doctors in the House will know, and others may know, that the amphetamines are in very large degree replaceable by other anti-depressant drugs which are not in the main addictive.  Therefore, our decision to control the use of amphetamines, which has been fully agreed to by a very representative group of the medical profession, does <Col N="324" /> not mean that people will be unable to get the beneficial effects of amphetamines in a different form and/or amphetamines if we can arrange for a licensing system which will enable people who need them for special reasons to get them.  I hope that I will have the full support of the House in making it illegal to possess these very dangerous drugs unless they have been procured and are being used in a proper way on the basis of a prescription and under regulations which we will provide.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, we certainly welcome the inclusion of this section in this measure.  It is very necessary, as the Minister has emphasised and it is only, of course, one small part of the steps which must be taken to deal with the terrible menace of drugs.</P>
      <P>We have one fear, however, that is, that anxious as the Minister is to have this power and to give the Garda the power, it may be some time before it is brought into operation.  Would I be correct in thinking that there is nothing to stop the Minister on the passing of this Bill to apply this long before many other sections which quite clearly cannot be applied until elaborate negotiations are completed and machinery is set up?  Once the Minister has made the regulations under this section there would appear to be no reason why the section should not be implemented rightaway.  Speed is important. This problem is growing in our community and any community that has had it&mdash;and we are one of the last to have it&mdash;found that it multiplied and ran ahead far in advance of legislation to control it.  We, therefore, should not delay in any way in any of the steps which are desirable for the control of this terrible problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, we will support this measure by the Minister to help him to deal with the problem of drug addiction.  He tells us that other measures are coming along which will be more comprehensive.  Quite honestly, I am sorry to have to tell him that while it is true, as he says, that amphetamines are replaceable as antidepressants, they are also replaceable <Col N="325" /> as addictive forms of drugs.  That is the sad truth, that he is going to stop people getting hold of these amphetamines and they will simply switch over to something else.  That is one of the patterns of drug-taking which is emerging in Dublin, Cork and Galway, there is such a diversity available.</P>
      <P>The Minister is more than welcome to the amendment and we will have further discussion, I presume, on this whole question of drug addiction later on but I wish he would be careful about choice of words in this problem. He should try to look on it as an illness. &ldquo;Punishable offence&rdquo;&mdash;this, of course, is something about which I have very definite views&mdash;the whole approach to criminality and criminology generally, the whole idea that somebody who does something wrong is a criminal and must be punished or that someone who has done something bad should be punished.  That is a view that I do not share.  The Minister could look at this type of thing as an illness or an emotional disturbance of a mild nature or a serious nature depending on the severity of the addiction and whether it is soft or hard drugs.</P>
      <P>The Minister should approach the problem in a more sympathetic way and he will get every help from us in doing whatever he can.  He must think of drug addiction from the point of view that it is very like smoking and drinking, which are quite acceptable social habits but which are founded essentially in some mild neurotic illness. The Minister will find that he will have to look at the drug addict with none of the anger and disapproval with which society generally tends to regard him.  The Minister will have to have a sympathetic understanding of and a compassion for the drug addict. Drug addicts are very unhappy people. Addiction is due to emotional illness and we must do all we can from a medical and psychiatric point of view to help these hapless addicts.  We must remove the causes which create this kind of psychological disturbance in young people.  That is our biggest problem really because it arises out of the structure and mores of our society which produces youngsters who can only cope with their emotional problems by indulging in some kind of drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> On the whole, the press has dealt very sympathetically with these drug addicts.  Our communications media in general have dealt with drug addiction in a compassionate way and the result is there is not now so much antagonism. Indeed, there is a good deal of sympathy for these people amongst a significant number of influential people.  I have had some dealings with the Garda and I have found them wonderfully understanding in their approach to and their handling of this problem.  It is a growing problem and, like some of us on the medical side, they are at a loss to know quite what to do.  The problem is a serious one and we are at a loss to know how to deal with it because we are dealing with a product created long before we came on the scene at all; I refer to the behaviour pattern that develops as a result of different factors&mdash;alcoholism, broken homes, an institutionalised existence, and so on.  These are things over which we have no control, but it is very important that we should have a full understanding of them because the youngsters have no control over them either.  They are the innocent victims of a set of circumstances which turn them into drug addicts in order to satisfy their particular emotional needs. I am frequently fascinated by my psychiatric colleagues who lecture these youngsters&mdash;we have different views naturally&mdash;about the evils of the habit while they themselves are happily smoking.  The Minister, I think, smokes a pipe.  Most of us take a drink.  We should at all times try not to let the punitive element enter into our legislation. There should always be understanding and pity.  There should, as I said earlier, be compassion for these unfortunate youngsters who are really very, very unhappy.  It is not as if they even get enjoyment out of drugs.</P>
    <P>A special unit has now been established and I hope it will do very good work not alone in treating the young people but also in the fields of research and education in order to find out the best way to help these people. No one knows the solution or the answer to this problem&mdash;we are all agreed on that&mdash;particularly from the point of view of the hard drugs.  It will have to be dealt with as a special problem <Col N="327" /> unique to our society; we shall have to find its origins and deal with it as best we can.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to decide on the proper approach.  Will it be hospitalisation or imprisonment?  No doubt he knows something about the British approach.  It is rather permissive.  The United States approach, on the other hand, is prohibitive.  It is authoritarian. The danger in the American approach is that it drives the drug traffic underground because of the punitive measures adopted to curb it.  In Britain they at least know the size of the problem and they deal with it in a more humane way and keep it within bounds.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be very, very careful in this legislation.  I do not think it will make a great deal of difference really because the youngsters will simply switch to something else. When, however, he introduces his more comprehensive legislation I hope he will bear in mind the fact that these youngsters must be treated as sick people.  It will be quite useless punishing them.  Punishment, or the threat of it, will only drive them away and no one will ever get near them to help them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on the action he proposes to take.  I also welcome the fact that this is but the forerunner of further legislation.  We have all become aware of the problem of drug addiction.  It is not peculiar to this country, but there is a tendency to brush it aside and pretend it does not <Col N="328" /> really exist.  The drug traffic is a worldwide racket.  There is a great deal of money behind it and a great many people are making fortunes out of it. The way in which these drugs are imported is usually through sailors.  The Minister should do his utmost to find out how these drugs get into the country so that they can be stopped at source.</P>
      <P>In this, the Minister is endeavouring to control certain drugs in an effort to control the very serious drug taking that exists.  The major step would be to try to cut off supply.  Other countries were not, perhaps, alert to the situation and suddenly found themselves with an enormous problem.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Dr. Browne's plea for a sympathetic approach to addicts. Anyone who takes drugs is to be pitied. The people I am anxious to get at are those who create the problem in the first instance.  It is true, I think, that drug addiction is a malady of seaport towns and cities.  We have it in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  In the not too distant future, unless the traffic is checked, it will become a problem of the hinterland too.  In fact, it has already extended into the hinterland and that development has not just occurred in the last year or two.  I hope the Minister will introduce the necessary legislation as soon as possible and I hope that legislation will deal most effectively with those responsible for this illicit and infamous traffic.</P>
