      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted now by most Deputies and people who have been concerned with the social questions of this country that there has been, and is, a very real need for reform in relation to health services in order to widen their scope and to extend their application.  I do not think any Member, even of the Government Party, would disagree with that view.  It has won general acceptance by the people, particularly over the last decade.  It is, therefore, worthy of comment at this stage in this Dáil, when we are in the shadow of a dissolution, that in relation to this question of the reform of our health services the people have been expecting much and needing a great deal and have been given nothing but continuous stonewalling by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  I will not go back to the naughty days of Deputy Seán MacEntee, that dyed-in-the-wool Conservative who believed in giving nothing to anyone and who was perfectly satisfied with the poor law mentality of the outmoded dispensary system.  Just take the last few years and the change of Fianna Fáil Ministers in 1965.  The health trumpet was then sounded.  There was to be a sweep of the Augean stables and there was to be a new look at health&mdash;all this, of course, in the aftermath of the discredited select committee established under the aegis of Deputy MacEntee, that was designed to talk and do nothing and which committed health into the limbo of forgotten things&mdash;but now with a new Fianna Fáil Minister for Health there were to be more promises and there was to be a situation in which a change was just around the corner.  Then we had the White Paper on Health Services published in 1966, a document which was a compound&mdash;it might have well prompted the song &ldquo;Lily the Pink&rdquo;&mdash;of various notions put together and called a policy.  It was, of course, patching up the cracks in the Health Act policy designed to give a little bit of improvement here and there but maintaining the old Fianna Fáil policy of extending grudgingly the dispensary approach to medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper of 1966, we were told, was published so that it could be <Col N="983" /> considered by Deputies and that Deputies, if you please, could read it, study it and then after two or three months' deliberation contribute wisely to the debate on the new health legislation to be introduced in the month of November of the year 1966.  However, the legislation did not come in November and it is my belief that there was little intention that it should come.  There was a change of Government and a change of Taoiseach around that time, so we had no Health Bill in 1966.</P>
    <P>There was no Health Bill, either, in 1967.  Again, the matter was under consideration, active or otherwise, and, meanwhile, the White Paper was there as if the White Paper was going to tackle the difficulties and assuage the anxieties of people who wanted to see a change in our health legislation.  We went through 1967 and at the time of the local elections in that year we were told that the Government had just not been able to get around to introducing the Bill but we were promised that it was coming in the autumn of 1967.  By then, of course, the people would have voted in the elections.  Again, the Bill did not come.  The autumn of 1967 lengthened into the winter of that year and in the concluding session of the Dáil before the recess at the end of 1967, the matter was raised and we were told that we would have it in the spring.  The Health Bill, they said, was bound to come in the spring of 1968 but in the spring of 1968 there was still no sign of the Bill and so the spring of 1968 went into the summer and, again, in the autumn of 1968 we were promised that the Bill would come in November but it did not come last November.</P>
    <P>When the fiftieth anniversary of the First Dáil was commemorated in the historic building of the Mansion House, the First Reading of a Health Bill was introduced by the Minister for Health&mdash;significant, I wonder, or was this a charade being played on the people of this country?  The Bill was introduced and the Second Reading was ordered for the next week when we would reassemble here to resume the work of this Dáil.  What has happened to that Bill?  Where has it gone? <Col N="984" /> Is this more of the situation in which the health and the needs of the people are being made a political football by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>There will be no Health Bill; there will be no improvement of our health services as long as the present Government remain in office.  They have been playing tricks and introducing gimmicks in order to deceive the ordinary poor people of this country.  The Health Bill will be talked about but the attitude will remain &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;; there was jam yesterday but never jam today.  The new health proposals of the Minister do not exist and are not intended to be implemented. They are talked about now just because this Dáil remains in session this week and may or may not resume but certainly no major legislation will be passed through this House before the dissolution.</P>
    <P>I wish to make my protest in this House from these benches while I am still here because I have no doubt that after the dissolution it will be the responsibility of my colleagues in Fine Gael to bring about this much-needed reform.  This attitude on the part of the Government is bad, wrong and discreditable.  It would not be too bad if it were not for the fact that the refusal by the Government to act is a political refusal&mdash;the action of small men afraid to admit that the Opposition in this case is perfectly right.</P>
    <P>I have in my hand a memorandum prepared by me for presentation to the Select Committee on the Health Services.  It is a memorandum that runs over ten pages.  It relates to general medical services and, on behalf of my Party, was submitted by me to the Select Committee some four or five years ago and circulated to its members. It had an effect similar to the effect of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima because it blew the Select Committee in smithereens.  They disappeared back to their respective posts. Back to the Custom House went Deputy Seán MacEntee surrounded by his various cohorts and advisers and for weeks afterwards they studied this document inside out.  They studied it from different angles and the result was that the Select Committee never met again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> Were I to put the details of that document on the record of Dáil Éireann, it would weary the House although I feel sorely tempted to do so.  I wish to bring some of it to the notice of the House.  On page 2 of that document the case was made that, apart from Finland, Ireland is the only country in western Europe which, at the moment&mdash;this was four years ago&mdash;under its health services made no provision for the general body of wage-earners and persons of limited means in relation to the expenses of general practitioner medical care and of necessary drugs and medicines and medical applicances&mdash;the only country, apart from Finland, that made no provision for the general body of its wage-earners in relation to these essential services&mdash;and this was only talking about general medical services.</P>
    <P>The document went on to point out:</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that in Ireland a general medical service with free drugs, medicines and appliances is provided under the dispensary system for poor people but this does not apply to the vast majority of persons who, on any reasonable assessment, must be regarded as having limited means.</P>
    <P>It appears from an account of <i>Health Services in Western Europe</i> that in most continental countries comprehensive and compulsory health insurance schemes are in operation applying to the vast bulk of the population and provide, <i>inter alia,</i> almost complete cover in respect of medical fees and the costs of drugs and medicines. This is important:</P>
    <P>Details relating to the countries covered by the account show that in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>May I say, in parenthesis, that when we say &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; we mean and cover in relation to the people that part of our country at present comprised in Northern Ireland. The account shows that, in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;100 per cent of the population is covered; in Austria, France and Germany 9/10ths of the population is covered; in The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Spain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" />&mdash;Spain&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;4/5ths of the population is covered; in Belgium, three-quarters; and in Luxembourg, Portugal and Italy, the majority of the population is so covered.  It appears that all of these countries&mdash;mainly by means of compulsory insurance&mdash;have recognised that there is a social need to help the individual not only in relation to hospital treatment but also in relation to medical care at general practitioner level and with regard to drugs and medicines.  In addition, it is known that both in New Zealand and Australia the State has accepted the same obligation and is providing a general medical service available to the bulk of the population.</P>
    <P>The document also directed the attention of the Government and the Select Committee to a report&mdash;then fairly recently available&mdash;of a commission established in England under the chairmanship of Sir Arthur Porritt who examined the workings of the British health services.  That committee published in brief its findings.  Having reviewed the working of the British health services, it said:</P>
    <P>We therefore had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that, basically, the concept of a comprehensive national health service is sound.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out in this document and as I wish to put on the record of this House, for this country&mdash;or for this part of our country for which at present we are responsible&mdash;these developments in so many other countries must pose for us the question whether we are doing enough for our citizens if we single out only the established poor and provide only for them a general medical service.  To continue to provide in this manner is to decide to stay out of the mainstream of social welfare developments all over Europe, if not over the entire world.  It is to decide merely to do what the Imperial Government and Parliament in the last century decided to do for the poor, sick, faminestricken Irish&mdash;merely to provide for the established poor; never to accept the obligation of the community to <Col N="987" /> provide for the general body of wage earners and people in a comprehensive way.  If we continue that approach, which, I regret to say, is the circumscribed, rather stunted Fianna Fáil approach as enshrined in the Health Act, if we decide to stay with that, then we are staying out of the mainstream of developments throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We made a token application&mdash;I presume we are still concerned with it&mdash;to enter into the new Europe under the Treaty of Rome.  If we go into that Europe, if we ever get in, with our present health services then we shall go in as a limping poor relation.  So long as we continue this approach&mdash; even at home, domestically&mdash;how can we ever be serious about our policy to re-unite our people?  How could we ever approach a situation in which we are seriously inviting our fellow-Irishmen and Irishwomen in the North to join with us in a United Ireland if we do not accept as a State the same obligation as is accepted in Northern Ireland in relation to the provision of a comprehensive health service for the people?</P>
    <P>This document having, in that sense that I have indicated, made the case for a change of policy, it then dealt with the existing policies.  At paragraph 11, on page 4, we read:</P>
    <P>With regard to the existing General Medical Service as available to 30 per cent of the population, I have on many occasions stated my grounds of criticism.</P>
    <P>The criticisms, which were repeated there, referred to the fact that the dispensary system, which is the present general medical service system, involved means testing, involved the issue of medical cards and all the administrative paraphernalia that, in fact, had been and still are evoking considerable criticism throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have to refer to what is in the document and, since it was submitted by me, it appears as if it is emanating from me but I want to make it quite clear that I am not the author and that it emanates from the Fine Gael Party.  In paragraph 12 (a) we read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> In my view with regard to General Medical Service, all limits, categories and restrictions should be reduced to a minimum.  The aim should be to provide a comprehensive health service which will give General Practitioner medical care, with of course the ancillary services, to almost the entire population.</P>
    <P>It goes on then to indicate the kind of cover that should be provided and it contains this statement:</P>
    <P>The present Health Act was designed to give some form of medical help or service to roughly 2.4 million people, or some 85 per cent of the population.  I think this proportion of the population should be taken as comprising those who have limited means and who require the benefit of a publicly organised comprehensive health service.  I would envisage that people in the remaining 15 per cent of the population would be free to become participants in the service on a voluntary basis but on terms which would involve no cost to the tax-payer.  This large proportion of the population would fall into the following categories, but are so divided merely for convenience and to enable some of the suggestions which I made to be clearly understood:</P>
    <P>(1) Old Age Pensioners, Widow and Orphan Pensioners, Home Assistance Recipients and others in receipt of Assistance, Unemployed, Sick and Injured workmen, landholders solely dependent on their holdings where the valuation does not exceed £15.</P>
    <P>(2) Persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>(3)  Farmers up to £50 Valuation.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>And the fourth category relates to selfemployed people.  The service which was suggested in this document provides for the free choice of doctor, for the ancillary services, for drugs and medicines and medical appliances at a subsidised cost.  The financing of it envisaged a weekly contribution which would range from 1/9d. per week to 2/- per week and which would be graduated in relation to the different categories.  It would carry under the <Col N="989" /> insurance fund, without charge, all the people in the first category, that is, all people in receipt of any form of assistance or pension, sick and injured workmen and so on.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme at that time is fully worked out in the document. I do not say that it represents or could represent the cost now and there would have to be adjustments and changes. The document concluded with this statement:</P>
    <P>I believe that the adoption of such a Scheme will remove the dissension and controversy which has been associated with Health Services over a number of years.  It will in addition ensure that proper and uniform standards can be attained without undue hardship to contributors, and without a strain on local Rates. In this regard it is important to refer to the fact that many of the existing present-day health services will no longer be financed partly out of Rates and will be a charge on the Insurance Fund.  This will result in a not insignificant reduction in the level of local Rates.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have not attempted to give the full details of this document but I want to say that this document was presented to the Select Committee and has been available to the Government since.  It contains a workable proposal for the reorganisation of health services, which is financially possible, which is within the resources of our people, which will remove the cost of personal health services entirely from local rates and which will permit an expansion of these services to more people, with higher standards.  It is a proposal which is already in operation in one form or another in every country in western Europe except Finland, and which is already partly in operation in Ireland.  In these circumstances I ask why has nothing been done to introduce a scheme of this kind in the last five years?  I suggest that the reason is quite clear, that Fianna Fáil did not want to admit that Fine Gael were right.  If you procrastinate long enough, if you prevaricate sufficiently, some day somehow things will come to a climax and now at this moment the dilatory <Col N="990" /> approach of Fianna Fáil to health, their political stonewalling over the years, their refusal to change course or accept advice, are all resulting in the reaping of the whirlwind.  The patience of the people has been finally exhausted and in every part of Ireland today people are pointing to the size rates have attained and the cost of health services.  People will no longer tolerate a situation in which they are told &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass.  Go home, let us strike the rate and we will do something in the coming year.&rdquo;  They have heard that far too often and this time they are seeking to prevent the rate being struck in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I have the most profound sympathy for the afflicted ratepayers.  I can appreciate the sense of injustice they feel and the sense of neglect that must concern them.  The rating system as a system of taxation is inequitable and unjust. It applies to people living in similar houses, one beside the other, one of whom may be a married man with seven or eight children and who may have had considerable hardships and difficulties and perhaps a limited income, while his neighbour may be a single man with a large personal income, but nevertheless under this system of local taxation each head of the house pays the same amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the question of rates would be a matter for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am merely indicating that once we use a system as inequitable as that in order to finance partially our health services then obviously we will provoke the sense of grievance which any unjust system of taxation will arouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, therefore, put forward the policy we have advocated consistently: personal health services should be removed from the rates.  In that way a significant reduction will be obtained. Other things also should be done.  We believe that it is inappropriate to use the poor rate as a source of financing the cost of maintaining and running our general hospitals throughout the country.  At the moment, the cost of <Col N="991" /> running and maintaining the TB and general hospitals in each health authority area is financed as part of the health services.  In other words, it is partly financed through rates and partly through central taxation.  In our view this is a wrong approach.  We believe all general hospitals throughout the country should be run and financed at the cost of the Exchequer.  There is no reason why it should not be so.  An Irish citizen living in Dublin, as a member of our community, has an equal and joint interest in the running of a hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon or Manorhamilton&mdash;why should he not?  It is an Irish hospital; Irish citizens are being treated there and it is quite wrong to have an approach to the running of what are national hospitals on the basis that they are the particular responsibility of particular citizens living in a particular rating area.  This is not the correct approach. The cost of all general hospitals should be the responsibility of the Exchequer. That will mean increasing taxation but at least general taxation will remove the inequalities of particular taxpayers. It will envisage a taxpayer's circumstances, his dependants, his losses, income and so on.  General taxation will mean that there will be more equity.  I do not suggest it will be perfect; it cannot, but it will bring a degree of equity in regard to financing necessary services of this kind.</P>
    <P>Nobody would suggest that An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil or any part of the Defence Forces that happened to be stationed in a particular place should be financed by the ratepayers, the local people.  That would be daft because our Defence Forces are the nation's responsibility and the cost is provided by the nation and paid for by the people generally through taxation.  Why should it be different in regard to our health services?  Are the Defence Forces to be one thing and a national charge, but our health services, where the very future and welfare of every person in the community is directly involved, another?  It is absurd to carry on in this old-hat way merely because this was what the good Victorians did, using the poor law rate&mdash; abusing it really because this rate was <Col N="992" /> envisaged originally to provide for the poor in particular areas and it gave the rich dowagers and corpulent lords and dukes a comfortable feeling when they went back to their well-appointed houses to know that the poor were being well looked after by the poor rate that was being raised by them. That poor rate was abused over the years.  More was added to it.  It was made to pay for roads, services, for the health of the people, for the cost of running institutions and the different asylums they had.  It came to be used for all these things and the poor law rate ceased to be a means of providing merely for the shelterless, unharboured paupers in a particular area and became a system of raising finance in ease of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>We have reached the limit.  In the course of the abusing of the poor law rate many unfortunate people have been hurt and we should not continue this injustice.  The Fine Gael Party's view is quite clear.  We should endeavour to get back to a just approach in financing our health services.  We should try to remove them from the exigencies of local rates in particular areas and get them away from the yearly ache represented in the striking of the rate each year.  We should try to make them uniform in application by providing for personal health services on an insurance basis and we should make the cost of our institutions and hospitals a national charge.  If we proceed to approach this problem on that basis we can make real progress. Of course, it will not be done by this Government.  It will not be done this side of a general election.</P>

      <P>Tóg bog é. Fan go bhfheicir.  We are committed to this reform in health legislation and we will bring it about.  It cannot be brought about without a dissolution now.  It is <Col N="993" /> regrettable that is so and regrettable that there have been so many wasted years, years in which fruitful change could have been brought about, in which reform could have become a fact; years in which there could have been an orderly expansion of our health service, wasted years, years in which there has been a bit of patching here, a bit of oiling there, removing of aches here, there and elsewhere, grudgingly conceding some help for the rates in this county or that, unimaginative efforts to patch and repair a machine that was not working well.  That is what we have had.  This is the dynamism we have had from what was once described as the youngest cabinet in Europe.</P>
      <P>Let us get away from that.  A visitor of great standing, when he spoke here, recalled that it was once said in Leinster House that there were rarely new ideas.  That was President John Kennedy recalling the view expressed, I think, by the Duke of Leinster referring to this House shortly after it had been built.  I do not know whether that is accurate now but there are no new ideas in the Fianna Fáil Party regarding this matter of health, no new ideas, no new policy, no possibility of reform.  It is not the Minister's fault. He is the fall guy in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a free country.  I am going to say that whether the Minister likes it or not. The Minister is the fall guy in this matter.  He is not allowed to do anything in relation to changing it.  The money was not there last year and the money is not there this year.  He is a fall guy.  Of course he knows very well, because Deputy Seán Flanagan is a man of intelligence and a man of <Col N="994" /> courage, what should be done but he is in handcuffs.  He will have to sit and listen to what I have to say, breathe deeply, get angry but there is nothing he can do, sweet fanny adams.  The Minister for Finance will not allow a change because it would be too costly.  When Deputy Seán Flanagan became Minister for Health after the White Paper was published he found all the money was going to education and he could do nothing except keep on saying: &ldquo;Well, next autumn or the following spring&mdash; some day&mdash;you will see something being done&rdquo;.  Now when the whirlwind is blowing he can do nothing whatsoever.  He is a fall guy.  He has to bear the brunt of the angry ratepayers, of ordinary people who have been neglected not by him but by those who went ahead of him.  It is a pity because the Minister is a person for whom I have a real affection.  I am sorry to see him in that position.  I am sorry to see him put in a position in which he has to bear the brunt and pay the penalty for the sins of others. So it is with the fall guys in this world. All I can say is there is a change coming and perhaps in the next Dáil the Minister from those benches can make sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not suffer from inflation.  Other august people do and they get deflated. Unfortunately when you stand on the ground you do not just blow up.  I have always kept my feet on the ground.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to end on this note: I said the Minister is a person for whom I have a high regard.  I should like to say in relation to this yearly review of the administration of the health services under the chairmanship of the Minister that every Deputy, and I can say this quite genuinely from my knowledge of my Party, has found in the Minister a person of courtesy and understanding and indeed real sympathy in relation to any of the matters that have been brought to his notice. I think that is in keeping with the high standard that has always been exercised and shown by the Department of Health and its officers.  I, personally, would like to say in relation to one matter which I brought to the Minister's attention that I received the greatest courtesy and sympathy, which are always acceptable, but, more important, the complaint was remedied very rapidly and remedied in a way which was both just and appropriate. <Col N="996" /> I would like to say that very genuinely to the Minister and in that respect to congratulate him on the manner in which he runs his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to speak at length on this Estimate but I would like to mention a few matters of local interest which come under the Department of Health.  I would like to refer to the cost of health services on the ratepayers of Galway.  At present we pay something over £5&mdash;£5 Is or £5 2s&mdash;on the rates and £2 of this is attributed to the health services.  It is an enormous cost on the ratepayers of the county. When we asked our county manager to contact the Department of Health to ask the amount of the health grant which we would receive this year we failed to receive any acknowledgment of the receipt of the representations by the county manager in this regard.  It was only by telephone on the morning on which we were striking the rates that we received a guarantee from the Department that the health grant would not be any less this year than it was last year.  This is poor consolation.  I would like to tell the Minister that £2 is put on the rates in Galway for the health services.  The health services should be financed on some other basis because it is almost impossible for our people to meet the rate demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to refer to dispensary doctors.  In County Galway when a post becomes vacant a doctor is appointed on a temporary basis.  I have put down many questions in this House regarding dispensary doctors in East Galway.  If the doctor resides in any part of the area, it is OK but I would ask the Minister if he would consider asking doctors to reside in the part of the area where the greatest population is.  In Dunmore we always had a dispensary doctor residing there but that is no longer the case as the present dispensary doctor resides in Milltown in the far corner of the area. It is a very big dispensary area and people on our side of the parish are not altogether satisfied that the dispensary doctor is fulfilling her duty.  In fact, nobody could find fault with the doctor in question in any way in the world but the location she is in geographically <Col N="997" /> in relation to the dispensary area makes it almost impossible for her to serve the needs of the community from Milltown.  I would ask the Minister to make a recommendation that dispensary doctors should live in the centre of their areas or where the greatest number of people live.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that there is no security in the position of temporary dispensary doctor.  If a doctor is temporary in one area his service in that area does not count when he goes to another area.  The salary of a temporary dispensary doctor at the moment is £1,200 and in a county like Galway where 46 per cent of the people are holders of medical cards, in those circumstances it is very difficult to get doctors to stay in the area. It is a very big problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the care of physically and mentally handicapped children.  There is a voluntary group in County Galway who have collected approximately £10,000.  This money is lying idle due to the fact that they are not receiving help from any other source.  In fact, they have set up a school in Galway City to cater for mildly and moderately physically handicapped children.  The Department is not contributing its share.  At the moment I doubt if it is contributing anything to that school.  I would like the Minister to look into that.  There was a meeting recently in Galway to which the local politicians and private individuals interested in these children were invited with a view to doing something about this problem.  There are acres of ground available at the Galway Regional Hospital where a building could be erected for those children.  We should provide the necessary facilities for them because there will be more of them born today and tomorrow.  In the past if people had a child like this they hid it away.  Today, due to education, they try to help the child.  The facilities available to educate these children are almost nil. I have met many of the parents of these children and they are deeply distressed because there are no facilities available to educate these children and prepare them for some walk of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> Many Deputies have suggested that health charges should be removed from the local rates.  My opinion is that this would be taking your hand out of one pocket and putting it into the other. Whether health charges are on the local rates or on a national basis does not make much difference.  Health services should be based on the scheme proposed by the Fine Gael Party.  Voluntary health insurance works very well indeed.  Health services should be paid for on a contributory basis by those who can pay.  Today people are demanding more and better services all the time.  In many aspects the service that exists is top class but people are inclined to abuse a lot of things they have.  The system we have at the moment is the kernel of the problem and we should change to the system advocated by our Party, that is to put health services on a contributory basis. That would be better for the country in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to be associated with the remarks of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in relation to the Minister and his Department.  I, too, have always found the Minister most courteous in every way.  I would ask him to take note of the problems I have mentioned.  They are very important and were not introduced for any political motive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great drawbacks in the Department of Health is that in this Department, as in many other Departments, the Government have been for many years content to play politics.  About four years ago the then Minister for Health announced with trumpet calls that he was preparing a new charter for health.  Great things were to be done; everybody was to be happy; people were to have better services; medical practitioners were to have better times; nurses were to have the time of their lives.  This was announced and after plenty of ballyhoo the then Minister decided to issue a White Paper.  The White Paper was duly issued and people on this side of the House who asked when the Minister intended to introduce his scheme were told that they were being cynical as usual, that Fine Gael would see that this was no empty promise and that when the new <Col N="999" /> Health Bill would be brought in it would be the cure for all ills and Fine Gael would never again be able to raise the matter here.</P>
      <P>The White Paper, if it is only taken out for an occasional airing or to see that the months are not eating it away, must now be getting a bit stale because it is three years since it was introduced and nothing has happened since.  I earnestly hope that the Minister, who seems to be quite a rational and reasonable man, will do what he can to press forward with the new Health Bill.  We cannot hope for its introduction in the lifetime of this Dáil, and we do not know who will be here when the new Dáil assembles.  However, please God, they in their time will see this Health Bill introduced.</P>
      <P>In the Third Programme recently issued by Fianna Fáil they refer, at page 197, to one of the achievements in the field of health, that is, the reduction in the number of deaths from TB.  This is something to be welcomed by everybody, but it is something for which Fianna Fáil should be slow to claim credit.  Everybody knows the war on TB was started by the first inter-Party Government, and that Fianna Fáil directly or indirectly impeded the efforts of the then Minister and the then Government to press ahead with the scheme.  If there were nothing to the credit of the first inter-Party Government except that by their initiative and courage, they were successful in the eradication of TB, then that would fully have justified the existence of that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Third Programme makes scant reference to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Of course, even Fianna Fáil could not have the audacity to claim credit for the setting up of that board.  Everybody knows that it is a lasting monument to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Tom O'Higgins.  The only way to provide proper health facilities is to accept the Fine Gael recommendation of a contributory scheme.  This scheme, when originally thought up and announced by Fine Gael, was derided and rejected out of hand before it was even examined by the Fianna Fáil Party. Anybody who has taken the trouble <Col N="1000" /> to listen to different pronouncements over the years will realise that Fianna Fáil are gradually coming over to this idea of an insurance scheme and do not regard it as the evil thing they considered it to be when Fine Gael first mooted it.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to stress the burden which the health services are placing on the rates.  The Minister was annoyed last night when Deputy P.A. O'Donnell reminded him that on the introduction of this health scheme the then Minister told this House it would not cost more than 2/- in the £.  At the moment the figure is nearer to £2 in the £.  In Dublin it is over 33/-.  I am sure the Minister is very well aware of what happened last Monday night when the Dublin City Council met to strike the rate and that he is also aware of what is happening in Dún Laoghaire and in several other councils.</P>
    <P>The people feel that there is no need to make the health services a full charge on the rates and that something will have to be done if they are expected to bear the burden of the rates. Even the 33/- in the £ in Dublin does not allow fully for the cost of the health services.  The Minister stated in his speech here that he was providing more than 50 per cent of the cost of the health services, and I should like to quote what he said at column 284, volume 239, of the Official Report of 12th March, 1969:</P>
    <P>In reply to this criticism I would point out that the percentage extra assistance given to the rates over the statutory 50/50 division of cost varies from four per cent to eight per cent for individual health authorities, averaging roughly six per cent over the whole country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that this is true in the case of Dublin Health Authority.  I do not know the position with regard to other health authorities, but Dublin Health Authority provide services which should be, and really are, under the heading of health and for which they receive no aid.  They provide supplements for disabled persons and allowances to social welfare recipients who are in need because their social welfare payments are being held up.  It is also well known that old age <Col N="1001" /> pensioners in Dublin are provided with turf, but in very many cases they are unable to collect it and Dublin Health Authority contribute money for the delivery of this turf to these people. When all services are taken into account I think it is true to say that Dublin Health Authority do not get the full 50 per cent, not to mention 55 or 56 per cent, as the Minister says.</P>
    <P>Again, if I may quote from column 290 of the same volume of the Official Report, we see that there are certain things which the Minister is now thinking of introducing under the heading of the health services which were not heretofore introduced:</P>
    <P>I have recently introduced a new scheme which is designed to give a fillip to the development of community social services in general and specifically to increase substantially the financial assistance given by health authorities to voluntary bodies which care for the aged in the community. I have encouraged and authorised health authorities to give grants within a total of £50,000 in the current year and £75,000 next year towards the running costs of voluntary bodies providing community services for the care of the aged.</P>
    <P>These are services for which the Dublin Health Authority have long been paying and for which they have received no grant from the Department of Health.  Again, at column 291 of the same volume, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>...they&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>meaning the health authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;will be free to support social services which in a narrow context might not be considered as health services but which do, in fact, make direct and real contribution to the health and well-being of the old people.  This scheme, taken as a whole, gives to the local health authorities the capability, the responsibility, and the scope for initiative in developing community services for its aged.</P>
    <P>Everybody will welcome this new scheme of the Minister's.  It is true to say that this has not existed heretofore.</P>
    <P>About three or four years ago&mdash; I think it was in 1965&mdash;the Minister <Col N="1002" /> for Health at the time announced that there would be no further increase for health charges on the rates.  Everybody was delighted.  Everybody thought that at no time in the future would there be an increase for health charges on the rates whereas the Minister said later that he meant only in that particular year.  Now, if the members of Fine Gael misunderstood the Minister's announcement, there is no blame due to them because the Fianna Fáil members of Dublin Corporation were of exactly the same opinion.  I remember quite well the Fianna Fáil members in Dublin Corporation asking: &ldquo;What will Fine Gael have to say now, next year, or the year after, if the rates go up?  They will not be able to blame the health charges&rdquo;.  They indicated that the Minister had taken away all the ammunition and left Fine Gael with nothing for which to blame the Government if the rates increased; they were deprived forever of throwing out this scare of the Health Act being responsible for the increase in the rates. Fianna Fáil members were of the same belief as everyone else and it is no shame to Fine Gael members that they misunderstood, remembering that the members of the Minister's own group also completely misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked local authorities to make reductions in the health estimates.  He emphasised here that he wants a reduction in the estimates but he wants no reduction in the services. If he does not want a reduction in the services how does he propose that local authorities can effect a reduction in the estimates?  The only way that I can see is by doing what the Minister has asked&mdash;reducing the estimates without reducing the services.  If they do that then it is obvious they were not up to this giving real value for money.  Fianna Fáil speakers have stressed that, if one wants better services, then one should not later come in here and crib when asked to pay for these better services.  They say you cannot have a service unless you pay for it.  But now the Minister is asking us to reduce the estimates but not to reduce the services.  Surely, if this can be done, it is a reflection on what has been happening up to this and it is an indication that the services have not <Col N="1003" /> been administered as economically as they could have been and should have been.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints from several Deputies about school medical services breaking down or being practically non-existent.  Quite a number of people in Dublin are under the impression that if a child is examined and there is no cause for complaint but the child some months later is found to be suffering from some illness he or she will not be eligible to be treated under the school medical services.  I have been informed by the principal of one of our leading schools that this is not exactly true.  The child may be treated under the school medical services if he or she gets a note from the principal.  Apparently this is something of which a large number of parents are not aware.  The Minister and his Department should take steps to make it clear to parents that they may avail of these services.  Very few parents go to the trouble of consulting with the principal of the school.  Possibly in some cases the principal does not make it clear either.  This is something the Minister and his Department could well clarify for the benefit of parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points on which I should like to make some comment.  First of all, I want to express my disappointment at the delay in introducing the new Health Bill, which is urgently needed and which has been promised for so long.  There is a general desire all over the country to see an end to the present antiquated, inequitable and totally unsatisfactory health system we have at the moment.  The situation has now reached the explosive stage because of the additional burden on the ratepayers.  So far as my constituency is concerned&mdash;the Minister is aware of this&mdash;the problem of financing the health services is becoming very serious and the Minister is receiving a deputation tomorrow from the Limerick Health Authority to discuss the whole question of the financing of the health services there.  The burden of rates has become so intolerable that we have now reached the stage <Col N="1004" /> at which something drastic will have to be done.  I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to see his way to giving a supplementary grant which will go some way towards relieving Limerick ratepayers of this intolerable burden.  It is costing Limerick Health Authority 20/- more per day than they are receiving from the appropriate health authorities to maintain patients from outside County Limerick in the regional hospital.  This is an intolerable situation and something will have to be done to remedy it.</P>
      <P>Like others who have spoken, I have considerable experience of medical cards.  This is an abominable system and wholly inequitable.  It is a degrading system.  The time is long past when this detestable system should have been abolished.  The Government have fallen down on many things in recent years but in nothing have they shown greater failure than in their complete inability to devise and implement proper health services.  During the past four or five years the Government have tried to find an alternative through what has come to be known as the &ldquo;O'Higgins Plan&rdquo;.  Eventually, the health services will, I hope, be based on the O'Higgins system.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested to read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> this week that a great deal of examination is being undertaken by the various Parties of the health services in England and I was particularly impressed to read that the spokesman on health for the Conservative Party has come up with a new system to finance the health services in Britain similar to the &ldquo;O'Higgins Plan&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the medical cards system, I understand that the unfortunate officials of health authorities have been placed in a terrible position. Deputies have referred to public representatives bullying the officials to persuade them to give medical cards to people who may or may not be entitled to them.  As far as I am concerned, and I have had as many representations to me on the matter of medical cards as anyone else, the officials of the Limerick Health Authority have tried to administer the Health Act in the spirit in which the health services are framed.  I am sure most Deputies have <Col N="1005" /> found cases of unfortunate people whose incomes may be a few shillings above the statutory limit or of small farmers whose valuations might be £1 or £2 above the limit, who are deprived of medical cards.  It is heartbreaking to find people in need of medical and surgical treatment but who because of their fear of the costs and their inability to pay do not get the treatment they require.</P>
    <P>Last week I had a letter from an elderly lady in my constituency who is not entitled to a medical card and whose local general practitioner has recommended surgical treatment for her as a matter of urgency.  However, she felt she could not afford to pay for the operation.  The present Health Act is unable to cater for such cases and I hope that before long we shall see the end of that abominable system of medical cards.  There is an impression abroad that people who are not entitled to medical cards are getting them and that others who should have them have not got them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of mess the Minister has been making in recent months of his dealings with the Medical Union and the Medical Association.  I understand the introduction of a new health service is being held up because the Minister and the doctors are unable to agree. I understand that the main bone of contention is the question of the payment of doctors.  Recent proposals put forward by the Minister in this respect are ridiculous.  I understand that the Minister expects the medical profession, the GPs, to provide a service which would make them absolute slaves&mdash;a 24-hour service on a capitation basis.</P>
    <P>A capitation basis is a bad thing because it would lead to a situation in which doctors would be inclined to take on the maximum possible number of patients whom they could not efficiently deal with.  I believe the feeper-service is the fairest and most equitable system and that it would lead to better medicine all round.  However, whatever the hold-up is I urge on the Minister the desirability of arriving at agreement with the medical profession because there is no doubt that the success of any new health service will <Col N="1006" /> depend on the full co-operation of the profession.  That co-operation will be forthcoming but the Minister must first of all realise that doctors cannot be expected to provide a 24-hour service at what is a ridiculous rate of remuneration.</P>
    <P>Failure to introduce a new health scheme, which we have been awaiting for so long, has led to serious problems in many dispensary areas throughout the country.  In my constituency a number of dispensary posts had been vacant and in recent times the Minister has filled some of them by permanent appointments.  Other vacant posts are to be advertised.  Nobody knows the basis on which the Department select certain dispensary posts to be filled. I know a situation in Cappamore where the medical officer retired on reaching the age limit.  The post was advertised on a temporary basis and a doctor practising in England applied for and got the post.  He brought his wife and family to Limerick and one year later, after that man had set up in practice and been acting as temporary MO, the post was advertised as a permanent appointment and another doctor got it.  The poor unfortunate who had come back from England had to pull up and go.</P>
    <P>There are other such situations in my constituency.  There is the case of Caherconlish.  There, the dispensary doctor was killed in a car accident and during the past two years the Limerick Health Authority have been unable to find a temporary doctor to fill the post.  After the Cappamore incident I do not blame any doctor for refusing to take on a temporary post in an adjoining area.  Now, the Minister has decided to fill the Caherconlish vacancy on a permanent basis.  The whole system of the filling of dispensary posts in the past two years has been ridiculous.  It will create further problems when the proposed new health scheme comes into operation.</P>
    <P>There is another situation in Limerick which has been brought to my attention.  It involves the dental health service there.  People in need of a certain type of dental service have been waiting two years.  I have in mind cases of people who are in need of dental treatment but because of medical conditions <Col N="1007" /> such as heart or chest ailments they cannot be provided with the dental treatment they require until they are hospitalised.  We have a dental clinic in Limerick with beds available but there is no medical doctor and no medical service attached to it.  The result is that within the past week I had to approach the chief dental officer concerning an unfortunate man who has been waiting two years to have a dental operation performed, and this cannot be done.  I know another case of a lady who had had a brain operation and was urgently in need of dental treatment.  This would require her being hospitalised and being given a general anaesthetic.  She would also require post-operative care which was not available.  That is an appalling situation, which should not arise.  The Minister is well aware of this because the matter has been brought to his notice by the Limerick Health Authority and by the chief dental officer in Limerick.  The clinic is there and the beds are there, but there are no medical officers available in the dental clinic.  There is no personnel available to provide post-operative care.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the health services to which every Deputy refers when speaking on this Estimate, and one with which most people are concerned, is the question of mentally handicapped children.  In my opinion it is a most heartbreaking situation for a Deputy or a public representative to be confronted with when an unfortunate parent seeks his aid to have a child admitted to an institution.  Despite the tremendous work done by religious orders and by voluntary bodies in this field, we still have not anything like adequate facilities available in our instituations to cater for these children. This is a situation which merits top priority, and I sincerely hope that the Minister, or the Minister in the new Government which we will have in the course of the next couple of months, will tackle that problem in a realistic fashion, and that we will be able to reach the stage where adequate and proper services will be available for these unfortunate afflicted children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been <Col N="1008" /> asked to be brief and I will try to be brief but I find it a little difficult on an Estimate like this.  I will confine most of my remarks to the problems in my own constituency.  The first matter I should like to mention is the question of the hospital in Ballinasloe which, under the new plan, is to be done away with.  We feel in South Galway that this would be a great tragedy because the Portiuncula Hospital, which is comparatively new, has given tremendous service since it was opened about 20 to 25 years ago. It has got all the facilities.  Unlike Athlone, which is the bigger centre of population, it has a resident surgeon, gynaecologists and the lot, and also a training school.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage I should like to appeal to the Minister, as I understand there is to be some rearrangement in connection with the various hospitals, to do his best to include the Portiuncula Hospital.  In East Galway we feel that if it goes we will not only lose a hospital but we will also lose lives because from wherever it is&mdash;the nearest will probably be Mullingar&mdash; to Galway is too big an area to have without a hospital for emergency cases and things like that.  I appeal to the Minister not to forget Portiuncula in the rearrangement of the hospital services.</P>
      <P>I know we are waiting for a new Health Bill which it is hoped will solve the problem of the dispensaries.  There is a large area in my constituency in which there is no doctor.  In fact, at one stage in the town of Gort there were seven vets and no doctor.  Looking over the west end of my constituency I can see that there are umpteen vets dotted around the place but no doctor.  It seems to be funny thinking on our part if we consider animals before humans.  We have had a problem in the Ardrahan dispensary area for a number of years.  There was a doctor there.  The area was amalgamated with the Gort area and the doctor is now living in the town of Gort which incidentally is left without a dispensary doctor too.  The Ardrahan man will be going in there.</P>

    <P>The nearest dispensary doctor is in Loughrea.  There are two doctors there. Since the Tynagh mines opened, and <Col N="1009" /> over the past couple of years, Loughrea has become a very large town.  It also has St. Brendan's, the county home, and only two doctors.  Those two doctors are well occupied and find it difficult to go to Ardrahan and other areas outside the town.  For that reason, even before the Health Bill is brought in, every effort must be made to get doctors for this dispensary area.  It is no good saying that the posts are advertised and no one applies.  No one would apply because of the ridiculous salaries which are offered in some areas.  The salary must be made attractive.  Life in rural Ireland is not very attractive for a professional man with children to educate.  He has to be induced to go there.  He is not going to rush there.  It must be made attractive and this must be done rapidly or we will find ourselves in the West of Ireland&mdash;and God knows we are bad enough in the West of Ireland&mdash;without any doctors but with plenty of vets.  This seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>I am being very brief because I promised I would be.  Every Deputy who spoke said a word for the mentally handicapped.  In Galway we have the second highest number of mentally handicapped in the country.  Great work has been done by voluntary organisations and by religious orders in my constituency, but we could still have many more schools for mildly retarded children, and schools for severely retarded children.  Now £90,000 is being paid for our County Galway children in institutions around the country.  I know a religious order, and the Minister knows it too, which is anxious to open a school for mentally handicapped children.  It is a teaching order with experience of handicapped children.  Under the rearrangement of the secondary schools the Order lost its secondary school.  It has the building and the personnel, and all it needs is the financial assistance which one must have in a case like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is for severely handicapped children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The sisters in charge and the people in the area are anxious to see the Minister after Easter.  I will speak to him again <Col N="1010" /> about that, but I would appeal to him to think about it between this and then because we have the second highest number of mentally handicapped children. I think the highest number is in the Minister's own county of Mayo.</P>
      <P>The nuns in Clarenbridge are anxious to open a school for girls. Boys are nearly always catered for but perhaps that is because there are more mentally handicapped boys.  We have some mentally handicapped girls.  Some of my constituents have mentally handicapped girls and they cannot get them in anywhere.  It would be a great help to the parents if we could keep them in our own county.  This would facilitate bringing them home for holidays and visiting them.  Visiting them is very important because these little mites need more affection than healthy children.  If they are a long time away from their parents holidays can be a very emotional experience, and terribly upsetting if they have forgotten their parents as these children will. They have not got the same capacity for remembering as ordinary children have.  So, a school close at hand would be a great advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said during the course of this debate about the burden on the rates because of the health services. Anyone who lives in County Galway knows that we have now reached the stage where we will not be able to pay our rates any more.  I remember when I was a child&mdash;it is a long time ago now, but not all that long&mdash;my grandmother used to say that the time would come when the rates would be as high as the rent.  Rents are now non-existent and the rates are phenomenal.  I do not know the answer, but we cannot continue in the way we are going now and I believe there could be some saving.  I believe there is abuse at various points in the hospitals services.  For example, I know that in the regional hospital the patients look on the ambulance as a sort of taxi service, even though they may have private cars at their doors. The doctor will ring and say that an ambulance is to be sent to such-andsuch a place, and they consider that their right.  I have heard ambulance drivers and nurses saying that when <Col N="1011" /> they arrived there were three cars in the yard, perhaps the cars of sons and daughters.  Somebody would even drive behind the patient in the ambulance. It should be impressed on people, perhaps by the dispensary doctor, that the ambulance service is only to be used for stretcher cases and for medical card people who have not got cars. Anybody who can bring a patient themselves to hospital should do so.  It is a terrible abuse to use the ambulance service like a taxi service.  Sometimes when a situation arises where there is an emergency the ambulance is off ferrying somebody to a dental clinic or something like that, which is something patients could travel to by bus or car.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention drugs given out to patients at home.  Patients do not take all the drugs they get.  It is a notorious position, but one does not finish the drugs usually.  The doctors in the dispensaries are too liberal with drugs.  Bottles of various sizes are handed out to patients who take about ten doses of them and the remaining amount is then left on the dresser or the dressing table and is not used.  They then run out-of-date and another batch has to be got.  Doctors should give the minimum amount. They should give expensive drugs, if necessary, but it should be impressed on the patients that the drugs are expensive and that they should use them. They should be told that if they do not take them they should leave them back to the dispensary and not have a situation where heaps of drugs are stacked up in houses when nobody is using them.  There is an abuse of the health services in this.  These are small savings, and I know one could be penny wise and pound foolish but the people should not subject the health services to such abuses.</P>
    <P>The same point applies to the hospitals. Much money is spent in hospitals that need not be spent.  There is much waste where there need not be waste.  Speaking of hospitals prompts me to mention the nurses and the nursing profession.  Last week three young nurses came to me here in the House.  They had just qualified with the <Col N="1012" /> last batch in November or December last.  Until they were qualified these youngsters in a Dublin Health Authority hospital lived in the hospital but they are now expected to fend for themselves and are paid £2 per week to pay for their digs and their food. That is not even sufficient to pay for their digs.  They are saving their wages for falderals, for blouses and skirts and such like&mdash;and it is very hard to blame young girls for thinking of clothes with their first-earned money. If these young nurses are not properly nourished then they will pick up infections in the hospital and ruin their health.  Something has to be done about it.  The living-out pay is far too small. The pay for any nurses, in or out, is far too small.  They work long hours in fairly hard conditions.  They should get a reasonable figure for living out.  £2 per week would not keep you in peanuts, never mind digs or food.  This will have to be looked into.  The health authorities are not the only ones to blame.  The voluntary hospitals are just as bad.  They have the same system where a qualified girl is put out immediately after qualification with very little to pay for her food and her digs.</P>
    <P>There is not a Deputy in the House who does not get as we do in the West of Ireland a large number of social cases.  Every weekend in my constituency I meet people who tell me that a relation, perhaps an uncle, is in hospital and that he must come home but that there is nobody to care for him at home.  He is just a social case.  It sounds a nice word, but it is one of the saddest things that I know to say that a man or woman who has lived a long time and who has worked hard should be labelled a social case and shoved from one place to another, just because he or she has no one to care for him.  We have St. Brendan's County Hospital in Loughrea.  It is an excellent one and is better than some of the other institutions in my constituency, but it is bursting at the seams.  There are four rows of beds in the wards and it must be impossible for the nurses and the doctors to work in them.  I must say for this hospital that it is beautifully kept and the patients are extremely well cared for.  It is a question of the <Col N="1013" /> authorities saying: &ldquo;We cannot get another person into St. Brendan's and you will have to wait until someone passes on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar position.  Some of our elderly people are being taken at Merlin Park Sanatorium.  There are units there closed and they will not be opened because the RMS says he cannot get nurses for them to look after the social cases.  I had a case last week of a man of 94 years of age who was in Merlin Park Hospital.  He was living alone but had one nephew, a bachelor, living near him.  He was sent home because we could not get him into Loughrea Hospital because there were not any beds.  Merlin Park will, I think, make arrangements to take him back soon, but something must be done.  If the units are free in Merlin Park and if enough salary was offered people would work there, even part-time. Married women would take part-time employment there.  Everyone knows that married working women get little or no income tax reliefs.  Perhaps the Minister would have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to make it more attractive, and then they would get nurses.</P>
    <P>There were many other small items in my mind, but I promised I would not be more than five minutes.  I will leave it at that.  I should like to ask the Minister not to forget the Portiuncula Hospital and the hospital at Clarenbridge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and to say that, in the main, it has been a very constructive and enlightening one from my point of view though perhaps in the last few hours, with some notable exceptions&mdash;the last two speeches in particular&mdash;the debate might be said to have become unnecessarily repetitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So many points of detail were raised by various Members that it would be impossible for me to deal with them in the course of this reply.  I can, therefore, only undertake to the various Deputies that any matters of detail to which I do not refer now I will deal with in correspondence or otherwise by <Col N="1014" /> contacting the Deputies concerned as soon as possible.  I must say when Deputy Seán Moore was speaking earlier on and he mentioned that health was no burden on the rates in London I had a rather impious thought that there is an easy solution to my problem in this regard.  In London and in England generally education is a considerable burden on the local authorities, though health is not; but when I mentioned to my colleague, the Minister for Education, the possibility that, say, 50 per cent of the cost of education would be imposed on the rates while the entire cost of health would be taken off the rates he gave me a rather hard look.  Many Deputies spoke, as Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins has just done, on the cost of drugs and medicines in the general medical service.  Indeed, I think all Members of the House agree that, irrespective of the cost of these drugs and medicines, if they have the result of keeping people out of institutions of any kind, the money involved is well spent.  This is true economically as well as socially but, of course, the economic is by far a secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House referred to wastage in the general medical service.  I ask: how much wastage in fact occurs?  How many doctors are too casual about the prescriptions that they are giving to their patients?  How many doctors are giving drugs supplied for the use of medical card holders to their private patients? How many patients are misusing the rights and privileges which they enjoy of free drugs and medicines in the manner in which Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins has just described?  How many of these people realise the obligation under the Seventh Commandment not to steal from his neighbour? There is no difference between the misuse of expensive drugs supplied by the taxpayer or the ratepayer who is simply one's neighbour than taking the money directly out of his pocket.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time that in these days, when our services are costing such an astronomical amount of money, each one should examine his or her conscience as to his public attitude to <Col N="1015" /> money.  In the last analysis, there is no such thing as a free health service, comprehensive or otherwise, and may I quote from Deputy Dillon's very useful and helpful contribution to this debate a few days ago.  I am quoting from column 811 of the Dáil Debates for Thursday, 20th March, 1969:</P>
    <P>I want to remind Dáil Éireann of something which we are only too prone to forget, that the illusory yearning for a universal free health system has brought not only Great Britain but the United States of America itself to their knees financially. And the Labour Government in Britain has itself re-introduced prescription charges in order to stem the economic flood that was engulfing them.  The USA, with its almost incredible resources, economically speaking, is finding that the programme designed for the protection of the old, Medicare, as introduced by President Johnson's administration, is overwhelming their resources and they have not reached out at all, comparatively speaking, to the able-bodied.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon goes on:</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House, God knows I am tired issuing these warnings and have earned derision at the hands of the Fourth Estate for reiterating them.  The Minister for Finance has appeared on television in the past few days to tell us that we are on the verge of economic catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon goes on to say that this is the fault of the present Government and he is entitled to make that observation. He continues at column 812:</P>
    <P>Everyone must sympathise with the clamorous demands that some relief be provided for the rates but relief of rates can only be provided by the Exchequer and the Minister for Finance says that the Exchequer is almost flat on its back.  What Deputies are inclined to forget is that when you speak of the Irish Exchequer you speak of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I must say that I agree with this point of view and that I totally disagree with <Col N="1016" /> the point of view put forward by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins this morning and last night when he proceeded to replay the record that we now have almost off by heart in regard to a method of financing the health services which he says will remove entirely the burden from the rates.  However, I propose to leave that matter alone for the moment.</P>
    <P>The subject of drug abuse was mentioned by a large number of Deputies and, having listened to the very many points of view, I am convinced more than ever of the wisdom of my decision to set up a working party to advise me as to what steps should be taken in this matter.  Members of the House have been sharply divided, for instance, on the value of education, type of education, the value of publicity and the type of publicity and so on that should be given in regard to this matter of the use and misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>I wish to say to Deputy Des Foley and others who spoke on this matter that, if he or any other Member knows of persons who can give advice to the working party, he should ask those persons to come along in answer to the working party's invitation and to do so as soon as possible.  Some people outside the House have taken a very strong line in this matter.  I hope that they are right.  For myself, I shall be much happier when the working party reports and then we will all have the benefit of considering its recommendations. I think we shall then be able to decide whether the approach of Deputy Foley, who says that this matter of drug abuse by young people should be glamourised by maximum publicity and maximum education is right, or the approach of Deputy Ryan, who said we should not foster an unhealthy interest in the young in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the decision to set up a working party was the right one because, while I have certain views, I am not satisfied that they are backed up by sufficient knowledge.  This debate has demonstrated that other Members of the House&mdash;each obviously talking from a sincere concern about the possibility of the abuse of drugs escalating into a national problem&mdash;have spoken from very different points of view and sometimes have <Col N="1017" /> taken diametrically opposite lines to each other.  In conclusion on this matter, may I say that the working party has indeed been working.  I hope to have their recommendations in the near future although I have not, in this case, set any time limit on their deliberations because I thought that this is a field in which to do so would be ill-advised.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I should like to refer was also referred to earlier today by Deputy T. O'Donnell.  It was previously referred to by Deputy Kyne in his helpful opening speech on behalf of the Labour Party, by Deputy Ryan in his opening speech on behalf of Fine Gael and by Deputy O'Connell and others.  I think it was Deputy O'Connell who referred to the offer to the doctors, which I published a couple of weeks ago, as an insult.  Deputy O'Donnell was equally severe this morning in his criticism of the terms which he alleged were hopelessly inadequate. May I say that, since this debate began, I have received a communication from the secretaries of the Irish Medical Association and of the Medical Union rejecting the offer on behalf of their members.  I do not propose to say anything more about the contents of the joint letter I received from the secretaries because they appended certain counter-proposals which I told them I would discuss at a meeting arranged to take place next week.  I shall, first of all, give to the House approximate figures as to the earnings that a doctor would receive in the general medical service on the basis of the proposal that I made.</P>
    <P>A doctor with 2,000 patients, of whom one-quarter are over 65 years of age, would have £2,125 by way of capitation payment.  He would have, in addition, £800 as an advance towards his practice expenses and this, I think, although I am subject to correction, would be free of income tax and, if so, this would be the equivalent of a taxed sum of £1,200.  One way or the other, he would also have £500 for what I can only describe as waiting time, that is, the time between the end of his ordinary eight-hour day and the night, when a special rate will apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister <Col N="1018" /> mentions 2,000 patients.  They are private patients and medical card patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 2,000 public patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For a dispensary area, are 2,000 patients necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. I am just taking that as an example.  It is impossible to estimate how much this particular doctor would make over a year in respect of night calls, for which he is to be paid, on the basis of the offer, £1 per call.  Perhaps this might be roughly £50.  In addition, he has various items in respect of which he gets a fee for service.  Therefore, taking private practice into account, he would earn over £3,000 a year, plus his private practice, plus his maternity fees, plus his certification fees, plus his immunisation fees, and I leave the House to guess what he would make on fees for item service such as stitching fingers, and so on.  It may be that it is an insult to doctors to offer them a basic remuneration exceeding £3,000 a year on the number of patients I have mentioned.  The only question I have to ask the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union is this: what do they regard as a reasonable basic salary for a doctor in the public service?  Do they consider that he should be paid a basic £20,000 a year to look after public patients, or £15,000 a year, or £10,000 a year, or £5,000 a year, or what figure do they regard a general practitioner is entitled to by way of a basic reward for looking after his now-called dispensary patients, who of course will cease to be that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to doctors employed mostly in institutions or to dispensary doctors, or to both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am talking about the doctors who will take part in the new general medical service which will look after the patients now in the lower income group and looked after by dispensary doctors.  Therefore, <Col N="1019" /> I do not propose to say very much more about that.  I hope that, when I meet the representatives of the two associations next week, I shall have from them an answer to the fundamental question that I have asked just now and also the assurance from them that that answer does represent the view of the general members of their profession throughout the country.  I do not think the offer is an insult and, furthermore, I do not think the remarks made by Deputy Dr. O'Connell in this House and elsewhere in regard to the offer are, or were intended to be particularly helpful.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of the mentally handicapped which, again, was referred to by almost every Deputy who contributed to the debate. May I say, first of all, that I am most appreciative of the compliments paid to me personally and to my Department in regard to the work that has been done in this field in recent years.  I was somewhat surprised by the contribution made last night by Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to our alleged failures. Indeed, I was also somewhat surprised at an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which referred to a crying need for new provisions for mentally handicapped children merely because this allegation was made in the House. I should like to set the record straight here.  Four years ago a Commission on Mental Handicap made a report in which, on the basis of all the information they could get at that time, they recommended that a total of 900 beds be supplied throughout the country to cater for this problem and to cater totally for it as they saw it then.  Within the four years that have since elapsed 880 extra residential places have been provided.  Unfortunately, as the House knows, the problem has grown very much in the meantime with the result that we still require, as far as we can see, a further 800 places or so to be created.  We are in the process of creating these over the next two or three years and I can only hope, as I said to Deputy Dillon in reply to a supplementary question some months ago, that the provision of these 800 beds will in fact then result in the total solution of the problem in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> However, it should be remembered and this is what I want to remind Deputy Fitzpatrick about, that it is not merely a question of money&mdash;and I again wish to reiterate that this is and has been a priority matter all during the last four years and it will continue to be a priority matter for the future&mdash; but you must also find people who are willing to look after handicapped people and in particular severely handicapped boys and girls.  I am delighted to hear&mdash;although I had actually heard this before&mdash;from Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, who has put it on the record, that there is an Order willing to look after handicapped girls at Clarenbridge.  I can assure the House that I will be glad to meet the sisters and be glad to cooperate in every possible way provided the premises are suitable for the girls concerned.  This is another matter about which we have to be careful.  It is not just a matter of providing an institution for children, you must provide the children with more than a mere building; as well as staff you must provide the right atmosphere and the right ancillary help and the right numbers.</P>
    <P>It has been very strongly urged on various Ministers for Health that small institutions are not the answer but institutions which cater for a minimum of 100 and preferably 200.  In connection with the Galway situation the House may be aware that negotiations are taking place at present with a view to acquiring a very large institution in the city of Galway which, if acquired, and if we have the people to run it, would effectively solve the problem for the whole Galway area and indeed for much of my own county as well.  I would join with Members who congratulated the sisters and brothers throughout the country for their wonderful devotion and kindness to the cause of these unfortunate people, and to the nursing staffs in all these institutions who have been equally kind and hardworking in the same cause.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this subject might I mention that the Department of Health have also made very significant advances in the case of children at day schools.  As the House knows, this is <Col N="1021" /> not my responsibility but the responsibility of the Minister for Education. I was happy to hear at a symposium in Sligo recently that the work being done here is very considerably in advance of the work being done in the United States, in Britain and in other countries throughout the world.  It was very pleasing to hear that and I can confirm that it will continue to be the policy of the Department of Education to provide the necessary day schools and the teaching staff to run them.</P>
    <P>This, perhaps, may be a suitable moment to mention the subject of the control by the religious orders of their institutions in the future.  This is a matter on which Deputy Dillon spoke most eloquently and in which he has been very interested in recent times.  I have already given Deputy Dillon and the House the assurance that for the future it will be no part of my policy or the policy of my Department to remove from the ownership or control of the religious the institutions they run at present.  Indeed, since I did mention mentally handicapped, perhaps there is confirmation of this in the fact that practically all the institutions which cater for the mentally handicapped are owned and operated and controlled by various religious orders, male and female&mdash;the Brothers of Saint John of God, the Brothers of Charity, Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary and the Sisters of La Sagesse, who were specifically mentioned by Deputy Gilhawley.  There has never been anything in the agreements entered into between the Sisters of Mercy, Irish Sisters of Charity, the Medical Missionaries of Mary as owners of general hospitals and the Minister for Health, as a condition of grants, that their ownership of the hospitals would be interfered with in any way.  I hope this assurance will be sufficient for Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Recently, in conversation with certain religious some concern was expressed about the continued flow of postulants into their orders in the years ahead.  The world is changing and sometimes not for the better.  The fear has been expressed that without the flow of postulants into the orders, or <Col N="1022" /> indeed with the flow of postulants, but with girls interested in missionary work abroad rather than at home, the nuns and brothers may not be able to continue to staff their institutions as effectively in time to come as they are at present.  This is something over which we have no control.  It does not affect in any way the assurance I have given as regards policy towards voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>Specifically, in regard to the mentally handicapped and the connection between phenylketonuria and mental handicaps, which was mentioned by Deputy Foley, if there has been difficulty for any parents in obtaining the necessary food for the children this is a matter which I would immediately draw to the attention of the Dublin Health Authority.  I think they are, in fact, alive to the situation and that any difficulties that did arise were of a casual nature.  PKU was also mentioned in connection with the cost of the food.  The children concerned are normally treated under the hardship clause already in existence.  I can give particulars to the House of the treatment of the children concerned in detail at any time.  Thalidomide victims were also mentioned and in regard to this difficult problem, the principal concern has been to ensure that the limb-fitting arrangements were adequate through the rehabilitation facilities.  This, I am glad to say, is the case.</P>

      <P>About 50 in the entire country.  It is very rare.  The next matter I wish to deal with is the child health service which was mentioned in an excellent speech by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  It was also mentioned by Deputy Ryan and many other speakers, including Deputy Belton this morning.  I fully agree with Dr. Gibbons' point of view that the desired extension as regards children is in the downward rather than in the upward direction.  In other words, it is far better when we extend the child health service to extend it to the younger children in the pre-school age long before attempting to extend it to post-primary, secondary or university level.  It is vital that any resources we have should be concentrated on the preventive side.  As well as helping medically I hope this would be helpful educationally in making the parents more conscious of their obligations to their children at an earlier age.  It is the intention, and this will be incorporated in the Health Bill, that defects discovered at any time during school age or, as I hope to extend it, at pre-school age, will qualify for free treatment. I wish to emphasise that, even as things are, if a defect is discovered at school but not cured until the child has left school the child still continues to be entitled, for instance, to orthodontic treatment even though at that stage he is attending a post-primary institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> The desired extension is that, instead of making it obligatory that the defect be discovered at school medical examinations, in future when the new Health Bill comes into operation, if the defect is discovered by the child's GP at any time, it will qualify.  In that way we remove a source of great irritation and annoyance in the past, an annoyance and irritation about which we could do nothing because the provision was a statutory one and therefore not amenable to Ministerial or other alteration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the district nursing service I wish to repeat what I said in my opening remarks, that the target of 600 extra district health nurses should be achieved within the present year or, if not, very shortly afterwards.  This, I think, has been a significant improvement in the health services over the past few years and one which, I think, can be justified on social grounds because district health nursing will surely again prevent people from having to disappear into institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to that extent is again a most desirable social objective.  Of course the district health nursing will cost us money and of course I would like to pay them more but you would have to come back again to the dichotomy evident throughout the whole debate of our desire to give more in every possible direction and the reality of the fact of having to pay. This to me has been also a priority development because of the social implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I should like to mention is the Voluntary Health Insurance which was also very much to the fore in the course of the debate. I wish to endorse everything that has been said in praise of the Voluntary Health Board and indeed gladly acknowledge the fact mentioned this morning that it was during the Ministry of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins that the necessary legislation was passed. Deputy Dr. O'Connell made what I think may be one very good practical suggestion and that was that there should be some form of no claim <Col N="1025" /> bonus associated with a compulsory annual medical check.  Obviously to have a no claim bonus without the check would not be a very desirable development but I think this is a good suggestion and one which I will convey to the Board as well as the suggestion by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  I have forgotten exactly what it was but I thought it was a sensible suggestion at the time and one which I should like to bring to the notice of the Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will bear in mind that with those who retain good health it is not altogether unreasonable to ask them to bear their share of the burden on the unfortunates who fall ill.  It is only for when we are sick we have to pay the premium.  If I get through a 12-month period without any sickness I am not discontented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Another matter mentioned, which is one of importance, was the question of the use in institutions of native fuel.  There seems to be some confusion in the public mind as to whether Government policy in this matter had changed. I think it is true to say to some extent that the policy did locally as a result of the disastrous year of 1965.  But the Government policy has not changed and I also have regard to the private producers of turf who have a very big investment in turf in various parts of the country and particularly in parts of the country where employment is notoriously difficult to obtain, including my own part of the country, and therefore where the employment is of national as well as of local value.  I want to tell the House that I wrote on 30 Meán Fómhair, 1968, on the use of native fuels in hospitals and I addressed a circular to each health authority, each mental health board and the Western Health Institutions Board.  I do not propose to bore the House with the details of the circular.  I think it is sufficient to say I stressed that the Government policy has not changed <Col N="1026" /> and, in addition to consulting Bord na Móna, they should also consult private producers of turf before any decision is made to use oil or any other substance. Recently a case has been made to me by the representatives of Dublin Corporation that this is a policy not particularly appropriate to Dublin and that it might in their regard be alleviated. I undertook to look into this matter.  I am getting in contact with Bord na Móna and I will communicate with Dublin Corporation.  So far as I am concerned if it was quite clear there was no change in the general policy with regard to the use of native fuels I would not be against the Dublin Corporation's saving which would be involved only in the city.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately during the debate Deputy Treacy accused me of insolence and of treating the people of Ballingarry, County Tipperary, and their problem with contempt.  I think the exact expression used was that I was making a mockery of the people of Ballingarry.  I think since I was invited to produce the letter I wrote to Deputy Treacy I should do so.  I have it with me here.  It is dated 21st February, 1969, and it will be obvious it was dictated by me.</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
      <P>I have been for a long time concerned about the lack of suitable arrangements for medical services in the Ballingarry area.  Indeed, the late Don Davern was the first to bring the situation to my notice.  The position is that Local Appointments Commission advertised the post without success over a too long period but as a result of their most recent competition hoped to be able to offer a doctor to Ballingarry at last.  I very much hope so.  Frankly I do not think the people of Ballingarry could tell me anything I do not already know about their plight. Deputy Fahey has also concerned himself so all the public representatives have given me the facts and between them to say the least of it they are highly articulate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I wish to deal with is the big one, namely, the question of the transfer of the cost of the <Col N="1028" /> health services from the rates to the Central Fund.  This morning once again Deputy T.F. O'Higgins contributed on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and for the life of me I still do not know what the Fine Gael Party policy is.  I am not making politics out of this because this has been almost exclusively an apolitical debate by people concerned about health services and about their improvement and about methods of paying for them.  As I understood Deputy O'Higgins this morning his insurance scheme is to cover personal medical service only whereas the cost of the hospital service is to be loaded on to the taxpayer and taken exclusively from the rates.  May I point out to the House that the cost of the general medical service is only one-tenth of the total cost of the health services at the present time?  Therefore, all the suggestions that are made with regard to the improvement of the general medical service concern only a minute part of the service and refer to only a minute part of the service as well.  The real cost of our health services is hospitalisation.  At the present time, not in respect of this year but in respect of the next year, when the total cost of my Department will be almost £50 million in round figures the cost of the general medical service is £5 million and the cost of the hospital section of it is £45 million so that to load on the cost of the hospital service to the taxpayer would certainly vastly relieve the rates but would place on the back of the taxpayer a new and extraordinary heavy burden.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the proposal put forward by Deputy Richie Ryan, not so much in his contribution to this debate as on the Motion debated here a couple of weeks ago, was that there should be a comprehensive health service with general medical and specialist care for all the community and that the cost of this should be borne as to one-third by the taxpayer, one-third by the ratepayer and one-third by insurance.  Might I, in this connection, point out to the House that if this were to happen the minimum that this service would <Col N="1029" /> cost in the year 1969-70 would be £70 million?  Therefore, £23 million odd would have to be found out of insurance, £23 million odd found out of taxation and £23? million found from the ratepayers.  At the present time the total contribution under our scheme by the ratepayers is £22 million so that a comprehensive service on the lines suggested by Deputy Ryan would involve not decreasing the burden of the rates but increasing it.  One way or the other, whether it is a slight reduction or a slight increase, it should be obvious to the House and to the public that it would not involve a substantial reduction of the burden of rates in any event.  As I said I do not know which of these two schemes is really the one that Fine Gael support but I do point out to the public that the one-third, one-third, one-third scheme does not involve a reduction in the rates and that the other scheme suggested by Deputy O'Higgins this morning involves an enormous increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>If on the other hand we take the Labour Party's approach as outlined in the Labour Party policy document very recently published where the whole burden is removed from the rates, and on this the Labour Party are perfectly clear in what they say, the kind of service outlined here would cost their social fund something between £70 million and £90 million for the year 1969-70.  Having regard to all the obligations that the social fund undertakes in this document I find it very difficult to believe that it would be possible for it to achieve them without a fantastic burden in taxation apart from anything that the social fund itself would contribute.  Perhaps I should be more specific on this and point out what the obligations of the social fund will be: pensions of all kinds, contributory, non-contributory and widows'; unemployment of all kinds to take the place of the present unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and redundancy payments system; benefits to complement a comprehensive health service.  These are the main burdens that the social fund will have to carry and while the document is vague on it, it would seem to <Col N="1030" /> me that if it is successfully to carry these obligations the whole of the cost of the comprehensive free health service will have to be met out of general taxation.  At the present time general taxation runs to roughly £26 million. To escalate that to a figure of £70 million to £80 million will give the House and the country some idea of what is involved in trying to keep our health services going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned the matter of medical officers in Cork.  As he knows, there were two special competitions held for permanent posts by the Local Appointments Commission in the past four years and, as a result of these, two posts were filled in Cork. Very recently I agreed to a still further easing in the stand-still and have recommended a number of posts to the Local Appointments Commission for filling.  Three of these are in County Cork, namely, Bandon, Buttevant and Doneraile.  I can only wait and see what the outcome of this will be, though I should say there are three posts in Wexford, which has been particularly badly hit recently by the departure of doctors, which I have recommended for permanent appointment in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne spoke about the conditions of service and remuneration of nurses.  I think it fair to point out that hospital nursing hours of duty were reduced from a 96-hour fortnight to a 90-hour fortnight in the past five or six years and were further reduced to an 85-hour fortnight a couple of years ago.  As regards pay, as the House knows, there is conciliation and arbitration machinery, and the arbitrator has recently made an award.  This is being considered both by the INO and the County and City Managers' Association and if agreement is reached I shall be happy to implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that where a nurse finishes her eight hours of duty, if she is on ambulance duty she can be kept on for four, five or six hours over her time and the only compensation she gets for that is to get time off when the hospital authorities can afford to give it to her?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have spoken about the recommendations of the Fitzgerald Report, and I feel I should say a little on this matter, although it is not strictly relevant to the debate.  To begin with, I should like all Members of the House to study the Fitzgerald Report and to grasp the principles which govern the recommendations made in it.  It is easy enough to praise the report if one of the recommendations is the establishment or the preservation of a hospital in a particular area.  Equally obviously, it is a matter of satisfaction for Deputy Fitzpatrick or any other Deputy from Cavan to point to the recommendation in the report and urge the Minister to have it implemented.  It is equally understandable that Deputy Crotty, on behalf of the people of Kilkenny, should protest that the report is not satisfactory inasmuch as it proposes to alter the status of an existing hospital, a particularly good one, in Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The description &ldquo;community health centre&rdquo; used in the report may not have been too happy.  One must remember that the people who prepared the report were very eminent consultants but were not politicians, and perhaps if they were politicians their nomenclature would have been worse rather than better.  One way or the other, what I do wish to emphasise is <Col N="1032" /> that the report has been agreed in principle only and will be subject to detailed consideration.  I can, for example, see a good deal of merit in the argument put forward by Deputy Crotty on behalf of Kilkenny.  It is a different case from that of Cavan which would appear to be a very obvious centre for a general hospital, having regard to the location of regional and general hospital facilities in its vicinity and its geographical and other features.  Therefore, to that extent, I agree with Deputy Crotty that these are two cases which are not on all fours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Collins was very stern about Bantry and said that, as far as he was concerned, it would be over his dead body that Bantry would be closed.  Again there are obvious differences between the case to be put forward for the preservation of Bantry hospital and the case put forward on behalf of Kilkenny and Cavan.  These are very difficult matters.  The people of Mallow have expressed their dissatisfaction to me about having to amalgamate.  All I wish to say on this matter is that I should like everybody &mdash;politicians and public alike&mdash;to treat this as a medical matter which concerns the people and not as a political matter and something to be used against me.  I am not prepared to have the Fitzgerald Report turned into a political football.  I shall simply say to the people in these areas who want to preserve their facilities, &ldquo;Go ahead and do so&rdquo;, because the developments in medicine which will be taking place over the next fifteen years will effect considerable reorganisation in the hospital structure in any event and the major decisions that will be made in regard to the development of other hospitals will receive every possible consideration from me and from my officials in the future.  Some form of reorganisation is essential and this ought to be admitted by everybody, whatever specific recommendations the report makes in relation to his area.</P>
    <P>With regard to Lisdarn, it was certainly very high on the priority list of recommendations of the council that surgical facilities should be provided there.  Where these facilities are necessary <Col N="1033" /> and recommended, there is no question of my Department postponing action.  There will be no postponement because this improvement, structurally and otherwise, of our hospital service must go on all the time irrespective of Health Bills, recommendations, or anything else.</P>
    <P>There were so many specific matters mentioned in the course of the debate that I do not really think I could possibly attempt to deal with them all. As I said earlier, I will undertake to get in touch with the Deputies in regard to matters of importance to them, personally or from a constituency point of view, to which I have not had a chance to reply.</P>
    <P>So far as the financing of the health services is concerned, this debate proved once again that, no matter what improvements are made, the people will never be satisfied and will go on asking for more.  If we are to give more in any sector of our health services then somebody must pay for that more.  If the rates do not pay, the taxes will have to pay; if the taxes do not pay, then the rates will have to pay. If neither of these is considered suitable as a means of financing our health services, then there will have to be some system of insurance and the people will have to pay the insurance. One cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.  I am fully conscious of the fact that in recent years the development of the health services has placed a very considerable burden on the ratepayer and the taxpayer.  That is why, when the White Paper was published three years ago, it was spelled out that the development mentioned could take place only as the economic situation of the country improved.</P>
    <P>Where the Health Bill is concerned, all I want to say is that any taunts thrown at me by Deputy T. F. O'Higgins I accept; I have been just as irritated and annoyed over the delays that have occurred as has any member of the Opposition, especially since January last.  I never realised, until I went through the experience, all the miserably silly things that could hold one up.  The Bill will be in the hands of Deputies in a matter of <Col N="1034" /> days.  Its implementation must obviously depend on the improvement in the economic situation.  I have no objection to an insurance system as an aid to paying for our health services. Do I have to repeat that every time I speak?  Or will I have to go back to television to repeat what I said on television to Deputy Richie Ryan?  Not merely will I accept any suggestion of value from Fine Gael, the Labour Party, or anybody else, but I will gladly give them credit for it, because I agree with the Deputies, the 95 per cent who contributed to the debate, that health is not a political matter and should not be regarded as such.  I do not think that Deputy Tom O'Higgins added anything to his contribution by repeating today the political charges he made this morning.  I do not mind by what system we finance our health services, now or in the future, providing we can continue to improve them as we have been improving them up to this, providing we continue to provide better hospitals; though not necessarily more hospitals, and providing we continue to provide better facilities for the aged, the infirm, the handicapped and so on. I hope that after Easter I will spend as long on the Health Bill as I did on this Estimate because, if I do, I can be given all Stages in a matter of days in the knowledge that I shall have in the main support from the Opposition in enacting the Bill.</P>
    <P>Once again, I wish to thank the Members of the House for their contributions. It might be invidious to single out any particular speech but I was very impressed by the contribution made by Deputy Clinton.  Everybody who contributed, with the exception of, perhaps, two or three, did so because of a genuine interest in people as patients and as persons liable to suffering and disease.  Very few contributed on the basis of a narrow political point of view.  I believe the majority had the right view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,907,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain Services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for Sundry Grants.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of the increases in rates of payment and the other improvements in social welfare services announced in the 1968 Budget statement.  When introducing the Estimate for my Department in July last, I explained that the 1968-69 Estimate did not make provision for this expenditure, and that a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose would be required later.  The additional amount required is £3,907,000 which will bring the Exchequer expenditure on social welfare for the current financial year to £49,193,000.</P>
      <P>Under Subhead E, which provides for payment by the Exchequer of the deficit on the Social Insurance Fund, an additional £341,000 is being sought. The gross additional expenditure from this fund&mdash;arising almost entirely from improvements in the social insurance schemes&mdash;is expected to amount to £1,315,000.  This will be met to the extent of £865,000, by way of anticipated savings on the original provision and increased income from higher contribution rates.  The difference&mdash; namely £450,000&mdash;between the estimated net additional expenditure and income of the fund, accordingly falls to be recouped.  There is, however, a sum of £109,000 in the fund which was overdrawn from the Exchequer in previous years, and when this is offset against the revised deficit of £450,000, there remains the supplementary sum of £341,000 to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Social Assistance&rdquo; substantial additional amounts are required in respect of old age pensions, unemployment assistance, <Col N="1036" /> widows' and orphans' pensions and miscellaneous grants.  In the case of non-contributory old age pensions the improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, are expected to cost £1,510,000 in the current financial year. A saving of £300,000 is, however, anticipated on the original estimate so that the net additional requirement is £1,210,000.  The extra £2,025,000 required for unemployment assistance is partly attributable to the cost of the increased rates of payment, and partly to an increase in the number of claims over the level on which the original estimate was based.  The excess of £260,000 on widows' and orphans' pensions is due to the increased rates of payment in operation since last August.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead K&mdash;Miscellaneous Grants&mdash;the additional sum of £130,000 now being sought arises as to £21,000 on the free travel concession, £35,000 on the free electricity allowances and the remaining £74,000 on the new scheme of free radio and television licences for certain pensioners which was introduced last year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Deputies will readily agree to provide the additional moneys I am seeking in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

Our persistent complaint is that the Government's share of welfare expenditure at a time of increasing national prosperity has been falling and that compared with ten years ago the State is now paying out of total gross national expenditure only nine-tenths of what was paid one decade ago.  This is a terrible reflection on those now in power&mdash;that at a time of increasing national wealth, at a time when resources have been multiplied, instead of using those increased means for the relief of people in need, they have been dissipated on luxurious current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most alarming figure in the Supplementary Estimate is one of more than £2 million for unemployment assistance.  This is clear evidence of the collapse of the Government's economic programme.  It is a frightening <Col N="1037" /> indication of the degree to which the Government's efforts, miserable as they are, have gone off target that within nine months the Government should have to seek another £2 million for unemployment assistance.  Accepting that some of the increase is attributable to an increase in the amount of assistance granted, an appalling amount of it is due to the increased amount of unemployment and, associated with the increased amount of unemployment, the increased periods of unemployment for those unlucky enough to find themselves unemployed.</P>
    <P>This is a reflection of the Government's expenditure on unemployment assistance but it does not reflect, directly in any event, the increased expenditure on unemployment which has to be made from the rates in urban areas; but it is obviously an indication that if the national Exchequer is paying so much extra in the form of unemployment assistance, ratepayers in urban areas similarly are providing an increasing amount under this head because of the failure of the Government's employment policies&mdash;perhaps not the failure of their policies but the absence of them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the amount paid by the State has dropped by one-tenth in the last decade.  As the State's share of the expenditure has dropped, the contribution to the preservation of life among the poor people in our community has had to be increased from local rates.  Year after year, in all areas, the local rates have been called on to pay increasing sums to subsidise the inadequate payments from the national Exchequer.  In the Dublin region alone, some 25,000 people must, week after week, receive subventions from the local rates because of the gross inadequacy of State welfare payments, not only social assistance payments to old age pensioners and unemployed people, to widows and orphans and so forth, but also to those in receipt of social insurance benefits. This will continue as long as the present Government, or any Government, fail to accept the need for wage-related social insurance schemes which would ensure that while people had income and property they would <Col N="1038" /> contribute a reasonable amount to ensure that when they are unemployed due to illness, accident or loss of employment, the income and consequently their standard of living would not be depressed.  This can be done by wage-related insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage that we should complain of the large amount, proportionately, which the smaller wage earners are required to pay towards social insurance.  There are cases in which people are required to pay anything up to 10 per cent of their gross earnings for social insurance contributions.  This is wrong and some people skilled in this discipline recommend that the highest contribution towards social insurance should be 5 per cent.  We in Fine Gael regard this as a valid figure.  It certainly ought to be possible to have 5 per cent as the maximum for all sections of the community and to provide a much smaller percentage contribution from people who are regarded as being in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>We were very disappointed, indeed, that in the Government's first programme for social development, which was tucked away in a few pages of the larger programme for so-called economic development, practically all the Minister for Social Welfare could promise us was to examine this, that and the other thing.  One would think that he and his partners had not been in power for the past 12 years.  One would think they had not available to them the resources of the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and the other agencies which distribute social welfare benefits throughout the country.  We think it is an appalling admission of neglect, of indifference, of failure, after promising for years to produce a social programme, to say that all the Government are doing is carrying out examinations, making feasibility studies, and engaging in that kind of ineffective phraseology as a substitute for a social policy.</P>
    <P>We need a social policy to ensure that no one in the country is suffering through lack of food or clothing or shelter or medical care.  The truth is that we have in our midst tens of <Col N="1039" /> thousands of our people who are doing just that, who are suffering day in and day out because of the gross inadequacy of our social welfare services. The Minister has failed completely to look after the needs of our less well off citizens.  You do not answer their requirements, you do not answer the requirements of society today, and you certainly do not match the concern of our people, by simply increasing by a small percentage the amount of payments made under antiquated social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>That our social welfare system works at all is due far less to the skill of the manipulators of it than to the goodness of God.  It is utterly inadequate.  The relic of 19th century Victorian charity which now passes as social policy will not meet the requirements of this day and age.  We believe our society is very concerned.  We believe that our people are prepared to pay the taxes necessary, that our people are only too willing to pay the insurance contributions necessary to rid this country of the social evils which are eating away at our very national soul.</P>
    <P>We regret that the Minister and the Government have failed completely to meet the requirements of our times and to meet the obligations which they owe to their fellow men and women. With those words we in Fine Gael give the Minister the £3,900,000 which he requires, expressing a regret that he is not looking for a great deal more to look after all the people in our community who seek but little, and who frequently get nothing at all and who, if they do get anything, are receiving far too little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be rather brief.  The Minister mentioned that it was necessary to introduce this Supplementary Estimate because of the increase in benefits to the recipients of the various classes of social welfare, and that this was not included in the Budget last year.  It is a very bad practice to introduce a Budget and allow the Minister for Finance to claim all the increases which were just around the corner, post-dating them of course <Col N="1040" /> to a particular time of the year, and not include the estimate.  I do not understand that type of book keeping.  Possibly it is politically motivated.</P>
      <P>Some of the faults which I find in the present system are possibly more remarkable to me as a Deputy representing a Border constituency.  Very many of my constituents spend their lives working in the North of Ireland or, indeed, in Great Britain and, on retirement, they come back to this country to live.  Very often they find that the insurance contributions which have been credited to them over a lifetime of employment, do not come up to the standard required by the Department of Social Welfare here in the Republic.</P>
      <P>One of the matters which I feel must be protested against is the situation where the husband must emigrate to find employment or might be lucky enough to obtain employment in the North of Ireland.  That man may meet an early death.  His widow is credited with a widow's and orphans' pension because of the British credits obtained by her late husband's employment.  We have the ridiculous situation that if the pension allowance is below the present statutory limits of non-contributory pension rights in this country, a nominal non-contributory pension will be granted to that lady. However, if the British Government see fit to increase the pension allowance, and it then exceeds the statutory limits of the non-contributory pension rights in this country, her non-contributory pension will be withdrawn. This is a slick way by which the Department of Social Welfare can withdraw a non-contributory pension in circumstances that, to my mind, are mean and despicable.</P>
      <P>No one will challenge the claim that people in this category are in need of financial help.  Very often people in this category are not fully aware of their democratic rights and, indeed, they are prepared to criticise the investigation officer when that individual is merely carrying out orders which he is statutorily bound to abide by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole trouble is Departmental or Ministerial.  I know the Minister for Social Welfare is a fair-minded man.  I should like to think that we are on <Col N="1041" /> reasonably good talking terms.  I should like to think that he would appreciate injustices in the same way and from the same point of view as I assess them.  Using whatever limitations God has given me to sort out right from wrong, I think it is wrong that this country cannot provide employment for a person and that he is forced to emigrate and, if the country to which he went considers that, because of the contribution he has made to that country, he is entitled to a pension, and if that man is called to his reward very early in life, that we, in this country, should take full advantage of the situation and withdraw the non-contributory pensions which, in very many cases, if not in all cases, are really only nominal, from the widow and family of that man.  I hesitate to say that the actions are criminal but they are tending to be in that direction.</P>
    <P>One of the ways this problem could be overcome would be to increase the statutory limits of the present non-contributory pensions schemes.  Deputy Ryan has just pointed out that the value of social welfare benefits at the moment is 10 per cent less than it was 12 years ago.  This would indicate to me that people in these categories are really receiving less pensions, in terms of purchasing power, than they were getting 12 years ago.  The reasons for this, in my opinion, are that the statutory limits are much too rigid and too mean to allow a reasonable, generous allowance to be made to the people in these categories and, for this reason, very many investigating officers find themselves in the class of being the big bad wolf.  Very many of them are most unwelcome when it is their duty to call to investigate the income of a family.</P>
    <P>I have had ventilated in this Chamber many complaints with the present Minister for Social Welfare and, indeed, with his predecessors&mdash; complaints that, to me, were petty in many ways, particularly when we would take into consideration the poor law valuation of properties which nobody wanted to own.  I have in mind now one particular case in my own home town of Raphoe where a family, <Col N="1042" /> in terrible living conditions, were on a very low, mean income.  Because that lady paid 20/- per year rates&mdash;the poor law valuation was something like 5/-which gives an indication as to the type of the property&mdash;her widow's pension was reduced by 2/6 or 4/- a week; I just cannot recall which at the moment.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, the lady did not own the property.  She merely honoured her rights to Donegal County Council. Because she lived in what I would describe as a pig-sty and because the rate collector was saddled with the responsibility of collecting rates on the properties in his collection area&mdash;I suppose she felt it was her responsibility to pay this money.  Because of this, the Department of Social Welfare reduced her widow's pension.  I am thankful that the good lady sought refuge and mentioned the case to me.  I subsequently discovered that the owner of the properties did not even care or want to know that he owned them.  When I tried to persuade the Department of Social Welfare that this was an injustice, nobody seemed to care; nobody seemed to listen; nobody seemed to bother whether this lady was entitled to her rights and if she was getting them or not.  This was the subtle difference&mdash;I only state this case to bring out this point&mdash;between the attitude of the Department of Social Welfare in Ireland and the type of attitude or the approach that social welfare officers and officials have in other parts of the world and, indeed, in other parts of this country.</P>
    <P>The concept of social welfare in which I believe is that the attitude of the Department of Social Welfare should be to help and not to deprive. In this case to which I have referred, we have the attitude that, because this lady paid 20s per year on a poor law valuation of a dwelling which was nothing short of a pig-sty and which a newspaper reporter and photographer refused to enter to take a photograph when I called upon him to expose the injustice, her widow's pension was reduced. A young man who was employed by what I can describe as a Fianna Fáil news organ refused to go inside the door of that dwelling because he felt the roof would fall in. <Col N="1043" /> Needless to say, the county manager and everybody concerned were interested in getting this lady a house and the old house collapsed within a month of her leaving it.  This is the type of injustice I protest against.  It is just one on which we have caught out the Department and the Minister. It is the duty of the Minister for Social Welfare to correct these situations. This case spotlights the approach the officials of the Department of Social Welfare are forced to adopt.  Because of conditions foisted on them, they must think in terms of what we must take rather than in terms of our duties in respect of providing welfare for classes entitled to it and to whom society is prepared to give it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present Government system as we know it in social welfare has tended away from the real purpose which it should have served and continue to serve.  There is no longer interest in social welfare problems. It has developed into a Department doling out money for the purchase of votes.  Basically, this is what the Department of Social Welfare is doing at the moment.  There are many injustices in our society and there are many classes of people who have to be cared for.  Basically the thinking behind it all was that these people must be helped but somewhere along the line politicians' minds became active inasmuch as they began to consider &ldquo;What can we salvage from this huge amount which the Government are paying out to unemployment benefit recipients?&rdquo; Far too much money is being doled out to people who do not want to work. Very often the cry is &ldquo;If you vote Fine Gael or for anyone other than Fianna Fáil they will take it from you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is good politics or not to say this but at least it is honest politics and if anyone wishes to misinterpret what I am saying at least I would ask him to give me credit for being honest.  Too many people are getting unemployment assistance and being bribed into voting for the Government Party, being intimidated at election times by Fianna Fáil <Col N="1044" /> Party workers and canvassers.  They go to the gullible people and tell them &ldquo;If you vote for anyone other than Fianna Fáil they will withdraw widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance.  Fine Gael are against them.&rdquo; Fine Gael are against none of these things; they are in favour of a just social welfare policy.  We issued our policy and gave in it comprehensive details of what we propose to do, but we would rather substitute employment than pay unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the Supplementary Estimate before the House. The question of policy is not before the House but a Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>But it deals with unemployment. It says that an extra £2 million odd is required for unemployment assistance and that this is partly attributable to the increase in the rates of payment and an increase in the number of grants over the original Estimate. Am I not therefore entitled to make this point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to come into conflict with the Chair but am I not entitled to develop the argument that these things are being abused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are confined on the Supplementary Estimate to the headings with which it deals and cannot discuss the broad outlines of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the Chair's ruling but perhaps the Chair will just let me finish on this point.  I should like to put it on record that the attitude of this Party is that we would much rather offer employment to unemployed people than purchase their voting power by using State funds to pay them the dole.  The Minister indicated that under the heading of social assistance a saving of £300,000 was anticipated on the original estimate.  I should like the Minister to explain this.  Is this saving caused because other countries have increased widows' and orphans' <Col N="1045" /> pensions, that is in cases where the husbands of the widows worked in these countries, and the Department of Social Welfare are withdrawing the non-contributory pension?</P>
      <P>Another matter in which I have been involved recently and about which I tabled a question is that sometimes it happens&mdash;and if it happens once cognisance should be taken of it&mdash;that firms for one reason or another fail to make their social welfare contributions in respect of employees, possibly for financial reasons.  A firm may go bankrupt or may seek the protection of the courts and if employees are laid off they may discover that they have no claim for unemployment benefit or sickness benefit and the Department will not recognise that for reasons beyond their control these people find themselves in serious financial difficulty. I do not know what powers are necessary but certainly in the case of one company, about which the Minister knows, which finds itself in this difficulty, the former employees cannot now avail of sickness benefit.  One particular person has not received one penny disability or sickness benefit from the Department since the beginning of December.  It is a shame that a man who works for 18 months or two years with a firm which goes bankrupt should find himself unemployed and without unemployment benefit or sickness benefit.  In this connection, sickness benefit is more important.  If he finds himself unemployed he can hope to get alternative employment but if he is unable to avail of work then he will be in real trouble.  Therefore the Minister should introduce legislation governing situations like this.  They are few and far between and would not add that much to his Department's burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I should like to make is that the three-day waiting period should be abolished.  This is unnecessary and I can see no reason why if a person becomes unemployed the Department cannot make his just rights available to him towards the end of that week.  It has to be done in a fortnight's time or in three weeks' time anyway.  If there are any difficulties and if he was not entitled to the <Col N="1046" /> money then the amount paid out can be offset by the withdrawal of unemployment assistance rights.  I have spoken to officials in the Department of Social Welfare who feel that a streamlining of present regulations could remove this anomaly which exists in the Department's administration. I do not want to go into this in detail but just to mention it as something which I feel should be attended to.  It would not take much imagination to devise regulations which would be more acceptable and would meet the situation fairly.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Ryan in saying that we in Fine Gael accept this Supplementary Estimate and sincerely hope that the Minister will deal with some of the difficulties we have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say that quite recently we have given people in certain categories allowances now classified as free electricity, free transport and free travel.  Under Subhead K the Minister refers to £35,000 being spent on free electricity allowances, £74,000 on free radio and television licences and £21,000 on free travel.  I think we have reached a stage in civilisation where we should not take credit for providing services such as those.  We have a national transport system.  I have never seen a CIE bus going along a country road full to capacity but I have noticed buses on a wet day with one or two people on board going along a country road while an old age pensioner was walking perhaps two miles to the nearest post office to collect his pension.  In such circumstances no society should take credit for giving free transport.  It costs nothing. In fact, it is an injection of £21,000 into the coffers of CIE.  With respect, I would ask the Minister not to take credit for giving anyone&mdash;to use a country expression&mdash;a drink out of his own bottle.  These people are paying rates and taxes and CIE is being subsidised. We had the ludicrous situation in rural Ireland of a person who wanted to obtain a contributory or a non-contributory pension having to walk a half-mile, a mile or up to three miles weekly to the local post office to collect the pension.  Usually, these people were waiting for that day so <Col N="1047" /> that they could avail of the allowances due to them.  They were working on a budget counted in pennies.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate we have £21,000 being transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to CIE.  We take credit for that because this bus which passed with two people aboard can now take four people aboard.  The two old age pensioners who were walking can now travel on the bus.  The Minister should not take credit for that.  The bus was travelling there because these people and others like them contributed a fair share of taxes and rates to provide a State transport service.</P>
    <P>Next there is a sum of £35,000 provided for free electricity allowances. The cheapest thing we can produce is electricity.  It cost a substantial amount to get the service going but it costs nothing extra to produce more electricity. Here, again, we have the Minister taking credit for transferring from social welfare to the ESB this £35,000, the cost of providing electricity to those in need.  The most ridiculous figure, however, is the £74,000 for radio and television licences which cost nothing whatever to issue.  I suppose this amount would be more than covered if pirates, paying no licence fees, were made to pay them.  How ridiculous can we become?  Our sense of proportion is completely upset.  It is not good enough that a State Department should take credit for spending £130,000 under those three headings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister is anxious to get through this debate fairly quickly but even though the amount involved is reasonably small, £3,970,000 is still quite a sizeable sum and there are some comments I should like to make on this Supplementary Estimate.  First, I should like to say, as I have done on previous occasions, that I think the Department is well run.  The Minister and most of those employed there are very courteous in their dealings with the general public and with Members of the House. Usually it requires only a call, a phone message or a letter to get the problems straightened out.  But those problems arise fairly often.  Recently, when reading where an eminent churchman spoke <Col N="1048" /> about public representatives tending to claim credit for getting things for people to which they were entitled, I wished he would take the place of one of us for a while.  He would realise that quite a lot of our time is spent in contacting the Department and similar institutions where somebody who just does not know the job has, for one reason or other, not given the correct information or had not the correct information to make a claim.  These people are left without benefit for a considerable time and I can assure anybody who is interested that, far from claiming credit for getting things which people should be able to get for themselves, most public representatives do not want to spend their time getting things for people to which they are entitled but do not know how to claim.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things which bear comment here.  First of all the Minister slid over the fact that last week there were 3,000 more persons registered as unemployed than there were 12 months ago.  This of course is part of the reason why the extra money is needed.  It is too bad that unemployment seems to be growing despite all the promises we get of improved job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Again and again we have raised with the Minister and his predecessor the question of the widow who must go out to work and if she falls ill or is unemployed has her benefit reduced because she has a widow's pension.  She is paying the same amount as if she were a single girl and if she is paying at the same rate she should be paid at the same rate.  If the Department's idea is followed to its rational conclusion when she is working she should get only half as much as a single girl gets, which would be absolutely ludicrous.  The time has come when somebody who has a widow's pension and is entitled to unemployment or sickness benefit and becomes unemployed or ill should be entitled to draw the same benefit as her sister who is single.  Often her need is very much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing which must be changed is the system whereby somebody who has the number of stamps to qualify for unemployment benefit is <Col N="1049" /> debarred because it is estimated by some inspector of the Department that he has an income or could have an income of more than 10s per day from his farm or from some other source. The Minister must understand that at the present time 10s per day is a very small sum.  Recently I had a case of a man who had been working all his life.  He was obliged for a short period to work a farm which he had acquired from a relative.  One of his sons took over the farm and the man resumed work again.  When he became unemployed, although he qualified under every other heading he was adjudged as being not entitled to unemployment benefit because he might be able to make 10s a day from the farm which was in his name.  The fact that his son was operating the farm apparently had nothing to do with it.  This man had two or three children.  I had a case of another man with 15 children who was put in the very same position.  In each case the amount was the same&mdash;10s per day.  I do not know how that figure was fixed but it is due for review and I would ask the Minister to reduce it or wipe it out altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to do something about the man&mdash;or woman&mdash; who is working and becomes unemployed or ill and has dependent relatives living with him.  Even if they are adults, surely if they are dependent on the wage which the person brings in to live, when that person starts to draw social welfare benefit he should be entitled to some extra benefit for those dependants?</P>
    <P>There is the question of the person who returns home from insurable employment to look after an aged parent.  It appears that if a person returns from England this does not apply to him.  A case was brought to my notice of a daughter who came home and was told she was not entitled to benefit.  She then drew benefit for the 26 days to which she was entitled under the reciprocal agreement with Britain.  She was told again she was not entitled to the benefit for looking after her father.  She then applied for unemployment assistance but was told that as her stamps were in England she <Col N="1050" /> was not entitled to unemployment assistance either.  Was she supposed to stay here and look after her father and live on his old age pension?  The thing is just too ridiculous for words. Let us not give the impression we are doing something for people if in fact we have it ringed round with so many clauses that it is absolutely no use to them.  Many people who should in fact be drawing this benefit are not getting it.  We all know the necessity to have particularly a daughter at home to look after aged parents.  It would save the State and the local authority a lot of money to have old people living at home and not going into old folks' homes.  This should be taken into consideration. It would be a saving to the State and the local authority.</P>
    <P>Another case I came across recently was where somebody who was ill was drawing sickness benefit.  He had previously been working in England and as a result of his English stamps he qualified for disability benefit here. He had to go to England for a couple of weeks and did not draw disability benefit there.  He was disqualified from drawing benefit here and the only way he could go back on benefit was if he could succeed in getting disability benefit for the period he was in England. It is too ridiculous for words. Benefit should be paid to people who are entitled to it and who need it. Otherwise they would not ask for it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the failure to stamp cards.  I had three cases where employers stated they had stamped cards and the Department said they did not receive them.  In two of the cases it was found that the cards had been stamped and in the third case the employer was obviously not telling the truth.  One of the things I cannot understand is why, if somebody applies for benefit and is adjudged not entitled to benefit because the employer did not stamp the card, it is necessary to wait months before the matter is dealt with.  Why should the Department not immediately inform the person concerned, not in some stereotyped form which he may find it difficult to understand, but in a simple letter: &ldquo;Your insurance card has not been received here.  You should <Col N="1051" /> approach your employer&rdquo; or words to that effect?  Sending them a circular which to many people does not mean a darn thing is not the way to deal with this.  It is something which has probably been handed down from one set off officials to the next.</P>
    <P>I said last year and I repeat now that a review of the type of circulars being issued from the Department of Social Welfare is long overdue.  Possibly they got a couple of million of them printed some years ago and are waiting to use up the last of them.  The sooner they are used up the better because the Minister will admit that these circulars, even though we know what they are supposed to mean, are often extraordinarily difficult to understand. A man came to me recently in a terrible panic about his occupational injuries.  He had made a settlement with his employer.  He was being paid £4 10s a week.  He got a circular to say he was not entitled to any more disability benefit though in fact he was entitled to disability benefit all the time.  However, he did get his £4 12s 6d eventually and I suppose that is what matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit the three days' waiting period has gone beyond a joke.  The Minister must admit that at the present time if a person falls ill, particularly a person who has been working all his life and for the first time becomes a charge on the State for a short period, it is a great hardship to be told he cannot get any benefit for three days. For those who are living on low wages and who require their social welfare benefit fairly quickly, to find they get only a half week's money for the first week means in many cases that not only the person who applies but his family will have to go on short rations until such time as the benefit is received and they are able to pay their way.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  I have great respect for the Department for the manner in which they deal with many matters but I resent very much something which I could never understand <Col N="1052" /> until it was explained to me recently by a retired official of the Department. This relates not to my constituency but to another constituency in which there was a Minister of State.  Any time I have made representations which have proved successful I have said to the Department not to bother getting in touch with me unless there was something wrong.  What I complain of is that if there is a Minister of State in a constituency he has to be notified before the Deputy who made the representation and before notice is sent out to the person concerned.  A case arose some weeks ago which concerned the return of a pension book to an old age pensioner.  The old age pensioner had to wait for many weeks because the Minister could not get around to looking at the case.  It was in his constituency and therefore he felt he had the right to be the first to be notified although he had done nothing at all for the person concerned.</P>
    <P>That is something that should not continue.  I am not making an issue of this; it does not happen in my constituency; it happened some years ago but it does not happen now.  I have no complaint in the matter although one of my colleagues is a Minister.  It is wrong that somebody should be left waiting so long for a pension book because some Minister wanted to know about it.  I asked that the matter should not be confirmed to me, and it was only when the poor old man wrote to me several weeks afterwards to say that he had not got his pension that the matter came up again and, as I said, a retired official of the Department informed me of exactly what happened.</P>
    <P>Occasionally it happens that when a pension book is being changed the arrears due to a person may not be paid.  Sometimes it may be only a matter of shillings but other times it may be £10 or £20 that is due.  Would the Minister say if this is due to shortage of staff?  Is it true that the Department, like all Civil Service offices, are recruiting very young people who have just passed the leaving certificate examination, because the rates being paid are very low?  Is it because they cannot get staff who could deal with these matters as they were dealt with a few years ago?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> Another thing which rather annoys many of us is that if we phone the Department of Social Welfare we find it hard to get through to them.  I know they are very busy and it is not the fault of the telephonists, but the number is engaged for about three-quarters of the time.  If one wants an answer to a query in a hurry this is not very satisfactory.  Is there a shortage of telephonists or phones?  Is there some reason why the position has deteriorated badly over the past few years?  As I said at the outset, the officials of the Department are courtesy itself, but if one cannot get through to them on the phone it can cause great inconvenience.</P>
    <P>With regard to free transport and free electricity, I do not agree with Deputy Harte in some of what he said. We should give credit to anybody who is responsible for thinking up this idea. However, I do agree with him in what he said about the book-keeping transaction. The old age pensioners may not use the buses at peak periods, so at other times if one or two old age pensioners use the transport service it will not make any difference to the cost of providing it.  If CIE insist on getting £25,000 extra, it simply means a switch of the subsidy that is given to CIE anyway, and in putting it down under this heading somebody is just taking a chance.</P>
    <P>The figure for free electricity is a figure which can be calculated, although £35,000 does appear to be a very large amount.  This service is very much appreciated by the old people, and many of them scraped together the few pounds necessary to get their homes wired for electricity when they found they could get a certain supply without paying for it.</P>
    <P>Again I am astonished at the figure of £74,000 for TV and radio licences. It does not seem possible that there are so many old age pensioners who have nobody living with them who would qualify for this.  Again it seems as if somebody conjured up a figure and said: &ldquo;OK.  This is the figure we shall give.&rdquo;  It must be something like that, because if there are £74,000 worth of licences issued to old age pensioners <Col N="1054" /> living on their own, then there must be a colossal sum received for radio and television licences all over the country.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions to have unemployment assistance substituted for unemployment benefit when the latter is no longer payable.  At the moment when the disability benefit is no longer payable the person concerned can go anywhere he likes; there is no benefit being paid from Social Welfare.  Could the Department of Social Welfare not introduce a disability assistance section which would give the same kind of assistance as Deputy Harte referred to as the dole, to the limited number of persons who have less than 156 stamps, who are drawing disability benefit and who because of the shortage of stamps are ineligible for further benefit?  Would the Minister consider having a look at this?  He told me before that he would.  He must have forgotten about it because I have not heard anything further about it.</P>
    <P>One final point I want to raise is as to the way investigations are carried out in respect of old age pension applicants and people like that.  If somebody applies for a non-contributory pension, whether he is eligible or not, there should be a direct query made to find out whether or not he is entitled to a full contributory old age pension. I have found many cases where people who for years were drawing non-contributory pensions were in fact entitled to contributory pensions.  Nobody took the trouble to inform them, and so they were left without the money to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>The SW4 booklet which is brought up to date pretty often does a very good job.  It is a pity it is not publicised more or made available to more people.  It would save public representatives a lot of trouble, because many of the questions we are asked are answered in SW4.</P>

      <P>Reliable figures for the consumption of anthracite on the home market are not available, but figures for consumption and net stock changes combined can be derived from data on domestic production and external trade.  Figures for the quantity and value of home production are obtained in the annual Censuses of Industrial Production while figures for the quantity produced are obtained in the Quarterly Industrial Production Inquiry.  Production of anthracite in 1967 amounted to 110,900 tons, valued at £681,900 and in 1968 production, as returned in the Quarterly Inquiry, was 105,500 tons. The value of this production is not available.</P>
      <P>Consumption and net stock changes, which can be taken as imports plus home production minus exports, was 172,600 tons in 1967 and 173,500 tons in 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsidy covering the full cost of transport of ground limestone from the quarry to the farmer's premises is paid under the ground limestone transport subsidy scheme.  Application of ground limestone also reckons for grant under the Land Project Mountain Grazings (Supplementary Keep) Scheme, under which improved grants were recently introduced.  As these subsidies offer worthwhile inducement to farmers to apply lime to suitable mountain-type lands I would not propose introducing a further subsidy at this stage.</P>
      <P>I understand that machinery for the spreading of lime on hill and on mountain-type lands is available through normal trade channels but, of course, such factors as firmness, evenness and slope of the ground will affect performance of the machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the decline in the number of sheep, would the Minister consider reviving for review the project which I initiated but never carried to completion of spreading lime and phosphates by the aerial method employed in New Zealand? When I had the matter under consideration I was frustrated by the existence of commonages on the mountains, and you could not fix any liability on anybody.  I think possibly it is a matter of time, and that perhaps the situation will become simplified in view of the Minister's scheme for mountain fencing.  I wonder would the Minister, in the light of the development that has taken place in the past 20 years, reopen the question and reexamine it, as I believe the grazing for sheep, particularly on the Donegal and Kerry mountains, would be vastly improved thereby?</P>

      <P>I am quite interested in this same aspect.  I have not really got any satisfactory work-out of it and, whether there is such a satisfactory work-out so far as our circumstances are concerned, I do not really know. The new factor that has entered into it, perhaps, since the time the Deputy would have been concerning himself with it is that apparently some new land machines have been developed that are suitable which were not available <Col N="1068" /> at that time.  I am not saying that that is a write-off of the aerial idea.  I am interested in that one, and I would hope to find whether in fact it can be applied usefully in the light of the development of the land spreading machines which are now more suitable to the hill and mountain spreading than what was available in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 29 together.</P>
      <P>In the seven years up to and including 1968 building societies lent about £50,000,00 to help people to buy or build their houses.  Last year they lent £10,200,000 for this purpose, or more than half of all the money lent by the principal lending agencies for house purchase.  Their current surplus or &ldquo;profit&rdquo; on their operations goes to build up their reserves.</P>
      <P>Societies raise practically all of their money from the public.  To do this they must pay a rate of interest competitive with that offered by other bodies.</P>
      <P>If societies do not pay competitive interest rates people who have lent them money will take it back and invest it at the higher rates obtainable elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I think I should spell out the consequences of this.</P>
      <P>First, the societies could not lend for any more houses.  The building industry which, in 1968, employed an estimated 82,000 men, would be hit. Jobs and incomes throughout the economy would suffer.</P>
      <P>Again, the societies could not, as they have in recent years, provide one of the fastest growing sources of finance for the ever-increasing numbers of houses needed in our society.</P>
      <P>Finally, the confidence of people in the stability of the societies would be endangered by any indication that the societies may be subjected to such conditions that savings invested in them would not be safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> For these reasons, societies must be free to adjust their interest rates to investors upwards or downwards in accordance with market trends&mdash;which are governed largely by what is happening to interest rates not only in this country but throughout the world. Ministerial consent or sanction is not required to these adjustments, though as a matter of courtesy the societies notify me of their intentions.</P>
    <P>I have given special consideration to the position of existing borrowers which was examined in great detail in 1967 by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Societies borrow on terms which permit the lender to withdraw his money on demand or at short notice.  House-purchase loans are, however, made for terms of about 25 years.</P>
    <P>This means that all loans to borrowers made when interest rates were low must be maintained by the societies from money borrowed at current interest rates.  The result is that when interest rates rise, societies must carry heavy losses for these earlier loans&mdash;unless they revise the interest rate applicable to them.</P>
    <P>Bearing these considerations in mind, most societies include, and most borrowers accept, a provision in their mortgages allowing the society to vary the interest rate.  If they did not do this, interest rates on new mortgages would have to be increased well above the existing level.</P>
    <P>This would mean that people buying houses now or in the future would be subsidising those who bought their houses at cheaper prices or lower interest rates in the past and who may stand to gain substantially by the increase over the years in the value of their houses.</P>
    <P>While I have the greatest sympathy with those persons who may be called upon to pay higher interest rates now, in accordance with the terms on which they accepted their loans, the Government must use available public finance to increase the supply of housing and to help persons now without decent accommodation to acquire it.  To take any other course would directly affect the housing programme and retard the <Col N="1076" /> Government's efforts to provide proper accommodation for all persons requiring it.  The total amounts expended from central and local authority funds for housing have grown from £16,300,000 in 1961-62 to an estimated £41,600,000 in the current financial year.  The extra amount which a person required to pay an increase of one per cent in his loan repayments would have to pay would come to approximately 3s. a week for each £1,000 of his loan.  For persons paying a ½ per cent extra the increase would be 1s. 6d. a week approximately for each £1,000 of his loan.  Most persons paying increased interest will, of course, be eligible for tax relief.</P>
    <P>I should add that following the recent rearrangement of functions, I intend to invite representatives of the societies to a discussion on general questions affecting finance for house purchase as soon as certain preliminary investigations I have in hand are completed.</P>
    <P>In so far as loans from the Local Loans Fund are concerned, I would refer Deputies to the reply today by the Minister for Finance to Question No. 55.  The fixing of the rate of interest on house-purchase loans to individual borrowers is a matter for each local authority.  Under the provisions operative from 1st October, 1964, farmers, and certain other persons in rural areas, building a house may qualify for grants of up to £920. For other persons the grants may amount to up to £570.  At current interest rates, these grants are equivalent to a subsidy of about £87 and £54 a year for 35 years to a person providing a house for himself.  In addition, rate remission, a specially reduced rate of stamp duty and, in some cases, a site subsidy of up to £150 are applicable.  It is not proposed at present to vary these subsidies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minisig <Col N="1081" /> ster for Justice if in view of the proposal to impose a 60 miles per hour speed limit he will ensure that in the interests of economy the present Ministerial cars are replaced by smaller cars which would be quite adequate for travelling within this speed limit, as such cars would be cheaper to run, would command a good resale price and would not have to be replaced more often than the present cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of a speed limit is not a factor of any great importance in the determination of the suitability of cars for Ministerial use.</P>
      <P>The technical advice tendered to me by the Garda authorities who service the cars is that the type of car now in use fulfils the purposes for which it was purchased, effectively and economically, in comparison with other makes of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, while these cars may not be subject to speed limits, that Ministers in this, as in other matters which are very much in prominence at the moment, should give an example?

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a car with a medium horsepower would amply fulfil the work which a Minister would be called upon to perform, that it would last the prescribed period of time and would have a better resale value and that in the interests of the economy it would be a good example for the Ministers to have them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who advise me and who are in a position to judge the matter would not agree with the Deputy.  They say that six-cylinder cars are needed for this type of work and also for Garda work.  If you had small cars they would have to be overhauled after a much shorter mileage, their depreciation value would be far greater and they would be far less economic than six-cylinder cars which do 75,000 to 100,000 miles without an overhaul and are in good condition and fetch <Col N="1082" /> good prices as secondhand cars.  I am advised, as far as the economics of this is concerned, that these cars for the purpose for which they have been purchased are, in contradistinction to what the Deputy suggests, much more economic than purchasing small cars which have to be replaced and overhauled much earlier and more frequently and would depreciate more than the bigger cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement in regard to the operation of the Heinz-Erin joint venture since it commenced in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Heinz-Erin commenced trading in Britain in October, 1967.  Initially it launched a range of catering vegetables and recipe products. Sales are at present running at a rate of approximately £1,000,000 per annum.  Sales in the first year achieved break-even and it is expected that there should be a small profit in catering products in the coming year.  The success of Heinz-Erin with catering products has been of considerable benefit to Erin Foods because it has meant increased throughput for the company at prices which allow for the recovery of direct costs and factory overheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1968, Heinz-Erin extended into the retail market in Britain.  In October a range of convenience meals was launched.  Like all other Heinz-Erin products, they are produced by Erin Foods in Ireland.  Convenience meals are showing every sign that they will be a considerable success.  They are at present on sale only on a regional basis but it is planned to launch them nationally very shortly.  Sales in the first year are expected to exceed £1,000,000.  The costs involved in <Col N="1089" /> launching a retail product in the UK are heavy.  Heinz-Erin will incur development expenses on the retail side initially, but these should be small in relation to the turnover achieved and the potential for future profit.</P>
    <P>Heinz-Erin's total sales for the coming year are anticipated to be approximately £2,500,000.  It is also hoped that a break-even situation will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The fact that Heinz-Erin has access to the selling, distribution and related facilities of H. J. Heinz Co. Ltd. has freed Erin Foods in the main part from the heavy overhead burden which would have to be undertaken if the company were marketing its product independently in the UK.</P>
    <P>When the Heinz-Erin agreement was concluded, the accumulated losses on the food project amounted to £6.55 million of which the loss in the previous year accounted for £1.6 million.  The Heinz-Erin operation has been largely responsible for the reduction in the current loss to an estimated £250,000 in 1968-69.  It has also resulted in a significant increase in horticultural activity in this country.  The acreages of vegetables grown for the Erin Foods project and the payments to growers during the past three years are as follows: 1966-67: 4,300 acres, £406,000; 1967-68: 6,100 acres, £585,000: 1968-69: 9,200 acres, £900,000.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if he is satisfied, in view of his statement to the Dáil on 5th April, 1967, that everything possible is being done to preserve the identity of Erin Foods in television and newspaper advertising especially in view of the fact that a recent <i>Sunday Times</i> business feature in a wide-ranging article on the activities of Heinz and its managing director described the joint venture as a merger, which is totally opposed to the information given to the House by the Minister?  Is the Minister satisfied that we are doing enough to keep these Irish firms, both the Irish Sugar Company and Erin Foods, clearly before the public as Irish, or are they being merged in the idea of Heinz?</P>

      <P>When the managing director of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods Ltd. resigns on 1st May, 1969, he will continue as an ordinary part-time director of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann but not of Erin Foods Ltd.  It is considered that the experience gained as managing director over the past two and a half years will enable him to make a valuable contribution to the work of the Board of CSET.  The company has no direct commercial relationship with Heinz and I am satisfied that his new appointment will not conflict in any way with his responsibilities as a director of CSET.</P>
      <P>A new chief executive is being appointed in each company.  These appointments are matters for the companies themselves, but I am informed that both appointees will be Irish.</P>

I have every confidence in the Board of both of these companies. There is no suggestion nor any danger that they might be taken over by foreign companies.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta that the question of transferring the computer from Thurles, in the interests of efficiency, had been under consideration for nine months both by the company and by outside consultants and that the final decision was taken by the Board of the company on 6th March.  The staff involved consists of three married men and 24 single men and girls; the company also employees over 800 other people in Thurles.  The decision was announced to the staff on 12 March, and each member was given the option of transfer to the office of the Thurles sugar factory without loss of salary or status.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the company that no hardship to staff will result from the decision to move the computer. Disturbance allowances, removal expenses and subsistence allowances will be paid in accordance with the company's usual practice.  In addition a compensation allowance will be paid to the staff on transfer to Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is a standard condition of employment of all permanent staff that while in the company's employment they will be required to work at whatever location the company may from time to time decide and to carry out the duties assigned to them by management. The company had explained that this condition is essential for efficiency in a large complex group like the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that no hardship will be caused to the workers and the families involved in the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether he was consulted before the decision was taken to remove the computer from Thurles or could he give any estimate of the loss to the Irish Sugar Company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not consulted and I would not normally be consulted <Col N="1094" /> in a matter of this sort.  The semi-State companies have freedom in their commercial operation.  They are expected to run their affairs efficiently and competently and decisions of this nature are taken by them without reference to me or to the Government.  It seems clear that all the examination of this matter which had been made by the company itself and by their consultants indicated that this was an essential step to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state whether he is satisfied that this decision was taken at the proper time? The fact is that apparently they have been working at a complete loss, according to the Minister, in Thurles and in view of the Government's decision to decentralise industries is it not a very wrong decision to take a potential industry from the south of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly I would prefer if the company did not have to take this decision but there will still be a very considerable number of their staff in Thurles.  There will be over 800 people left and only about 23 people are affected by this transfer.  We would all expect this company to operate efficiently and apparently it is essential for efficient operation for this computer to be in Dublin.  Both the Sugar Company and Erin Foods now have a very difficult marketing job to do and this computer apparently is part of their marketing operation and they were under a very severe handicap apparently in running their marketing operations efficiently by not having this computer in Dublin.  I am told they came to this conclusion with reluctance but it is one they could not avoid taking.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> and <b>Mr D.

      <P>I assume that the Deputies have in mind the recent decision of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta to move its computer centre from Thurles to Dublin.  I understand that the decision to transfer the centre to Dublin, which is the administrative and marketing centre of the CSET group, is essential in the interests of efficiency.  The decision was taken following an intensive study of the situation over a period of nine months both within the group and by outside consultants.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the computer to the Dublin headquarters will involve a staff of 22 out of a total of 832 persons employed by the CSET group in the Thurles area.  In view of the small number of staff involved and the need to bring the administrative units together in order to achieve maximum efficiency the decision taken by CSET cannot be regarded as being in conflict with Government policy on decentralisation. In fact, of a total work force of some 5,000 employed by the CSET group only 160 are in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest charged to borrowers from the Local Loans Fund is now 8½ per cent, having been increased to that rate from 7¾ per cent which was the rate up to 17 March, 1969.  This increase is due to the rise in interest rates generally which has led to an increase in the cost of the Exchequer borrowing necessary for the purpose of making these loans.  It is understood that local authorities who borrow from the Loan Loans Fund for the purpose of making loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts charge an additional ½ per cent to cover their administrative costs thus making their charge to borrowers the 9 per cent referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Since the enactment of the British National Trust Act, 1907, which was sponsored as a Private Members' Bill, the position of companies has been greatly strengthened by a series of Acts which have been consolidated in the Companies Act, 1963. An Taisce as a company incorporated under this Act has, under its memorandum of association, very extensive powers in relation to the acquisition, preservation and management of property.  These powers can, if necessary, be extended by appropriate amendments of the memorandum of association.  There is no apparent necessity, therefore, for special legislation in relation to An Taisce.</P>

      <P>Sir, in the past ten minutes we have listened to charges and countercharges across the floor of this House.  I shall not address myself to any of these charges and countercharges since I was not present during the scene that took place last Thursday. But Deputy Tully, my colleague here, does not make charges lightly and, listening to his contribution on this Supplementary Estimate here today, I understood from a statement made by him that the Department of Social Welfare is engaged on a propaganda drive on behalf of Fianna Fáil through the medium of making files available to members of the Government and possibly TDs who have not made representations on the matters contained in the files.  In other words, representations made by their colleagues are handed over to Party agents&mdash;by &ldquo;Party agents&rdquo; I mean members of the Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;to help them to promote Fianna Fáil by underhand tactics.  Mark you, I had some idea that was happening.  I know it is happening so far as the Minister for Local Government, the man engaged in the last tussle, is concerned.  He has treated this House with contempt since he became a Minister.  There is nothing new in his activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> So far as Deputy Brennan, Minister for Social Welfare, is concerned, I am somewhat doubtful because I regard him as a man of integrity.  However, I have had some information in the recent past and I listened to Deputy Tully here today.  It is outrageous, if the allegation is correct, that public servants should be paid to hand over files to people who have nothing at all to do with them, people who have not been asked to make any representations whatsoever about the matters contained in the files.  I hope we will have from the Minister a detailed statement on this aspect of departmental activities.</P>

      <P>I want to be fair to everybody.  If I am asked, as a Deputy from West Cork, by John Murphy or Cormac Breslin to make representations on his behalf to the Department of Social Welfare, the representations and the fact that I have made them should not be made known through the Government agent in that constituency.  That is what I want to guard against.  It is no harm to make these statements here in the presence of the responsible Minister in order to give him an opportunity of saying whether or not there is any foundation for the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on that score, so far as representations in relation to old age pensions are concerned, is it true that <Col N="1105" /> some Deputies have access to the appeals officer while others have not? That is a simple question.  I will leave it to the Minister to answer it.  Is there discrimination?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why a Deputy should be precluded from calling on the appeals officer.  In the main the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare is to make available sums of money to people who are old, incapacitated, unemployed and so on.  Everyone agrees that there is an obligation on the Department of Social Welfare to provide&mdash;to provide, indeed, in a more liberal manner&mdash;for such categories of our people.  Since I became a Member of this House I have made the case here that the Department of Social Welfare should have other duties as well as handing out benefits.  It should endeavour to create and contribute towards the creation of employment for those to whom they pay benefits. We have a relatively small population &mdash;2.8 million&mdash;in a small country stretching from Malin Head in Donegal to Mizen Head in Cork.  The population is less by many millions than the population of medium-sized cities on the Continent of Europe.  Why should it be necessary to have in the Book of Estimates a sum of almost £10 million, plus the amount in this Supplementary Estimate, to pay unemployment benefit to recipients?  I have said time and time again that there is no proper co-ordination between the different Departments of State.  We have a provision of £9,775,000, plus the amount in the Supplementary Estimate, for unemployment recipients this year. At the same time we are besieged by local bodies and by local development associations to have development works carried out in different areas.  Is it not peculiar that, on the one hand, we <Col N="1106" /> pay unemployment benefit to ablebodied men, the vast majority of whom would prefer to be working and earning their money rather than going to the exchange signing for it while, at the same time, there is work waiting to be done all over the country?  Surely there should be some co-ordination of effort?  I maintain that money paid by way of unemployment benefit carries with it the obligation not to work. Why should that be?  Why not try to help other Departments, such as the Department of Industry and Commerce, to establish industries in areas in which benefit is being paid, in which it must be paid because of lack of employment. Why not, instead of handing out the money completely free of obligation other than that one must not work, channel the money by way of subvention towards the establishment of industries, which, no matter how small, would be likely in the course of time to stand on their own feet?  Would that not be a better way to spend this sizeable sum?  I do not want to be misinterpreted in my remarks.  I have made these remarks at the church gates in Cork as well as here in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>We have Departments existing as if no other Department existed.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is supposed to be the Department with an obligation to promote industrial development.  Did it ever strike the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say to the Minister for Social Welfare: &ldquo;Look here, my colleague, you are paying £x in this area to people under the heading of unemployment benefit and under the heading of unemployment assistance.  I wonder if we got that money could we get any little industry going that would give these people employment instead of having them travelling to the exchange or to the police barracks, signing for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Did it ever strike the Minister for Lands when he reduced the Estimate for his Department to such an extent that in my own constituency 20 to 25 per cent of the workers in the forestry scheme are to become redundant within the next few months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They would far prefer if those moneys were utilised to provide some kind of productive employment or to establish small industries.</P>

      <P>I am on the Estimate for Social Welfare.  Unemployment benefit is part of the Estimate for Social Welfare.  It is set down here on page 198 of the Book of Estimates. I am on the Estimate for Social Welfare.  It is regrettable, indeed, that in this relatively small country with a proportionately small population, in the year 1969, with so much productive employment all round us, whether in cities or towns, with houses to be built, sewerage schemes to be provided, land to be drained, roads to be repaired&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indicating that this Government which have been in office for 13 consecutive years are so incompetent&mdash;and I must assume the people who are advising them are likewise incompetent&mdash;that we have this position that the Minister for Social Welfare has to come to the Dáil and ask, among other things, for an extra vote for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  In my view, if we had a competent Government in power&mdash;as we should have and I hope we will have in the not too distant future&mdash;that position would not arise and we would not have to vote and ask our citizens to contribute more than £10 million for unemployment benefit payments and almost £4 million for unemployment assistance payments.  That is my view today and it was my view when I came into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to state as a rural Deputy&mdash; and I am sure the same applies to urban areas&mdash;that more than 97 per cent of our Irish boys and girls do not want anything to do with unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance but, by virtue of Government <Col N="1111" /> policy, they are forced to have recourse to it with the greatest reluctance. That is something all Members of the House should address themselves to.  You can fancy in County Donegal a man with a wife and two or three children, or a single man, having to go to the exchange and sign on this for money and, at the same time, all round him there are roads to be improved, forestry plantations to be planted or some other useful productive work which would be helpful to the nation and helpful to the economy if carried out.</P>
    <P>What I am claiming now on this Supplementary Estimate, as it will be some time before we will have the major Estimate, is that the Minister &mdash;and I think he would get the commendation of all our people&mdash;should change the present system, and change the present procedure.  He should go to the other Minister and say: &ldquo;Look here, I am paying so much money to people who are able to work and who are quite willing and able to work if the work is provided, and I wonder, gentlemen, would any of you have any useful and productive schemes to make employment available for these people, rather than having them unemployed and going along to the exchanges?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is something I feel very strongly about.  Cork County Council as the local authority, an employing body, will lay off, as happened, six men on a Friday night.  Money will be available from the Department of Social Welfare to pay to them and, in some cases, that money will be equal to their wage rates, particularly in the case of married men with families.  There are other jobs to be carried out by other Departments, by Finance, in forestry, by the Department of Local Government, in water, sewerage and housing works.</P>
    <P>In a country where there is so much work to be done it is disgraceful that so many men are unemployed because of lack of funds.  We have men idle and redundant because, we are told, there is no money available.  Would not this £10 million help to establish industries and give employment in the western counties?  It would help to <Col N="1112" /> keep our boys and girls who have to emigrate to England and America at home.  Money can be found for this purpose but no money can be found by the Department of Local Government and other Departments to find employment.  When I mentioned this earlier the Ceann Comhairle ruled that it was irrelevant but the time has come to take some action on this question. I want to repeat again and again, that I am completely against the position obtaining in this country in 1969 where we have £14 million paid out under this heading.  I am all in favour of giving money to the old, to the mentally and physically handicapped, to those who cannot find work because of incapacity but it is ridiculous in this year of 1969 to be giving money to able bodied men because we cannot provide enough employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, but there is so much useful work to be carried out that if we had proper organisation on top and better liaison between Departments of State the need for having so many of our people unemployed would not arise and neither would the need for such a huge vote from the State to provide unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  Irish people do not like having to avail of unemployment benefit.  Our people were brought up in a tradition of work.  We know how hard they had to work in the past and we know that they would much prefer to be helping to improve a road, to provide a waterway or to build a house than to be going to the employment exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question I want to deal with is that part of the Supplementary Estimate dealing with old age pensions. I am well aware of the difficulties of people existing solely on the pension. I know that while the means test is applied generally many old age pensioners live with their relatives in reasonably affluent circumstances and in these cases the pension may not be <Col N="1113" /> of supreme importance to them.  I know the problem of formulating legislation to deal with these different matters.  I can appreciate the difficulty of giving a higher pension to a person living alone or who is incapacitated and giving a lower pension to a person who is active and able to look after himself or herself.  To deal with those problems the health authorities should come in and level off where the State is unable to devise means of getting around these problems.</P>
    <P>I want to say this to the Minister&mdash; I have said it before and it is not a question of political kudos for the Labour Party, it is a simple appraisal of facts&mdash;that this country is the only one in Europe that has not changed the qualifications for the retirement allowance. We have had old age pensions since 1908, almost 62 years, and there has been no change in the qualifying age.  It is time that the age limit should be changed.  I am well aware that it would cost money to do so but I also feel that it would not cost the amount we would be told it would cost if we put down a question on the matter to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We all know that a large percentage of the money paid to pensioners finds its way back to the State through taxation.  A man draws his pension and gets a pint and out of that the State gets 1/4d plus 2½ per cent turnover tax. On the purchase of other goods which are highly taxed, such as other drinks, cigarettes and tobacco a great deal of the money finds its way back to the State.  When the old age pensioner buys tea, sugar, bread and butter, which are all taxable, part of his pension finds its way back to the State.</P>
    <P>Possibly there would be an answer to this problem if we had the position that all people had to wait for the pension until they were 70 years of age but that is not the case.  Some people qualify for pensions much earlier than 70 years.  All our professional people, our public employees, qualify for pensions at 65 years but the man who does not qualify at 65, the man who has to wait until he is 70 is the man who has to be out in the wind and the weather.  These are the people, the people with the much tougher jobs, who have to wait until they are 70 and <Col N="1114" /> then face a rigid means test to qualify for the allowance.  Unless they have no means or have no house they will not qualify for the full pension of £3 5s per week.</P>
    <P>Is it not time such outlandish regulations were changed?  Is is not time the regulations were changed whereby a man owning any house, no matter how poor or small it is, deemed to be worth more than £25&mdash;imagine such a house in 1969&mdash;is not entitled to the £3 5s weekly according to the regulations of the Fianna Fáil Government which are implemented through their Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Joseph Brennan?  It is very difficult to get that across to old people.  Picture an old bedridden woman in her little hovel.  Unless the pensions officer asserts that that hovel is of a value less than £25, she cannot get £3 5s weekly.  I come now to the question of the introduction of the pension at 65 years.  Undoubtedly, it would impose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall slip over this.  I have in mind that additional taxation would be required.  The Labour Party will always support additional taxation which we deem justified for useful and productive measures. I am well aware that money does not fall from heaven but must come from the pockets of our people.  I want to ensure, however, that the poor devil who is working on the road or on the farm or who is struggling for a livelihood in a small shop will have a chance of sitting back at 65 years of age just the same as the fellow who is doing reasonably well all his life and who will get not only his pension at 65 but a gratuity of 1½ years' salary&mdash; and in some cases before reaching that age at all.  We want to do what our Constitution spells out: we want to cherish all our people equally.  If this were put into operation it would mean that more employment would be available because more people would be leaving their jobs and farmers and shopkeepers would be leaving their farms and businesses five years earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get it across to the members of the Government that there is discrimination in our community in the giving of pensions and that that discrimination should be removed.  I am aware of the difficulties.  Our Party are prepared to support the legislation and the taxation that will necessarily ensue.  When all aspects are taken into account, the amount involved will be found to be not nearly as high as the Minister would allege.  Some sections of our community are very well favoured and it is time to bring up the other sections into line.  I remember that when this pension was first given these people were termed &ldquo;septuagenarian paupers&rdquo;. Our old people are esteemed now.  The majority are not subjected to such out of date terms. We regard them as our senior citizens and we all hope to live long enough to be in that age group one day.  In all the years, we have not changed the limit: it is some time now since I mentioned this point.  I understood from a statement by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy J. Brennan, some 15 or 18 months ago, that some immediate action was to be taken.  We have waited now in order to give the Minister a chance and he has certainly had sufficient time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of old age pensioners, I should like to refer to the assessment of means.  I realise that the social welfare officers must do the job they are paid to do.  There are certain standard regulations and it is their duty to follow them as fairly and as impartially as possible.  Some of them measure up to our standards: they are fair, just and impartial.  I cannot understand, however, why some social welfare officers assume that every old person in this country who applies for a pension is <Col N="1116" /> dishonest.  Do we not ask every week in this Chamber to let people of 70 years hand over their means to their families so that the young people can get married and make a living for themselves?  Why, then, should old people applying for a pension in such circumstances be considered dishonest? It is disgraceful and outrageous that a person who has saved maybe £2,000 over a period of 50 years of struggle and hard work and then gives a certain amount of it to his son and a certain amount of it to his daughter, and so on, is considered dishonest if he then applies for a pension.  Such a social welfare officer should be given another job.</P>
    <P>I have seen people who made over money to their family in good faith. Could it not be said that almost every one of our people of more than 70 years of age is suffering from incapacity of some kind or another?  It is indeed distressing when the pensions officer says to the type of person I have been talking about: &ldquo;No, you did that in order to get the pension&rdquo;.  Why can we not have the same system that operates in relation to a farm so that, once it is handed over and properly assigned, the matter is accepted without further question?  Our senior citizens are honest people with a religious tradition and it is unlikely that, in the winter of their days, they would try to obtain money under false pretences. I resent very much a social welfare officer saying to an old woman, in effect: &ldquo;You are not honest&rdquo;.  If the circumstances warrant it, well and good.  I have already mentioned that several social welfare officers do a good job and are very conscientious and endeavour to help the applicants as much as possible and to give them justice.  I am emphasising this evening that money is holding several people back from their pension rights by virtue of the fact that it is being determined by the appeals officer here in Dublin that, for instance, John Murphy gave Mary, his daughter, a sum of money and gave his son, John, a sum of money for no reason other than to be able to qualify for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>Let us get out of this rut in which we have been for too long.  An appeals <Col N="1117" /> officer in Dublin who will uphold that kind of contention should find some other source of livelihood.  Instead of hindering and obstructing our people of 70 years of age from assigning any property they have to their families, let it be a farm, a shop or money, and letting the young man or woman take over, we should be encouraging and asking them to do so, thus giving our young people an opportunity to settle down in their own country and not having to emigrate as so many have had to do before them.  I regard this matter as one of great urgency.  I am very dissatisfied when I see it happening and I am justified in taking up the time of the House in dealing with this grievance.  Irrespective of what a particular social welfare officer may do, there is an obligation on the appeals officer to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how many decisions of the social welfare officer are changed.  Are appeals now just a formality, where a case comes to the appeals officer who leaves it on his desk for three or four months and then makes a decision similar to that of the social welfare officer?  That was not the case when I became a Member of this House.  Then we had a right to go to the appeals officer and discuss with him the pros and cons of each case, giving him our advice with regard to particular applicants.  Now only the favoured few can go.  When Fianna Fáil came into office a former Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, decided that this practice would be wrong and would probably give some advantage to Opposition Deputies and that, as far as doling out State benefits was concerned, it should be confined to Fianna Fáil members and Fianna Fáil agents only. This is something which should be rectified.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy elected by the people I am entitled, when an old age pensioner comes to me asking me to make representation on his behalf, to go to this man in Aras Mhic Diarmada and see him in his glass cage to discuss the case.  That was the position when we had democracy here as far as social welfare was concerned.  But this right of Deputies was filched from them by Dr. Ryan and was never given back except to the favoured few.  We find <Col N="1118" /> Fianna Fáil people writing to &ldquo;Dear Jack&rdquo; or to &ldquo;Dear Jim&rdquo; saying that they are going to review Mary Murphy's case because it is implied in her letter that she is a Fianna Fáil supporter and that they will help to couch the letter in favourable phraseology. Letters, of course, are framed differently to different Deputies.  After this discussion I will get a letter in cold terms but a member of Taca or a member of Fianna Fáil will receive a letter in nice flowery language.  &ldquo;Dear Liam, you were speaking to me about John Murphy and I will look into his case.  You may rest assured that I will do the best I can for him.&rdquo;  That is the type of letter they will receive but in other cases it will be &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mise le meas&rdquo; and that stuff.  These are matters which should be aired in this House.  If citizens qualify for pensions, then they should be entitled to them irrespective of which Government is in power.</P>
    <P>If this Department was functioning properly from the head down, which unfortunately it is not&mdash;and when I refer to the head I mean the Minister &mdash;there would be no need for anyone to come along to a TD or a county councillor or any other public representative asking him to make representations. There would be no need for Members of this House or of local authorities to trouble themselves making representations if we had a smoothly operating system of inquiry. I fail to see why any old person should have to ask anyone to intervene on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>In regard to the part of this Supplementary Estimate dealing with additional allowances for widows' pensions I should like to make a spceial plea on behalf of widows.  Where widows are entitled to contributory pensions they will get them and they do not have to undergo a means test; but a widow with a young family, who has a shop or some other property, may not be able to assign that property to a member of her family, if she were entitled to do so, because of their age. Not alone is she suffering from the handicap of having lost her husband but having lost his earnings, whether he was a farmer, shopkeeper or whatever vocation he followed of a noninsurable <Col N="1119" /> nature.  Special measures should be introduced to help such widows.  They are getting the full belt, if I might use the expression, of the regulations.  One can picture a widow with nine, ten, 12 or 13 cows on a farm, whose husband has died a relatively young man, and who has three or four young children.  The likelihood is that, because of her interest in the farm and because of the wretched means test she must undergo, she will get no pension or a very small pension.  We must change the regulations for widows in such a position.  We must help such people who have been unfortunate enough to lose their breadwinners and do not qualify for a pension under our contributory schemes or from other sources.  I do not see why this system cannot be changed during the current year, or next year, so that it would come into force on the 1st April.  The Parliamentary Secretary or any Member of the House will appreciate such people's difficulties in qualifying for pensions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the need for the Minister for Social Welfare to encourage local authorities to pay blind welfare allowances.  A small percentage of people in Cork have lost their sight and we have an obligation to such people to help them.  In regard to the Cork Health Authority, I would not give it any credit as far as paying blind welfare allowances is concerned, and I am only saying what I would say to the Authority itself.  I do not see the need for all these measurements in the case of blind people.  The maximum allowances we can give are relatively small.  We should be liberal in our approach to the blind and in applying the regulations governing the granting of allowances.</P>
    <P>The only other group to which I referred are those who are physically or mentally handicapped and, particularly, elderly, bedridden people.  I hope when introducing the general Estimate next year the Minister will have some good information for such sections of the people.  It was suggested to me that when people go beyond 80 they should get a supplementary allowance.  Only a relatively small portion of the population <Col N="1120" /> reach that age, and I throw out the suggestion so that it can be considered.</P>
    <P>I conclude by supporting the allowances involved in the Supplementary Estimate and agreed to by all Parties in the House.  I hope, so far as the moneys provided for unemployment benefit are concerned, a more useful method of expending that money will be found in the near future and that the new method will provide much needed employment of a productive nature for many people who are forced through Government policy to live on unemployment benefit or assistance at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention old age pensions and the means tests. There is more than one means test connected with these pensions.  The means tests could be more streamlined because, not only have we the test mentioned by the previous speaker, the £26 per year, but there is the further test which I think the Minister should abolish&mdash;the test introduced during the credit squeeze of 1965, or perhaps the following year, when the increase given then was made conditional on whether the applicant had means or had not.  It transpired in the administration of this increase that, if the applicant had even 1/- a year income, the 5/- increase was not granted.  There is, therefore, a category of old age pensioners at present who are caught by this provision. It is time that the Minister abolished it.</P>
      <P>You can take the example of an old age pensioner living in a council cottage.  If it is a vested cottage, although the pensioner does not in the strict sense own it, the tenancy debars him or her from getting the full old age pension.  If the son were the vested owner, or any other member of the family, and the old age pensioner lived in the cottage he would, although his means was no different from that in the other case, get the full amount.  This is a niggling regulation which should be abolished as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to mention a point dealt with in recent legislation.  That is the allowance paid to old age pensioners where a daughter or step-daughter leaves employment and resides with the old person, because of his age or <Col N="1121" /> infirmity, in order to look after him. The regulation is that, if they have three years' social welfare contributions in employment, then a payment of £2 5s extra is allowed to the old age pensioner concerned.  Unfortunately, as I have discovered, this does not apply to daughters wo have worked in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  Very frequently such girls come home to look after the father or mother, or both, who are old age pensioners and they thus lose their wages.  Such girls should get the same treatment as daughters who have been working at home and give up their employment to look after the old people.  Irrespective of where the Irish girl has worked, if she has given up work to look after her father or mother or both, the special allowance of £2 5s should be payable in respect of that daughter or step-daughter.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister some time ago indicated that the question of payment of old age pension at 65 is being considered.  As a result of the consideration, which I hope will be favourable, I trust this will be done.</P>
    <P>In referring to means the previous speaker criticised the Department in regard to old age pensions where a person, on reaching the age of 70, distributes his wealth and is refused the old age pension.  Deputy Murphy did not indicate how far this should go or if there should be any limit to it.  If a person of unlimited means distributes his wealth and applies for an old age pension at the age of 70, should he get it?  In giving it to him should other people who are more entitled to it and more deserving be paid so much less?  It is all very well to advocate that those who distribute their means among their families should be considered, but not everyone who does this should be considered.  There are people who have reached 70 and who may wish to distribute their wealth but they should be, by no means, granted a non-contributory old age pension which is rightly reserved for those who need it. There is a very strong case to be made that the amount of money being paid by the Department of Social Welfare in children's allowances should not be given to those who have unlimited wealth, as is being done at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> I can see the logic of Deputy Murphy's suggestion about the unemployment assistance and benefit which are benefits paid when work is not available but I cannot see the logic of saying: &ldquo;Take this money away and establish with it industries which will give employment to the people concerned&rdquo;.  This is absolutely unrealistic and is not facing facts. Surely the amount of money being paid to any individual in unemployment benefit or assistance will not create a job?  It is estimated that in order to create a job many thousands of pounds are involved.  It is not looking at hard facts for a Deputy to say that it is just as simple as this: there are so many people unemployed who are receiving either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit; all you have to do is take this money from them and with it establish jobs to employ these people. The creation of one job may cost £40,000 or £50,000.  This money which is paid to an unemployed person would certainly not go any distance towards this.  There is no point in trying to create a fear in the minds of those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed that any Party in this House would compel them to do work which may not be economically paid or which may not give a return for a decent day's work.  There are countries where people are put to work whether they like it or not, whether the work suits them or not or whether it is productive or not.  We do not want to be in that category.  Deputy Murphy was not realistic in the very fine picture he painted of what could be done if this money were utilised to establish industries and to do other things.</P>
    <P>In regard to people receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, there is provision in the case of married people who have families for children up to the age of 16 years. In many cases there are handicapped people in the family; they may be 17 or 18 years of age but are not able to work.  I feel they should be treated on the same basis as children of school-going age.  This is something that we in Donegal have done in respect of cottage rents.  As well as allowing for children up to the age of 16, we have allowed for physically and mentally <Col N="1123" /> handicapped members of the family who are over 16.  I would suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that it is only right that this should be done.  It would be a help and the extra payments are just as necessary in respect of a mentally or physically handicapped boy or girl as they are for the school-going children under 16 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring a few points to the Minister's notice.  One concerns sickness benefit.  Only last week I had to get in touch with the Department on behalf of a married man with a family who applied for benefit on 18th February, 1969.  He was confined to a Dublin hospital for a few weeks and then came home for a few weeks.  His wife called to the exchange several times for benefit but no benefit came down for him.  He had returned to work before he got it a month later.  That is not a proper system.  I appreciate that the various benefits have been increased but I think there should be a better system devised.  Where people are sending in their certificates every week they should be paid their benefit every week.  It is not fair to a married man with a family to have to wait so long for benefit. There is no reason why a better system should not be evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had another case where a man applied for benefit on October 13th last.  This man was in England in the year 1967 and had his card stamped over there for the greater portion of that year.  I got in touch with the officials of the Minister's Department and they did their utmost for me.  They have written on numerous occasions to the British Ministry of Pensions.  At first they said his date of birth was not the same as what they had.  A birth certificate was sent on but the case is not yet finished.  The man is over his illness now but he was out of work for three or four months without getting any benefit.  Eventually he applied to the county council for home assistance and the most he could receive from them was £1 a week because the Department do not refund home assistance paid by the county council <Col N="1124" /> while a man is waiting to get benefit from the Department.  There should be better communication between the British Ministry of Pensions and our Department of Social Welfare.  The officials told me they had written and had got no reply.  I phoned again and got the same reply.  Eventually I had to put down a question to the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is on today's Order Paper but was not reached today.  The Minister and the principal officials of his Department should arrange for better communication between the British Ministry of Pensions and the Department.  If there are reciprocal arrangements there they should be made to work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham raised a point about the 5/- increase in old age pensions for those with no means whatever.  This increase was only given if a pensioner applied for it.  I had a case where a man applied for it and was granted it but he was very aggrieved that he did not get arrears from the time the increase was introduced. I feel any pensioner who applies should get the arrears from the time the increase was granted.  This man was so incensed that he wrote to me asking when the Minister announced this increase and other questions.  To satisfy him I wrote to the Secretary of the Department and I wrote &ldquo;Old Age Pensions Section&rdquo; on the envelope.  I just got an acknowledgment. I think I was entitled to a little more than that if only to satisfy that man that he was not entitled to this increase except from the date of his application.  It is most unfair that an old age pensioner without means should not get the arrears from the time the increase was brought in.  I would ask the Minister to refund these arrears to these people.  This was a travelling man with no means and he did not know about this regulation the Minister brought in.  I think people like that should get the 5/- from the date it was introduced.  He did get eight weeks arrears, that is from the date he applied.  I felt I should have got a decent letter from the Department replying to the various questions this man had sent to me which I forwarded to the Department with a covering letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House by making a lengthy speech on this Estimate.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Michael Pat Murphy on covering the whole field of social welfare so comprehensively. Everything he has said is true.  The suggestion that there should be a certain amount of co-ordination between Departments is a wise one.  It might not be wise, as the last Fianna Fáil speaker has said, in the short-term, but it would be in the long-term.  I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare and other Members of the Cabinet have a part to play in ensuring that jobs will be arranged in different areas, probably at different times, in order to remove the necessity for paying unemployment assistance to a number of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as I can remember, no substantial increases have been given to social services recipients.  If there is one factor that has contributed more than anything else to the retention of Partition it has been our inability to give social welfare benefits approximating to those obtainable across the Border.  The Labour Party will at all times support any suggestion of an increase in social welfare benefits. Everybody in this House can be certain that any Irish Catholic north of the border who is dependent on social welfare will vote Unionist in any election in the North, and we must agree that that man is right because otherwise he will be cutting a stick to beat himself.  We cannot expect him to vote Nationalist or to vote Republican or to vote something that might eventually bring him under the control of an Irish Government, which would mean that he would get only half what he is now getting by way of social welfare benefits in the North. This is a very complex problem.  We are passing through a time when to give increases of any kind represents a problem.  That is why I would not force any issue where finance is concerned.  I am not unmindful of the existing economic trouble.  Nevertheless, it is our duty to provide for our people.  I know too well that throughout the length and breadth of this country there is hunger, misery and want.  That is <Col N="1126" /> not a fairytale.  It is evident in every town.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made, with some of which I would agree and with others of which I would not agree. I would not agree with the suggestion that the old age pension should be payable to any man at 70 years of age irrespective of his wealth or the extent of his property or his bank account. I hope I shall never live to see the day when Lord Elveden will draw the old age pension.  It would be governmental madness to bring about a situation of that kind.  However, I would certainly support, as I know my Party will support, any effort to improve the lot of those in need.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what our position would be if we never had emigration, if we never had that terrible haemorrhage that took from the shores of Ireland thousands of our finest men and women.  As long as I can remember, Fianna Fáil have been telling the country that they and they alone have the cure for unemployment and emigration. I can see plainly now that they have a cure for unemployment and emigration, but it is a long-term cure.</P>

However, I bow to your ruling, Sir, if you think I am wandering from the subject before the House.  My Party will support anything that will alleviate the position of people in the lower income group, and I refer particularly to pensioners and other social welfare recipients.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Supplementary Estimate is really <Col N="1127" /> to provide additional sums to implement the promises made to the social welfare classes in what I would describe as the spring Budget of 1968. Of course, we on this side of the House agree that this money should be made available to carry into effect the social welfare payments provided for in the spring Budget of 1968 and the Social Welfare Act which followed.  It is opportune to remind the House that since the social welfare payments to old age pensioners, to widows, to orphans, to unemployed of one category or another, were fixed by the Budget introduced in the spring of 1968, the cost of living has been forced up by Government action.  Indeed, it has been forced up by a second Budget introduced in the autumn of last year, a Budget which made no provision whatever for compensation for the social welfare classes, who, by that second Budget of 1968, were deprived of what they had hoped to receive, of what they were promised in the spring Budget of that year.  I made the point here on a previous occasion that, when it is necessary, for one reason or another, to introduce a second Budget in any year, a Budget which imposes very substantial taxation indeed&mdash;might I say record taxation&mdash;as did the Budget in the autumn of last year, that Budget should compensate the social welfare classes who are deprived of what they were led to expect from the spring Budget.</P>
      <P>This is a shabby sort of trick to play on social welfare classes.  It is particularly shabby in an election year. We had an election last year.  We had the spring Budget which gave 7/6d to pensioners of one kind or another and increased unemployment benefits.  That was before the referendum.  After the referendum we had the autumn Budget which neutralised these increases through the medium of blistering taxation with no provision whatsoever to compensate those who were deprived of their lawful rights.  It is no harm that that should go on the records of this House.  The Government should be warned that this is not acceptable and should not be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare payments to the <Col N="1128" /> categories covered by this Supplementary Estimate are totally inadequate. As the last speaker said, we are passing through a period of economic crisis.  Indeed, that has been said several times but, when we on this side of the House draw attention to extravagance of one kind or another, such as the referendum of last year or Ministerial transport, we are told by the Minister for Finance, although he is not answering the particular question, to grow up.  We are told that whatever was spent on the referendum was a mere bagatelle and that mature politicians would not dream of mentioning it here.  When a question was asked about Ministerial cars today, in view of the pending speed limits, the questioner was brushed aside by the Minister for Finance, with a wave of his hand and &ldquo;piffle&rdquo;, &ldquo;nugatory expenditure&rdquo;.  But all these things add up.  If we can so lightly brush aside expenditure of that sort we should be in a position to be more generous with old age pensioners and the social welfare classes generally.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides money for the payment of old age pensions.  These pensions should be paid at the age of 65.  That suggestion was described by the Taoiseach as &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo;, something unobtainable, something that thinking people would not seriously suggest. When the old age pensions were introduced in 1908 the qualifying age was 70.  Since then our whole standard of living has changed.  We have a five-day week; we have two and three weeks' holidays with pay.  The whole pattern of living and employment has changed drastically.  Yet the qualifying age, 60 odd years after the passing of the Act, still stands at 70.  It should be reduced immediately to 65.  If that were done a great many of the payments now made to social welfare classes between the ages of 65 and 70 would merge in the old age pension and it would not cost the country as much as one might think.</P>
    <P>Many people between the ages of 65 and 70 are in receipt of sickness benefits.  Others are in receipt of disabled persons' allowances from local authorities.  Others are drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment <Col N="1129" /> benefit.  They qualify for these benefits because of their age.  They cannot be provided with suitable work and they are, therefore, rated as unemployed. All these categories could be covered by the old age pension if the qualifying age were reduced.  It is quite easy to get accepted the case for a fortnight's or three weeks holidays.  There is no trouble putting through a case for a five-day week or shorter working hours. When it comes to the old age pensioner, however, he must wait until he reaches 70 years to qualify notwithstanding the fact that his fellow workers are, if in Government or local authority employment, forced out of that employment at 65.  They are told they are not fit to work.  They must retire.  But the old age pensioner is told he must work on until he is 70.  I hope that when the Minister for Finance comes to draft his Budget, irrespective of that upon which he may clamp down or irrespective of the directions in which he will find it necessary to save, he will not do so at the expense of this category of pensioner.</P>
    <P>So much in a general way.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to raise a few points which I think can properly be raised within the Rules of Order on this Supplementary Estimate. An old age pensioner is entitled to free light, provided he or she is the tenant or the occupant of the house and is the account holder with the ESB and provided no one else is residing in the house except an invalid or persons who fall within a very narrow category.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently of an old age pensioner of 77 years of age who, after a fairly strenuous struggle, had succeeded in having electric light installed in his house.  He applied for a free supply under the scheme but, so far as I could follow the explanation given, he failed to qualify because there was another person living with him in the house.  In this case the only other person living in the house is his widowed sister who is in receipt of a widow's pension.  She is not 70 years of age.  If I interpret correctly the circular which was sent out, that old man will not qualify for a free supply of electricity until his widowed sister attains the age of 70 years.</P>

It would be reasonable to amend the regulation to provide for cases like that. I know it is not easy to draft regulations that will not be abused, and I can see that, if the Minister were to grant a free supply of electricity to every non-contributory old age pensioner in the country, without any qualification, he could be supplying light to some very wealthy householders. The tenant could be a non-contributory old age pensioner, and he could have wealthy sons and daughters living in the house.  I am not making a case for them.  The Minister should look at the regulations in this case and take an overall authority to give a free supply of electricity to an old age pensioner in necessitous circumstances.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree, but he is still 77.  Irrespective of the state of his health these two people should qualify for a free supply of electricity either individually or collectively. I suggest that the Minister should look at the regulations and, provided that the householder satisfies the Minister that he was an old age pensioner in necessitous circumstances, he should qualify.</P>
      <P>The next matter is a hardy annual as far as I am concerned.  I want to appeal to the Minister to pay the non-contributory old age pension or the widow's pension to persons who leave this country and go to England to reside with their sons or daughters who have emigrated.  We have this problem of emigration, and apparently we are going to have it in the foreseeable future.  It is only natural that old people who are left at home in isolated loneliness, in houses that are no more than hovels, or have ceased to be habitable, should want to go to join their sons or daughters who are, perhaps, married and householders in England. It is to the great credit of those sons and daughters who have emigrated that they welcome their aged parents who go to join them in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister's answer is that in the case of the contributory pension this could be operated but in the case of the non-contributory pension it is difficult if not impossible to operate, because the Minister must see to it that someone who is in receipt of pension qualifies within the means test.  It is as simple as that.  There is the Department of Health and Social Security in England and I am sure they have many officials throughout the length and breadth of Britain.  We have arrived at reciprocal arrangements.  The Minister has entered into a reciprocal arrangement with the British Ministry of Health and Social Security under many headings.  I do not think it likely that there would be abuses under this heading.  I do not think it likely that a person over 70 years of age will take up gainful employment in Great Britain if he goes there.  He could win <Col N="1132" /> the sweep or the pools, or he could go to the races and hit the jackpot.  Again that is not likely.</P>
    <P>This problem could be got over by entering into a reciprocal arrangement with the Minister's counterpart over there.  I am sure they would be prepared to check up on these people every now and again, first of all to see that they are alive and, secondly, to confirm that they have not suddenly become possessors of great wealth. They could become possessors of great wealth in this country too, because they could have a prize bond and they could draw a prize of £5,000, or they could buy a Sweep ticket and win a prize.  It is just as difficult to check up on their means here as it is to check up on their means in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this is a social problem, particularly to be found in this country, because it is linked with the problem of emigration, because we are a small agricultural country living beside a vast industrial country, and because for the past 150 years or more our people have been going there in great numbers and are still going.  When they go there it is likely that they will get married and settle down there.  It is cruel that these old people cannot go over and enjoy the old age pension.  I know it may be said that their sons and daughters can take them over there, but they cannot draw the pension.  If they went there with even £3 or £3 5s a week they would not feel pauperism.  They would feel that they were paying their way and they would be enjoying the company, hospitality and friendship of their own sons and daughters.  Under this heading I make an appeal to the Minister's heart rather than to the head of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the unemployment benefits section, I come across cases where a small farmer goes out to work for a building contractor for six or eight months and applies for unemployment benefit.  He has legitimately affixed the required number of stamps to his card but because he has a farm he is held not to be unemployed, not to be available for work.  I have made the case to the <Col N="1133" /> Minister's Department that if this man was prepared to go out to work with a building contractor&mdash;I think he was also employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;it is obvious that his farm is small enough to get on without him and that his wife is prepared to do the work in his absence.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the best possible evidence that he was seeking work and was prepared to work is that he was prepared to go to work with the building contractor or with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That being so, and having paid the required number of contributions, he should get the benefit of those contributions.  It is not likely that you will get those who have 100 acres or very big farmers going out to work and then seeking to draw unemployment benefit.  The men who do this will be very small farmers or borderline cases.  The best evidence that can be produced is that they went out to work when work was available.</P>
    <P>The case has been made to the Minister a number of times in this debate and it was brought up yesterday by way of a Parliamentary Question of the 45/- per week which, in theory, is paid to a daughter or step-daughter who comes home to look after her mother.  The Minister's officials must see that it is next to impossible to qualify for this payment.  The fact that the Minister was able to tell the House that since the introduction of the scheme about 100 persons had qualified shows how difficult it is to qualify for this payment.  I agree that if there is anyone else in the house capable of looking after the parent and if the daughter comes home to do so she should not qualify.  The only test should be this&mdash;does the mother need nursing attention, is the mother or parent capable of being left in the house on their own?  If the parent cannot be left alone in the house in the absence of somebody to look after them then this allowance should be paid to the person who looks after them provided that person is not working.</P>
    <P>The test should be&mdash;if the daughter is not there, would the parent have to be moved to the local old persons' home?  If that is established and if the daughter or step-daughter looks <Col N="1134" /> after the parent, then the Minister should pay the pension to the daughter. I do not think it would cost a great deal.  If you apply the test I have suggested, if the daughter is not available and if the old person is removed to the home, it will cost the ratepayers or the taxpayers considerably more than the 45/- per week.  I suggest that the Minister should look at that problem in the light of what I have said.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is the certification of recipients of unemployment benefit or assistance.  At the present time they have to go to the Garda station within their own district and this matter needs to be taken up by the Minister with the Garda authorities.  At the present time the Garda authorities insist that the applicant for unemployment benefit or assistance must sign on at the Garda station in his own sub-district or at the designated Garda station.  In my constituency that leads to a lot of inconvenience and hardship because in order to sign on at the appropriate station a person may have to undertake an extra journey of three or four miles.  He should be allowed to sign on at the nearest Garda station or at a Garda station which, within reason, he would nominate himself.  I had a young fellow with me the other day who does not ride a bicycle.  He would have no trouble in getting to one Garda station but there is no means of transport whatever to the one to which he has to go.  I suggest that the Minister and his officials should look into that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I have raised these points in all seriousness and in the conviction that there is considerable weight in all of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of the Supplementary Estimate to raise some pertinent points about our social welfare policy as it is operated by the present Government and which I maintain is based on a Victorian plimsoll line concept of benefits which are barely sufficient for survival.  A harrowing example is the old age pension rate.  Those on social assistance are given barely enough on which to survive.  Recently, in answer <Col N="1135" /> to a Parliamentary Question, the Leader of our Party elicited some figures from the Minister and, as a result, he estimated that some half-a-million men, women and children in this country are living on or below the poverty line: these are the people that exist in statistics.  Many of the poor do not appear in statistics simply because our present social welfare system chooses to ignore them.  A good example of this are the unmarried mothers and their children.</P>
      <P>I do not think our social welfare system caters adequately for the unfortunate members of our community who must avail of it.  The inability of the present system to cater for these people is acknowledged by the existence of home assistance grants.  If we were to speak about any Government Department as adopting a negative attitude then, without doubt, we could point an accusing finger at the Department of Social Welfare because this is one Department where every effort is made by officials to hinder any application for assistance or benefit to which people are normally entitled.  The whole concept within this Department is to obstruct people in every way and to hinder them from getting benefit. This negative attitude is predominant in the Department of Social Welfare right down through every section of it. This is the Department which should have a social conscience.  This is the Department which should see to it that the poor afflicted people are protected and given the benefits to which they are entitled.  The entire attitude of the Department is oriented towards denying people the benefits to which they are normally entitled.  I must emphasise the negative attitude which is more apparent in this Department than in any other Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know people who have gone down to inquire about their social insurance, their benefits, their cards, the misplacement of their cards.  These people find that the attitude of the officials in the Department is, in effect: &ldquo;Do not bother us about it; go across to the labour exchange.&rdquo;  No effort is made by the Department of Social Welfare to help or to facilitate people in any way.  They actually regard these people <Col N="1136" /> as second-class citizens who are deserving of nothing.</P>
    <P>There is a regulation under the Social Welfare Act whereby widows in receipt of widow's pension, provided for them by their husbands, and who are then compelled to work, receive only half benefit when they become ill despite the fact that they pay the full contribution.  Despite many requests by Deputies on all sides of the House, the Minister has refused to consider rectifying this tremendous injustice.  It is a damning indictment of the present system that a married woman can work, pay for her stamps and, if she becomes ill, can draw full benefit despite the fact that her husband may be working.  The widow is deprived of full benefit because she is in receipt of a widow's pension which was provided by her late husband, through his contributions.  I realise that this Supplementary Estimate does not entitle any Deputy to advocate legislalation but this is a glaring example of a tremendous injustice which should be rectified as soon as possible.  If the Minister were to bring this matter before the House, he would have the support of every Deputy.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is seriously considering payment of the old age pension at 65.  We should feel ashamed that we did not introduce this years ago and that we expect people to go on working up to the age of 70 before they can obtain any benefit.  I want to know when the Minister will introduce this proposal.  There is no use in saying that he is considering it and there is no use in allowing this matter to drag out interminably.  Here and now, the Minister should state when he proposes to bring forward this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the non-contributory old age pension or widow's pension is a sore point with many people.  I came across a case, which I brought to the attention of the Minister, of the recipient of a widow's pension who was completely homeless.  She had nowhere to live.  She had a non-contributory <Col N="1137" /> pension of £3 3s or £3 5s per week. Being homeless, and in the light of the fact that she could never be considered for accommodation by the housing authority, she sought employment and got a post as a caretaker-cum-cleaner with a free room plus £1 a week wages and she had the £3 3s non-contributory widow's pension.  An official of the Minister's Department called to see her.  He estimated her wage at £52 per year and, in addition, the rent of the room at £2 12s a year&mdash; one shilling per week.  As a result, this poor person was deprived of 17/- a week from her widow's pension of three guineas a week.  In consequence, she was compelled to work for 3/- per week due to this rigid attitude which was adopted by the Minister's Department. The Minister should make it very clear to his officials that rigidity in interpreting the rules and regulations is wrong, unjust and unchristian.  I should like him to make it clear to this House that his officials must adopt a more Christian and just attitude to the recipients of non-contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>A short time ago, I had occasion to see the Minister about the question of home assistance which, I understand, is operated by local authorities and over which the Minister has no control, although the money is provided.  His only obligation and duty in this matter, I understand, is in relation to the employment of home assistance officers. He has some function in that matter. It is a bad state of affairs that there is no control over home assistance and that there is no obligation on the local authority to pay an adequate amount of home assistance to the destitute.</P>
    <P>We had an unfortunate group of people who were the victims of the recent strike.  We saw them picketing Leinster House.  Their plight was brought to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare who felt he could do nothing to help them because their case had gone before an appeals officer and the length of time it would take for their case to be considered by an appeals officer was perhaps a month.  Meanwhile these people were not given adequate home assistance. We would all like some change in the system so that moneys could be provided <Col N="1138" /> immediately by local authorities, under a proper home assistance scheme, for the necessitous and the destitute. All health authorities have an obligation to relieve the destitute but it is not stated to what extent.  I do not think it is relieving the destitute to pay £3 to a man and his family in time of need.  We should not humiliate these unfortunate victims in our society by merely offering them food vouchers and expecting them to exchange these vouchers all at once.  Money must be provided for them and a more flexible system adopted adequately to relieve their destitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rejected all efforts made by Deputies on all sides to have the three days' waiting time reduced. His argument has been that people who need social welfare benefit can legitimately do without the first three days' benefit.  I do not agree with him.  The person who needs social welfare is a person who is not financially comfortable and who incurs the extra expense of medical treatment and of drugs. There are glaring examples of people who have suffered terribly as a result of these regulations which the Minister refuses to change.  In addition to this, we have the unnecessarily long delays in dealing with applications for social welfare benefits.  The Minister says that the people will be paid after the second certificate.  He must know there are many cases in which this has not occurred and that the result has been disastrous for householders.  When a family is waiting for the cheque on a Friday evening and when it does not arrive they must go through a weekend of starvation, literally, when there is no effective body to deal with an emergency such as this.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister or the Department could devise some more effective means of ensuring that people who have submitted social welfare certificates could be paid on time and some means of providing these application forms at doctors' surgeries so that patients could get them immediately. It should not be beyond the competence of the Department to streamline the system and ensure that application forms are available immediately. There should be no delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> I should like to deal with the question of the mentally and physically handicapped and to say that I deplore the regulations which impose a means test on the handicapped.  I remember one particularly glaring example of injustice where a man was handicapped to the extent that he could never walk but because the Department considered that his married brothers were prosperous he could not receive any allowance as a physically handicapped person.  I know that the local authority has the power to decide on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say that I object very much to the application of a means test in cases like this.  In our social welfare policy or programme we must consider the question of abandoned wives and unmarried mothers.  They must receive some income.  It is not sufficient to say that home assistance is available because in many cases home assistance applies for only four weeks.  I know of one wife who was deserted and was completely destitute and she received home assistance for four weeks after which it was discontinued and all she had was recourse to the courts for a maintenance order which could not be enforced because her husband was in England.  We should provide regular and continuous means of assisting these people.  We might consider a service which would be administered on a community basis with a corps of trained social workers to inquire into these problems.  This is one matter in which the Department of Social Welfare must work in close co-operation with the Department of Health. You cannot separate the two because only by close inter-relationship between them can we meet the problems of those in need of help and cater properly for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to appeals officers, I should like to know if they are medically qualified persons.  I have seen many cases rejected by appeals officers and <Col N="1140" /> intensive inquiry could elicit no information about them.  I brought one case to the attention of the Department.  It involved a person who had been declared fit for work and whose appeal had been rejected by the appeals officer on no fewer than four occasions. Finally, when I pressed the matter and insisted on an independent consultant's examination and the person was found unfit for work, the Department conceded that the person was not fit for work and was entitled to social welfare benefit.  This is an example of the negative approach of the Department in endeavouring to prevent people from getting benefit.  Instead of adopting a positive approach and endeavouring to help people to get the benefits to which they are entitled, their attitude has been obstructive in every way.  Where an injustice like this took place there was no apology from the Department.  They conceded that a mistake had been made and only after 18 months, and only after I had intervened, was it rectified. I do not think this is right.  The Department should have endeavoured to help that person.</P>
    <P>Frequently, we hear from people whose cards are lost.  Just recently one person was told the cards were lost although they were submitted to the Department.  In another case this person told me the priest for whom she worked submitted the cards in person to the Department.  Again, the cards were lost.  There must be something wrong with a Department where cards are lost.  This is a very important matter for a person who must claim unemployment or social benefit.  I do not think the Department is working properly or operating efficiently if it can lose cards.  It is not a question of a letter or a form being mislaid.  Where a person's entitlement is rejected as a result, it is a very serious matter.  It is a terrible indictment of the Minister's Department if cards can be lost, or lost for three, six or eight months and finally discovered somewhere in forgotten files.  This is not an isolated case but a regular occurence in this Department. We cannot overlook this fact or gloss over it because people suffer as a result of this.  We must have it rectified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I realise that employment exchanges <Col N="1141" /> now come within the ambit of the Minister for Labour.  Unemployment benefit is paid for a certain length of time. It has concerned the Department of Social Welfare for so long that I must refer to it.  No effort is made to offer employment to the people concerned. Many of them say they have never been interviewed.  It is just outside the Minister's scope now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only very recently. The Department of Social Welfare fell down on this matter for too long and we see the results of it now.</P>
      <P>I should also mention the poor law assistance.  The Minister may not be aware that we have poverty-stricken people in the country who cannot afford to pay funeral expenses.  We have them in great numbers.  I saw a case recently of a woman who had buried her husband. There was no insurance.  Four weeks later her mentally retarded child died.  There was no insurance and no money to provide for funeral expenses. The health authority would provide a hearse and coffin but would not provide a mourning coach.  The woman was told to get the bus to Glasnevin and the hearse would be at the gate and she could meet it there.  When I inquired of the local authority I was told that there was no provision for a mourning coach, that the woman must take the bus to the cemetery.  The official said the law was antiquated.  It is about time we changed it.  It provides a total of £20 for funeral expenses. Is the Minister aware that the undertakers take on this service as a matter of charity, as everybody knows that £20 would not cover funeral expenses? We should look into this matter seriously and see if we can rectify the position and provide a more realistic sum.  These cases are not as isolated as the Minister may think. When people are destitute somebody must come to their assistance.  Invariably, it is the neighbours who help out, as happened in this case, to provide the mourning coach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free travel for old age pensioners and other persons is an excellent idea <Col N="1142" /> of which I approve.  I support it strongly, but some liaison should be established between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare because those who must avail of it generally do so to keep hospital appointments.  They are told to report at the hospital at, say, 9.30 a.m. but the travel concession does not come into effect until after ten o'clock.  The Minister should look into this.  I do not want these people inconvenienced during the rush hour.  We do not want to have them travelling during peak hours.  Perhaps, through some closer liaison with the Department of Health, notice could be given to the hospital explaining the situation so that these people could be properly facilitated. That should be done.  People are deprived of their rights because of the regulations and if we cannot change the regulations we should at least inform the hospital so that people could avail of the concession.</P>
    <P>While the idea of the free electricity allowance is admirable the application of it is not so good.  I find that people are deprived of the allowance if they have somebody nursing them or caring for them.  When it is established that somebody is doing this very charitable service the allowance is stopped immediately.  We should not apply these rules rigidly.  The purpose for which the concession was established is gone if we apply the regulations so rigidly.  We should not discourage people from attending to the aged.  We are advocating that the aged should be nursed in their homes, thus saving the health services substantial cost.  We should not impose penalties on people because of this.  Where it is established that a person needs nursing care and that it must be provided by a member of the household, son or daughter or granddaughter, the free electricity allowance should apply as should the free television and radio allowance.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>I have been fighting a case for one man for over 12 months.  He has been insured from the very early days of the State.  His cards were lost.  I have written over 20 letters to the Department and the officials have not yet established the man's right to either unemployment or social welfare benefit. <Col N="1143" /> He has given them all possible details as to where he worked and on what occasions, dating back to 1914.  Where a situation like that arises the onus is on the Department if they cannot find the cards at least to say: &ldquo;We will establish that you have been there.  We cannot find the cards.  We will have a sworn affidavit or something like that to show that you worked over those years.&rdquo;  We should ensure that this man or people like him obtain social welfare or unemployment benefit. When such a person finds he is deprived of benefit he fights the battle on his own.  It is a terrible injustice that such a person should be deprived of social welfare or unemployment benefit.  This case has been going on for quite a few years and in spite of attempts to establish where this man was employed the Department has refused to yield on this matter.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House any longer except to ask the Minister if he will try to get his Department to adopt a more charitable attitude towards people and to facilitate them. A positive attitude by his Department could alter the image of the Department of Social Welfare.  He should seriously consider this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate affords me an opportunity of saying a few words on the Department of Social Welfare.  I want to say at the outset that I have no criticism of the officials of the Department with whom I have had dealings at long range and at short range.  I have had to write letters from time to time to the head office.  Dublin Deputies probably have more dealings with the Department than rural Deputies but I must say that whenever I troubled them I found them courteous, from the man on the lift or at the door to the people I met in the offices and they did not always know me as a Deputy because I went in in the ordinary way and later announced who I was.  I found everybody courteous and helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, as in other countries, great advances have been made. Benefits have increased down the years. Successive Governments, within the <Col N="1144" /> resources available to them, have increased benefits to social welfare recipients in general.  Of course we could increase them much more if more money were available.  We have increased benefits to certain necessitous persons and while this may be a great help to some people it may not be a great help to others because individual cases vary so much.  You could have the case for instance of an old age pensioner or two down the country with a right of residence, living in a happy environment with in-laws and so on.  They may be well cared for and perhaps the son or daughter is prepared to provide little comforts for them.  In that situation they may be able to save a little out of their incomes.  On the other side of the scale in towns like Ballina, Crossmolina or Castlebar you may have an old age pensioner living on the pension, maybe in poor health and having to buy drugs and tablets as well as the necessaries of life.  To that person I would like to be very generous and, if possible, would stretch the regulations to cover such persons.  I am sure the Minister would too if he could see a way of getting around the regulations.  It is not easy of course.</P>
    <P>We in the west of Ireland have a big problem in the matter of old age pensioners and widows and orphans. As the Minister knows, because he is a rural Deputy, many of our people emigrate to England to supplement their incomes.  Some of them are seasonal workers.  They are prepared to do hard work.  They work on building sites and some of them become building contractors in a big way.  Some of these workers send sums of money home, particularly while they are single, and quite often it means that the father or mother is expected to deposit that money in the bank or post office.  There are no pockets in a habit and they cannot bring it with them into the next world.  It often goes against them when the investigation officer comes to check their means when they apply for an old age pension or a widow's pension.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated by the Minister and his Department that these people have very hard lives and that they contribute in a big way to the economy of the State, and have done <Col N="1145" /> down the years, by their remittances, sometimes fortnightly cheques of £10 or £20.  The Minister for Finance has a rough idea of the amount of money these people send home annually from England, America and other countries. I feel they are entitled to certain consideration.  I am asking the Minister this evening to consider this.  He is familiar with the problem because he comes from a rural area something like my own.  I am asking him to try to amend the law so that a broader means test will apply to the congested areas.  When you consider the difficulties and the battles that these people have to put up to rear their families they are entitled to special consideration. They have been denied an opportunity of living at home under successive Governments.  The small holdings of land perhaps were not capable of maintaining them in reasonable comfort.  They went off on the boat and they made a big contribution. In return a special case could be made for old age pensioners, widows and orphans living in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Indeed, although I am not a city man I have sufficient knowledge of this city to know that a special case could be made for many people in this city also.  I spend a lot of my time in the city and I know the hardships and difficulties these people go through.  I have met them in their homes from time to time and a case can be made similar to that which can be made for the people in the rural areas.  Take the case of a widow with a small shop or some other sign of prosperity.  The husband may have had a car which is on hire.  Perhaps these things would create an impression in the mind of the investigating officer that there was wealth around when in reality it was not wealth but a millstone around the necks of the people concerned.  A widow might have a small business with a turnover of £100 or £200 a year which would be of very small significance, particularly if there is a big family.</P>
    <P>The British pensioner gets the pension at 65 years of age and many of them come home to Ireland and draw their pensions here.  In the West of Ireland I have noticed many <Col N="1146" /> Americans who, due to the high cost of living in the United States, would consider it an advantage to come and live here when they are eligible for pensions.  I would add my voice to that of Deputy Dr. O'Connell in asking the Minister to grant pensions here at age 65 to bring them into line with American and British pensions.  This will take money, which is not so plentiful at the present time, but if the Minister has to dip a bit deeper into some pockets, particularly the pockets of those who seem to have money for luxury items, it should be done.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment benefit, in the Minister's constituency and in my own as well there are many smallholders with valuations of between £2 and £7 who are receiving what is commonly called the dole.  They may not be in regular employment locally. Occasionally the county council come in and take away a corner or do some other small job, and these people get work for a few weeks.  How can you expect these people, in this day and age, to live without some little help? I know many fathers of families who draw £4 or £5 which helps to keep them at home in Ireland with their families, which pays for the groceries and enables them to put 10/- or £1 aside over a period to buy a little pair of shoes of some other necessity for the children.  People pay taxes on their groceries, their cigarettes, the bottle of stout and so on, so quite a sizeable amount of this money finds its way back into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I was asked to refer to the fact that domestic servants must have ten years stamps&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;before they qualify for benefit.  If that is so, that is bad law. I fail to see why domestic servants should be regarded as third-class citizens and why they would not be eligible for benefit as other people in various types of work are eligible. People will tell you it is nearly impossible to get domestic help nowadays, and it is no wonder if that is the law.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to raise is in connection with people in receipt of British pensions.  I know a tailor who went out of business due to rural depopulation and the fact that nowadays people buy their clothes off the <Col N="1147" /> peg.  He was a sensible man and an admirable tradesman.  He went over to England to seek employment and stayed there until he qualified for a British pension, which he gets regularly. He applied for a free radio licence and he was told he could not benefit under the scheme because he was not in receipt of an Irish old age pension. This man who came over from England makes his contribution to the Exchequer; he is a taxpayer like everybody else and it is wrong that, through no fault of his own, he should be denied the benefits of free transport, free light and a free radio licence for which other old age pensioners are eligible.  It is not of his own choosing that this man went to England. Economic circumstances obliged him to go.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have no complaint to make about civil servants in any Department.  On one or two occasions I met a few hotheads but one meets them in any walk of life.  I remember having a run-in with a civil servant, but he apologised afterwards and told me he had been with the dentist.  We are not always feeling in the best of form, and I would not like to criticise any civil servant.  Investigation officers, appeals officers and other such people are subjected to a lot of criticism.  I criticised one of them on a previous Estimate, but I realise they are working according to a set of rules and regulations. They are not spending money out of their own pockets.  They are answerable to the senior officers in their Department, and if there is any question of money being paid out which, according to the regulations, should not have been paid out, there is trouble right along the line.  While we could be critical of them, and it would, perhaps, be good in an election year to slate them, I do not propose to do it.</P>
    <P>I give my views.  The applicant will give the best side of the picture and sometimes, when you make inquiries, you find there is a little bit of money here or there but, by and large, if the Minister could possibly meet me I would appreciate it very much.  The people in the congested areas are obliged to give up their homes and <Col N="1148" /> go across to England or elsewhere to make a living.  They are worthy of special consideration.  If the allowances were more generous it might be some encouragement to them to stay in the west of Ireland where now, thank God, the majority have good homes, particularly in the rural areas, because of the generous grants given down through the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House unduly but this is an Estimate in which the Labour Party have a very real, live and active interest.  Within the confines of the Minister's Department we are concerned in particular with the masses of the underprivileged. We are concerned about those against whom the winds of adversity blow most harshly.  We are concerned with the aged, the widowed, the orphaned, the sick and the unemployed.  We are concerned with destitution and poverty. Let no one pretend that the incidence of these social evils is less now than it was a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the money devoted to social welfare is paid by the worker.  The insured male worker contributes 11/- per week to a social welfare stamp and his employer contributes 13/5d per week, making a total of 24/5d per week per contributory stamp.  The State pays one-third. The female worker contributes 9/10d per week by way of personal contribution towards a social welfare stamp. Now, 11/- and 9/10d are sizeable bites out of the wage of the lower paid manual worker, the domestic servant, the builder's labourer and so on and it is becoming clearer and clearer to these workers that they are getting very little, in fact, in return for the contributions they make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one examines the social welfare code and the various regulations governing the payment of benefit one can come to only one conclusion and that is that the whole social welfare code was conceived with quite extraordinary ingenuity, designed to deprive from benefit rather than to assist in securing benefit.  The whole process is to hinder rather than to assist in the securing of the benefit for which the working classes contribute, to which they are entitled as of right and not as mere charity.  Mere charity is what <Col N="1149" /> it would appear to be judging by the approach of some of the people who dole out these various benefits.</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to be deprived of benefit.  All sorts of strictures are laid down in the regulations designed to trap the applicant and to deprive him of benefit by one means or another. Before a man is granted unemployment benefit he must satisfy the Minister's Department that he has not lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at his place of employment.  We had, as my colleagues have pointed out, instances in recent months in which hundreds of workers were deprived of unemployment benefit because they were involved, in a most indirect way, in a trade dispute.  These hundreds of workers had to call on home assistance and that was granted only grudgingly and after a great deal of investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recollect that I tabled a question to him a short time ago in regard to the undue delay in the payment of benefit to workers in a factory in my constituency.  As a result of a stoppage of work in which they were not involved, these workers failed to secure unemployment benefit until I raised the matter here.</P>
    <P>There are many regulations governing the payment of benefit.  No benefit will be paid if the applicant lost his employment through his own, as it is described, misconduct or left his employment without just cause.  In quite a large number of cases applicants are disallowed benefit on one pretext or another; because they lost their employment due to misconduct&mdash;a nasty word; because they left their employment due to the overbearing and tyrannical attitude of the employer, or his representative.  The first thing the employment agency office will do is to ring up the employer concerned and if the employer, as employers are likely to do, reflects on the operatives concerned the employer's word is taken and the men are disallowed benefit for six weeks, pending appeal. Six weeks is a long time to try to live on the wind in these times of very high prices, and a very high cost of living.  In many instances when this humilitating code is <Col N="1150" /> applied, the applicant gives up in despair and finds alternative employment or, which is more likely, he scrapes a few pounds together and heads for the boat to England.</P>
    <P>He may also be refused benefit for what is termed as refusing an offer of suitable employment.  Here again, the Department will decide what is suitable employment.  If he refuses or fails to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity to receive training, provided now by An Chomhairle Oiliúna, or if he has not taken advantage of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment, he can be disallowed benefit.</P>
    <P>I have known people to be disallowed benefit on this pretext.  Very often this stricture is invoked against applicants.  If he is convicted of an offence in relation to unemployment benefit or, indeed, if he winds up in prison he is disallowed benefit.  I have known an instance of that recently in my constituency.  So, for genuine reasons of unemployment we have known people to be held up in their benefit interminably, and at least over six weeks.  They have to face the ordeal of going before an appeals board and being interrogated sometimes in a pretty ruthless fashion.  I am a member of such a tribunal and I have sat in on these cases very often.  Some of the officers who come down from the Department to us are thorough gentlemen. Others are not so nice, and the rugged attitude they adopt towards unfortunate men or women, obviously in order to deprive them of benefit, leaves much to be desired.  Some of them are more suited to the role of a <i>gauleiter</i> in the old Nazi Party, than the role of a humane officer intent on doing justice in a humane way.  That is only one aspect of the social welfare code in respect of those who claim unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I believe the whole code is particularly prejudicial to the interests of the women of this country.  The manner in which we have contrived to defraud the women of this country of their entitlement under the social welfare code is nothing less than disgraceful. We pride ourselves on being a great Christian country, and we tend to frown on the idea of women working <Col N="1151" /> after marriage.  We are over concerned, perhaps rightly so, about the duties of women in the home and to the family.  On that basis, is it not strange to find&mdash;and the social welfare code lays this down&mdash;that unless a woman continues in insurable employment for at least 26 weeks after marriage, she is deprived of all benefit under the social welfare code, even though she has been working in insurable employment all her working life since she left school at 14 years of age.</P>
    <P>Unless she works on, she loses unemployment benefit, disability benefit and, most important of all, she loses maternity benefit.  She loses the allowance for the six weeks before and the six weeks after the birth of her baby. Is not that a penal clause?  Is not that an affront to Irishwomen?  Should it not be deleted from the social welfare code forthwith?  In so many ways we militate against women in this code, and against widows who claim contributory pensions.  It is startling to reveal that, unless a woman is entitled to a contributory pension on her husband's stamps, she does not get it. She is entitled only to a non-contributory pension subject, of course, to an odious means test.</P>
    <P>I have known instances where women were obliged to work after the death of the husband to maintain themselves and their families.  They have put on stamps over a long number of years.  Is it not disgraceful in the extreme that, no matter how many years these widows work on after the death of the husband, their stamps are not recognised or allowable for a contributory pension?  Only the stamps they put on prior to marriage and only the husband's stamps are credited.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that there is a large number of women in this country who have been abandoned by their husbands.  There is a number of cases before the Minister's Department from me already of women who have been abandoned by their husbands over a very long number of years. These men are presumed dead sometimes, and they are certainly missing. Many of these cases have been the <Col N="1152" /> subject of investigation by welfare officers here and in Britain.  It is virtually impossible to get anything like a pension for these abandoned women and their dependants.  Surely it is high time to recognise these women as widows in the strict sense of the word, as completely and utterly abandoned and proven to be abandoned.  We have shown evidence from the Garda in the area and from the police in Britain. All these factors are discarded.  We seem to disregard the long and interminable suffering of these women.  Is it not sufficient suffering for them to have been abandoned by their life's partner, to have been discarded in such an inhuman way?  Almost invariably they have had to go out to work to maintain their families.  They have had to humiliate themselves by calling on charity and home assistance.  Has not this State got an obligation to come to the rescue of these unfortunate women and provide them with a positive pension, call it what you like? If we feel we are not entitled to call it a widow's pension as such, we can call it what we like.  Let us at least acknowledge this human problem in our midst.  It is not sufficient for us to sweep it under the carpet and pretend it does not exist.  We know the problem is there and it is high time that we faced up to it and provided some positive income for these women abandoned by their husbands.</P>
    <P>I do not have to reflect on the inadequacy of the non-contributory widow's pension and I want to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister, the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party to wipe out once and for all from the social welfare code all reference to non-contributory pensions and assistance of this kind.  More and more we find claims for contributory pensions growing and the number of applicants for non-contributory pensions of all kinds decreasing rapidly. There is too great a disparity between the contributory and the non-contributory elements and it is time we did something to bridge that gap.  The more we bridge it the more it will appear to the Minister that he should abolish the non-contributory element altogether.  Speaking for the Labour Party and speaking for the vast <Col N="1153" /> majority of the working classes I can say that we would be proud as insured persons to pay extra over and above the 11/- contribution for males and 9/10d contribution for females in order to bring about equality for the non-contributory element.  We would pay these increased contributions willingly and the employers would not begrudge them either.  Why should the State lag behind?</P>
    <P>Apart from the economic need to bridge the gap there is also the urgent necessity of eliminating altogether the odious means test involved in the non-contributory element.  This odious means test for old age pensions and for widows' pensions is particularly nauseating at the present time.  I have been a member of an old age pensions committee for a long time and I do not hesitate to say that I know of no good purpose served by these committees. They are effete and sterile things. They can do no good whatever and it is high time they were abolished. All they can do is to humiliate the unfortunate applicant, the old, sick applicant who has the temerity to come before these committees.</P>
    <P>The committees will recommend the maximum pension to most applicants because the people on these committees are very generous but their recommendation is subject to the review of the local welfare officer and the Minister's Department who have the overriding decision in every case.  This is why these committees are ineffective. They serve no purpose.  Abolish them. The code they administer is disgusting to the extent that a wealthy farmer with vast acreage and stock, say 100 acres with 50 bullocks, sheep and pigs, will qualify for the old age pension because it is alleged that he has handed over his farm, stock and assets to some member of his family.</P>
    <P>The next case coming before the committee may be that of an unfortunate man down the street whom we all know to have no assets but who may have a small pension, say from Britain, or a military service pension. Because he has this miserly pension which could not compare with the vast resources of the other man his application is rejected.  There was a case in recent months of a wealthy man in my <Col N="1154" /> own town who disposed of his property for £7,000, whose family are in professions, and who got the pension. Others of the type I have referred to, because they have a few shillings more than the miserly amount stipulated in this book here, get nothing at all.  Is it seriously contended that because these people hand over their property to their next-of-kin they are worse off by doing so?  They continue to live in opulence and comfort.  I have no respect for a code of that kind and this is why I say we should wipe out the non-contributory code altogether and abolish the old age pensions committees.</P>
    <P>I have noted the improvement in the reciprocal arrangements between ourselves and our opposite numbers in Great Britain but I still feel that the Minister should take steps to ensure that those Irish emigrants who have qualified for the maximum British pension and who want to return home to this country should be facilitated to draw the maximum pension here without any threat to that pension.  I would like to see a recognition of the British rates of pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I wish to make certain points on this important matter.  We did expect more from the Minister on this particular occasion having regard to the imminence of a general election.  It might have been felt that this was the time to make the great breakthrough, to give the pensions at 65 years of age and to bring these allowances up to a standard which would provide at least frugal comfort for the recipients.  I am merely touching on the fringe of these things in the hope and in the belief that the Minister will avail of an early opportunity to improve the sorry situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is next increasing these various allowances, especially for the non-contributory classes, the assistance classes, I trust he will liberalise the means test and that we shall have no more of this dirty pretence of granting <Col N="1155" /> increases to non-contributory old age pensioners, widows and the like and then stipulating that these increases apply only to persons of no means or, as applies today, to persons whose means do not exceed £26 per annum. This is a fraud.  This is making a mockery of the sufferings of these people.  This is a gigantic fraud.  It happened on a number of occasions in this House.  We saw banner headlines on the <i>Evening Press</i> as a result of a Budget speech.  Time and time again it happened&mdash;&ldquo;Five Shillings For Old Age Pensioners&rdquo;, and the like&mdash;but, when we got the Bill in this House a few weeks afterwards, it transpired that these increases would be granted only to persons of no means whatsoever. Quite a large preponderance of those unfortunate people never saw that increase because the code was so niggardly that the welfare officers valued even the old bed that the old person was lying on and the shelter of the roof and they were assessed as means, even if only at one shilling, and they got no 5/- or 7/6d increase and it was all a fraud.  Now the limit is £26 a year&mdash;again, a very miserly amount.  Some of these officers, whom I know very well, will look for means with a fine-comb and a magnifying glass and, if they do not get £26 a year in order to deprive a person of the increase in pension, I do not know what to think.  Invariably, hundreds, thousands, will not qualify on this basis.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to develop a little further a matter I raised recently in this House with the Minister in respect of the insurability of meter readers employed by the ESB. I raised some questions with the Minister recently on this subject and I was extremely dissatisfied, as indeed were many of my colleagues of all Parties with the disdainful attitude the Minister adopted.  I do not say that the Minister or his Department were responsible for this dastardly deed in the first instance. It was, I think, the ESB who drew this matter to the attention of the Department of Social Welfare. Employment such as that of meter reader with the ESB was always held to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>I shall not.  I wish to point out for the benefit of the House and the country that the ESB raised a question as to the entitlement of their meter readers to be insured under the Social Welfare code in May, 1967.  A test case was heard by the Department of Social Welfare.  The deciding officer came to the firm conclusion that the meter readers were not employed under a contract of service and consequently were not insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  I do not know whether the officer concerned in the Department of Social Welfare realised what he was doing but he has done incalculable harm to a large number of men who are employed by the ESB in this fashion.  Many of them are men who were insured all their life but their more recent employment with the ESB is the operative employment, for benefit purposes, under the Social Welfare code.  When it was deemed that the stamps appended in respect of meter readers were invalid, they lost all benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> This being very light work, I further pointed out to the Minister on the occasion, many of them were men who were invalided to some extent, who were incapacitated.  I am not concerned in this issue with persons who were meter readers part-time.  I am concerned with semi-invalided men who were doing this work as a means of livelihood and who, when disallowed, lost all benefit with resultant very considerable hardship.  I should like the Minister, with a sense of humanity, to look again at this issue, to ascertain the numbers of men concerned, especially those dependent on meter reading for a livelihood and consequently dependent on the stamp for social welfare benefit, and to see what he can do to redress the wrong which has been done to these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I want to mention, too, the allowance in respect of an aged parent whose daughter or daughter-in-law is caring for him or her.  I have made representations on a number of occasions where a daughter or a daughter-in-law was obliged to relinquish her employment in order to care for her aged parent or parent-in-law.  I submitted all the relevant information to the Minister's Department, and indeed I addressed my representations to the Minister himself, but except for receiving mere acknowledgment none of these cases has yet been dealt with.  It has been alleged to me by some applicants whom I am representing that persons who went to another Deputy had their cases resolved some time ago.  I want to say that my representations to the Minister, his predecessors and to Aras Mhic Dhiarmada generally, have been treated with courtesy and the utmost despatch and I am not reflecting on them in any way.  However, I telephoned the Department last week and gave them this information and even still none of these cases has been resolved. I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  I am not alleging unfair play as such and I feel the real reason is that, this being a new scheme, there has probably been an avalanche of applications for this new special allowance and it may be that the staff in the Department are unable to cope with them.  Nevertheless, it is <Col N="1158" /> disturbing to think that representations made six weeks or two months ago have not yet been resolved.  Except for a mere acknowledgment we have not been told what exactly is happening.</P>
    <P>I think it is pertinent to say that the Minister has a responsibility in regard to the payment of home assistance and in regard to the free footwear and free fuel schemes.  Would the Minister ensure the extension beyond March of the free fuel scheme, which operates from November to March?  The weather can be very cold and harsh in April, and indeed in May, and the Minister might consider the feasibility of extending the free fuel scheme to April or to May.  He might also consider the desirability of extending the scheme to large towns.  It is confined in the main to cities but the need for the scheme is as great in many towns and villages as in the larger cities.  The free footwear scheme has reached a sorry state and the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; is a misnomer because it is no longer free.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may feel that the Chair is putting him off but in the Supplementary Estimate there is nothing about these schemes under any of the subheads. The Chair has allowed the Deputy to mention these matters but they do not appear under any headings in the Supplementary Estimate before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but I have been waiting here some considerable time and listened to my colleagues ranging far and wide on matters they considered appropriate. Nevertheless, I appreciate that the Chair is right to draw attention to the specific matters in the Supplementary Estimate.  I should like to mention now the difficulty of securing unemployment assistance in very many cases where the condition is laid down that one must secure a qualification certificate.  My experience is that it is becoming more and more difficult to secure this certificate.  Various stipulations are laid down and recently a rigid means test has been applied. Many people in urgent need of unemployment assistance are deprived of it and are put to great inconvenience in <Col N="1159" /> securing it.  I would hope that the dole, as we know it, would be granted in a more generous and a more humane way.</P>
      <P>I do not apologise to anyone for having taken up a little time on this very important Supplementary Estimate because a large number of our people depend on the various benefits granted under the social welfare code. We can do a lot to alleviate human suffering and misery by having a more generous, more careful and more dignified approach to this matter; or we can make life pretty miserable for thousands of our people by dealing with this important code in an offhand and disdainful way.  We should treat people as human beings, should treat them with dignity, and ensure that whatever allowances are payable will provide the recipients with a reasonable standard of living and eliminate human misery.  I hope that the Minister will soon bring in a provision that all these benefits will be paid at the age of 65 and that all references to non-contributory and assistance classes will be wiped out of the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker when he says that the net is tightening and tightening a bit every day as far as the issue of qualification certificates to people applying for home assistance is concerned.  If one looks at the unemployment assistance which is payable to smallholders one finds that the method of calculating means is beyond description.  This is only applicable to counties like Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Clare, Kerry and the congested parts of West Cork and West Limerick.  That clearly indicates that it applies to the poorer parts of these counties.  I am surprised at the Minister for Social Welfare because he is a Donegal man, and certainly if he has not got this problem in Donegal he is going to find it in the portion of Leitrim which he recently took into his constituency.  He leads the people to believe that a farmer with a valuation of one pound has the equivalent of an income of £20 a year.  That basis of calculation might be suitable <Col N="1160" /> for parts of this country where the land is much better&mdash;one thinks of Meath, Westmeath and Dublin&mdash;but it is a ridiculous calculation for the poorer parts of the country.  I think that figure should be halved.  There might be some sense in it if he said £10 of income per £1 valuation.  Up to that period £10 per £1 valuation was the figure usually used by county managers and local authorities to calculate the income of the small farmer but under the 1965 Act it went up by 100 per cent to £20.  I hope that in the near future the Minister will have another look at it.</P>
      <P>When one examines what these unfortunate people get one finds, taking the person with one adult dependant and one child dependant, that his income is only £4 4s 6d.  That is inadequate today.  In the published policy of this Party we clearly indicate that we are quite prepared to increase this figure by 40 per cent.  Certainly, when the Minister had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate he should have increased that payment to these unfortunate people who are living in desperate conditions.  Even with the 40 per cent increase one might ask if it would be sufficient.  It would mean that these people would have to live on £5 18s a week.  As was mentioned earlier, it often happens in election times, with Fianna Fáil people moving around, that it is said that if you support any Party other than Fianna Fáil you will lose your unemployment assistance, your old age pension, or your widow's and orphan's pension or any other benefit coming under this heading.  Our people have become mature and I suggest to the Minister and his Party that if in the next election, they have no way of trying to secure votes other than intimidating persons in receipt of social benefits, it is a degrading and a desperate thing for any political Party to stoop to.  As we have clearly indicated, we believe the qualifying age for an old age pension should be lower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely.  If an <Col N="1161" /> old age pensioner applies for a pension, having reached the qualifying age, the means test is so severely operated that if he has £1,000 and disposes of it to his daughters or sons or does anything like that he is deprived of his pension because the Department officials seem to think that is the right thing to do. I certainly do not agree with that.  The means test has been rather rigidly enforced.  Everybody knows what happens in the case of persons seeking the extra 5/-.  Take the new benefit which it was proposed would be paid last year, some 46/- per week to a person looking after an aged parent, whether a daughter or daughter-in-law or nephew or niece.  I think the Minister admitted yesterday in replying to a question that there are only 100 persons in receipt of that benefit.  If that is the situation the scheme has not been operated as it should be and the best means of operating it would be for the official concerned&mdash;a doctor presumably&mdash;to decide whether the person residing in the house is capable of moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from Sligo/Leitrim I am conscious of the fact that quite a number of persons from that area benefit under the Social Welfare Department, many more than in other counties.  We have now reached the stage when the old age pension does not cover the cost of keeping an old age pensioner.  Were it not for the fact that many of them are living with their relatives and are saved the expense of rent and the difficulty of working out their own budgets more of them would have to be sent to the county homes. The majority of old age pensioners get only £3 and only the few who have absolutely no means and no valuation get £3 5s.  Meeting them, as we do, and hearing their grievances we are fully convinced that the time has come to increase the old age pension substantially. It was never more necessary than in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been discussing the matter with social welfare officials and they are surprised that these unfortunate people manage to keep body and soul together.  They go into the home of an old age pensioner and discuss this with him.  They find that the old age pensioners <Col N="1162" /> have it so worked out that one week they will have a shilling, perhaps, over while in another week they will be a shilling in debt.  The same purchases are made week after week and beyond that they cannot go.  It is sad to think that those who gave of their best to rear their children and worked hard on small holdings should find themselves with their families gone to England leaving them with no means except £3 a week to keep body and soul together.  I would ask the Minister, whatever else he does, to try to give old age pensioners a substantial increase.</P>

      <P>I come from a county which adjoins Northern Ireland and when one compares the social welfare benefits paid to our people with the benefits paid to the people in the Six Counties one wonders how our people survive.  It is unbelievable that they can live on such meagre allowances.</P>
      <P>This morning before I came to Dublin I had to contact the Department of Social Welfare by telephone about an aged couple whose allowance has not been paid since 22nd December. That is serious.  I read on the paper this evening that this question had been raised in the Dáil today.  It is very important that the Minister should take it up.  One week people may get the pension on Thursday, the next week they may get it on Saturday or perhaps even by the following Monday morning they may not have got it. This matter has been raised here today and I am certain the Minister will take steps to straighten it out.</P>

      <P>As every Deputy knows a great part of the time a Deputy spends in making representations to Departments is taken up making representations to the Department of Social Welfare and to the Minister for Social Welfare but mainly to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most important Departments in the country because the people this Department helps are <Col N="1163" /> the people with the lowest incomes and the people who are most in need. For this reason the Department must be run on humanitarian lines and possibly unlike any other Department strict adherence to the rules must be abandoned if the necessary service is to be given to the lower income classes. For that reason it is well, even coming towards the end of a session, that the Minister should listen and Deputies should give their views as to how the services should be improved and how we can, within the resources of the State, increase the benefits and allowances to the social welfare classes. The Minister has been told&mdash;I have heard Deputies tell him here&mdash;that the time has come to increase old age pensions.  I am certain that the Minister, coming from a county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said that the problem must be approached in a humanitarian way and that the rules applying to this Department should not be interpreted too strictly.  I would also infer that the rules of debate on the Supplementary Estimate might be stretched a little in order to allow Deputies to bring home to the Minister the facts of the case.  I will bow to your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I will attempt, in so far as I am able, to make the case without contravening the rules.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue that line of argument.  I think the Minister and possibly the House recognise the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that we as Deputies often find when we meet people who claim, and have the right to claim, benefits under the social welfare code is that they tell us that when officials come to investigate their claims, they are rather harsh in their approach and get down to the bare bones of the situation <Col N="1164" /> and that there is very little flexibility in their approach.  Officials are trained to do a job and of course it is hard to blame an official if, when he investigates a case, he goes strictly according to the rules but it can happen that an official who is not familiar with the circumstances of the area in which he is operating might be too harsh in his approach and might not be prepared to listen sympathetically to a reasonable case that might be made to him.  By a reasonable case I mean one in which all the circumstances are examined rather than going strictly according to the rules laid down in any section of the code.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to ensure that when officials, particularly in the west of Ireland, are instructed to investigate claims, they will give them the most sympathetic consideration rather than examining every detail.  We must admit that there are many people who, if they do not get sympathetic treatment, will be institutionalised. Everybody in the House knows the tremendous cost involved in institutionalising a person compared with the cost of maintaining him in his own family.  I am not suggesting that the Minister and his Departmental officials do not know this but there are, I know, investigation officials down the country who do not realise all the factors involved.  I would ask that it should be standard practice in the Department that the approach should be as lenient and as flexible as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to people who have to look after relatives I had a case brought to my notice during the week of a young man whose mother is unable to move from bed.  This young man had been ordered out to work by the local labour exchange.  When he went to work he got a message that his mother was seriously ill and he had to go home. There is a doctor's certificate to prove that this woman will be unable to move around on her own. She needs care and attention but it is not exactly the kind of case that needs to be institutionalised.  However, this man will have to stay at home to look after his mother or else his mother will have to go into an institution.  I always feel <Col N="1165" /> that it is far better to have a person looked after at home than to have them go into an institution.  Under the social welfare code this man can no longer draw unemployment assistance, and he has been so told by the local employment exchange.  The social welfare code should be flexible enough to allow this man to draw his unemployment assistance while he looks after his mother.  I should like the Minister to examine this case, because, while legally my point might not be substantial, in reason something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a person on disability benefit whose stamps run out and who can no longer claim benefit.  This person is told he must get 13 further stamps before he can continue on disability benefit.  If this person is unable to work, how can he get 13 extra stamps?  His doctor's certificate is no good to him.  This rule is so unreasonable that nobody could look at it and say that it is something that should be continued.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to people who qualify for old age pensions in England and come back here to live. These people were born here, their wives were here all their lives and their families were reared here.  They come back from England and just because they are getting an English pension, although it is a mere pittance, and because their income is beyond a certain figure, they are told they are not entitled to the old age pension. Here there is need for a humanitarian and humane approach.  These people who qualified for an old age pension in England were sending money home to keep their families here and to keep the economy and the balance of payments of this country on an even keel. Without them I do not know where this country would be, because recently I found out that emigrants' remittances in the County of Mayo last year were far more than all the social welfare payments that went into the county. There should be more flexibility here, and I should like the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the widows whose husbands were not fully qualified, who were a few stamps short of the 156 that would qualify them for <Col N="1166" /> the full widow's contributory pension. Again, there is this finicky approach where nobody is prepared to bend just that little bit to ensure that the widow gets a contributory pension.  Seeing that the social welfare benefits are not up to the standard of living costs at the present day, the Department should wherever possible bend in the direction of being more humane and more generous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very happy with the debate even though it ranged over a very wide area, considering that it is only a Supplementary Estimate and allowing that at times one could perceive a slightly electoral atmosphere in the contributions.  This money, as I said in my opening statement, was required to provide for the increases given in the Budget to social welfare recipients and to meet cases where the Estimate fell short of what was required.  It will always be impossible in my Department to estimate accurately what is required.  One cannot foresee the contingencies that can arise in any direction, even the number of persons who may attain the qualifying age for pensions or the number of people who may become sick in a particular year.  It is understandable that sometimes there is overestimation and at other times underestimation.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the various points raised by Deputies, but it would be a very long exercise and it is hardly necessary.  Many of them were overlapping, but I shall run over some of them.  Deputy Ryan's opening statement for the Opposition was mainly on principles and I shall come to that later.  He did make reference to the amounts being granted not being sufficient to meet the cost of living. I should like to remind the House that all increases granted, in recent years particularly, were far in excess of what the cost of living index would have justified.  The cost of living was not used as the criterion in making payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte and many other Deputies mentioned the question of English pensions.  It is only necessary for me to say in that regard that an English pension must be regarded as <Col N="1167" /> another form of means.  Just because it is a pension does not mean we can disregard it, unless we pass special legislation to ignore it.  For as long as we have a means test any means of which the applicant is in possession must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In recent answers to Dáil questions I have referred to the problem of persons with English stamp records in relation to the home care of aged people and I pointed out that separate legislation would be required to meet this.  Many people do not qualify under the scheme whereby an extra £2 5s per week is paid in respect of a daughter or step-daughter who has to give up insurable employment to take care of one or both of her parents.  It is merely the beginning of what is, I think, an important scheme.  Many applications have come in, all of which will be carefully examined and all of which should prove valuable in finding out the magnitude of the problem, but many of those who apply cannot possibly have read the publicised qualifications necessary to qualify under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a person who is too young to be in insurable employment: if a young person, who is about to go into insurable employment, stays at home there is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the scheme as it is operated at the moment.  It is designed to meet a particular case.  It is the case of the person in good insurable employment who has to give up that employment to take care of a parent and who, for that reason, does not qualify for unemployment benefit because she is not available for work.  There are people who give up insurable employment, draw unemployment benefit for as long as they can and, by doing so, certify that they are capable and available for and generally seeking work.  Then they apply for benefit in respect of a parent, pointing out they are not available for work because they have to stay at home.  Now they cannot have it both ways.  This is a detail, but it shows the type of problem that can arise.  This <Col N="1168" /> scheme meets the case of the person precluded from qualifying for unemployment benefit because she is tied to the home looking after a parent and does not fulfil the qualifications necessary for benefit.</P>
      <P>This initial toe-in-the-door effort is very valuable and could, I think, lead ultimately to the promotion of a better scheme.  But there are so many things that are desirable one just has to get one's priorities right from the point of view of making the necessary finances available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte raised the case of bankrupt employers whose employees discover that their stamps have not been paid up.  They have no redress. These cases should be a warning to all employed persons to ensure that their cards are being stamped correctly. There is certain action open to such employees and to the Department but, as has been explained frequently here, there are also cases in which there is just nothing to be got.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the three waiting days.  I have answered questions on this matter recently.  One of the things which justifies these three days is the frequency with which we would have people getting occasional days now and again.  The short-term applicants would increase if we did not have this waiting period.  This does not hurt the intermittent applicant for benefit.  In his case, unless a period of, I think, 13 weeks has elapsed, there are no waiting days and so the inconvenience, if any, is minimised in those cases which might be most adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte referred to free travel, free electricity and free television and radio licences.  He could see no merit in them.  All he feared&mdash;he was, of course, talking politically&mdash;was that people might attempt to claim credit for providing these facilities; he said it cost nothing to have them carried on the buses; nothing to give them free electricity and nothing to provide them with free television and radio licences because all the bodies involved were State sponsored.  That is so much nonsense. The services are paid for.  The free travel is a very useful amenity because it enables old people to go <Col N="1169" /> out and visit.  I am glad the facility is availed of to a considerable extent. It is an excellent scheme.  It will cost a good deal; it is not just a book transaction as far as we are concerned. It will be paid for by the taxpayer ultimately.  The same is true of electricity and television and radio licences. All these schemes are movements in the right direction, towards doing things for the older people among us, things which extra money granted to them would not give them.  I should like to see more of this type of assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte referred to a specific case in his home town.  Other speakers also raised specific cases.  I should like them to write to me giving me all the details and I shall have them examined to see if anything can be done.  We will always have marginal cases.  That is inevitable in any scheme.  So long as there is a means test there will always be marginal cases.  I do not think there is much one can do at the moment to eliminate such cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully dealt with the things he would like to see improved.  He paid tribute, I am glad to say, to the officials of my Department.  It is very easy for all of us to indulge in attacks on faceless people who administer schemes.  It is not often we hear tribute paid to them.  They are not infallible.  They may make mistakes. Sometimes we have not enough of them to do the amount of work that has to be done and we have to suffer the occasional embarrassment of unnecessary delay, but 99 times out of 100 there is just cause for any delay that occurs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully had a complaint, which he said was referred to him by an ex-employee of the Department, regarding a file dealing with an old age pensioner being given to another Minister or shown to another Minister. I can only say quite frankly that I cannot equate what he said with anything I have known to happen in the Department in my time.  I do not see anything wrong in any Minister of any Government, at any time, having the right to see any file in any Department. I hope that will always be the case. Frankly I was never asked by any member of the Government to show him a file on an old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> Old age pensions are decided by appeals officers who have statutory functions, and interference with them by Deputies on any side of the House so far as I am aware is nil.  Even if it were not, interference would be ineffective. Deputies have the right to put forward cases in support of particular claims and to give information they may have which others may not have had.  I can neither confirm nor deny this complaint because I have absolutely no knowledge of it.  If the Deputy were more specific about it, it might recall something to my mind that would make the cap fit.  At the moment I cannot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised a number of matters which are well known to be what might be called minor anomalies. I was disappointed that he did not refer to some of the matters about which he used to complain.  We have tidied them up in recent times.  Nearly every year when the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the House, we take the opportunity to correct some of the things which we learn about in the course of the administration of schemes which are part of the social welfare code. These all go to solidify and co-ordinate a system which, despite what anyone says, I think is the superstructure of a good social welfare code, on which any Government can continue to build, to expand and to improve.  It is a superstructure which is well laid, and it is not a lot of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions or piecemeal schemes as some people would suggest.  I could submit it for examination to anyone who is inclined to make these remarks or allegations quite glibly, or perhaps after a superficial examination of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to access to appeals officers.  I do not know if anyone has any particular privilege in regard to appeals officers.  I should like to refute this.  When people write to me, if there is information they can give which has a bearing on the case, it is brought to the attention of the appeals officer if and when he is deciding the case.  Deputy Murphy, this year as well as last year, dealt with something which I often talked about in this House particularly when I was on that side of it and, indeed, on this <Col N="1171" /> side too, that is, the question of providing employment for unemployed persons.  I do not know if the Deputy would believe how deeply we have examined that problem in the Department. I can only say it is a very difficult problem and one which it is not as easy to solve as he suggested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy suggested that this money should be used to provide factories or industries, and that there should be more co-ordination and liaison between Departments in order to provide work for these people.  The people receiving these benefits are scattered all over the country in different places and, unless we start an employment camp of some kind and bring them all into it, it is not as simple as the Deputy suggests.  There are small pockets here and there from Cork to Donegal, and the amount which they are receiving would, unfortunately, play a very poor part in establishing an industry which would be suitable for their employment.  The whole basis in dealing with the social services must be the provision of employment, and the provision of suitable employment is not always easy for particular age groups.  That must be perfectly obvious to everyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty referred to specific cases also.  He has a question down for answer tomorrow.  Again it is a question of delay.  I will not go into it because it is an individual case and the name is supplied, but I can assure him that, if he went into it very accurately, he would find that there are good reasons why it was not merely difficult but practically impossible for a speedy decision to be taken in that case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to a number of specific cases also, all of which I think he said he had brought to our attention already.  One related to free electricity for a sister and brother living together.  The brother is an old age pensioner.  I should like to remind persons who may have that type of problem that this is a case that could qualify if the sister's care is essential to the brother with whom she is living.  However, in this case the Deputy made it clear that the brother <Col N="1172" /> was a very active man, even more active than the sister.  He also advocated pensions at 65 years as did most Deputies.  I will deal with that in a general way later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell was highly dissatisfied with the approach of the Department to the whole question of giving social welfare benefits.  He said we were pursuing a Victorian plimsoll line approach to these matters.  I should like to point out again that we should understand that we cannot apply just a humanitarian approach. Deputy Lyons suggested we should be flexible and sympathetic in our approach.  The people who go out as investigation officers and who are in any way concerned with compiling the necessary information which leads to a decision on qualification must necessarily be guided by the statutory regulations which we in this House have laid down for them.  It does not permit of a personal decision however one may be motivated by a desire to help and to have a humane approach and however one's conscience might be likely to react.</P>
    <P>Hard and fast rules are laid down for the application of a means test and, while we have a means test, we must ascertain whether a person is qualified or not.  In order to do that, I am afraid you cannot avoid having a certain approach and asking for certain information.  It may be that in their approach some of these officers are not as courteous as they should be but, by and large, they are usually regarded as people who observe all the necessary courtesies.  Indeed, any instruction or training they have in that respect is towards making their approach in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>They go there to help the applicants, although people sometimes feel they go there to hinder them.  The idea that they are out to prevent people from getting what they are entitled to is wrong.  They are there to learn if the person is qualified according to the regulations.  Even where the means test does not apply there are other regulations and qualifications.  You do not get benefits in any country in the world just as you go to a railway station and buy a railway ticket.  You have to <Col N="1173" /> satisfy certain conditions about your contributions, about your medical condition. You do not march up to the hatch and say that you want your benefit because you are ill.  We must have people who know these regulations to see that the applicants qualify under them.  If they do not get the proper information the first time they have to go through the matter again and again and then delays occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell questioned the medical qualifications of these appeals officers.  They have available to them the advice of the medical referees who are men well qualified and accustomed to dealing with cases of every kind. They may resort to obtaining specialist advice if that is found to be necessary. To those who criticise this system I would say that sympathy and social conscience are not the things which guide an official, however much he would like to use this yardstick.  He must obey the statutory regulations laid down for him by this House. If we can relax the regulations and completely abolish the means test then we can go knocking at the doors of the people and asking if there is anyone inside who wants social benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy at the beginning of his speech complained about the cost of the social welfare stamp and then finished up by proposing that there should be all contributory benefits and that all should be made to pay for the benefits to those who are not employed. I would like to see everybody contributing so as to be able to operate a system similar to that operated in other countries where they have 100 per cent employment insurance but we have a big assistance section directly financed by the Exchequer. We have a relatively small number of insured persons and in that situation the social welfare burden is relatively a very heavy one.  Deputy Ryan was making comparisons about the lack of progress made by us and I went to the trouble to obtain figures which show that we are paying one-fourth of our total tax revenue in social welfare, which is not bad.  I think it is excellent. The remarkable increase in the last ten years, as I have frequently said, is the greatest assurance of our catching up in the near future with many of the <Col N="1174" /> other countries operating this insurance system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara from the west of Ireland, defended what is commonly known as the dole, or unemployment assistance.  He is in a position to know a few things about it.  Sometimes unfair criticism is made of this system. When we applied the means test to small farmers it was done for the purpose of enabling a small farmer to qualify for unemployment assistance and at the same time not to regard this unemployment assistance as a disincentive to operating his holding to the best advantage.  In the past we were accused of putting a premium on laziness and on doing nothing because it was pointed out that if a small farmer improved his holding he would lose the unemployment assistance.  Under the new system any extra income accruing from the better management of the holding, the selling of a few more cattle or an increase in tillage, does not affect the amount of unemployment assistance of which the smallholder is in receipt.</P>
    <P>This is a step in the right direction. Deputy O'Hara rightly pointed out that the smallholder or the rural recipient of unemployment assistance who spent it on his children or on the provision of the necessaries of life for his family spends it with the shopkeeper.  So there is a circulation of money which is very necessary and which has been a great help in maintaining at home many people with large families who otherwise would have had to leave.  Like Deputy O'Hara, I make no apology for this and I entirely agree that it provides an essential circulation of money in areas where people who criticise the system would be very slow to go to live at all.  I think that covers most of the points made by the various speakers.</P>

      <P>The question which was most referred to was that of British pensions being assessed as means.  I have already dealt with that. Such pensions are regarded as the same as any other means.  We would have to bring in legislation to disregard them the same as had to be done by the Department of Defence in respect of service pensions.  You must consider the fact that our own people have to be content with one pension only. These people are lucky in having a pension which puts them above the limit.  That is their good luck.  I think it was Deputy Treacy who suggested the abolition of sub-committees.  He said they were a useless lot who did not perform a very good function.  I am one of those who believe that the sub-committees should be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a very hard and fast opinion.  I could be persuaded to abolish the system but I did see one particular use for them: they do act as a buffer between the State and the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It started because the Minister's predecessor said he would abolish them.  He said they were useless.  We know where the idea came from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>They very often make themselves appear useless when they make recommendations which <Col N="1176" /> they know are not in accordance with the facts before them.  But many of them go into the cases very carefully and recommend what they think is near enough to the correct thing.  They often possess information, due to intimate knowledge of the applicant, which can be helpful.  They can perform a useful function in that way. The investigation officers have been castigated and accused of being too severe and unduly difficult but they know that their work will be examined. I can see use in them.</P>
      <P>I shall not go into the whole question of home assistance now, much as I should like to.  We have it under examination.  It has some good points too.  At one time I was not prepared to admit it had any good points but, however antiquated or Victorian it may be, one advantage is that the intimate knowledge is there, too, with regard to the applicant.  The home assistance officer can go to the house concerned and immediately pay benefit. This is something we could not do. Therefore, irrespective of what change may take place, I should like that immediate and intimate contact to be preserved because it is one of the strongest points of the scheme, if it has any good points.  There is much improvement to be made in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Those people who talk about having the qualifying age for old age pension reduced to 65 may not have read the Long Title to the Bill which I introduced in the Mansion House on 21st January, 1969.  It will be a first step towards paying pensions at 65.  We shall also provide death grants.  Somebody referred to funeral services and complained that the home assistance code does not provide coaches for the mourners.  Death grants will be payable to the relatives of the insured person or to the dependants in the case of death.  The Bill will also provide for pensions for invalids on a limited scale. These are very definite steps in the right direction.  Every social welfare scheme we have introduced tended to expand immediately.  One has only to look back on the children's allowances scheme to note the various improvements made down through the years which I hope will continue to be made as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Nobody can divorce improvements in the social welfare code from the fundamental basis of all that one can do, namely, economic expansion. Deputies frequently deride the suggestion that we are keeping the services expanded in accordance with economic expansion and improved national income. These are the factors which must basically receive prior attention if we are to get to the root of the cause and eliminate in many cases the necessity for having to pay social welfare benefits. I said here last year or the year before, and on many other occasions, that no Minister will ever be told from the Opposition side of the House&mdash; irrespective of what Government are in office &mdash; that he is doing enough for the welfare classes.  It is an emotional subject and the nearer it comes to election time the higher the bidding goes.  I do not think we should allow ourselves in regard to this serious matter to enter into any serious auction on what we should like to do, had decided to do or proposed to do for the weaker sections of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could sense that atmosphere as Deputy Lyons was speaking.  Let us hope that we shall always be prepared to devote a generous percentage of the national income to these very important sections&mdash;particularly the old people, the widow and the invalids.  Any improvement in the economic system or in society, as such, cannot much improve the position of these sections.  You cannot make an old man young.  The only thing you can do is to ensure that he gets reasonable comfort.  This we can do by continuing to apply more of the nation's wealth to his wellbeing, whether in cash or in kind&mdash;such matters as the free travel scheme, the free electricity scheme, the free television licence scheme.  I should like to commend highly those persons who are doing much useful work for the old people.  Indeed, I would hope the day will not be far distant when myself or the Minister for Health, or both of us, will cooperate with the social workers who are doing useful jobs which nobody but they can do. <Col N="1178" /> These are things which make the life of these people happier and which, at times, provide assistance which no Department of State could give.  I think of the meals on wheels and such types of service.  I hope that in our future extension of the health services, these things will get a high priority.  That is my objective.</P>
      <P>I mentioned already that we are preparing draft legislation for what the British call &ldquo;graduated benefits&rdquo; under a pay-related scheme.  I would hope that we would have it available soon. Again, it is a scheme that has caused a good deal of research and a good deal of work for the limited staff we have available for it in the Department. I am glad that reasonably good progress has been made and that the scheme will shortly see the light of day. This is only one of a number of schemes: there will be other times to talk about them.  I would not have dealt at such length with this Supplementary Estimate tonight but for the fact that, without casting any reflection on the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Acting Chairman, the debate did tend to range over a very wide field.  In fact, to me, the debate was no different from a general debate on my annual Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £60,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána including Pensions, etc., and for Payments of Compensation and other Expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Forces; and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is largely of a routine character and the net sum required, that is £60,000, represents the difference between increases which have arisen on certain subheads and savings which it has been possible to make in other items. The increases come to a gross total of £173,500 but this is partially offset by savings totalling £113,500, mainly on subheads F and G.  The additional sum of £30,000 required in subhead A arises from the introduction last October of mid-monthly advances of pay to those sergeants and guards who are still paid on a monthly basis. This is an interim measure pending the general application of weekly pay to those ranks.  Payments totalling £100,000 which have been made in mid-March would normally not have arisen until the 1st April and would be a charge on next year's Vote.  There have been savings of £70,000 on the subhead so that an extra £30,000 is now required.  There will, of course, be a corresponding adjustment next year.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £80,000 is required for subhead B mainly to cover increases in rates of locomotion and subsistence allowances which were made retrospective to January and April, 1968, and increased removal expenses rates which were made retrospective to July, 1964.  All these changes in rates were negotiated under the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead E. 1 is a new subhead to provide specific approval for the payment of an annual Grant-in-Aid of £3,500 to the Garda Síochána Medical <Col N="1180" /> Aid Society.  This replaces a corresponding annual expenditure on the provision of medicines for members of the former Dublin Metropolitan Division. As shown in the Supplementary Estimate, this payment was originally provided for under subhead E and I am advised that the change-over brings the payment into line with Grants-in-Aid generally.</P>
    <P>Finally, a net sum of £60,000 is required to make good a deficiency in the payment made from the Road Fund to subhead H, Appropriations-in-Aid. The amount of this payment, which falls to be determined by the Minister for Local Government with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, had not been finally decided upon when the main Estimate was printed.  In the event, the actual payment will now be £70,000 smaller than the figure shown in the main Estimate.  This deficit of £70,000 is offset to the extent of £10,000 by an unexpected buoyancy in Miscellaneous Receipts, so that the net deficit is £60,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael support this Estimate as it is money necessarily required to meet the expenses outlined by the Minister.  Any money which is spent on the Garda Síochána is money very well spent.  They are a body of men of which this country can be rightly proud.  It is composed of some of the finest citizens in our community and they render singular service to our people, most of the time far beyond the call of duty.  Sometimes I am very much impressed, as I am sure the Minister must have been in his private capacity as an officer of the court, at the manner in which the gardaí will frequently, out of their own pockets, contribute money to many worthy causes and the number of occasions on which gardaí, again out of their own pockets, will come to the assistance of people who come under their notice in order to assist them in whatever difficulties might have brought them under the notice of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore appropriate that when we are voting some money to these men we should reject the mischievous accusations which have been made by <Col N="1181" /> an irresponsible element in the community that gardaí have been guilty of brutality.  It is an extraordinary thing that the more force some people are prepared to use to get their unlawful ends the more they are inclined to accuse the Garda of brutality.  Those who live by force can hardly expect to be treated with velvet gloves.  Those who seek to cause mischief can hardly expect people to sympathise with them when the forces of law and order in our midst endeavour to obstruct their ill-designed aims.  Therefore, once again we applaud the Garda Síochána and are only too glad to see even some small modifications in the conditions of their service and the conditions of their retirement.  They are all highly deserved and we in Fine Gael welcome them.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear what the Minister means by the last paragraph of his speech.  It is not very clear to Deputies what exactly is covered by payments made from the Road Fund to subhead H, and I would appreciate some clarification of the type of expenditure covered by the £60,000 which is the main figure in the Supplementary Estimate.  I must say that I have been impressed to see in Bettystown, County Meath, on Saturdays and Sundays and on days when considerable traffic accumulates near the very popular beach, moveable &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs which are apparently erected by the Garda Síochána.  It is the only place in which I have seen signs of this kind. I do not know why they have not been availed of elsewhere.  I do not know whether this is due to failure on the part of local authorities or the Garda Síochána elsewhere to comprehend the value of such notices.  One of the great dangers we have at present is that traffic prohibitions of one kind or another are erected which are suitable to certain days of the week but not to others.  This is the kind of thing which leads to lack of respect for signs.  The Garda Síochána have statutory functions in regard to these signs and, rather than erecting signs which apply for seven days of the week, I would like to see a much greater use of the type of signs they have in Bettystown which are entirely appropriate on a small number of days of the year and if they <Col N="1182" /> are crucially valuable on such occasions they would be equally inappropriate on most days of the year.</P>
    <P>Similar situations arise from time to time in the Dublin area but I have yet to see any signs of a similar kind.  Likewise, I urge that the gardaí be equipped with ample signs to indicate the location of traffic accidents.  It is unfair to the gardaí themselves to be required to investigate accidents, take measurements on roads and so on without adequate warning being given to approaching motorists of the existence of the accident or the presence on the road of members of the gardaí. It is also unfair to approaching motorists not to be warned of obstructions lying ahead.  If the money under subhead H is being devoted to anything of that kind in the provision of what I might call dynamic traffic signs we certainly would welcome it.  It is very necessary in the interests of the Garda Síochána and the road-using public.  I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to support the Estimate.  As I said on a previous occasion I want to say how glad I am to pay tribute to the gardaí and the work they are doing.  Under extreme provocation most of them behave very well.  It appears as if they are sometimes pretty scarce.  If it is a question of a shortage of gardaí it should be possible to call up for training applicants who have been examined and passed but are left waiting a very long time.  If the training period could be speeded up it would help considerably to relieve gardaí who appear to be asked to do more than they should be asked to do.  Could the Minister say if there is a special section of training dealing with courtesy because, while 99.9 per cent of the gardaí, particularly those with some service, appear to be very courteous and patient under provocation, the odd one seems to spoil the whole picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had two examples of this recently. One was when I was coming to Dublin the week before last.  Repairs were proceeding on a section of the road and a <Col N="1183" /> young garda was routing city-bound traffic around the repairs, or at least, the outside lane, and making a very good job of it.  There were two traffic lights there at this period.  The following morning as I approached, the lights changed just as I passed them.  The car in front of me stopped before the road repairs and as there was a car behind me I had no option but to drive up alongside the first car to free the other road coming into the intersection.  The garda there signalled me up, stopped me and said: &ldquo;Red means stop.  I saw you sneaking up behind that fellow. Go on, now.&rdquo; I could have done a number of things but after a little contemplation I did none of them and drove on to the city.</P>
    <P>This young man would obviously make his living in various ways but being a garda is not one of them.  He should have been taught a little manners. This sort of thing, having happened to me, would undoubtedly happen to many people passing that place. If he was in bad humour at having to go on traffic duty at that hour of the morning he should not take it out on motorists.  Incidentally, the question of the amount of patrol duty that the gardaí are able to do makes one wonder whether there are sufficient gardaí to do it.  Six or eight months ago there was a car at Dublin Airport crossing.  It had either been stolen or deposited there for some other reason. It was an almost new car and it stayed there until it was taken away bit by bit.  I am sure the gardaí saw it there. I could see it while passing by.  I mentioned it to one garda and he said: &ldquo;We do go out and have a look at it.&rdquo; Having a look at it during the day did not prevent it disappearing.  Somebody owned that car.  About three weeks ago, in almost the same position, another car appeared which was obviously stolen and abandoned.  It has also been disappearing.  The wheels are now gone and no doubt the windscreen and doors will follow.  If the gardaí see a car abandoned for a couple of days I think they should take the necessary steps to ensure that it is not left until vandals make away with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the job <Col N="1184" /> being done at Bettystown during the summer.  I want to congratulate the gardaí on that job also.  We have a very good development association and a good county council and when we need assistance we simply ask the Garda to help.  Not only do they put up signs to show where it is possible to park and where it is not, but if the traffic is too dense, out of their very sparse Force they put gardaí along the route to direct traffic at peak periods. We are very grateful to them because they make it possible for people to get into and out of this very popular seaside resort.  Much more of this work could be done in other parts of the country; it is simply a matter of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Most of the gardaí are very courteous. I find any of them I have any dealings with, meeting them and discussing things with them, are people to whom you can talk.  The senior officers are usually very sensible men who appear to have been promoted because they are good public relations officers also.  It would, therefore, be a pity if the type of thing I mentioned earlier were allowed to spoil the record of a good Force.</P>
    <P>While it may be outside this Estimate, may I ask the Minister if it has finally been decided to abandon hope of having a Garda Band again?  If so, what has happened the instruments? Does the Minister know?  Is there a hope that at some future date we may again see a Garda Band in operation?</P>
    <P>The Minister refers in his Estimate to an additional sum of £80,000 required for subhead B mainly to cover increases in rates of locomotion&mdash;a very nice word&mdash;and subsistence allowances and increased removal expense rates which were made retrospective to July, 1964.  All these changes in rates were negotiated under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  I quite agree that this is right but is there an effort being made now to keep the rates of pay for gardaí in line with rates outside?  I think it was before the Minister took over the Department, but he will be aware that on a previous occasion the fact that nobody seemed to worry very much until it was almost too late meant that there were many dissatisfied gardaí, who <Col N="1185" /> found they could do very much better elsewhere.  As a result many very good officers were lost to the Force because they were not adequately remunerated for the work they were doing.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to mention again that all the detection work in the world will not help unless the Minister can do something about regularising the treatment of young brats taken to court for doing things for which they should receive severe punishment.  Despite all the efforts of the gardaí to bring these people to book the gardaí usually end up disgusted by a district justice or somebody of that kind giving the young lads a lecture and saying: &ldquo;You will be a good boy; you will not allow that to happen again.&rdquo;  Off he goes and within hours he is stealing cars, breaking into places or, worse still, smashing up private and public property. I, for the Labour Party, support the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene briefly, mainly to put on record how much I deplore the proposal to reduce the strength of Garda barracks in rural areas.  The Minister himself is a rural Deputy coming from the west of Ireland and he appreciates to the same extent as I do the part the Garda Síochána play in the rural community. I was greatly dissatisfied with the proposals which were brought before us recently to close down in some cases country stations and in other cases to reduce the strength of Garda stations in rural areas.</P>

      <P>That is principally what I rose to speak on.  There are other matters appertaining to the Garda force which I could mention now.  I will not, as I know the House does not wish to be delayed at this time.  Before I sit down I should just like to wish our Garda oarsmen every success on their trip to London for the Putney Head of the River race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  First of all, I should like to apologise for not being here when the Minister spoke.  I was not aware that he was getting up and I did not appreciate that he was going to be so brief in his comments.</P>
      <P>I do not want to open any discussion on this but I think it should be said&mdash;I referred to it on the main Estimate&mdash; that in this country, particularly nowadays, when there are few pictures being painted in public other than pictures of gloom and depression, perhaps too few of us recognise that one of the big success stories in this country was the establishment and development of the unarmed Garda force.  The country as a whole owes a debt of gratitude to the Garda force which has been established and developed.  It would be entirely wrong if in this House we were to view the Garda force at any time through mean or niggardly eyes.  I am not suggesting that that has been the attitude of the House in dealing with the Garda because I think, by and large, even though we may overlook the origin and the development over the years of the Garda force, there is a real appreciation, both inside the House and outside it, of the valuable services that are rendered day in, day out, night in, night out, by the members of our unarmed Garda force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I am saying that is because I want to ask the Minister, and I think it comes within the confines of this discussion, the position with regard to the question of Garda pensions and pensions of retired members of the Garda.  The Minister in his opening remarks referred to the fact that this Estimate was for salaries and expenses of the Garda <Col N="1187" /> Síocnána, including pensions.  I think I am correct in saying that, other than that reference to pensions, there was nothing further in the Minister's statement with regard to them.  I want to ask the Minister in a general way what is the present position and what are the prospects in so far as Garda pensions are concerned.</P>
    <P>I only want to make one other point.  I will do it very briefly, because Deputy Tully has already made the point.  Deputy Tully is quite right when he points out that the gardaí on traffic duty or &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo; have in some sense a definite public relations job to do.  Certainly, in my experience the gardaí on display, whether it be on traffic duty or &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo;, do perform not only the immediate task assigned to them but do a good public relations job for the administration of justice and the preservation of law and order. If one does come across the occasional garda, who for one reason or another, whether it is that he is inexperienced or that he is not for some reason in a particularly good mood, dealing with traffic or anything else who is a bit abrupt or discourteous, the bad impression it creates goes far beyond the particular incident concerned. One garda who may be discourteous at a particular traffic point to one or two users of the road can give a bad impression which will extend far beyond the garda concerned and may give an unfavourable impression of the Garda force as a whole. In that sense Deputy Tully is right when he refers to the public relations aspect of the work of the gardaí. Generally speaking they are, both in that sense and in the actual performance of their particular tasks or assignments, doing a good job.  The Garda force in this country do give a very favourable impression not only to our own people but to visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>In so far as we are concerned&mdash;I mentioned this on the main Estimate &mdash;if an increase in the Garda force is necessary, if better pay or better conditions are necessary to attract recruits into the Garda if further recruiting <Col N="1188" /> is necessary, then my own view is that we should not hesitate to provide the necessary funds for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I should very much have liked to have had an opportunity of supporting the views of Deputy Molloy with regard to the closing of rural Garda stations. I shall not open a discussion on it other than to say that very often the excuse advanced for the closing of Garda stations is the absence of crime in a particular area.  I have urged on the Minister's predecessors that it is worthwhile considering if the true position is not that the very existence of the Garda station is the reason for the absence of crime in the area.  It seems to me that it is possibly putting the cart before the horse to use the absence of crime in a particular area as a justification for closing down the Garda station.  However, as you have very properly pointed out, Sir, this is not a matter that falls for discussion on this Supplementary Estimate, and I suppose we will all have an opportunity again of giving our views on that subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the manner in which they have received this Supplementary Estimate and, in particular, for the tributes paid by Deputies from all Parties to the Garda Síochána.  I fully subscribe to the views expressed by Deputies as to the general reputation of our gardaí amongst the people.  Indeed, one would want to have my experience of the appeals I get, of the deputations I receive week in and week out, from different communities asking that gardaí are not changed.  It is the participation of the gardaí in community effort which is making such a very big impact throughout the country today.  From the correspondence I receive from certain towns one would imagine that the local GAA club, the local boxing club, even the local dramatic club and other social activities would all fold up if Garda so-and-so was changed.  That is about the best tribute that could be paid to our police force, that they are participating so much and so effectively, particularly in rural Ireland, in the activities of the community amongst <Col N="1189" /> whom they live and serve.  While the gardaí know that it is one of their occupational hazards that they must be changed from time to time, it is heartening to me in another sense to find that the general public express such regard for them.</P>
      <P>I particularly liked at this time the objections expressed by some Deputies to the attempts by some people to brand our police force with the label of police brutality.  I saw this outside my own Department not so very long ago.  A number of young people&mdash; perhaps that is the wrong expression; it was difficult to tell, between the length of their beards, the colours of their shirts and the length of their hair what age group they belonged to&mdash; marched up to my Department and before they even got near a garda they were carrying protest signs with &ldquo;Police Brutality&rdquo; printed on them. In these days it is heartening to hear Deputies publicly paying tribute to our Garda force.  It shows that this type of stunting, which may be got up for outside consumption, will not wash with the general public or with their representatives here in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan asked me what connection the Road Fund had with the Estimate for the Garda, and he sought clarification of the payments from the Road Fund to the Garda Vote under subhead A.  The Road Fund pays to the Garda force certain sums in recognition of the time spent by the Force on road traffic duty.  The main payment is a small percentage, at present two per cent, of the income of the Road Fund.  Also, the proceeds of fines for road traffic offences are, in the first instance, paid into the Road Fund and then transferred to the Garda Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked whether the young gardaí are instructed in courtesy.  Indeed, on my very first visit to their training centre in Templemore, I put that very question to those concerned there.  They expressed the same views as Deputy Tully and other Deputies have expressed on the importance of inculcating courtesy in our young gardaí or, putting it another way, the development of <Col N="1190" /> public relations in dealing with the public.  I was told that this was being stressed in the training of these young men, that in order to be successful in their careers they would have to rely on the co-operation of the public.  They are taught to be courteous on all occasions.  I suppose any Force of this size would always get the odd-manout, and unfortunately Deputy Tully came across one of them.  I think in the main he would really except them from the general run of gardaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully said the garda to whom he referred was a young man.  There is an old saying that it is hard to put an old head on young shoulders.  Looking around these days, sometimes it is hard to put an old head on old shoulders, and perhaps Deputy Tully came across the wrong example of a young man.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully suggested that the rates of pay for the Garda should be in line with those outside.  Up to this, Garda pay has been a matter for the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, and the Government have honoured in full all agreements and findings which emerged from that scheme.  Since I came in as Minister for Justice I have, as the Deputy knows, set up the Conroy Commission especially to go into all these questions of pay and so on.  The Commission is at present working and it would be wrong for me to say anything further about it except that I would not have set up that Commission in the first instance unless I felt there was a general need for a broad look at the structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that part of the agreement I made with the Garda Representative Body was that while this Commission would be working they would get the nine per cent that was awarded to the public service, and that was accepted as being a fair approach.  I hope this Commission will do a very thorough job.  We have got as impartial a Commission as could be devised by me and I am relying on them to do a good job.  I do not expect a very long delay.  I want, as I say, the job to be thoroughly done. Deputy Tully inquired about the Garda Band.  I understand the instruments were given as a gift to the Garda Benevolent Association and the committee are in control of the instruments. As far as I know they still have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not make any statement on this without examining the matter fully.  Deputy Molloy travelled a line of country into which I do not propose to follow him now.  I thank him for his tribute to the Garda.  I am sure he will appreciate that I am getting constant demands, from city Deputies in particular, for more and more gardaí here in Dublin to deal with increasing crime and increasing vandalism.  It is a question of utilising the Force as effectively as we possibly can, and if manpower were not so <Col N="1192" /> scarce, I would be inclined to agree with the view expressed by some Deputies that it is better to have at least one local garda rather than close down barracks completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the closing of barracks has created problems for social welfare recipients because they used to sign on in the local Garda barracks.  Now they have to travel several miles.  George's Cross is a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give me particulars I will look into the matter.  I know in my own part of the country the gardaí go out to the different areas in which stations have been closed down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins raised the question of Garda pensions.  Pensions are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  For some years now all public service pensioners&mdash;civil servants, gardaí, teachers and so on&mdash;have had their pensions increased on a common basis by the Minister for Finance. There was a small saving in the provision for superannuation this year because as many as anticipated did not retire.  The Supplementary Estimate is, as I said, largely of a routine character and part of it represents extra payments which arose from agreements made during the year under review between the Garda Representative Body and my Department.</P>
      <P>I thank the House once more for the unanimous tributes paid to the Garda force.  These tributes will be appreciated by the men.  They have, as has been said, exercised commendable restraint in the face of very grave provocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £353,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for Grants-in-Aid to Universities and Colleges and to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to enable additional grants to be made as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) £218,000 to pay increases in the salaries of the academic staffs of three colleges of the National University of Ireland, Trinity College and the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies;</P>
      <P>(b) £130,000 towards reduction of the deficit in the accounts of University College, Dublin, and</P>
      <P>(c) £5,000 to meet the grant shortfall in respect of current commitments on publications by the School of Celtic Studies of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay increases being provided for are those resulting from the application of the 11th round of nine per cent to the staffs of the four university colleges and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  The supplementary amounts being provided relate to the period 1st <Col N="1194" /> June, 1968, to 31st March, 1969, and are as follows:</P>
    <P>UCD, £85,000.</P>
    <P>UCC, £30,500.</P>
    <P>UCG, £25,000.</P>
    <P>TCD, £70,000.</P>
    <P>DIAS, £7,500.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that on the basis of current revenue and expenditure there would be a deficit of £130,000 in the accounts of the college in the case of UCD for the year ending 30th June, 1969.  This position could not have been accurately foreseen at the stage of the preparation of the original Estimate for the financial year 1968-69.  It is proposed, accordingly, to make good this deficit by way of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5,000 is being provided for the School of Celtic Studies to meet the shortfall between the expenditure incurred and the grant provided for publications in the current year.  Expenditure on publications is subject to relatively wide fluctuations and it is difficult to anticipate the incidence of expenditure arising in each particular year.  An amount of £13,000 is due for payment by the School of Celtic Studies in respect of publications in 1968-69, compared with the sum of £8,000 originally provided for the purpose in the relevant section of the subhead of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this Estimate.  I just want to ask the Minister a couple of questions with regard to it.  As the Minister mentioned, the Estimate is to enable certain additional grants which he mentioned to be made.  The first he mentioned is a sum of £218,000 to pay increases in salaries of the academic staffs.  I think that the Minister has made it clear&mdash;it is implicit in his statement&mdash;that this sum is purely for the purpose of paying increases in salaries, and that it is not for the purpose&mdash;I am putting this in the form of a query &mdash;of expanding the academic staff in the colleges?  I would hope that I am incorrect in that, but I do not think I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I would hope I am incorrect is that, it seems to me&mdash;and I do not want to open a discussion on it in <Col N="1195" /> a general way&mdash;that one of the drawbacks which has been highlighted by recent events in the university field is that you have, on the one hand, the problem of gross overcrowding so far as the students are concerned and, on the other hand, the problem of inadequate staffing.  Consequently, you have an inadequate staff-student ratio.  The question I want to put to the Minister is whether the sum of £218,000 being provided now will go any way towards relieving that situation, or is it simply, as it seems to me is the case, for the purpose of paying increases in salaries to existing academic staff members.</P>
    <P>The other point I wanted to ask the Minister about is the next sum of £130,000 which he mentioned as being towards a reduction of the deficit in the accounts of UCD.  Am I not correct in taking it that it is not merely a reduction in the deficit, but that it is a question of wiping it out by this payment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Estimate.  If it is necessary it is necessary. Like Deputy O'Higgins, I am wondering whether this £218,000 is to pay increases in the salaries of the academic staffs.  Can anything be done to improve the present position?  It appears that, apart from the improvement to the buildings which appear to be entirely inadequate and becoming more inadequate, the number of the academic staff available seems to be much less than what is required.  Can the Minister say if any arrangements have been made, or are being made, to try to relieve that position?  We know the Government will say, and rightly so, that the influx of students as a result of the change in our educational system has created a big problem but, surely this problem could have been foreseen, and surely something could be done now to try to remedy the problem which has been created?  Otherwise it will become greater year by year and, in a relatively short time, we might find that the number of students looking for places in the universities and the number of places available, would bear no relation at all to each other.  I wonder could the Minister say&mdash;a question was asked last week and I did not <Col N="1196" /> get the answer; I do not know if it was given&mdash;the number of foreign students who are in fact getting places in Irish universities as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express to the Minister my concern over the financing of the universities in general, and I have particularly in mind the Galway University.  I am glad to see that whatever extra few pounds are needed to finish off the present financial year are being provided.  We know that the teacher ratio is not at the level at which we should like it to be, and we know there is a need for equipment in the laboratories and in the different medical schools and engineering schools to keep up with modern developments, all involving added expenditure.  Indeed, we are fully aware of the fact that the students facilities provided in the universities are at best only minimal. There is need for a great improvement in this respect, all of which involves further investment by the Government in the development of our universities, which brings me to the point I want to make.</P>
      <P>I feel that at present the universities which we have are ideally situated in as much as there are two universities in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway. I have a slight fear that, with the tremendous growth which has taken place in the universities in Dublin, we will arrive at a situation in which we will have some kind of colossus or monstrosity in Dublin which really will not be a university at all.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for the co-operative way in which the House has accepted this Supplementary Estimate which relates to very practical matters.  First of all, it provides for pay increases related to the nine per cent increase for the academic staffs of the institutions I have mentioned, and secondly for a reduction of the deficit which had arisen.  It was a question, in fact, of wiping out the deficit which had arisen due to the colossal expansion in the numbers of students in UCD which was not anticipated and gave rise to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there was the other problem which was referred to by one Deputy without relating to the overall picture.  This Supplementary Estimate is purely related to the nine per cent increase to the staff.  The question of providing staff is related to that matter. It is a problem which has relation to our universities and I am well aware of the fact that considerably increased investment will be required in higher education to meet the explosion among our young people in the desire for higher education, an explosion which was not anticipated.  I do not make a political point of this, but I make the point that nobody interested in education <Col N="1198" /> at that time in the Fifties anticipated that the numbers in our universities would have doubled in the last ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I am not trying to make any political point on this matter.  Until 1958 there was no real plan to foresee the student explosion of the past ten years and to cater for it.  The result was that, while ten years ago we only had something in the order of 10,000 students we now have something in the order of 20,000 students in higher education.  Where ten years ago you had an investment of £15 million in higher education you now have an investment of £58 million. I mention this to highlight the immensity of the potential investment involved to cater for this explosion and desire of young people and of parents to secure the best education for their children.</P>
      <P>It is not going to be an easy problem to solve in the years ahead.  The Government will have to devote serious thought and attention to it.  If we are going to provide equal opportunity for all our children the logical outcome of that is higher investment in higher education at technical, technological and university level.  This can be said to be related to this Supplementary Estimate which we have had to bring in and which is not for a very substantial amount.  Unless in the future the community is willing to make substantial sacrifices in the way of contributions towards higher education through the taxation which will have to be raised, our community will have failed the young people.  I mention that as a point of warning because the subject was raised by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate relates <Col N="1199" /> to the nine per cent increase of last year but the staff arrangements that will be needed and the accommodation and equipment needs required will cost very substantial amounts.  This is a matter which future Irish Governments and the community at large will have to bear in mind and in relation to what the community will have to yield.</P>

      <P>It will.  The ramifications of the whole problem are quite great.  Under the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development we have a special section which highlights education as a top priority.  The rate of increase in expenditure envisaged for education in each of the next four years is 8.5 per cent.  Again, it may be that this will not be sufficient.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter and we are dealing with a very important subject.  It is for this reason that we established the Higher Education Authority.  In the context of the demands that will be made on a small community such as ours by our young people it was essential that we establish an overall authority to rationalise the facilities we will have available, such as staff provision, student placement and the provision of equipment and accommodation.  We have established this authority.  This is the whole thinking behind the required statutory association which we want to see between the two colleges in Dublin.  This is what we want to ensure&mdash;that there is a balanced and rational growth in the colleges in Cork and Galway.  We do not want to see tremendous growth in Dublin at the expense of the other two colleges and there is also the Institute of Higher Education which we propose for Limerick.</P>

      <P>In University College, Dublin, in the current year we <Col N="1200" /> have 9,000 students, in Trinity College, Dublin, we have 3,800 students, which means that in the new university in Dublin we will have over 13,000 students.  In University College, Cork, in the current year there are 2,900 students and in University College, Galway, 2,400 students.  If we are going to plan properly, and legislation in this connection will be introduced in the near future, it will be essential to ensure that this imbalance will be redressed and that we will have in University College, Cork, at the end of the next ten years between 4,000 and 5,000 students and in University College, Galway, also between 4,000 and 5,000 students.</P>
      <P>In the Institute of Higher Education in Limerick degree awards will be made and there will also be technician and technological awards which will be universally recognised.  This is the sort of thinking and planning on which the Government are engaged at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to end my remarks in relation to the Supplementary Estimate. This Supplementary Estimate highlights the important financial commitment that will be involved in the future on the part of our community in facing up to the problem of carrying through to the full the policy of equal opportunity for all our people on which we have engaged.  As far as higher education in the future is concerned, substantial sacrifices will have to be made by the community to face up to the very substantial investment that will be required to ensure that the equipment, the accommodation and the staff will be available to cope with the very substantial explosion in student numbers that will take place; to ensure that we shall be in the position that our young people will be fully equipped for the technician, supervisory and managerial jobs in industry in the future and that our farmers will be better equipped technologically and in every other way, and to ensure that all branches of our society will be better equipped to face up to the world into which we are going.  It will take money.  There is no easy way out of it.  Anybody who pretends that there is an easy way out of it <Col N="1201" /> is not facing up to the realities of the world into which we are going.  All of this has been highlighted in that excellent document <i>Investment in Education.</i> We are following it through the whole way.  We, as a political Party, will face up to our responsibility while we continue in office, as all the signs indicate will be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have followed the normal practice but, unfortunately I did not expect to come on.  We shall give it to the Deputy tomorrow.  I have only the one copy.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet additional expenditure arising on subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses, on subhead D&mdash; Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons Abroad, subhead F&mdash;Information Services and subhead G&mdash;Official Entertainment.</P>
      <P>On subhead B, the additional requirement arises mainly from the payments by way of travel expenses and related expenditure arising from the transfers of diplomatic staff abroad. During the year the number of such transfers was greater than originally envisaged and some of these involved very long distances.  In general, such expenditure and also expenditure on other services provided in the subhead &mdash;postage, telegrams, telephones and miscellaneous items&mdash;have been markedly affected by rising costs.  It is difficult to forecast travel costs, especially the incidence of foreign transfers, and the extent of the use of the other services covered by the subhead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to subhead D, the additional £3,000 is required due to an unexpectedly large increase in the number of persons repatriated or given financial assistance by our missions abroad during the year.  As the public becomes more travel conscious we must expect that the number of persons applying to our missions for assistance, especially on the Continent, <Col N="1203" /> will continue to increase.  This trend is also reflected in the increased receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid, for repayment of repatriation and maintenance advances.  Under the present system of accounting, expenditure incurred on the repatriation and maintenance of Irish persons abroad is charged to the appropriate subhead of the Vote and moneys subsequently recovered from persons who are repatriated is brought to account by way of Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.</P>
    <P>On subhead F&mdash;Information Services&mdash;printing, freight and postage costs in respect of booklets and other information material for distribution abroad and expenditure on group visits by foreign journalists proved higher than anticipated, as a result of which additional unexpected sums of approximately £2,000 have to be paid before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The additional amount required under subhead G is £16,000.  This is mainly due to the success of the efforts of Government Departments, semiState bodies and other organisations to promote Ireland as a venue for international conferences.  In recent years the number of these conferences held here has increased from 18 in 1960 to 81 in 1968.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulty about not having a copy of his speech available and I do not want to be in any way churlish in my reference to it but it is rather difficult in dealing with Estimates of this sort under particular subheads to follow what the Minister is saying without having the opportunity of reading a copy of his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Supplementary Estimate goes, we are not objecting to providing the money for the objects the Minister has mentioned.  I wish to take the opportunity to speak in relation to subhead D as it seems to me I am in order in raising this matter on this Supplementary Estimate.  I wish to say a few words generally on emigrant welfare and to inquire if the Government propose to do anything concrete on that subject, particularly in relation to Great Britain.  We are providing <Col N="1204" /> an additional £3,000 under subhead D for the repatriation and maintenance of destitute Irish persons abroad.  I want to express the view to the Minister that there is a responsibility on the Irish Government to keep a watchful and careful eye with regard to Irish people who, for one reason or another, find that they have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>This is quite apart and distinct from the occasional case&mdash;perhaps it is more than occasional&mdash;where a person finds himself involved in some cycle of events abroad, such as an accident or something of that sort, in which he loses all his possessions and money and requires assistance to get home. That kind of case is dealt with by our representatives abroad and dealt with very adequately, but what I am concerned with here is the acceptance by the Government of responsibility for assisting in such matters as welfare centres in England which cater for Irish emigrants and giving financial assistance to help organisations expand in such matters as hostel accommodation and community centres.  All this is the kind of work which it would be proper for the Government to undertake through the Department of External Affairs.  It seems to me that if this kind of work was undertaken by the Government we would not, in an Estimate of this sort, have to refer so much to the question of destitute Irish persons abroad because we would as a country, and the Government as the Government of the country, would be showing concern for the continued welfare of these people.  It is right to say, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, that we have made it clear in the policy we published on emigration welfare that we would accept responsibility for assisting in the provision of welfare centres in England and we would, as a Government, accept responsibility for providing financial assistance to existing organisations who wish to expand accommodation in hostels and community centres in England.</P>
    <P>Subhead D deals with what I have been talking about, repatriation and maintenance of Irish people abroad, and subhead F deals with information services.  The information services <Col N="1205" /> referred to by the Minister are not quite the same type of information services I have in mind.  I think it is necessary and desirable that a Government concerned with the continued welfare of emigrants should establish an advisory service drawn from the various voluntary organisations&mdash;I am concerned here particularly with England&mdash;dealing with Irish emigrants there.  An advisory council should be able to make available both to the people at home and to the Government, and through the Government to those who are contemplating emigrating, information with regard to a whole variety of matters such as the prospects for employment, the prospects for housing accommodation, where a person is emigrating with his family, and other matters of that sort.  To my mind this would be a very valuable type of information service to make available and I would urge on the Minister that it should be considered by him in relation to his Department.</P>
    <P>On the question of official entertainment, the Minister mentioned this as a reflection of the success of his Department in promoting this country as a venue for international conferences. This is very valuable work which is being done by the Minister's Department and if the increase in numbers, I think the figure the Minister mentioned was an increase from 18 to 81 approximately, can be attributed reasonably directly to an expenditure under this heading then it seems to me the net gain to the country is well worth it.  The holding of international conferences of one sort or another here is the kind of thing that not only by the actual holding of the conference assists our economy in a small way but through the aftermath, in publicising the country, it can also be of very great benefit to our economy and our balance of payments position.  Therefore, although the wording of the phrase &ldquo;official entertainment&rdquo; is one about which some people might immediately feel cynical I think that, if there is a pay-off in terms of advantage to the country and to the economy, a recurring advantage in the form of boosting tourism and the consequent beneficial effects of that on our balance of payments position, then money of this sort is well spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> I did not quite follow the Minister's references to subhead B which relates to travelling and incidental expenses.  I understood him to say that it related principally to the transfer of officials abroad.  I suppose that is moving from one assignment or embassy to another and things of that sort.  Obviously that is an expense that must be incurred and it is our job to provide the money for it.  I do not suppose it would be in order now but it might be as well to pose a general query about another matter.  From time to time people inquire&mdash;and one must have sympathy with them, particularly at this time when appeals are being made by the Government&mdash;whether it is necessary to maintain the number of establishments and the size of the establishments we have abroad.  I am not going to enter into a discussion on that at this stage but it would seem to be relevant because obviously if you are to reduce either the number or the size of our embassies or establishments abroad then the amount of money required for travelling and incidental expenses in this connection would be reduced.  I simply pose the query in a general way to give the Minister an opportunity of dealing with it when replying.  I know the case can be made that even where there does not appear to be particular need for an embassy, so far as the work of looking after the interests of Irish people in a particular country is concerned, nevertheless the existence of an Irish office, embassy or trade ambassador may prove effective from the general economic and trade point of view.  Again, in terms of our balance of payments with other countries, from the trade point of view, if the return is to our advantage there is obviously justification in having representation even in cases where people might be inclined to raise their eyebrows at the existence of an Irish embassy or offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is a relatively small one compared with those with which we have been dealing.  One or two points strike me as rather peculiar.  It appears that on subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;an additional sum of £32,000 is required, representing about 40 per cent of the original Estimate.  This seems to be an extraordinary <Col N="1207" /> amount of extra money and perhaps the Minister would say, if he has not already done so, whether or not there was a very big movement or changing of people employed in our embassies.</P>
      <P>In regard to subhead D&mdash;Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons Abroad&mdash;there is a very small increase from £3,750 to £6,750&mdash; an extra £3,000.  Does it mean that we shall not bankrupt ourselves helping Irish people who are in trouble abroad?  I know people who have been abroad and for some reason required assistance and some of them tell me they had to go to the British Embassy to get assistance, that the Irish Embassy did not want to know about them.  I am only stating what I was told; I have no proof of it.  If this is so it is regrettable.  With all our talk about the number of Irish abroad, particularly in Britain, it is extraordinary that so many of them are really &ldquo;hard up&rdquo;. Those of us who go over there occasionally find quite a number of Irish families who are really down on their luck and it seems strange that the total sum to be spent on this work for the year is to be £6,750.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we have any machinery for checking up on the situation over there.  My knowledge of it is mainly through Irish clubs in London and other places where people are doing a tremendous amount of voluntary work very well.  Most of them have said that they would very much appreciate some encouragement or assistance from the Irish Government. There may be the danger that if the Government attempted to do something there would be a flood of applications which would cost a great deal of money.  Even if it meant a very big increase in the sum required I think the Minister will agree that if it helped a small number of people who really needed help it would be far preferable to having such people destitute with&mdash;as they say over there&mdash;no way of raising the wind.  Many of them must do things that they would never do but that they are forced into.  I do not blame the Minister or suggest that he is unmindful of this matter but it <Col N="1208" /> requires very careful attention.  It would be no harm if some special committee were set up to go into it fully with responsible heads of the Irish organisations, in Britain particularly, and see if something could be done.  It would not be right to rush in headlong and throw out money right, left and centre as the Maundy silver is thrown out but this is a problem that must be tackled some time and the Minister would do well to consider it.</P>
    <P>The answer is not to have somebody sitting in the ivory tower that it is almost impossible to approach made responsible for whatever assistance can be given.  He might be a very decent fellow, ideal for the job, but if he has not some connection with people really needing help or if there is no channel through which the help can flow he will not be able to do his job.</P>
    <P>While this is not a matter that is exactly covered here, one point was brought forcibly to my notice recently. Previously, I and other Members of the House have suggested that Irish embassies abroad could, and should be used as trade missions.  Those of us who have been abroad, in most cases, have been received very courteously by the officials abroad who do everything possible to make one's stay comfortable and iron out any snags that arise. Recently, I spoke to a number of members of the Meath team who travelled to Australia to play friendly football.  With the team travelled a number of enthusiasts who wanted a holiday and who decided to kill two birds with one stone and see if some trade could be whipped up.  I found that those businessmen who spent only a matter of days and in some cases hours in Australian towns and who were away for only about three weeks altogether came back with notebooks loaded with orders for Irish products which they are at present manufacturing here and selling in Australia.</P>
    <P>I asked them how this happened? Why was no effort made to canvass this trade before then?  I was told that in the areas in which they travelled it appeared that Irish products of the type they were selling had never been heard of.  The people concerned were amazed to find that such fine products <Col N="1209" /> could be produced in Ireland and were only too glad to order them.</P>
    <P>This emphasises the point that Irish products should be pushed on every possible occasion and that if a trade mission which is at least partly comprised of good businessmen is established it will, of necessity, result in orders for goods which are not at present being received.  I should hate to think that our representatives abroad feel that they are above looking for orders.  The Minister said on a previous occasion that it was part of their job and that they were doing it.  If so, they are not very enthusiastic about it with the result that people who went to Australia for three weeks were able to get orders which apparently had not been sought there before that.</P>
    <P>There was also the incident when some of us who went abroad found that at least in one of our embassies the whiskey which was produced was Scotch and that Irish whiskey was never produced there until a couple of bottles which some visitors had brought out in their bags were taken out.  Then there were a few red faces.  This sort of thing does not help our trade relations. Our embassies should emphasise Irish products as much as they possibly can in the country in which they are located.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise for having to seek permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 50 and thereby lend myself to what might conceivably be regarded as disservice to this great company, namely the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company is one of our few success stories.  It was founded practically with the State and grew up with it.  It represents the sacrifice and the <Col N="1210" /> genius of ordinary Irishmen and Irishwomen. Therefore I wish to see the Sugar Company and its subsidiary remain successful as Irish enterprises and it is because of this that I must now raise some important questions in this House and particularly, perhaps, because of the attitude of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What I am questioning, Sir, is not the good name of the Sugar Company, which is beyond doubt, but a matter of important principle which is based on a fear that a small group of people are given the opportunity to manipulate the company.  The power structure as of now leaves a lot to be desired.  My fears about this company are easily explained and, despite the contradictions of the Minister for Finance, I believe they are fears shared by many people in this country.  When we read the Sunday papers and see articles describing the activities of the foreign company, Heinz, and its new managing director for the UK who is still supposed to be in the employ of this country, we are left to wonder whom the Irish taxpayer is paying to run this very basic and important enterprise.</P>
    <P>On the basis of that article, I should like to ask the Minister for Finance if the managing director of the Irish Sugar Company and Erin Foods is being paid by the Irish people to operate their affairs from the head office of Heinz in Britain because as I understand it, and in reply to a question of mine, the Minister says this man resigns his post on 1st May.</P>
    <P>There are other important points and questions to be raised.  The proposed change in the power managerial structure of the company leaves one to wonder why such an important change could take place without being mentioned in this House and the way in which Ministers seem to concern themselves about the running of the semi-State bodies leaves much to be desired. We should ask for a revaluation of the role of the control of these organisations.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that Mr. O'Reilly has been thought so highly of as to have been awarded a permanent position at £25,000-odd a year and indeed it must be a great tribute to his ability <Col N="1211" /> that he should have been so chosen.  It is because of that that I question the ethics of his being allowed to keep certain important channels in the structure of the Irish-owned company.  The foreign combine, Heinz, recently expanded its control over Fisons Food Products to give it what could only be described as conglomerate status.  We would not like to see a situation here whereby the farmer who produces in this country will be providing cheap raw material to be processed by their own company and fed into the Heinz marketing network.  I do not believe the Minister would like to see that sort of situation arise, either.</P>
    <P>The farmers are alarmed at the apparently unchecked domination of the Sugar Company complex by overtones of outside control.  Nothing said by the Minister in this House today allays the fears of these people.  We are rightly jealous in this country of the success of that enterprise and we do not wish the situation to arise where, when our success is assured, it is handed over to foreigners.</P>
    <P>The people do not want this and I am sure the Minister does not want it either but in all honesty can we ignore the allegations of the former chairman of the Sugar Company, Lieutenant-General Costello, even allowing for a certain prejudice because of the way he was displaced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if he would agree in view of the recent comments of the former chairman of the Irish Sugar Company, that anything that would suggest that this most vital Irish industry, which was founded and is owned by the Irish people was falling into the control of foreign combines should be clarified immediately.</P>
      <P>I am also asking the Minister, in view of the recent article in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> whether Mr. O'Reilly has been paid by the Irish people to work for them in Dublin or to work, in fact, for Heinz in Great Britain even though his contract does not expire until 1st May. I am asking the Minister to state how many days Mr. O'Reilly has worked in this country since the Minister or the Taoiseach, who was acting Minister for Finance at the time, allowed him to rescind his contract?  I am asking him if he is aware of the disquiet among the people and especially among the farming community about the danger of this company becoming a cog in foreign interests?  I am asking him why there is no representative of the farming community on the board of this company; indeed, why it is not even under the control of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances and in view of the disquiet, I am asking him if he will give an assurance to the House that he will set up a public inquiry to examine and report on the allegations made by the former head of the Sugar Company.  I see the Minister is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is that the word?  I am asking the Minister now to state how many managerial or semi-managerial appointments have been made by Mr. O'Reilly since he announced his resignation and I am asking him by a public inquiry and a public debate in the House on the role of this basic Irish industry to allay the fears of the <Col N="1213" /> Irish people as to the future of this industry.  If the Minister has nothing to be concerned about he should give an assurance to the House and if he has read the allegations made by the former head of the company he should in all fairness conduct an inquiry into them and report to this House exactly the situation regarding the company.  I think the other question arises about Mr. Godsil being a managing director and employee of the chocolate manufacturers. I think he is placed in an impossible personal position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his own company in so far as his own company is a customer.  I would like the Minister to answer those questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to take serious account of this.  Deputy Dr. John O'Connell is a socialist but I am not too sure in my mind exactly whereon the socialist scale he fits in, whether he is a Castro-Cuban socialist, a Maoist, a Revisionist, a Deviationist or simply a Rathmines intellectual painter. Whatever sort of socialist he is, I always thought socialists, if they believed in anything, and I do not think they believe in a great deal, but if they believed in anything they believed in State enterprise.  I am confused and confounded at the attitude of the Labour Party, the Socialist Party in this House, which never miss an opportunity, if they can possibly find one, of attacking and abusing our State enterprises. This is very much a case in point.  If this sort of thing is to go on, and if Deputy Dr. O'Connell, whatever his motivation is, makes a practice of meddling in the affairs of State companies in this way, of attacking the people who are trying to run those State companies in this way, then the whole concept of State enterprise will be put in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that those State enterprises since their foundation have served this country well.  They have made a great contribution towards our economic welfare.  We in this House have a very solemn obligation on us not to interfere unnecessarily in their affairs.  There is a temptation on us, I suppose, to try to exert our influence on them but I think we should resist this.  They were set up for a certain <Col N="1214" /> purpose and with a certain idea and the idea was that they should to a large extent be free to run their commercial operations from day to day with the minimum interference.  Many of them operate in a keenly competitive world and they have to have the greatest possible amount of commercial freedom that this House can give them.  They have to get the very best people we in this House can select for them.  I think this sort of thing that Deputy Dr. John O'Connell is indulging in here tonight could be extremely dangerous and damaging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, of course, should have got his facts right.  He asked me about the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  There are two farmers.  There is a farmer from Kildare and a farmer from County Carlow.  There is a very respected responsible trade union official on the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and there are other members in whom I have the utmost confidence.  I am the sole shareholder, as Minister for Finance, of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods Limited and the suggestion that I or the Government would be in any way a party to handing over control of those valuable national assets to any outside influence is ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the link-up between Erin Foods and the Heinz Company was one of the most valuable things that ever happened to Irish agriculture and I think that is recognised by the farmers of this country who have reaped the benefits of it in recent years and they will reap the benefits in the years ahead.  By virtue of the link-up the whole massive selling organisation of the Heinz Company was placed at the disposal of Erin Foods.  There is no question whatever of the Heinz Company having any control or influence over either Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta or Erin Foods.  They agreed as partners to set up a mutual selling organisation, Heinz Erin.  They both have an equal stake in <Col N="1215" /> that joint company.  Neither has any control or interest in the other.</P>
    <P>Heinz Erin have no interest in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta or Erin Foods, which are still separate independent Irish entities owned by me as Minister for Finance.  Conversely, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods have no interest whatever in the Heinz Erin Company.  Both have combined, in one sense, a sound working business arrangement, in a joint marketing venture, Heinz Erin, which already is paying off in a very satisfactory and beneficial way to Erin Foods Limited.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost confidence in the board of the two companies.  They are combining a wide range of experience and business acumen and I have confidence beyond belief in and admiration for Mr. O'Reilly as a man who has done enormous work for two State enterprises in this country with which he has been associated.  In the first instance he was responsible for doing a truly magnificent job in building up Bord Bainne and its marketing organisation. Then, when the Erin Foods project looked like foundering and when losses were accumulating at a staggering rate, the Government asked him if he would take on the job of trying to put this right.  To his eternal credit he took it on and put it right. He changed the situation in which this company was losing in the last year before he took over £1.6 million a year to a situation now where its losses are reduced practically to break-even point. He is not serving two masters at the moment.  He is still the full-time employee of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Erin Foods.</P>

      <P>Regrettably he is leaving on 1st May to take up a very important appointment in the Heinz Company of Great Britain.  I am sorry he is going but I have complete confidence in the two chief executives and the staff that he is leaving behind him in those two companies to carry on the job.  I think that he will be able to do a good and valuable service for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and for Erin Foods Limited in his new position.  He will be able to help them still, and I am happy that he is continuing his link with the group through his membership of the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  I cannot understand why this matter has been brought before the House in this way.</P>

      <P>The managerial structure of these companies is a matter for the board of directors of these companies.  If we appoint the board of directors of these companies and have faith in them then we must trust their judgment.  I am perfectly happy and confident that the boards of both companies are competent to do their job in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude, I want to say that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta has been a very continuing success story.  Erin Foods has had a chequered career but at no stage in the history of both companies were things proceeding as satisfactorily at they are at present. In both companies there are good sound boards of directors and competent, trained, skilled, efficient management staff.  I think both companies are pursuing sound, progressive policies which will be of benefit to Irish farmers in particular and to the Irish economy as a whole.  I do not want an attempt, for whatever reason it is <Col N="1217" /> made, to muddy the waters.  I hope on reflection that Deputy O'Connell will withdraw whatever half-hearted allegations he has made here.</P>

He is a man of integrity, honour and above reproach in all his dealings.  While we regret he has to leave these two valuable Irish companies we hope that in his very important new commercial position he will still be able, through his guidance and encouragement, to help their future progress and development.</P>
