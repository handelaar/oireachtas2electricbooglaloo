      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me last night I was seeking to develop the concept of better relations in the industrial field in the years ahead and I pointed out that better control by the responsible leaders of trade unionism was essential to this condition being brought about.  I should like to say now that, for my part, in so far as I can facilitate the responsible leadership of trade unionism, I will be only too glad to do it.</P>
      <P>We have, as I pointed out, a year behind us with a record of lost mandays which, when published, will be the highest yet.  A great part of this deplorable record is due to the unofficial strike.  If we can eliminate unofficial strikes we will have gone a long way towards improving the whole position with regard to industrial relations generally.  In recent times we have had unofficial strikes in pursuit of claims before existing agreements expired.  We have even had a strike recently in pursuit of a claim for pay for a period in which an unofficial strike took place.  Such actions do not improve the atmosphere or the outlook with regard to industrial relations.  An improvement is essential to the acceleration of the progress which has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that it can be safely asserted that everybody in this House and <Col N="1817" /> outside it is anxious that more rapid progress should be made towards full employment.  Whatever else we may have to worry about, all the indicators show that very good progress has been made but it has not been at all as rapid as we would like it to be.  There is considerable room for improvement.</P>
    <P>When I have been pressed in the House to answer questions with regard to the Educational Company ruling and the promise that was made that legislation would be introduced to rectify the situation, I have pointed out that I was not in any way shirking my responsibility in this respect but that I should like, in consultation with all concerned, to have a serious look at the whole question of strikes and picketing before I would bring in legislation.  I have made myself understood to congress, certainly to some members of it, that I should like with them to go into the situation which exists regarding unofficial strikes and picketing generally and with them to agree on strengthening the control of the trade unions generally so that we could look forward to some elimination of the unofficial strike at any rate.</P>
    <P>We have come to a stage where the right of workers to withdraw their labour is accepted by everybody.  It is hardly necessary to refer to it.  The suggestion made occasionally when legislation is proposed that somebody is seeking to deprive the workers of certain rights is native in the extreme and is not genuinely believed.  The time is ripe to take into confidence the employers, the trade union leaders, the representatives of the workers, and this House and to have an agreement on the type of reasonable control whereby the responsible trade union leadership would be in absolute control of the workers and capable of negotiating.</P>
    <P>I have said nothing about the employers at this stage.  I want to come to that later and to say a lot about that also.</P>
    <P>In perusing the records I find that there are 740,000 people employed in non-agricultural economic activity at the present time&mdash;that is approximately the figure; that there were 320,000 employed in agricultural activities, which <Col N="1818" /> would include forestry and fishing. There are 100 trade unions with a membership of 370,000&mdash;six general unions representing 310,000 and the ITGWU representing 150,000.  Of these, 77 are affiliated to congress, which represents 95 per cent of organised workers.  Twenty-six British-based unions represent 50,000 workers.  In all, apart from any rationalisation in the trade union movement, there is a very strongly-organised trade union system in this country.  I was trying to stress that point in order to show that nobody, I think, need fear any suspicions that may have been entertained in the past regarding any effort to deprive workers of any right for which they have fought and gained.  I should like to see a more rational trade union organisation and a more consolidated employers' organisation which could really speak with one voice for the employers.  This would be a prerequisite to bringing about any prices and incomes policy.  In the 1970s, we should bend our every effort towards bringing about that situation.  I can see that the unofficial strike will eventually lead to the complete disruption of organised trade unionism in this country.  A great deal of time and effort and hardship have gone into the building up of this organisation to its present state.  If responsibility and control do not fully repose in the top leadership of trade unions, we cannot expect to sit down to make the necessary arrangements for better industrial relations.  One can visualise the chaos that is likely to exist if this is not brought about.  If we could achieve this happy situation in the year ahead it would be a big step forward.  Indeed, I have very strong hopes of it.  I find trade union leadership very highly responsible and understanding. With better organisation on the employers' side, I think there is much we could get down to doing.</P>
    <P>Lightning strikes or the unofficial types of strikes that take place do not in any way advance the human dignity of the worker, about which everyone is so much concerned.  These strikes, which occur every so often, throw the whole economy into chaos.  We must eliminate this factor in our industrial relations before we can sit down to work out the many things that urgently <Col N="1819" /> require to be done.  There is a lot of legislation in the pipeline in my Department which will shortly be presented to this House.  Much of it has already been sent for consultation with all the parties concerned.  It deals with working conditions, due period of notice of termination of employment; hours of employment; safety conditions in employment; the atmosphere in which people have to work; safety from health hazards and accident-free environment. These are most important and are only some of the many factors which should form a proper workers' charter.  If we could bring about a sense of reality into the whole method of adjusting incomes and wages, it would be to the benefit of all concerned. We are rather preoccupied with this question of demanding incomes which do not in any way conform to the ability of the concern to pay or to the resources available or to a likely increase in production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night we had made very considerable progress in the past year and particularly in recent years in the matter of industrial employment.  Much greater progress could be made if we could earn for ourselves the reputation of being reasonably free from industrial strife. We still have unemployment and we still have emigration&mdash;both problems we are anxious to eradicate but which still remain to be solved.  One of the most essential factors in preparing the ground for a final drive towards full employment is the eradication to the minimum of industrial strife, and, first, the unofficial strike.  We must give trade union leadership the necessary power and leadership which they do not seem to have at present.  Anything I can do by way of legislation to <Col N="1820" /> strengthen their hand in this respect will gladly be done.  There is no question of depriving anybody of any powers they hold.  Nobody denies the right of the worker to a fair wage.  I would be the last person in this House to lend my hand to any type of legislation restricting the worker in his right to seek better conditions and fair wages.</P>
      <P>Frequent reference is made to our record for man days lost.  It is not a good record.  Official strikes have been a big element in that record.  The Deputy who asked me if I could give the name of a firm that closed down because of a wage increase is well aware that inordinate claims for wages which have been granted contributed substantially to increased prices which have eroded the value of the increase, anyhow.  We have frequently warned that this would impair our competitiveness in the foreign market to such a great extent that it would ultimately lead to a serious situation in which we would have unemployment and all the evils that follow.  If we have been accused of crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; it is because the inflationary trends here and increasing prices have also occurred in other countries in which we have been marketing our goods.</P>
      <P>This world inflationary trend has saved us in that respect in the years that have passed but there is no guarantee that this will continue to happen. Some Labour speakers during the debate on my Estimate pointed out, quite rightly, that inordinate wage increases or wage increases of any kind are not the sole contributing factor to increased prices.  This I immediately concede.  The increased prices of essential imports for the manufacturing industry, for instance, are bound to add to the cost of production here and thereby increase prices.  This undoubtedly is one of the factors&mdash;and one of the factors over which we have no control&mdash;which have contributed to increased prices here, but there is no denying that the most important factor is the increase in incomes which is above the increase in production or not matched by an increase in production or growth in the national income generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> There is another factor with regard to increased incomes which contributes indirectly but very definitely to increased prices.  When wages are increased income goes up all round and the welfare classes are left in the position that the small incomes which they receive from the welfare payments are insufficient to give them the minimum of comfort and it is essential that their benefits be increased proportionately. This has happened several times and it invariably means extra taxation to provide the moneys necessary to bring the welfare classes up to some reasonable standard.  These tax increases again are responsible for further increases in prices and the vicious circle goes spiralling on.  While the actual impact of wage increases directly affects prices, it also affects them indirectly due to the fact that it makes it necessary to increase taxation in order to meet the welfare claims. This is a very important aspect of the spiralling that has gone on and will continue to go on unless we realise what the position is and all of us agree to have some understanding about it.</P>
    <P>I would not contribute in any way to any hard and fast arrangement with regard to incomes and wages because there are always those sections which are not up to the standard one would reasonably expect for them.  Certainly, it must be left open so there can be adjustments of that type.  I do not think anyone will agree with the system of claims for parity and relativity that are not always justified.  Very recently I had experience of a firm in which the general workers claimed and succeeded in getting an increase in conformity with the maintenance craft workers' increase of last spring.  Immediately that increase was conceded to them the craft workers came back looking for the differential for no other reason other than to maintain the differential.</P>
    <P>These claims, which are based on nothing more than just being that much ahead of someone else, or claims that are pressed just because certain people know they are in a position where they can exercise to a very serious degree very strong pressure that must eventually be yielded to, are the types of claims that we have to face <Col N="1822" /> up to and resist if we are to make progress in the years ahead.  I should like to make some progress in the very essential field with which my Department are more concerned than anything else, that is, the preparation of workers for the competitive years that lie ahead.  This is mainly in the field of training and of technology.  We have in our AnCO organisation, the Industrial Training Organisation, already made a very good beginning in that we have got three centres in operation.  The last one I opened recently in Galway is a centre for training which I would advise Deputies to visit any time they are in Galway and, indeed, the centres in Waterford and Shannon for that matter, and see for themselves if these are not a very genuine and worthwhile effort to provide workers with the necessary skills that will enable them to develop their aptitudes and enable them to have job satisfaction in the competitive time which lies ahead.</P>
    <P>This is a direction in which I should like to see more rapid development. Our national manpower service seeks to identify the areas where there is a shortage of labour, where there is a surplus of labour, where there is emigration, where there will be availability of labour in the years to come, where training of a particular type is needed.  The career guidance service comes under the same manpower section.  We want to develop our manpower forecasting service and to assist with placement and replacement, which we are now developing.  We are seeking the appointment of suitable officers. There is much to be done in this field which is for the greater and ultimately the real benefit of the workers, but I feel this work is being superseded by unnecessary striving towards demanding&mdash;often unofficially demanding&mdash; increased wages to meet the cost of living, which invariably is followed by the cost of living eroding the increase given and, in the last analysis, bringing the real increase back to a very insignificant figure which, if granted in the first instance, probably would have been accepted.</P>
    <P>This is the situation as I see it moving into the seventies.  If this message is not got across to all concerned, <Col N="1823" /> and particularly to the workers, then we can only hope to continue making the progress we have been making in the past, which to me is not sufficiently rapid.  One could say that 4½ per cent is very satisfactory progress but we must think of the progress that could have been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan suggested that I could not point out any case where losses in man days caused some concerns to close down.  I am more concerned with how this acts as a deterrent to people who might have come here.  Indeed, I have evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.  I asked the Minister did he know of a case where a wage increase caused a firm to close down. That is not the same question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much the same question I am trying to answer.  I may not be making myself very clear.  I do not think I could name any such firm &mdash;and I would not even if I thought I could&mdash;but I could give instances of firms which were about to expand or open new branches and did not do so, or opened elsewhere, due to their experience in the industrial field, almost entirely due to our not grappling with the situation of the unofficial strike&mdash;for which I am blamed. Frequently I meet people who say: &ldquo;Look at the unofficial strike which has taken place here, and look at what has happened there, and what is the Minister for Labour doing about it?&rdquo; The public generally do not yet seem to have grasped that we cannot legislate for industrial peace&mdash;it has been said so often before that it seems to be unnecessary repetition&mdash;but yet so many people do not seem to have grasped the simple fact that, unless there is acceptance and common agreement with the unions and the employers' representatives, anything we can do by way of legislation goes for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion by Mr. Aubrey Jones, who is in charge of the British prices and incomes policy, that voluntary restraint is very essential if one is to formulate a policy that is <Col N="1824" /> likely to work.  Voluntary restraint is essential in order to prepare the ground for a policy that would be acceptable.  There is no use embarking on a hastily arranged prices and incomes policy which will not work. For that reason it is agreed by all who are in a position to know more about it than I am that voluntary restraints for a time are an essential prerequisite to the introduction of a prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Invariably when anybody is talking about this sensitive field of industrial relations he seems afraid to mention one side without mentioning the other. If he refers to chaos in regard to industrial strikes and unofficial strikes he is sure to mention the employers immediately after mentioning the workers in case he may be suspected of taking sides.  We will have to be less sensitive about this and talk openly about both sides.  There is a lot that can be done and must be done on the employers' side.  I am not at all happy that the employers have really good representation to speak for them as a whole.  As a matter of fact, the employers' organisations are rather disarrayed at present.  However, efforts are being made which I hope will be successful to improve that situation. Until we have some bodies which can sit down with us and discuss the whole situation and really speak with authority for the people they represent there it little hope of achieving the success we would all like.  There is one bright spot on the horizon.  We seem to be moving, perhaps more rapidly than anybody might think, towards the situation in which on the workers' side we will have trade union representation that will be really capable of speaking for the workers and accepting and honouring any arrangements made, and on the employers' side representatives who will be capable of doing the same.</P>
    <P>We are now facing the 1970s and the competition about which we hear so much talk and which the future is bound to hold for us and the record of man days lost is not very encouraging. I have extracted the figures for 1959-1969.  In 1960 a total of 8,349 man days were lost which would be <Col N="1825" /> the lowest figure in the ten-year period. In 1966, 783,635 were lost which seems an appalling record until we come to 1969 when up to the end of November, without having the official figures, about 800,000 man days were lost, which will be the highest yet.  With these figures in mind I think about the great progress that could have been made if we had not lost that huge number of man days; how many more people might be working, how nearer to full employment we might be and how many other things we might be talking about doing for the workers if progress in this field had been made. A great proportion of those 800,000 days was due to unofficial strikes.  This is a sphere in which so much could have been done without resorting to a stoppage of employment.  We have built up a very good system of negotiating and discussing our troubles when they arise.  The Labour Court was considered a very great step forward in the matter of settling disputes but I am not too sure that in recent times it has gained much prestige because of non-acceptance of its recommendations.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting the Deputy did.  I am not denying that they may have made mistakes.  They are not that long established.  In these days it is very popular to think of starting something new, to have committees, commissions and so on, but the institutions we have in this field are quite dependable and sufficiently capable of meeting any situation if they are given the necessary powers and the necessary acceptance which is essential for the working of any institution we may establish.</P>
      <P>Shortly I am going to appoint rights commissioners for which the House provided in legislation passed before I became Minister for Labour.  We will start off with, perhaps, only two.  I am not sure that they will make any great impact in regard to the early detection of trouble and its settlement but it is well worth trying.  If we can get the suitable people to take on this task it could be well worthwhile.  The idea would be that they would move in early and bring reason to bear, to trace the trouble that is brewing and thereby bring about an early settlement by eliminating the cause.  I am not going to prejudge what they should do but that is roughly what the House had in mind when they wrote this provision into the legislation for appointing rights commissioners.  I hope to have them early in the new year, and it will be interesting to see if they have any worthwhile effect on the situation.  If they have, I shall not hesitate to increase the numbers available for this important work with which they will be entrusted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will, like the conciliation officers, be available to either side.  Indeed, I should like them not to wait to be asked by anybody, that they should move themselves, where a case is brought to their notice. Naturally, before they do it will be with the joint consent of the people concerned. It is hardly necessary to say that if they moved in without the consent of the people, whether they were <Col N="1827" /> invited or not, there would be little hope of bringing about any conciliation. They will not usurp the functions of the conciliation officers or the industrial relations officers, as they are now called.  These people have been doing an excellent job and I hope they will continue to do it.</P>
      <P>If I have bored the House talking a great deal about industrial relations it is, first of all, because it gives me an opportunity of discussing these matters. It is often said that Ministers make statements outside the House which they should make here.  I welcome the opportunity of saying what I have said about these matters and making it known to the House what our hopes are for the future.  Irrespective of what accusations are being made regarding the mistakes of the past&mdash;and anybody who does anything must make mistakes &mdash;to understand the situation is useful and of ultimate benefit to everyone.  I am not in the least sensitive about referring to workers' or employers' representatives. We have been much too sensitive about this in the past.  One seems to have been afraid to be misinterpreted. I hope to have further discussions with the FUE and the ICTU and I shall be only too glad to do anything that will gain acceptance from them towards putting them in better control of their respective sides on this question of industrial employment and employment generally.  We have already a great deal of common understanding and consent in this matter and I believe it can be developed further.</P>
      <P>It is most impressive to see the export figures going up.  It represents greater activity in the economy and increased employment.  We have a lot to do still in this respect, as is pointed out in the Third Programme.  There is a very definite falling off in agricultural employment.  I was most heartened to learn from the recent report that when industrialisation takes place in the provinces this will automatically benefit the agricultural community over a wide radius from the industrial centres.  This is most encouraging to those of us who are particularly concerned about the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into a long discussion <Col N="1828" /> on the problems of the west, but we can look forward to an intensification of the efforts to put the west on an equal footing with the east coast, which is the area in which most people desire to have all their industrial activities.  I do not grudge any development that has taken place on the east coast, but it is evident from the last census and from the recent report published by the social research people that there are counties, particularly those in the west, which are not making the same progress as counties on the eastern seaboard.  It is imperative, therefore, that all our efforts in the matter of industrial development should be slanted towards these areas which are not at present securing their due share of development.</P>
    <P>While people have been talking about saving the west, the very idea itself has been resented by the people who live there, because the west is quite capable of saving itself, given a fair chance.  Sufficient has already happened to prove that there is no doubt about saving the west.  What we really mean when we talk about saving the west is providing the necessary opportunities to maintain the population that the west was accustomed to have in the past, when people like the congested districts board set out to remedy the situation by moving people elsewhere and thinning out the population, which to my mind is not the real solution.  What is needed is an intensification of all our efforts, sufficient incentives and inducements to greater development and greater activity in the west.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on a more hopeful note.  It is the duty of the Opposition to point out what they consider to be the flaws in the Government policy, but I do not think extreme statements of gloom and doom achieve anything.  We must recognise the very great progress we have made. We have had many obstacles to overcome, but I think we can safely say now on the threshold of the Seventies that the breakthrough has come.  If we can harness our undoubted patriotism towards working in greater harmony, we can achieve, much more rapidly than we otherwise might, that very much desired goal of full employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> However, full employment is not the be-all and end-all of what we set out to do.  It is only one important step in the development of our society.  Having reached that stage we can turn our attention to many other things that desire to be done.  We can do so much for the betterment of our society, for maintaining our separate culture in a competitive world in which we shall undoubtedly be more closely integrated in the years ahead.  These matters pose a very great challenge to any Government.</P>
    <P>I consider it essential to develop our economy to a stage where sufficient opportunities will be available for our people, many of whom at present emigrate either to find better remuneration or because they are unable to find opportunities at home.  We are solving the problem gradually but we have to hasten the day when it will be solved completely.</P>
    <P>The committee which I set up to look into emigration is giving us constant reports on their progress and I am satisfied they are doing a fairly useful job.  I am pleased to note that they confirm the numbers now going abroad have reduced to what can be described as almost a trickle compared with what used to be the case.</P>
    <P>Coming from a county which has experienced emigration of a most serious type during the last one hundred years, and particularly in the last 25 years, I can see a change in the pattern of emigration which is creating a much more serious problem.  The last stages of our efforts to find a solution to the problem of emigration will be the most difficult because relationships have been established.  People at home frequently leave their jobs in order to join their friends and relatives abroad. Rather than buy a ticket for the express bus to Dublin, where they can find work in plenty&mdash;particularly in the building industries, and many of these people are labourers&mdash;they are prone to buy a ticket for the boat and go across to Birmingham or London.  It is simple for people to shuttle back and forward at the present time and if they feel they might get a bit more excitement or a few pounds extra pay they are quite prepared to emigrate.  The <Col N="1830" /> facility with which people can do this makes solving the emigration problem, if one is to think in terms of completely eradicating it, a rather difficult one and in the last analysis a rather impossible one.  I would be happy if we could reach the stage where we could say: &ldquo;If you want to stay at home there is work for you.&rdquo;  When we reach that stage the State will be free from reprobation from anybody.</P>
    <P>It has been urged that we should bring in controls on the movement of our young people in order to prevent them emigrating, but we have declined to do so.  I think we should, only in the last analysis, introduce controls which would enable us to prevent anyone from emigrating if they want to do so.</P>
    <P>Any work which this committee can do to identify areas where something more is required to be done will be very welcome.  It must be remembered that the people who most need guidance in the matter of emigration are the people who do not present themselves to agencies.  People, who have been the charge of the agencies in the past, will immediately tell you that this is the greatest problem.  However, the majority of our people are capable of looking after themselves and this has become increasingly more so as they are better equipped now than they used to be in the past.</P>
    <P>Since this committee was set up the question of assisting people to return has been mentioned.  Thousands of letters have been received from people anxious to come back.  It is noticeable that they are from those who are married and have children who want to bring their families up here.  We have a shortage of skilled people and we are now arranging to bring skilled people back.  We have compiled a list of vacancies.</P>
    <P>The return of many of our emigrants will pose a housing problem.  As I have said, most people wanting to return are married with families and they will require housing.  The housing problem, which is sometimes thought of as only a Dublin problem, will be. I hope, a greater problem in the west in the years to come.  I hope more people who have left there will return <Col N="1831" /> to take up opportunities in their own county.  I hope the necessary housing accommodation will be made available for them as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is possible under our scheme of retraining and placement to facilitate and meet expenses incurred by people moving from one area to another due to redundancy or because they want a change.  I am arranging for this service to be extended to people wishing to come back from England.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, there is a shortage of female labour in certain areas.  We have not completed any worthwhile manpower service as yet but we hope to make rapid progress in the immediate future.  It is apparent in some areas that there is a surplus, but in most areas there is a shortage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say that I have asked the Labour Court under section 24 of the 1946 Act for a recommendation and report on the dispute which has been going on in the ESB for a long time.  To use a hackneyed phrase the dispute is &ldquo;getting nowhere&rdquo;.  No progress has been made at conciliation or at the Labour Court. There is a stalemate.  There is no obvious sign of any settlement.  As this is an area where the economy of the country is at risk, it behoves us to ensure that every facility available for the settlement of a dispute is utilised in order to prevent a crisis.  I shall say no more than that, but that is the reason why I have taken what I consider to be the last resort available to me since all other efforts have failed to identify the cause and to resolve it. That is the best one can do.</P>
    <P>I hope that 1970 will be a better year for everyone.  I hope that we will depart from all the ill-will and intransigence which have characterised some of the efforts in the industrial field in the past and that by the introduction of a greater degree of commonsense and harmony we will come to the Taoiseach's Estimate next year having behind us a year in which there was greater progress, with more people finding remunerative employment in their own country, and general economic conditions showing an even more marked improvement than that <Col N="1832" /> which we have been able to report in respect of the year coming to a close.</P>
    <P>Recriminations across the floor of this House will not improve any situation. As Minister for Labour, I hope to avoid as far as possible acrimony and the introduction of any unnecessary accusation which might in any way be misinterpreted.  To use a nautical term, I hope that in 1970 it will be &ldquo;Steady as we go&rdquo;; I hope that we will travel hopefully, not seeking an El Dorado impossible of achievement but seeking that which is realistic and attainable, an Ireland with full employment and all the other advantages which must necessarily accrue from that.  I wish a happy Christmas to all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking immediately after the admirable statement by the Minister for Labour, I am very happy to reciprocate the Minister's good wishes for a happy Christmas. The Minister modestly expressed the fear that he might, perhaps, have bored the House.  He need feel no such apprehension.  Everyone who listened to the Minister's statement must have, I think, appreciated that it was a model of what a Minister's statement should be.  As far as he could, he took the House into his confidence. He dealt with the problems facing his Department and he treated the House with a consideration which will, I believe, be reflected by other speakers here.</P>
      <P>I shall not enter into the substance of what he said.  Deputy O'Donovan, who will speak latter, is better qualified than I am to do that. I wish I could speak in the same vein, particularly at this season, of the Taoiseach's statement in opening this debate.  One would have hoped that he would have favoured the House with a survey of the substance of the serious problems which confronted the country during the past year and would have given some idea of the spirit in which he, as Taoiseach, and his Government were collectively approaching these problems.  Had he done that he would, I think, have found a ready response in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to prejudge this matter&mdash;it is possible that, in his reply, <Col N="1833" /> the Taoiseach will give us a more substantive survey&mdash;but I do not think such an approach an altogether satisfactory way of proceeding.  It would have been helpful to the House if, in the Taoiseach's initial statement, these matters were more fully covered in what one might describe as a more philosophical and generalised way. Instead of that, we had from the Taoiseach a statement which could quite as well have been produced by an automated public address system hitched to a computer.  The statement was almost entirely statistical, a rather bald statement, and it was not helpful to the House generally in considering the state of the nation, which is something we should do at this time.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Taoiseach, many of us felt, I think, that this was not the statement of a Taoiseach who was giving leadership in the sense in which the President, Mr. de Valera, gave leadership in the past.  Whatever opinions there may have been about him, he certainly gave leadership in times of crisis.  As opposed to that, the Taoiseach's statement was, perhaps, the statement of a chairman, perhaps, of the rapporteur of a committee, rather than that of someone who is going to give a lead to the country.  This corroborated the misgivings many of us have felt about the conduct of the Government during the past year.  It was evident to us, and it is right that we should stress this, that there were and are resources of very considerable ability, goodwill and strength available to the present Government, whatever we may think about them generally.  It was also apparent that certain Ministers are largely out of control; they do what they like in their own Departments. The conduct of some of them reminded me of a statement made by a Minister of the Interior in a faraway country when he was challenged about some arbitary act he had performed; his reply was: &ldquo;You have no right to say that.  This is a democracy and, as Minister of the Interior, I do what I like&rdquo;.  From the utterances and performances of some Ministers&mdash;by no means all&mdash;I feel their approach to the problems of their Departments and of the country is very similar indeed; they act like feudal barons controlling their <Col N="1834" /> own fief, showing respect for no one, even their own Taoiseach.  I shall give some reasons for that belief on my part later when I approach what will be the main subject of my contribution, the handling by the Taoiseach and the Government of the important crisis in Northern Ireland which the country, as a whole, traversed this year.  That crisis &mdash;to which I shall return&mdash;clearly demonstrated that some branches of the Government were out of any central control, and most dangerously so.</P>
    <P>But there were other examples, in a Government in which the Taoiseach, and it is to his credit, attempts to set a tone of dignity and good manners. We have had a demonstration by one member of the Government of a truculent, overbearing approach, of insults delivered here to citizens of this country who have no means of reply.  This Minister responsible for law enforcement, in a letter, the authenticity of which he acknowledged, advised a constituent how the law might be bypassed and advised that same constituent to destroy that letter.  In a strange contradiction, he then said that he stood over every line of the letter he had advised the constituent to destroy.  When some of us tried to put down questions about that matter &mdash;to ask whether the Taoiseach regarded that conduct as compatible with the standards of propriety to be expected from a member of the Government&mdash;we were told that since the question contained argument&mdash;I presume implicit argument&mdash;it could not be asked.</P>
    <P>That is why I am obliged to comment on it here and I do so because I think&mdash;I do not want to go into detail on this range of matters here; the country is familiar with a number of such cases&mdash;that is a case where in a Government under strong democratic leadership and control as Mr. de Valera's Governments were, such a Minister would, at the very least, have been severely admonished and had he persevered in conduct of the character in which he has indulged he would have ceased to be a member of such a Government.  If that has not happened we have a right on this Estimate to note the fact as an example of a lack of central direction, of a growing autonomy, <Col N="1835" /> an almost anarchic autonomy of certain Ministries, of a certain galloping free enterprise in the conduct of Government.  I do not wish to brood on that aspect now.  This is not an Estimate, as we have been properly told from the Chair, on which we should go into details on the conduct of Government. We shall have a chance of considering these on other Estimates.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have touched and will touch further on a number of aspects coming under the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I propose to say something about three of them&mdash;the European Economic Community, the housing crisis and the crisis affecting Northern Ireland and our relations with what has happened there.  It is into that last subject I propose to go most deeply since it is one to which I have been giving particular attention on behalf of our Party during the year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the EEC I should like to support the request by the leader and other members of our Party for a debate on this subject, a debate which I am sure the Minister for External Affairs will be inclined to accord in the same spirit as the Minister for Labour has given us an admirable and instructive survey of the work of his Department.  The Minister for External Affairs should also take us into his confidence as far as he can about what is happening in this area because I think the public are somewhat confused about it.  The Minister has gone on television and spoken to the public in general about this.  None of us wants to discourage that development; it is good that Ministers should go on television as much as possible and take the public at large also into their confidence. That is very welcome but what would not be welcome would be if this method of procedure should become a substitute for taking the House into the confidence of Ministers and telling us here what is happening.  I hope we shall have an opportunity of considering this matter in detail with the appropriate information.  There seem to be some contradictions or possible contradictions here.  The Taoiseach told us not long ago in response to questions from these benches that the Government have no intention of <Col N="1836" /> entering NATO or, he added&mdash;and it was an important addition, perhaps, not sufficiently noticed at the time&mdash; any other kind of military alliance.  Yet, the Minister for External Affairs in his television broadcast seemed to imply that there would be military commitments here.  We should like to know the outline of what is involved and have an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that which I should like to hear about and discuss is the whole style and approach within which we hope to operate inside EEC, if we are admitted, because anyone with experience of international organisations or groupings, such as OEEC in the old days, knows that within the membership of such organisations there is room for different kinds of emphasis and different styles of approach.  For example, in European groupings generally the approach and emphasis of the Scandinavian countries have been slightly distinct from those of other countries and even a small country within such a grouping has an opportunity to make its character, its geographical position, its tradition and its national outlook generally felt.  There has been a fear in some quarters that our Government are approaching this matter in too much of a passive spirit of &ldquo;we must accept anything in order to get in and we shall do anything we are told when we are in&rdquo;.  That may be a distortion of the position. I hope it is, but this is the kind of thing we hope to hear about and debate fully when the Dáil resumes.</P>
    <P>When the leader and other members of the Labour Party tried to raise the matter of housing, when we tabled a motion to declare a national housing emergency and were provided with a limited amount of time for discussion, it was very much pooh-poohed.  It was treated as a kind of stunt and we had the alarming and deplorable spectacle of a concerted attempt being made to howl down the leader of the Labour Party when he was using the limited time at his disposal to say what we felt was important on this question. That was extremely regrettable and I hope it will never recur.  I speak as a Deputy from a part of Dublin where there is a large number of housing <Col N="1837" /> estates and also large numbers of extremely badly-housed people.</P>
    <P>To speak of a housing crisis in Dublin is by no means a stunt; it is a reference to a fact which every Dublin Deputy knows just as every Dublin Deputy knows that to speak of 15 or 20 unlicensed moneylenders in Dublin city is to be farcically out of touch with reality.  The problems are much greater than that.  The time every Deputy in Dublin must give to his constituency is taken up to a very large extent, perhaps, as much as 90 per cent, by the pressures of the very real housing crisis which exists and which affects both those with no homes and those who are homeless in that they are extremely and dangerously badly-housed. There is danger to their physical health and psychological welfare. That is one phase of the problem and another is that tenants of corporation houses feel in very large numbers that the present system of differential rents operates inequitably.  That feeling is particularly strong&mdash;universal&mdash;among those on the so-called B scale but it prevails among other tenants also.  Here, again, I shall not enter into details on that but I should like to express the hope that the Government will hold an inquiry, with adequate sociological participation, into, in particular, the present operation of this differential rents system.  The differential can in itself be defended in principle but I think its present operation comports grave inequalities.  That is something which most Dublin Deputies are well aware of and I hope the problem will at least be investigated.</P>
    <P>What is most alarming about this housing situation is the extreme complacency of&mdash;I will not say the Government because I have already said that there are reasons to believe that units of the Government are functioning with a peculiar autonomy which one, perhaps, would not have expected from what is supposed to be the Government of a single party&mdash;but of the responsible Minister in this matter who responded to questions on this subject, first of all, extremely perfunctorily with monosyllabic answers which were often meaningless.  The Minister for Local Government showed <Col N="1838" /> an extraordinary inability to put his hands on statistics which were asked for except statistics relating to the Tallaght area about which he is singularly well informed.  His whole approach to this was summed up in a complacent statement which he made to the House that things had never been so good in housing.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Minister for Local Government should be brought to the attention of everyone in Dublin because there are a great number of people in this city who have a very different impression indeed.  I hope the Taoiseach in his reply to this debate will not leave out the question of housing altogether as he has done before but will say something about it, show some sign of a realisation that a real crisis exists, a crisis which may erupt in this city.  A Dublin Deputy has a right to give warning of that and should give warning that if attention is not given to this in time, if it is treated with this kind of complacency, it may erupt&mdash;I will not say into a social crisis; it is already a social crisis &mdash;but into that kind of open social crisis which does necessarily attract the attention of government.  The Government will then, if that happens, complain about lawlessness and speak about the necessity for strong methods but if that does happen it will be the result of the Government's negligence and complacency as expressed in the extraordinary answering here of the Minister for Local Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>The third subject on which I want to speak and on which I should like to develop my thoughts a little is that of the crisis in Northern Ireland and in this country generally which came to a head in the month of August but which still continues and which is likely to affect us again.  I want to devote considerable attention to this because I feel that the underlying gravity of the present situation here in relation to this is not sufficiently understood.  We have given a lot of thought, and rightly, to the situation in the north itself and, of course, we have debated that. I will not go back to the position before our debates here in October. It would not be proper that I should. But, I do want to look at what has <Col N="1839" /> happened since and I want to look in particular at how our Government have treated this matter because I think that with the simmering violence in the north and with the tendencies to a responsive violence on this side of the Border we are facing dangers which, if they are incoherently dealt with, may lead to disaster&mdash;I should like to weigh my words here; I do not want to enter into anything in the form of self-fulfilling prophecy as some have done on this subject&mdash;but there are serious dangers&mdash;we must all hope they will be avoided&mdash;which could even lead to the possibility of civil war in this island.  That is a reason for looking very attentively at the question of whether this issue is being coherently, competently, responsibly handled by our Government in such a way that we can have full confidence that everything that can be done to avert that danger will be done.</P>
    <P>Let us see, then, if that is so.  Perhaps, no Government in our history were offered so good an opportunity of uniting the Dáil and the electorate on a great national issue as this Government were offered in the crisis of this summer and autumn.  Both Opposition parties scrupulously refrained from embarrassing the Government during the crisis.  Both, indeed, supported what they believed to be the essentials of Government policy, at least, the key element of renouncing the use of force as expressed in the Tralee speech which we welcomed and would still welcome to the extent to which it could still reasonably be held to be Government policy&mdash;an extent which is I fear very small.  The Government had a great opportunity, not certainly of uniting the country in present circumstances&mdash; no Government however wise or well led could have that opportunity now&mdash; but an opportunity&mdash;and this is important too&mdash;of uniting the Dáil and the electorate on the basis of a reasonable approach not only to the immediate problems but to the problems that underlie the territorial division of this island.  The importance of that does not seem yet to have been sufficiently grasped.</P>
    <P>The Government could have begun <Col N="1840" /> to lay the foundations for better relations between the major communities of this island, the great religious groups, those better relations without which there is no conceivable hope for eventual unity, once force is ruled out, if force is really ruled out.  This Government could have tried, with full support from the Opposition parties in this House&mdash;support which would have been generously forthcoming&mdash;to quench the fires of sectarian hate and fear which still smoulder so dangerously within that area, with the sparks drifting across the Border.  They could have set their faces effectively against adventurism and the mischievous, lightminded bombast that has so long bedevilled this problem.  They could have tried to reach the majority in the north with the message that no one of any importance in this part of the country has any intention of trying to coerce them or to trick them into joining with us.  The Government could have availed themselves of every opportunity through television and otherwise to reach that population with a message understandable to it and directed to it. Such opportunities have presented themselves.  I am sorry to say they were not taken.  The Taoiseach could have spoken on Ulster television and did not do it.  I do not know why he did not do it.  Perhaps, he will tell us some time.  The Government could have reinforced that message by, for example, renouncing in clear terms, as they were urged to do, the use of anti-partition propaganda directed to third parties, a form of propaganda which can have no meaning in relation to unification unless the will of the majority in the north is in some way to be circumvented.  If it is not to be circumvented, why is one talking to those people out there?  What is one asking them to do?  Since the will of the majority in the north cannot in the last analysis be circumvented without some form of coercion, whether applied from Dublin, London or elsewhere, and since coercion seemed&mdash; seemed&mdash;to be ruled out by the Tralee speech, it should have been possible and would have been useful to rule out also anti-partition propaganda directed to third parties.  That has not been done.  The propaganda has been tuned <Col N="1841" /> down in accordance with an orchestration which corresponds to the needs of Twenty-Six County politics and, perhaps, the internal necessities of the Fianna Fáil Party but does not correspond to the needs of the problem itself which require not just a temporary tuning down and tuning up of this kind of propaganda but its complete elimination in a frank and honest manner. More than this, the Government could have ensured that all their utterances on this still explosive subject were responsible, coherent, consistent and visibly animated by the purpose of improving the relations between the major communities&mdash;not exacerbating them.</P>
    <P>It may be asked, and it would be reasonable to ask, what exactly could have been accomplished if the Government had behaved in that way, a way which would have been supported by this House overwhemingly as a whole.  If the Government had acted in that way, would it have ended Partition?  Would it have won over, say, Mr. Paisley or Mr. McKeague? Obviously it would not nor would any other policy now accomplish these things.  We must not deceive ourselves as to what the bounds of possibility are in this matter.  But the kind of approach I describe could have had, and I believe would have had, a calming effect.  It could have rendered further violence less likely.  It could have made the position of the Catholic minority in the north more secure, especially in Belfast, by reducing the fears which still centre now most acutely on that minority&mdash;the fears entertained, quite sincerely, by many Orangemen that the minority is simply a stalking-horse for the ambitions of the Dublin Government.</P>
    <P>It is that belief which is in the minds of the tragically-deluded men who go out for the Ulster Volunteer Force and who resemble people who have gone out on similar missions from this side of the Border too.  A responsible Government policy could also have helped the moderate elements in the northern majority, the people who would like the Hunt and Cameron reforms to be genuinely worked and who would wish at least for peace to return to their community&mdash;and there <Col N="1842" /> are a great many of them&mdash;and it would have made possible the resumption of a serious dialogue about common problems, a dialogue in which people from this part of the country, representatives of the northern minority and of moderate majority elements in that area could all take part with a view to making peaceful progress more likely and further outbreaks of murder, mayhem and arson less likely.</P>
    <P>That is what the kind of policy I have outlined could reasonably be expected to have accomplished, sustained over an adequate period of time, which would not need to have been very prolonged in order to furnish some of the desired results although, of course, it does need to be sustained in a consistent, resolute spirit over a period of years and not departed from under the winds of opportunism or factional difference within a group.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider how the Government have actually handled this issue.  First of all, they have shown themselves completely indifferent to any national advantages that might be derived from a unified approach by all parties in the Dáil on this issue.  The Taoiseach made this absolutely clear in his chilling and perfunctory reply to our debate on 23rd October last when I believe both Opposition parties had gone, with perhaps some generosity, a considerable way to meet him. &ldquo;Our approach is the right approach,&rdquo; he said, flatly.  He concluded: &ldquo;As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, we are, as I have said, the party of reunification and so long as the other parties come along with us in that course they are welcome to join us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have some small reason to be grateful for that statement.  At least it is unambiguous.  Fianna Fáil know it all in this matter.  They need no advice from anyone else and, though reunification in their hands has made absolutely no progress, as the whole country knows, during the more than 30 years in which they have held office, their leader can still call them complacently &ldquo;The party of reunification&rdquo;&mdash;no other parties need apply.  I believe that a genuine party of reunification would at this time, and for many years&mdash;whether we look forward or <Col N="1843" /> backwards&mdash;be preoccupied mainly with the relations between the major communities, the main religious groupings in this island.  The form which history has given to these relations is the root cause of Partition, not the other way round.  The Taoiseach would not accept that formulation.  His &ldquo;party of reunification&rdquo;, a party that has not, for many years, given any serious thought to the history of this problem and which I do not believe knows the history of this problem, is committed to the <i>prima facie</i> ridiculous proposition that Partition is the root cause of sectarian hatreds, fears and violence which racked that area for generations before Partition was ever thought of, as Deputy Blaney at least could tell the Taoiseach.  Whatever about that, the Taoiseach, or any other rational man, even one who has only looked at the problem in its most recent manifestations and at a superficial level, would have to admit that tension between the major religious groups was the immediate cause at the very least of the most recent violence and that a &ldquo;party of reunification&rdquo; would have to give a very high and anxious priority to an effort to reduce such tensions.</P>
    <P>The debate to which I refer, the debate entitled &ldquo;The Situation in the Six Counties&rdquo;, which took place in this House on 22nd and 23rd October last&mdash;the only debate on this subject since the events of August and a long-postponed debate it was&mdash;provided within itself, by a strange irony, a sorry example of how the &ldquo;party of reunification&rdquo; and its leader handle this most delicate matter in actual practice&mdash;and, of course, it is practice that counts.  It is not lip-service to the idea of tolerance, to the ending of sectarian violence, and so on: that is not what counts.  What counts is practice&mdash; how this matter is handled in the terms of relations between human beings in this island now.</P>
    <P>In that debate, a Fine Gael Deputy from a Border constituency who happens to be a Protestant produced evidence which he held up in this House from the Fine Gael benches over there to show that the local Fianna <Col N="1844" /> Fáil organisation in Monaghan exploited sectarian animosity against him as a Protestant in order to defeat him electorally in very much the same way&mdash;though of course on a much smaller scale, necessarily&mdash;as the Unionist Party has historically exploited this kind of feeling and this kind of fear among Protestants for the benefit of its particular kind of conservatism. That episode in itself might not be important.  It might mean no more than that a few local party hacks had misbehaved themselves as perhaps some people do in every group at various times perhaps in the belief that when the party leadership was using&mdash; as it was then&mdash;a Red scare in the elections, pretending that people they knew not to be Communists were Communists it might be permissible for them, for this little organisation in Monaghan, to use a little Orange scare, pretending that a Fine Gael Deputy who happened to be a Protestant must be a sympathiser with the B Specials, as he was not, and as of course they knew him not to be.</P>
    <P>If it had been just a local effort of that type it would be a mistake to take it too seriously I quite agree, but what was significant in relation to this matter, a small thing in appearance but a very significant thing in reality, was the Taoiseach's reaction or lack of reaction.  He failed altogether in his reply to that debate to react to Deputy Fox's revelations which appeared to many of us as disquieting. He made no reference to them at all in his speech closing the debate on the &ldquo;Situation in the Six Counties&rdquo;, which was the official title of that debate, a speech in which he found time to recite a little rhyme about a pussycat and generally to handle the closing in a rather leisurely way.  He did not find time to refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>The leader of a party of reunification, a party who were in earnest, a party who were truly concerned about the strained relations between the religious groups, the strained relations which as we all know are at the heart of this matter, at least now, would have shown himself, especially in the context of a debate like this, most sensitive and vigilant in relation to the <Col N="1845" /> kind of disclosure which was made by Deputy Fox.  Such a leader would have realised the implications of the transaction referred to by the Deputy and the way in which they would be interpreted by many north of the Border.</P>
    <P>Realising that, he would at the very least have given some indication&mdash;it would not have cost him very much&mdash; that he would look into the matter and that, if the facts were as represented, he would ensure that nothing like that would ever happen again.  That, I think, is the minimum acceptable response from a leader concerned with the importance of this problem to a matter of this kind.  But no.  The leader of this party of reunification did not think the matter worth referring to at all.</P>
    <P>I infer from that&mdash;and I infer it with sincere regret&mdash;that the Taoiseach and his party are not really interested in the tensions between the major religious groupings or in the need for reducing them.  I do not see what else I can infer.  I infer from that in turn&mdash; and I think this inference is inescapable if we accept the first one&mdash;that the leader of the party of reunification is not really interested in reunification. Possibly some members of his party and even of his Cabinet are of the same opinion, though reaching that conclusion by a very different road from mine.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, for example, is one.  I happened to be in Belfast at the time he made his now celebrated Letterkenny speech to the effect that the use of force could not be ruled out in certain circumstances.  As it happened the people I was speaking to in Belfast belonged mainly to the minority.  I was addressing a gathering organised by the Christian Brothers Past Pupils Union.  I did not find anyone in that gathering at that time who seemed to welcome the Minister's offer to rescue them.  I did find, in fact, that some of them felt statements of that kind only made the very difficult position of the minority more difficult by making the Unionist hardliners feel that their own siege-mentality was justified.</P>
    <P>Of course members of the minority, <Col N="1846" /> certainly in Belfast, were acutely conscious of the fact that any attempt to rescue them could only put them in far greater and more instant jeopardy than they are already.  They therefore were very conscious&mdash;conscious in their persons and conscious in relation to the security of their families and their own lives&mdash;of the profound irresponsibility as they saw it, and as I see it, of that statement, This was borne out on the following day when the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> led off its editorial by announcing that the statement by the Minister proved the necessity for the Ulster Defence Regiment which some have referred to as the continuation of the B Specials under another name though, of course, it does differ in some important respects from the old organisation.</P>
    <P>It was certainly in that spirit that the speech was received by the majority in the north, not just the Paisleyites who are not really the majority but by almost all sections of Protestant and Unionist opinion, including the most moderate sections of that spectrum. Quite certainly and quite obviously the Minister does not care about that. Does the Taoiseach care about it? Does he care that another member of his party, Senator McGlinchey, who I believe is quite closely associated with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, advocated in another branch of this Oireachtas the use of foul means or fair, as he did in the Seanad on 4th December?  Does he care that the Minister for Local Government once, as Senator McGlinchey implied he did also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any case, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I respect your ruling and will with pleasure refrain from further allusion to the individual in question.  Does the Taoiseach care when the Minister for Local Government wants to undo, as he says, the wrongs not merely of 50 years but of 300 years?  They want to go back I think it is a little more than 300 years. Whereas the Unionists only want to go back to 1690, apparently some gentlemen over there want to go back to 1641 or perhaps even earlier than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably it.  They want to undo the Plantation of Ulster, presumably by uprooting the descendents of the population then planted, that is to say, the Protestant population of the north.  I am not suggesting that anyone takes these threats <i>qua</i> threats <i>qua</i> suggestions of actual military intervention very seriously. That is not the point.  I think they deserve to be taken seriously to the extent that they affect the position of the majority and the minority in the north.  They affect them adversely and they increase tension but I do not think that as actual threats of intervention now they are taken altogether seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that, while gentlemen like this remain in the Cabinet or in the Oireachtas, and while they continue to be vocal on this issue in this way, the Taoiseach's more moderate utterances on this same question&mdash;and I am glad to say at least that they are more moderate&mdash;are completely discredited. It is of no use for any of us any more to tell people in the north, as some of us were telling them, that the use of force is ruled out by all parties in the Oireachtas.  It is of no use to say the Taoiseach has reiterated the non-coercion principle of his Tralee speech, since that is cancelled out by the presence of gentlemen who say something quite different.  It is of no use <Col N="1848" /> trying by some tortuous process of semantics to pretend to reconcile what the Taoiseach said in Tralee with what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said in Letterkenny.  This is not a question of a fitting together of formulae so that some common ground can perhaps be inferred or be patched up in some way.  That does not work in such matters, such extremely delicate and explosive matters as we are dealing with here.</P>
    <P>The spirit of the two speeches and the emphasis of the two speeches are so far apart that they discredit one another and discredit a Government containing such disparate voices on this absolutely vital subject which affects the future of our whole island and may affect&mdash;let us not over-dramatise it&mdash; in certain conditions even the lives of ourselves and our families and indeed many people.  From this the inference is necessarily drawn&mdash;from the presence of these conflicting voices in the Government on this subject&mdash;that the Government cannot be taken seriously on this subject.</P>
    <P>I suppose all Opposition speakers from time to time like to say the Government cannot or should not be taken seriously, but we find it alarming as citizens when we find that, on a subject like this, this statement is really true, that there is no central animating purpose in this Government, that nobody knows what the Government or parts of the Government will do in some future crisis.  When we know that future crises are probably brewing, the implications of this are extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is a wing of the Government which holds&mdash;and its opinion has been most candidly expressed outside this House I am obliged to say&mdash;that force is morally and politically justifiable if it can be applied in such ways as to offer any hopes of success.  We know that view exists.  Circumstances may well occur in which to minds like these such hopes of success might seem to present themselves.  What would happen?  Will we be brought to the point, during the early 1970s perhaps, when we have to consider, as people do in some countries whether the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice at any given moment belongs or does not belong to <Col N="1849" /> the physical force wing of this party of reunification by various incompatible methods?</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on that, but the more dangerous it is, the greater the importance that the Government, in whatever crisis may present itself, should be one whose utterances and whose leader's utterances should be credible and command confidence. They should give an effective lead to the overwhelming majority in this part of the country and should be regarded as responsible and reliable indications of intent and settled policy by both the majority and the minority in the north. That notoriously is not the case at the moment and it cannot be as long as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, and the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, remain in the Cabinet.  It is extremely dangerous for all of this country, the majority and the minority, north and south, that this should be the case.  We believe that while these people remain in these positions, particularly Deputy Blaney, no one having any serious realisation of the problem or who has understood its history and character and present implications can support this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity, from the economic point of view, to look back and review the developments of the current year and at the same time look forward to next year and try to assess the likely course of developments, try to foresee what problems or difficulties will arise and, if possible, try to propound sensible and wise courses of action.  The year 1969 has been a reasonably good year from the point of view of the economy but it has not been as good as it could have been.  The volume of total national production has risen by about four per cent which is in line with what we have been achieving over the last three years.  The average for the past three years in the growth rate has been 4½ per cent.  That is fairly good by world standards but could be a great deal better and it would have been a great deal better if it had not been for some unfortunate <Col N="1850" /> occurrences.  Industrial output has been particularly buoyant during the year. Production in manufacturing industry in the first quarter was upset by the unfortunate dispute which took place in the early part of the year.  However, in the second quarter it registered a rise of 11 per cent and that strong, upward surge is almost certain to have continued during the third and fourth quarters.  This was paralleled by a very satisfactory increase in industrial exports which to date have gone up by about 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Total exports went up by £34 million and that despite the fact that cattle exports were sluggish during the year. We can look forward with some confidence to their being better next year. There was also a considerable volume of activity in building and construction. Agricultural production was higher although the extent to which it increased is not yet available.  In the year to mid-1969 the number of persons employed in the transportable goods industry was up by about 10,000 and it is likely that the numbers in all other sectors also increased with, of course, the exception of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to underline as firmly as I can that our economy is basically sound and that it is an expanding economy. As I said, we are achieving a reasonable rate of growth; our external reserves are adequate for our purposes; we are achieving an increasing rate of investment and our exports are steadily increasing.  The problems we have stem from growth and from expansion.  It is important that we should keep that in mind.  We could solve all our economic problems simply by stopping growth, by turning off the tap.  That was done before but it is not our way of doing things.  To do that means hardship, unemployment, distress and emigration. Our policy is to keep pushing up economic growth to the limit of our resources.  That calls for very accurate judgment to determine precisely where that limit is.  It would be wrong and unjust to deny our people the highest level of economic growth we can obtain.  That would mean denying our people jobs, houses, levels of incomes and standard of living to which they are fully entitled.  On the other hand, there is an equally grave responsibility <Col N="1851" /> on us to keep the economy sound for our people, to prevent it racing too far ahead of its real potential, because in that way we would also do an injustice to our people by bringing about serious disruption, hardship and unemployment. How are we to achieve this balance?  How are we to determine the point when real growth has ceased and something which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;froth has taken its place?  I suggest we can only do this by sound planning and, perhaps, more important by accepting the discipline of our own economic plans.  Our economic planning techniques are reasonably good.  Certainly comparing them with other countries in the free world which adopt economic planning. They are reasonably satisfactory. Admittedly, they could be improved and we are seeking at all times to improve them.</P>
      <P>We can however make fairly realistic projections as to what is going to happen for at least 12 months ahead, perhaps more, provided, of course, that no serious disruption takes place and nothing happens that would upset our basic assumptions.  We were able to forecast fairly accurately what would happen during 1969.  Despite the fact that there were a number of disruptive factors, the balance of payments will turn out to be practically as we predicted.  It was a fairly good year, though it could have been better.  We can, on the basis of certain assumptions, make equally valid projections for 1970.  It is already clear at this stage that four principal characters will occupy the centre of the economic stage during 1970: prices, pay, Government expenditure and the balance of payments.  We have a great deal of ground to make up during 1970, and I hope to suggest ways and means whereby we can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, the most important thing during 1970 is to keep prices under control and to try to restore sanity on the pay front.  I think there is a moral obligation on employers and on the unions to try to bring back some <Col N="1852" /> semblance of normality into the pay situation.  The level of the demands which are being made in different sections today cannot be described as realistic, and it is quite illusory for any group to think that by getting in first they will do better than everybody else.  As soon as any one group succeeds in jumping the gun, they are simply giving inflation another push forward.  What is needed in everybody's interest is the restoration of order and a complete deflation of the unrealistic expectations which prevail in practically every area.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to be partisan on this subject of pay.  I can understand the attitude of the ordinary worker in this matter.  In an inflationary situation he has a very real fear of being left behind and he seeks in his demands to anticipate further inflation and to anticipate excessive claims by other groups who come after him.  In addition, increasing prices push him to seek compensation for the inflation that he sees taking place all round him, and these two pressures on the ordinary working man are very real and very understandable.</P>
    <P>The question is, how are we to break out of this straitjacket, because if we do not right the situation by wise and sensible measures, it is certain that the situation will right itself ultimately by its own harsh, inbuilt mechanisms.  Is it possible that some re-assurance to the worker, some lessening of the pressures I have mentioned should be the first step?  We could make significant progress if the trade union movement could be persuaded that an orderly progression can take place, that real pay increases and national production can march forward together, with price stability and steadily improving standards, which are real and which will be maintained.  There are three main parties involved in this: the Government, the trade union movement and the employers.  The Government are ready to take part in any discussions with either of the other two parties that would seem to help towards bringing about this situation.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of this inflationary situation to which I should like <Col N="1853" /> to direct the attention of the House&mdash; the position of the lower paid worker and the weaker sections of the community.  In an inflationary situation their position becomes increasingly hazardous.  The ICTU and the Government made a determined effort in 1969 to do something about the position of the lower paid worker.  I had hopes that 1969 would be the year of the lower paid worker, and the Government are anxious that this development should not be allowed to peter out but rather that it should gain momentum until the time comes when we can finally say that the problem of the lower paid worker and the weaker sections of the community has been solved.  Unfortunately, it does not give any appearance at the moment of solution.  Indeed, it does not seem to be commanding from the people who should be concerned about it the attention it deserves.  It must be an integral part of any attempt at a prices and incomes policy.  The Government are ready and anxious to enter into any discussions with the Congress or the employers which might be useful in getting some significant continuing progress.</P>
    <P>I said the balance of payments would be one of our main preoccupations during 1970.  Perhaps, we should look at exactly what did happen during 1969 on the balance of payments front. However, before doing that I want to make this general comment, that it would be most unfortunate if we were to allow ourselves to drift into a state of hypnosis about the monthly trade figures.  The figures in any particular month are of very little importance in themselves.  What matters is the underlying trend and that can only be studied over a period of time.  Any one month's figures can be subject to a wide range of random influences such as exceptionally heavy purchases of capital equipment, the bunching of shipments of commodities, an industrial dispute and so on.  Any of these things can completely distort the picture in any one month.  There was a very interesting illustration of that in the last two months, October and November of this year.  There was a considerable upsurge in the import excess in October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> As I pointed out at the time, that increase in the import excess was almost entirely due to the importation of capital goods and the raw materials which we need for our industry. Nevertheless, it was a very considerable increase and it had to be taken note of as such.</P>
    <P>The November figures have just been published and, in spite of what a lot of people anticipated would happen, the figures for November show a substantial improvement on October.  In fact, the import excess for November this year is almost identical with the figure for November of last year.  It is clear that one would have been very foolish to have reacted violently, or to have reacted at all, to either of these months' figures by themselves.  One might have been tempted to rush into remedial measures as a result of the October figures and likewise one might have been equally tempted to say that the whole balance of payments problem had been solved because the import excess, as illustrated by the November figures, had been arrested.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point as clearly as I can that what really matters is the trend, and that can only be identified over reasonably long periods.  I believe the balance of payments deficit this year will be in the neighbourhood of the figure of £55 million I suggested at Budget time.  For the 11 months to November the import excess increased by £55 million but that disimprovement in the balance of trade will be offset to some extent by higher net receipts from tourism and other invisible items.  For the year as a whole the balance of payments deficit is likely to be of the order of £60 million or under.  As I have already explained, that is almost identical with the forecast I made at Budget time when one makes allowance for one particular item, namely, the postponement of the sale of aircraft.</P>
    <P>When looking at a balance of payments deficit it is important to understand why it came about.  The fact is that it is mainly a reflection of the growth and expansion of our economy. In 1969 there has been a very significant increase in fixed investment.  The public sector investment has risen and, <Col N="1855" /> while the extent to which the private enterprise investment is likely to have risen is not known, certainly it is clear that the total investment in the economy increased very significantly during 1969.  Fixed investment as a percentage of national production is likely to have reached the record figure of 22 per cent.  It is clear also that the import of capital goods accounted for about 40 per cent of the total increase in imports in the first nine months of this year.  It is quite justifiable then to say that the balance of payments deficit which we have, and any problems which arise from it, flow directly from the growth and expansion of the economy and from increasing investment.</P>
    <P>We must nevertheless recognise that the balance of payments deficit is a problem which must be tackled.  We have been very fortunate this year in that the greater part of the balance of payments deficit has been financed by an in-flow of capital.  This can be clearly recognised from the fact that only a very small part of the deficit has been financed by drawing on our external reserves.  These reserves at mid-September are only £17½ million below what they were at the same time last year and are adequate by international standards.</P>
    <P>What, of course, is significant in this regard is the coming year.  We anticipated a balance of payments deficit of the order of £55 million this year.  We said it was a large deficit but we were prepared to go along with it in the circumstances of the year.  What we have got to decide now is what is going to happen in the coming year.  It does seem at this stage that a balance of payments deficit of the order of this year is likely to continue during the coming year.  Indeed, the indications are that unless some restraint is exercised on the pay grant it will be considerably larger, and this is the principal problem to which we will have to address ourselves in the coming year.</P>
    <P>We have got to increase our competitiveness. We have got to get the economy into the best possible shape so that we can bring this balance of <Col N="1856" /> payments deficit under control during the coming year.  The Taoiseach yesterday indicated our view as to what should happen with regard to pay during the coming months.  This is an attempt by us to lay down a guideline for all concerned.  It is an absolute truism that, if the community gives itself or awards itself increases in pay and income that are not justified by the level of national production, those apparent increases very quickly become illusory and are wiped out by the inflation which they necessarily bring in their train.  The figure of 7 per cent mentioned by the Taoiseach is, if anything, on the generous side.</P>
    <P>It is very early yet to make any prediction about growth during 1970 but it does look as if we can count on a growth rate of somewhere in the region of four per cent.  To base income increases generally at 7 per cent in relation to that four per cent is certainly not to be unduly restrictive, to say the least of it.  I hope the responsible people who will have to grapple with these problems during the coming months will look on this guideline as an honest attempt by the Government to indicate what is possible.  I want to repeat that it is totally illusory for workers to award themselves income increases which are not justified by what they produce.  As I said earlier, one cannot expect the worker to exercise restraint in his demands for increased wages if we cannot guarantee him some sort of stability, and the guaranteeing of that stability must be another major preoccupation during the coming year.  We shall have to try to halt the spiral and bring about comparative price stability so that workers will be able to get increases in pay which are both realistic and meaningful. That is the overall approach of the Government to this problem and, as I have said, we are both willing and anxious to enter into discussions at any time with any of the other parties to see how and in what way the situation can be improved or what beneficial measures can be taken.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of what the Taoiseach said about the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1857" /> looking very closely indeed at all applications coming before him for price increases.  He will expect that those making applications will have tried to offset by improved productivity and otherwise any increases in costs before coming to him at all.  He will also have regard, of course, to the guideline laid down by the Taoiseach in respect of price applications based on increased wage costs.  These attempts to bring sanity into the situation are, of course, basically in the interests of the workers, the poor and the weaker sections of the community because, in an inflationary situation, the wealthy can take care of themselves. It is the workers, especially the lower paid workers, who really take the brunt of inflation.  I want to remind the House now that in the 12 months to August of this year prices increased by eight per cent.  That is a pretty startling figure.  It is a figure which must cause us all to devote increasing attention during the coming year to the question of price stability.  We cannot possibly afford another year of inflation of that extent.</P>
    <P>Government expenditure has a very important part to play in the picture and, from that point of view, 1970 will be a very difficult year.  It is, I know, customary for Ministers for Finance, usually after Christmas, in the month of January, to forecast that the coming year will be a very tough year from the point of view of the Budget.  I did not do that last year or the year before, but I am afraid I must do it this year. I must warn the House that the situation is such that Government expenditure will have to be kept under rigid control both on the capital and on the current side.  Whatever resources we have will have to be very rigidly allocated to productive purposes and many desirable things for which Deputies on both sides will be pressing will simply have to be postponed because, an excessive degree of Government expenditure, would contribute to the inflationary problem we are asking the rest of the community to grapple with.  We must play our part and I hope that, when the time comes, we will discuss the Budget in the full realisation of the position.  The paramount consideration <Col N="1858" /> in 1970 must be to control inflation and we must have regard to the part played by Government expenditure in such a situation.</P>
    <P>May I here digress for a moment to deal with two points made by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party during the debate?  Deputy Cosgrave spoke about a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy.  I think he just used that phrase for the sake of using it because it is totally unrealistic to accuse this Government of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy. We have, in fact, done everything we could to avoid anything in the nature of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo;.  Deputies will recall that we resisted the attempts by the Opposition to push us into having a supplementary budget.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald in a number of questions tabled to me seemed to be trying to infer that the balance of payments deficit was much worse than I anticipated it would be.  He seemed to me to be trying to push us into something premature on the external trade front. Far from having a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy, we have tried to pursue a consistent policy of growth and development, with a minimum of interference, and it is only when the problems associated with growth become menacing that we will take any measures which would interfere with that growth.  In so far as this year is concerned, we have been able to avoid any such measures and it is completely unrealistic for Deputy Cosgrave to accuse us of anything in the nature of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in what Deputy Corish had to say about the EEC because, like most other Members of this House, I am very interested in the prospects which are opened up for us by membership of the EEC and I am reasonably optimistic about the outcome of the present situation.  I was astonished to hear Deputy Corish say he was not too keen on the EEC because it was a &ldquo;rich man's club&rdquo; and until such time as he could see that it was prepared to make a contribution to the underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa, he would not look on the EEC with a great deal of favour. I do not know where Deputy Corish got his information about the EEC.  On <Col N="1859" /> that particular aspect, it seems to me, he is totally misinformed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No other group of nations is making such a contribution to this dire problem as the EEC countries are.  The Treaty of Rome itself provides for the association with the Community of 18 African and Malagasy States.  A special fund, the European Development Fund, has been set up to provide finance for measures aimed at promoting the social and economic development of these countries.  This fund has been fed with contributions from all the member countries of the EEC.  In addition to that, the European Investment Bank, originally intended for investment within the Community only, is now being used to handle projects in these African territories.</P>
      <P>The aid by the Community to these associated African nations has been in three stages.  The first stage was the five year period from 1957 to 1962; in that period the average aid per year was 116½ million dollars.  The second period was from 1964 to 1969 when the average aid per year was 146 million dollars.  The third stage is the period 1970 to 1975 and aid will be in the order of 200 million dollars per year on average.  That is only the aid given by the Community as such: each individual nation separately makes its own contribution and these contributions have been considerable.  Perhaps I should mention at this stage&mdash;I am sure Deputies are aware of it&mdash;that the figure suggested for aid to underdeveloped countries by the developed world is 1 per cent of national income. In the international table three of the member states of EEC are at the top.  France is first with 1.64 per cent of her national income; Germany is next with 1.26 per cent and the Netherlands is third with 1.24 per cent. Belgium comes fifth with 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the EEC countries, both as individual nations and as members of the Community, is very good. Furthermore, during the Community's <Col N="1860" /> recent negotiations with GATT it made very valuable concessions to the Third World.  I think it has abolished all import duties for its associated nations. Quite recently it has tabled a further offer under the UNCTAD scheme of tariff preferences for further aid for underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Corish had the true picture and was going to decide this issue solely on the basis of what contributions were being made by EEC to the underdeveloped part of the world, I think he would be into the EEC in the morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed with the Taoiseach's speech.  He gave us a statistical analysis of the situation but he did not touch on a wide area of Government policy.  In fact, when one recalls what he said the only thing that is worth recalling in his entire speech is his prediction of economic growth to the effect that in 1970 production will rise, perhaps, more than 4 per cent and that, therefore, a 7 per cent overall income increase would be tolerable to the economy.  That would be roughly a 30/- increase for an adult male. These are the same figures on which the Minister for Finance dwelt just now and he seemed to think that even these figures were over-generous.  I do not agree with the Minister in the apparent lightness with which he dealt <Col N="1862" /> with our trade figures.  They are not good and, while he properly says one cannot judge trade figures by looking at one month's return and that you must take the picture over a period, the trade figures we have had up to date for the past 11 months are by no means satisfactory.  He just countered by saying that some of our imports are largely for productive purposes and that there was not an undue percentage of consumer goods.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am old-fashioned but I believe in the simple trading concept that your imports and exports must have some kind of reasonable balance. There was a time when people in this House became alarmed when our trade imbalance was around £100 million. That was regarded as a ceiling which frightened everybody.  Now, when the imbalance is rocking over £200 million the Minister for Finance seems not to worry too much about it.  On other occasions when our trade figures were a little out of tune the Minister would come in and say that he was not worried because our external reserves were improving and so long as we had money in the bank, even if our business was going down, we had this bank balance to fall back on.  Now our external reserves have dropped to the small amount of, perhaps, £17 million which he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dropped very much in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that our external reserves have gone down at the same time as our trade figures have shown a very serious imbalance. However, I will come back to that later.  Before I forget it, I may mention here that when the Minister for Finance, who would be a kind of key figure in this matter, was saying what we should do to get our economy right he, very significantly, referred to the question of pay restraint.  In not one instance did he dwell upon the notion of incomes restraint generally. It was entirely a question of pay restraint.  That approach will not be acceptable in our society.  I do not think it is a good approach or that it is one that is calculated to get the fullest degree of co-operation from what <Col N="1863" /> might be called the ordinary employee or worker in our community.  It departs from the notion of prices and incomes control or a prices and incomes policy. There was excessive emphasis on wage control.  The Minister did make passing reference to price control but we know that in our society there has not been price control; it has been a completely phoney concept.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the responsible Minister, has a section in his Department to deal with price control.  Yet, if one asks any housewife or any man in the street how prices are going, they will say that every day prices are mounting considerably. There does not seem to be any worthwhile measure of price control. Even similar commodities, proprietary preparations from similar firms, will command different prices in different shops.  In that atmosphere it is very difficult to accept the notion that there has been any effective effort made to control prices.  One cannot but feel that price control is non-existent here and that prices have simply got out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the contribution made by the Minister for Labour who, apart from the Minister for Finance, would, in our economic circumstances, occupy a very important position now and particularly in the future.  I agree with him entirely on the question of unofficial strikes.  There is hardly a right-thinking person in our community who would not condemn unofficial strikes.  They are childish.  They are largely ineffective.  Nobody benefits from them.  They cause considerable upset to the economy.  I was rather confused by the Minister's later statement in which, I gather, he mentioned, in passing, that trade union rationalisation is an essential prerequisite to a prices and incomes policy.  I do not know which comes first, the hen or the egg.  If the Minister is going to say that he cannot proceed with any question of a prices and incomes policy, if the Government cannot even consider the question, until the trade unions put their house in order, that seems to me to be merely passing the buck, merely trying to by-pass the situation.  It is the same mentality as the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1864" /> and Fishery uses&mdash;he cannot meet the farmers until the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the NFA reconcile their difficulties.  This is a not-too-honest approach.  I think the Government are merely sidestepping their responsibilities in this matter and trying to throw blame back on the trade unions and saying that they cannot proceed with the matter until the trade unions rationalise the trade union position and put their house in order.</P>
    <P>The whole question of trade union rationalisation, desirable as it is, would be helped considerably if it were felt in that quarter that the Government really and seriously intended to introduce some measure of a prices and incomes policy.  If the Government showed any sincerity in that direction, it would considerably improve the industrial climate in our community.</P>
    <P>I was completely baffled by the statement by the Minister for Finance that the position of the lower paid worker must be an integral part of any prices and incomes policy.  I do not know what exactly he means by that, whether the lower paid workers' salaries and wages must be put right before he will embark on a prices and incomes policy. That was a statement which I could not follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour mentioned that world inflation had saved us in the past.  That is very true, and particularly inflation in Great Britain.  Had Britain not inflated her economy, if inflation had not taken place there to the extent it did, we would be in a very difficult economic position because our trading position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain would have run very much against us.</P>
    <P>Here again, there is an evidence of failure on the part of the Government to face up to the realities of a difficult situation.  When the Minister for Labour says that he cannot legislate for industrial peace, let me say, nobody has ever said one can; but surely one can legislate towards industrial peace; one can do something.  Apart from the setting up of a Labour Court some years ago, nothing further has been done that would be conducive to industrial peace.  This is a most important <Col N="1865" /> matter.  There has been no real worthwhile effort and worthwhile thinking coming from our Government on this question of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>When we speak of inflation, to ask for voluntary restraint is quite ridiculous. People will spend money as long as they can get it.  Yesterday Deputy Fahey said that the people would follow the advice of a responsible Government and responsible Ministers and would exercise restraint.  Poor Deputy Fahey wears a pioneer pin.  He has never been inside a pub.  If he goes to any of the singing pubs all over the country he will realise what voluntary restraint is and what spending is. People will spend money as long as they can get their hands on it, whether it is in a pub or on holidays or anything else.  Voluntary restraint is a counsel of perfection.  I do not see it operating in this society or in any other society.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Labour expounding his philosophy about western depopulation.  He is apparently wedded to the notion that we must prevent rural depopulation on the western seaboard.  Coming from a place where emigration has been very high I quite understand that that would be his approach.  At the same time we have not heard any pronouncement from the Government on the important question of Buchananism&mdash;the Buchanan Report.  They have been strangely silent.  Apart from individual Deputies who happen to be in areas affected by emigration, particularly those from the west, we have had no official Government pronouncement on this entire question of industrial centralisation.  Of course, we have seen industrial centres established in Galway, Waterford, Limerick.  On the question of what to do with our population&mdash;whether we accept this or whether we will resist and try to prevent, if possible, depopulation of the rural areas&mdash;we should like to hear some official comment.  The Taoiseach in his speech carefully avoided any reference to that particular aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>I feel our economy is in danger of moving into a serious recession.  We have been through all this before.  The <Col N="1866" /> Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, thinks we have been hypercritical, that we have been unnecessarily accusing the Government of pursuing a stop-go policy.  I do not think the Government have deliberately pursued a stop-go policy.  I think it has been, so to speak, forced upon them by political circumstances. I believe we would have a smoother expansion of the economy if, for example, we had no such thing as elections.  I believe political pressures of elections have affected the smooth growth of our economy.  We are now passing.  I think, through a period which we experienced before.  Last March, a warning was issued by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, about our economy being under strain. He betook himself to Telefís Éireann to make a general pronouncement on the matter.  Subsequently, he introduced a Budget which was a nice Budget.  It did not suggest that the economy was under strain.  It was a Budget, of course, which preceded a general election. Then, during the autumn, during the months of September and October, there were general rumours that we would have a mini-Budget.  The economy was very buoyant, has remained very buoyant, but our trade figures were becoming unsatisfactory. Now we have the position where we are, I believe, passing into a recession and where restrictive measures will probably have to be imposed.</P>
    <P>I can recall that some few years ago, a somewhat similar set of circumstances arose.  Again, political considerations were paramount to subsequent economic developments: I think it was in 1963.  Mr. Seán Lemass was then Taoiseach.  He submitted a White Paper entitled <i>Closing the Gap.</i> At that time, the very self-same economic arguments were advanced as were advanced today by the Minister for Finance, namely, that expenditure was outrunning production; that we were living beyond our means and that we would have to tighten our belt; we were faced with a balance of payments difficulty and we would have to close the gap between consumption and production.  That was in the Spring of 1963.  Subsequently, the turnover tax was introduced.  A by-election <Col N="1867" /> took place in Dublin North-East and, under the agitation surrounding this turnover tax, there was a considerable drop in the Government's vote.  At that time, there were two important impending by-elections.  Suddenly our economy that had been passing through dangerous circumstances in the spring suddenly, a few months later, was so good that, pending these vital by-elections, it improved to such an extent that the then Taoiseach gave what we termed at that time the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; and told, by letter, the ICTU and the FUE and the public in general that the time was ripe for a wage increase to all workers and employees in the community.  The FUE and the ICTU met and disagreed.  Mr. Lemass got them to meet again and they disagreed again.  He got them to meet a third time and a 12 per cent wage increase was agreed to although, at that time, his economic advisers had told him that the economy could not stand that measure of wage increase. But the ICTU had Mr. Seán Lemass across the barrel because he was fighting two vital by-elections which, if he lost, would have meant a change of Government.</P>
    <P>Because Fianna Fáil was faced with the threat of being put out of power, the economy&mdash;which was &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; in the spring&mdash;was in perfect condition in the following autumn, so good indeed that we all could go on a spending spree.  Of course, we paid the penalty.  The credit squeeze of June, 1965, was the answer to the extraordinary non-national behaviour of the then Taoiseach.  In June, 1965, the present Taoiseach asked &ldquo;What happened to my March Budget?&rdquo; We had a credit squeeze.  Our economy was damped down.  The general economic advance which we could have expected and which we would have enjoyed had we an ordered forward march in our economy, did not take place.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, now says that we are unnecessarily and very improperly accusing him and the Government of which he is a member of pursuing a stop-go policy.  I say that we are perfectly <Col N="1868" /> entitled to say that the Government have deliberately and for very unworthy reasons pursued in the past a stop-go policy and not only in the past, but at present also.  I believe if the occasion arose tomorrow morning they would do exactly the same thing.  I know all Governments do that.  I suppose they tend to do it.  All Government parties when they are speaking from that side of the House will wear rosy spectacles and say the economy is better than it is.  We on this side will probably go the other way and say it is even worse than it is.  That is the tendency in parliamentary practice, I suppose, in most democracies.</P>
    <P>It is quite proper for the Minister for Finance to look around with an innocent expression and say: &ldquo;We never did anything like that.  Do not accuse us of ever pursuing a stop-go policy.&rdquo;  A stop-go policy is the bane of economic development in every country in the world.  I do not know if there has ever been a case of a Prime Minister more deliberately, more wantonly and more brutally moving into a Parliament to put the whole economy of the country in pawn to preserve power for himself and his party.</P>
    <P>When I say that we are on the verge of recession at present I am speaking in good company.  The last report from the Central Bank gave ample warning. The report of the Economic and Social Research Institute of September, 1969, states on page 1:</P>
    <P>Allowing present trends to continue means running the economy with no safety margin.  On the other hand, further restrictive action on top of the monetary tightening already undertaken would inevitably carry the risk of damaging confidence and reducing the rate of investment. The authorities would be helped in their choice if there were to be any genuine evidence of restraint by the community at large in claims for pay increases, higher guaranteed prices for agricultural products, or wider profit margins.</P>
    <P>That suggests restraint in a much broader concept than the restraint suggested by the Minister for Finance when he spoke here today and dealt solely with the question of wages.  That <Col N="1869" /> is practically suggesting a prices and incomes policy.  A prices and incomes policy is part of the policy of the Fine Gael Party and was first promulgated some few years ago.  I admit a prices and incomes policy has had a difficult &ldquo;go&rdquo; in Britain and I admit it is not an easy matter to put into operation. It is a more correct approach than a mere question of wage restraint which seems to be the sole notion in the mind of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Again to emphasise the fact that all is not well at present in our economy, I want to quote from page 18 of the same publication:</P>
    <P>As discussed in previous issues of OEC, we feel that the short-term damage to the balance of payments of rapidly increasing earnings and domestic prices have frequently been exaggerated.  However, there can be little doubt that a prolonged continuation of cost and price increases which are faster than those in other countries must ultimately have an adverse effect on exports, leading to a situation in which the apparent real standard of living must be reduced, either through devaluation or a period of severe deflation.  Tolerance of rising prices and large deficits for a number of successive years makes such a situation both more likely, and, when it comes, more painful. Rising pay and prices tend to lead to the creation of an inflationary psychology, in which the general expectation of increases becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy as the process accelerates.  External deficits imply that the society is living, and the economy expanding, at a rate in excess of that supported by the economy's own resources.  Once this excessive level has become accepted as normal, the adjustment back to a supportable level can be both psychologically and politically difficult, as recent experience in the United Kingdom has demonstrated.</P>
    <P>That paragraph is basically sound.  It emphasises one aspect of inflation which has been largely overlooked, the psychological aspect, the fact that when prices become excessive, when there is a lot of money in circulation, and <Col N="1870" /> people feel the value of that money is falling month by month, there is an inevitable tendency to excessive consumer spending.  If that is not met by a corresponding production, first our exports fall and then the economy goes haywire.  We are tending in that direction at present.  It is not to be forgotten that, while we had a 4 per cent growth rate in the past year, and it is projected that we will have a 4 per cent increase in the coming year, after the 1965 recession, for which we have ourselves to blame and not an outside influence, our growth rate sank for two or three years down to 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the rising cost of living and the consumer price index increase of 8½ per cent.  I believe the pressure exerted on the ordinary person in society is probably in excess of what is revealed by this figure, this calculated figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you examined that figure and turned over in your mind how it was arrived at, you would come to the conclusion that in such a society as we live in here, it understates rather than overstates the rise in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>As I said, I was disappointed at the Taoiseach's speech.  One would have thought that he would have approached the state of the nation in a broader fashion than he did.  It seems to be becoming the fashion that the Taoiseach comes in and says the least possible, awaits the comments of the Deputies and then chooses what he will say in his winding-up speech.  It would lead to a far better discussion if the Minister for Finance had touched on the broader aspects of our political and economic life rather than to have given a few figures that he had culled from or which had been handed to him by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are expected to become members of the EEC by 1972, according to recent pronouncements of the Minister for External Affairs, but most of us have only vague notions as to what this development will mean.  There is a general idea that it will help the farmers but that it will be tough enough <Col N="1871" /> on some of our industrialists.  For some years we have been providing adaptation grants to allow industries to equip themselves for this contingency.  Some articles on the subject have appeared from economists like Deputy Garret FitzGerald and others but I am not aware of any comprehensive publication from the Government in regard to what the realities are likely to be when we enter the Common Market.  Deputy Corish suggested that the Government &mdash;I presume they have the necessary information at their disposal&mdash;should issue a White Paper or some other document to tell us what we are likely to meet and what the difficulties are likely to be, as well as the opportunities when we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We will be one of ten nations and we will be one of the smallest nations and we are facing the situation as the weak man of Europe.  I already mentioned the consumer price index.  Prices here have advanced more rapidly since 1960 than they have in any other of the ten countries which we propose to join. Our gross national product in real terms has expanded more slowly than any of these ten countries.  Our personal income is lower than in any of these ten countries and, finally, our housing unit production per 1,000 population is lower than in any of these countries. In those circumstances it is desirable that the Government should issue a comprehensive study about the difficulties which are likely to face us when in 1972 we find ourselves members of a very large, highly-industrialised economic community which Deputy Corish chose to call a rich man's club.  If it is a rich man's club, are we to be the poor relations?</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in this annual stocktaking the Taoiseach had not one word to say about the Common Market although during the last 12 months he has been deluged with questions on the Order Paper.  Neither did he mention the word &ldquo;Buchanan&rdquo; nor the word &ldquo;Mansholt&rdquo; nor did he mention the Devlin Report which was one of the most expensive reports ever produced.  I understand that all they have done with the Devlin Report is to fire it back to the various Departments for their comments. <Col N="1872" /> Even the question of parliamentary reform, which would naturally follow up in the context of closer thinking on the Devlin Report, was not dealt with by the Taoiseach.  We have a considerable amount of public expenditure on semi-State bodies and the degree of public accountability of these bodies has come in for comment in this House and has been adverted to by the Committee of Public Accounts on many occasions.  This was a matter on which the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance might have been expected to say something but that subject too was by-passed.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing all that was said from the Government benches was that we sold more cement.  Everybody is aware of the difficult housing situation in Dublin and it is only right to point out that, despite all the Government's claims to be making an extra effort towards the house-building programme, the tendency in recent years has been &mdash;while there may be something to be said for it from one point of view, it is questionable from a social point of view&mdash;to rely more and more on building houses through the mechanism of grants and aids.  The percentage of State money being allocated to local authority housing has not kept pace.  I know it is tempting for any Government to provide money in the form of grants to somebody who will get the major part of the cost of the house through a building society, a bank or an insurance company, and then take credit for having built the house.  Financially it is a far more difficult problem for a Government to provide a bigger percentage of the money which necessarily they must do when it is a local authority house that is in question.</P>
    <P>The tendency in our financing of housing has been to switch from local authority housing to grant-aided housing, which means we help more and more the middle-class and perhaps the upper middle-class, and those who are absolutely unable by their own resources to provide a house are being neglected.  This is a trend which is socially undesirable, but it is the present thinking of the Government and the Minister for Local Government.</P>

To the average <Col N="1874" /> housewife, if she thinks of it at all, I suppose it means more for her groceries.

      <P>That is more effectively money, because it is big money, than the pounds, shillings and pence we <Col N="1875" /> carry around in our pockets.  This is something over which we have no control. The Fine Gael Party emphasised the importance of Central Bank control of the issue of credit.  The Central Bank has not yet devised a system whereby they can control the commercial banks.  In the last year the credit issue exceeded the recommendations of the Central Bank.  Not alone did our ordinary commercial banks disobey but our Government disobeyed.  There is the question of control of the commercial banks, not to speak of the moneylenders, whom I suppose we may hardly mention in this House as the matter is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
      <P>The danger of inflation in any society is that it induces a sense of euphoria. You sense that euphoria emanating now from the far benches.  Various people appear here who are certainly euphoric.  When Deputy Fahey was talking the other night he was suffering from a euphoria of inflation.  He was under the impression that we had never had it so good and that all this wellbeing emanated from and was due to Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Inflation is the economic sore of every society in the world.  We have had two or three doses of it here and we are facing another dose now.  It has serious and detrimental internal and external effects.  Internally, it induces speculation.  The chap who has got money and who is a member of Taca may be in a position to get good advice in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that Taca no longer exists.  It is now the Fianna Fáil Fund Raising Organisation.  It is a legitimate political fund raising organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear about the demise of Taca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with the effects on an economy of uncontrolled inflation. First of all, I said it led to undesirable speculation.  Those in well-organised trade unions can agitate and keep up with the increased prices attending inflation but the pitiful fact, as the then Deputy Dillon frequently used say, is that the rich get richer and the <Col N="1876" /> poor get poorer.  The sufferers of inflation are those who retired on small incomes feeling they could spend the rest of their days in comfort.  These people are virtually robbed by a Government which allow inflation to go on uncontrolled and in the end they have to go to the home assistance officer for help.  All too often these people find the value of money melting in front of their eyes.  The curse of inflation is that we are killing the weaker sections of our community who are unable to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>I recognise that every Government, every insurance company and every bank have a vested interest in inflation. It suits those concerns.  It is because of inflation that we have these large buildings belonging to banks and insurance companies on every street corner.  They have been built on inflation.</P>
    <P>There are also external dangers from uncontrolled inflation.  Our prices go too high because our production costs are too high and the result is that we cease to be able to export in a competitive fashion.  In an open economy, such as ours, the next thing that happens is that our external reserves are called upon to balance our falling commercial trade.  This is a natural corollary.  Despite what we may hope to gain from invisible exports, tourist remittances and capital inflow, the time will come when our external reserves will be exhausted and we will have balance of payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>These are the serious internal and external matters which arise from uncontrolled inflation.  On occasion we have deliberately induced inflation for base purposes.  It is because of that that I take strong issue with the innocent approach of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, in trying to disclaim all notions that his Government have ever followed a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy or would ever hear of such a thing.</P>
    <P>Failure to deflate in an inflated economy can mean the possibility of devaluation.  As far as I can judge we have a peculiar system here.  We have managed to preserve the value of our £ <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £ sterling by keeping a certain amount of money abroad to <Col N="1877" /> act as a guarantee.  On the other hand, we have allowed the value of our £ in our internal economy to be steadily eroded.  I imagine this is less likely to happen in other economies because the internal and external value of money rises and falls together.  If there is inflation in America the dollar moves with that inflation and the same position is true with other currencies.  I am not an economist, and I have never had any economist clarify this for me. Perhaps Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, when he speaks, will throw some light on this.</P>
    <P>We have preserved the value of our £ <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £ sterling by maintaining our external reserves, but we have allowed it to be eroded as regards the purchasing power within our own 26 counties.  The brake which other countries have by moving simultaneously inside and outside their frontiers does not seem to apply here.  We have been able to play willy-nilly with the value of the £ here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons is that we are a relatively small country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is a factor. The reason that this inflation has not hurt us more economically is because Britain has, over the years, inflated almost parallel to us.  As she is our major trading country we have not felt that impact, but will that situation continue in the context of the Common Market?</P>
      <P>Will a situation ever arise in which society as a whole will demand honesty from Government and say to Government: &ldquo;We want you to do your duty and preserve the purchasing power of our money when we get older and retire&rdquo;.  So far no Government have listened to that cry because the numbers affected for ill are less vocal than the organised young who can make their presence felt and agitate for increased wages to protect them against inflation.  Similarly, the well-advised professional man, the financier and the business man can protect themselves against the falling value of money by buying real estate or investing in other types of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> There is a failure by the Government as a Government to present to the nation and to the outside world a proper picture of collective responsibility. This has been dealt with at length by Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, particularly in respect of the situation in Northern Ireland.  We had a long debate on this, in which I did not personally participate, but I read the Taoiseach's now famous speech.  I also read some of the extraordinary vapourings of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  There is grave risk of our position here <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland being worsened and bedevilled by intemperate and ill-considered statements, particularly by Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who hold ministerial rank and whose utterances, therefore, tend to command perhaps more attention than do those of an ordinary Deputy.  Here is one field in which there should be unmistakable evidence of unity of thinking and collective responsibility.  These have been lamentably absent.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls itself the party of reunification.  I have never accepted that they are.  I believe they are quite happy with a partitioned Ireland.  They are in government.  They believe they will be in government for the next 20 or 30 years.  They have been there for a long time already.  Why should they rock the boat?  They are as comfortable here in government as the Unionists were in the north until the Civil Rights Movement started.  Had there been real sincerity of purpose surely they would, down through the years, have done something of a practical nature to preserve the picture their former leader described as an essential prerequisite to a better understanding between north and south and ultimate unity, namely, a unity of hearts.</P>

It is high time this irresponsible behaviour on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should cease.  Now that he has finished his fight with the farmers he is taking on the B Specials, or whatever crowd it is in the north is <Col N="1880" /> upsetting him.  He is behaving in a most irresponsible fashion.  It is time that the ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party used some common sense.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current salary scales for the three grades of physiotherapist in the local health authority services are as follows; Basic Grade, £850×£34&mdash;£1,210; Senior Physiotherapist, £1,025×£36&mdash; £1,277×£43&mdash;£1,320; Physiotherapist-in-Charge, <Col N="1883" /> £1,135×£36&mdash;£1,387×£38 &mdash;£1,425.</P>
    <P>The most recent increase&mdash;that is, the second phase of the 11th Round&mdash; was approved on 15th October last and amount to £65 a year effective from 1st June, 1969.</P>
    <P>The appropriate salary scale for an individual physiotherapist is decided by her grading.  If the Deputy would be kind enough to send me details of the special case he has in mind I shall be happy to investigate the matter.</P>

There are some 72 approved whole-time posts for physiotherapists in 22 health authorities and the remaining five have 23 sessional appointments on a temporary basis.

      <P>I understand that the negotiations being carried out by the housing authority are not yet finalised. However, on the basis of a statistical return received in my Department on the 18th November, 1969, I reapportioned the capital allocations to Dublin city and county for house purchase loans and supplementary housing grants so as to increase the amount available to the county council in the current financial year by £100,000 to £1,100,000.  This revised allocation, together with certain credit balances on their capital accounts, should enable the county council to make total payments of up to about £1,565,000 in the current financial year, compared with £1,008,000 last year and to issue loans, in the normal way, in respect of applications received by them up to the 1st September, 1969.  Applications received after that date would normally fall due for payment in 1970-71.  The capital allocation for that year is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 57 of 10th December, 1969.  I hope to convey a decision shortly on the contract documents for the laying of the new trunk main from Kilcarne to An Uaimh.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Meath County Council decided to proceed with the two schemes referred to by him at the same time as the major scheme was going <Col N="1897" /> on because of the urgent necessity to have a water supply for those two areas?  His officials, having visited the area as far as I am aware, expressed the opinion that this was the proper thing to do.  Under the circumstances, would the Minister consider issuing the sanction for the three schemes at the one time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that part of the 1967-68 public lighting programme has not yet been implemented by Dublin County Council and that Dublin County Council state it is quite impossible to implement this programme in view of the kind of co-operation they are receiving from the ESB?  There are large areas in County Dublin in complete and utter darkness. This is a danger to the children and to the women there and even to the motorists in the area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper articles in question refer, primarily, to a type of salesmanship whereby the prospective purchaser is given to understand that taking out a subscription to a magazine will help the seller to obtain or retain a scholarship. This seems to involve no breach of the law even if what is said is untrue. There is also a suggestion in the newspaper articles that, in some cases where deposits were taken up, the magazines were not delivered but this may be only a matter of delay in putting through the order, and I understand that when a complaint about a similar scheme was investigated some years ago it was found that this was so.  In that event, also, there would be no basis for Garda intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if there is a complete failure to fulfil an order, this is not, on the face of it, any more than a breach of contract even if payment had been made. If, however, it were shown that there was a systematic acceptance of deposits or subscriptions which were not being honoured, this could be a different <Col N="1901" /> matter.  Accordingly, anybody with a valid complaint on this score should report it to the local Garda as a series of complaints might provide a basis for Garda intervention.</P>
    <P>Of course it would be better still if people who are approached in this way would refuse to hand out money at the door to salesmen of whose identity and credentials they have no proper proof.</P>

      <P>The purchase of sires for the National Stud is the responsibility of the board of the Irish National Stud Company.  The board, however, informed me last autumn, as a matter of courtesy, that they had decided to buy the sire &ldquo;Tudor Music&rdquo; for £120,000.  I was not approached in relation to the purchase of any sire in 1968.  Prior to the passing of the National Stud Act, 1969, the board had no funds at its disposal for this purpose and no sires were, in fact, acquired by the company in 1968.</P>

      <P>The workers mentioned are seasonal workers whose period of employment in any year is not fixed.  The maintenance work considered necessary for the 1969 season has been completed for some schemes and the workers have been let go.  A few workers are retained on each scheme throughout the winter, mainly on patrol duties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that it was usual to employ these men from early March until late the following January and that because there was a wage increase of £2 5s given during the year the amount of employment was reduced so that they were laid off early in December and some were laid off in November? Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the work still remains to be done and some effort should be made to re-employ these men particularly as some of them are drawing social welfare benefit which may amount to what they would be getting if they were working?</P>

      <P>The administration of the major resort development scheme is a function of Bord Fáilte and my approval of development plans is not required.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that a resort development scheme for Kilkee has been prepared and that the board have already provided £50,000 towards the cost of a caravan park, golf clubhouse and shelter, promenade improvements, access works and property acquisition there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> Funds for the promotion of tourism have been provided on an ever increasing scale for a number of years. Of necessity, priority was given to promotional and marketing work and the development of holiday accommodation. In the circumstances, the funds available for resort development have had to be limited.  This has resulted in the deferment of certain resort development works at Kilkee and other resorts.</P>
    <P>The level of funds to be provided for resort development in the coming year has not yet been determined and will fall for settlement in the light of other demands on the Capital Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the local authorities in Clare, apart altogether from the guesthouse owners and hoteliers, are alarmed at the failure to approve the necessary funds to finance this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a large number of resort development schemes for consideration, including the one the Deputy mentioned at Kilkee.  There are no funds available this year.  We have spent about £1 million on resort development in the last three years over the whole country, and I am unable to state at what point funds will become available at Kilkee for the extension of the scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that a great deal has been done in Kilkee already.  I have given a list of the works which have been carried out and which amount to very considerable assistance to the resort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployed in the area adjacent to Kilkee and in Kilkee itself have no alternative employment. Will the Minister consider introducing the first stage of the scheme in order to relieve that unemployment?  Would he also give some indication when the money will be allocated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say when the money will be allocated, but I would point out to the Deputy that Bord Fáilte resort development schemes bear no relation whatever to the question of solving the problem of unemployment. <Col N="1916" /> They are carefully organised and planned to do a particular job at a particular time for the sake of providing employment in the tourist industry as a whole and not the employment immediately afforded by the carrying out of the work.  As a result there has been a great increase in seasonal employment generally in the tourist industry in which something like 160,000 people are employed directly or indirectly.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, as of March this year, there were some 25 professional vacancies in the institute and that they were not able to get qualified professional people, foreign or native, to fill them?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the first of the questions I desire to draw the Deputy's attention to the statement issued by my predecessor on behalf of the Government on 6th July, 1968, in which it was stated with regard to the provision which might be made for the teaching of Theology and Divinity in the reconstituted University of Dublin that:</P>
      <P>Statutory provision will be made for the teaching of these, but particular arrangements in regard to them will be subject to consultation with and the agreement of the appropriate Church authorities.  In that regard it is envisaged that Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, would, as an Associate College of the University of Dublin, be in a position to play the fullest part in the teaching and study of Theology, as well as fulfilling a distinguished role in the realms of Arts and Science.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to add to that statement pending receipt of recommendations from the Higher Education Authority in relation to the overall provision which might be made for higher education.  The position of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, is one of the matters which will come to be considered in that connection.</P>

Proposals at present being considered are that the existing schools at Ballincollig should be extended and converted for use either as a school for the boys only or for the girls only and a new school built nearby for the other sex; and that two new schools, one for boys and one for girls, be built in the vicinity of Poulavone.  As an interim measure, and to relieve the overcrowding in the existing schools, it is proposed to add two temporary classrooms to each of these two schools.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together. I am circulating with the Official Report a tabular statement giving the information in relation to student numbers in each of the years concerned. The other information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>NUMBERS of full-time and evening degree students attending UCD, UCC, UCG and TCD in 1938-39, 1948-49, 1958-59, 1963-64 and 1968-69.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not available? A lot of information which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, Deputy Kavanagh and other Deputies, including myself, have looked for is not available.  I know the difficulties in respect of the two grades in the universities but Deputy Dr. FitzGerald specifically refers to similar salaried scales. Does the Minister not think this information should be sought from his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that the information sought by Deputies has not been made available to them where it is possible for me to do so.  I have answered very many questions on statistics where the information is available to me.  I simply cannot give information which is not available to me, or when I consider that the amount of time it would take to compile it would be unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not for one moment disputing the Minister's courtesy in replying to our questions here. I am merely asking the Minister if he does not feel he should seek the statistics. Does he not consider he should extend the boundaries which he seems to have set with regard to the availability of statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not setting boundaries where statistics are available to me.  My Department, as I am sure everybody knows, is an overworked one.  I think it is unwarranted to ask the officials of my Department to compile statistics which, in one case, would take about 20 of them a fortnight to assemble.  The information in relation to students is made available by the universities and my Department and I have given that information now. With regard to the first part of the question, I feel the Deputy should request this information from the universities concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested is for the full-time staff-student ratios for the years 1958-59 to 1968-69 for each faculty in each of the university colleges.  In view of the very substantial amount of the taxpayer's money going to the universities, surely the Minister should direct the administrative staffs of the universities to make this information public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No questionnaires are sent by my Department to secondary schools seeking specific information on the proportion of classes containing more than a stated number of pupils.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it rather extraordinary that the Department of Education has not as yet asked the schools the number of pupils being taught, either subject by subject or class by class in each school?  The Minister must accept that this elementary information is very desirable.  I do not fault the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I take full responsibility <Col N="1934" /> for my replies here.  This would be a very big exercise.  It would take a very considerable amount of time to find out the numbers in each class, subject by subject.  There is, I think, enough paper work being done in both the schools and the Department without adding to it further.  We are getting the statistics necessary on which to base future policy.  These are available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly there is plenty of paper work, but it depends on the right kind of paper work and the right kind of question.  It is a matter of paramount importance that we should be able to assess the proportion of secondary schools containing more than a stated number of pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>At a recent meeting, some educational interests in Carlow expressed fears that in relation to post-primary education all senior cycle courses might be concentrated in the regional technical college.  They were assured that there were no grounds for such fears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether any figures of leaving certificate results are compiled by type of school; and, if not, whether he will initiate such a statistical series in view of the importance of assessing the consequences of changes in the structure of Irish post-primary education as between secondary, vocational and comprehensive schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that pupils in comprehensive schools and vocational schools will not be taking the leaving certificate examination until 1971, there does not appear to be any educational basis for the suggestion implied in the Deputy's question that a school's achievement should be judged merely on the basis of examination results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) the number of children attending national schools on <Col N="1938" /> 1st February, 1963, and 1st February, 1968, (b) the number of national teachers at each of these times and (c) why the number of classes with 40 or more pupils has increased in this period in Dublin by 24 per cent, from 1,429 or 71 per cent of the total to 1,769 or 76 per cent of the total, and in the rest of the country by 4 per cent from 2,892 to 3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of children attending national schools on 1st February, 1963, and 1st February, 1968, was 483, 188 and 490, 554 respectively.</P>
      <P>The number of national teachers serving on 30th June, 1963, and 30th June, 1968, was 14,218 and 14,737 respectively.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part of the Deputy's question the explanation is that the shift of pupils to areas of larger population was not matched by a comparable movement of teachers.  The securing of larger school units in rural areas will ensure that this imbalance is rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had waited until I had given an oral answer to his question I would have explained to him that the shift in population into the larger areas was not followed by a <i>pro rata</i> shift of teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to 50, but Deputy Desmond was speaking about 40.  The Deputy must remember that we have increased the number of teachers very, very considerably in the Greater Dublin Area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have increased the overall number.  If you take the average pupil-teacher ratio for the whole country it is below the number we envisaged and we are closing the smaller schools in an effort to rationalise the whole situation.  This takes time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy the manner in which we are dealing with this.  In the past ten years we have made 1,000 extra teachers available.  Between 1963 and 1968 we made 500 extra teachers available.  We are now in process of making 200 extra teachers available per year.  I think we are doing reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that we would not be short a single teacher if we were able to rationalise our total teaching force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education how many additional teachers were needed in 1964 to secure (a) the Council of Education's targets for maximum numbers of pupils per teacher, and (b) the target of a maximum of 35 pupils per teacher mentioned in his reply of 23rd July, 1969; and how many additional teachers would now be needed to attain each of these targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Education which reported in 1954 recommended that the average number of pupils on rolls in a one-teacher school should not exceed 25 and in a two-teacher school should not exceed 30.  One- and two-teacher schools are being closed as suitable opportunities present themselves and, therefore, no purpose would be served by making calculations by reference to the recommendations of the council.  As regards the target of a maximum of 35 pupils per teacher, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of the 11th December.  I might add that since 1954 the number of teachers in the service has been increased by 1,593 while the average number of pupils on rolls has increased by 18,018.</P>

      <P>The total number of refugees from Northern Ireland in Gormanston refugee centre as on the 16th December, 1969, was 92, consisting of 16 men, 19 women and 57 children.  Gormanston is the only Army refugee centre now open.</P>
      <P>While I have no detailed information regarding the re-housing of refugees in the north, I understand that this aspect is being looked after by, amongst others, Trench House, the relief co-ordination centre, in Belfast. There has been certain liaison between the Irish Red Cross Society social worker in Gormanston and Trench House.  The latter has been supplied with particulars of the families in Gormanston refugee centre.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that Gormanston military camp is a most undesirable place in which to house families over the winter period and will he not agree that if those families cannot be returned to their homes some effort should be made to have them billeted somewhere that would be more comfortable than in a military camp which is over 50 years old and has very few modern amenities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the circumstances in which these people came to Gormanston in the first instance and it is hardly necessary to elaborate on them.  He is also aware that Gormanston is a military camp and was never designed for use as a refugee centre.  We all hope that those who are now in the camp as refugees will be allowed back to their homes as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While Christmas is a time for wishing and while wishes are supposed to come true, at least in pantomime, wishing that the refugees will be returned to their homes while <Col N="1946" /> at the same time doing nothing to get them out of Gormanston camp, where they are anything but comfortable, is not the proper attitude.  I am not blaming the Minister personally because a Government decision should be taken on the matter.  The people who are there are either entitled to be there and should be treated properly or they are not entitled to be there and something should be done about it. Would the Minister not try to ensure that, since the camp is terribly uncomfortable, for soldiers as both he and I are aware, even in summertime, some suitable place would be found for these people before the winter becomes really hard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army authorities have excelled themselves in the efforts they have made to make conditions in Gormanston as comfortable as possible for those who are still there. They have succeeded to a great degree and the refugees themselves have told me that they were looked after very well by the Army authorities.  Most of the refugees intend to go back to their homes as soon as conditions permit.  That is the situation now.  I do not think there is any general wish on the part of the refugees in Gormanston to remain in this part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong Question Time but as the Minister knows I live very close to Gormanston and, perhaps, I know the conditions there, for more than one reason, better than the Minister does.  I think he will agree that in a place where there are only outside toilets, which are several hundred yards from the billets, where the only cooking facilities are communal and where the dining halls are also several hundred yards from the billets and are very old, no matter how hard the military authorities work it cannot be made suitable accommodation for men, women and children? Would he not agree that before the weather becomes any worse something definite should be done either to have these people back in their homes or provide them with some decent accommodation?  Otherwise, they will not leave the South of <Col N="1947" /> Ireland with very good impressions of the conditions under which people live here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is asking for, in fact, is a reproduction of ideal domestic conditions within an Army camp converted for use as a refugee camp.  It must be clear that you cannot get ideal domestic conditions in a camp such as that.  Those who are in Gormanston Camp are there as a result of dire emergency and the camp was prepared for use in conditions of dire emergency.  I do not think it is realistic to hope for absolutely ideal domestic conditions since that is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all that Gormanston is the worst camp available for this purpose.  On the contrary, a great deal of special reconstruction and new construction works were undertaken specially for the benefit of the people who are now in the camp.  I would say this also, that I would think that the last people who would complain about conditions at Gormanston Camp are the refugees who, after all, are the people most affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not complain too much when one is a guest of somebody else.  The only reconstruction work done there was that a few barriers were put up in billets to hold 24 men so that they could hold 30 or 40 women and children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that Deputy Tully's general trend on this subject is rather unfair to the Department of Defence and to the authorities generally who took over this job of handling large numbers of people who were driven out of their homes in recent times in the other part of the country.  I think that the people most affected would be the last to criticise <Col N="1948" /> the arrangements that were made for their reception at the camp.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that such concession would not prove an undue burden to the taxpayer or on Departmental funds, particularly <Col N="1949" /> in the case of persons over 70 years of age, if it were done on a selective basis if necessary?  The installation of a telephone is extremely costly.  The rental is very costly.  Calls are very rare and are on an emergency, life-line basis.  Would the Minister consider this on a limited basis, such as in the case of free travel, free television licences, and so on?  Would the consider the introduction of this concession for the persons I have referred to specifically&mdash;old persons living on their own? and proved to be living on their own? If a survey were carried out the Minister might not reject the idea so emphatically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a necessity for the survey suggested by the Deputy because the 1966 census indicated that there were some number short of 23,000 persons in the country of 70 years of age and over living alone.  The House will appreciate the huge cost that would be involved in providing a telephone service for that number of persons individually. I am surprised to hear the Deputy talking about a selective basis because the Minister for Social Welfare is for ever getting into trouble in regard to the means test in relation to old age pensions.</P>

      <P>I am trying to be helpful to the Minister.  The Minister has said that there are 23,000 persons aged 70 and over living alone.  I am not suggesting that telephones should be provided for every single one of these.  If it were provided for 10 per cent of these, say, 2,000, phased over a ten-year period, I do not think it would upset the taxpayer enormously. I am grateful for small mercies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish now to make a few observations as regards the amount of money provided for local authorities. As a member of a county council, I would naturally be personally concerned that we would recive sufficient money for our essential works on housing, sanitary services and roads.  I have already adverted to and protested against the trend in housing financing which I mentioned earlier, namely, that there has been a switch from the provision of local authority houses, as such, towards private housing.  I regret that a decreasing interest has been paid to the provision of local authority housing because that has to provide shelter for the very poor and the weakest sections of our community who are absolutely unable to provide anything from their own <Col N="1967" /> resources.  A similar trend is obvious in relation to water supplies.  In my constituency, we had works drawn up to the value of £2½ million.  We paid £8,000 to architects for drawing-up these schemes.</P>
      <P>Now we are virtually to switch from these regional schemes to group schemes.  I have no objection to group schemes.  Per household, the charges tend to be lower.  However, I feel this is forced upon us because central Government want to cut down on the amount of money they are providing to local authorities.  I think the Taoiseach should, in his reply, give us some reason why local authority subventions are being cheesepared so much, particularly in view of the fact that the amount of money coming into the Taoiseach's exchequer is quite good.  Compare, for example, the first eight months of this year with the first eight months of last year.  Revenue, as they describe it, is excessively buoyant. Total receipts to the Exchequer from 1st April, 1968, to 6th December, 1968 &mdash;eight months&mdash;were £211.8 million whereas, for the corresponding period this year, the figure has advanced to £258.3 million.  This is a jump of nearly £50 million.  It is a tremendous jump in a revenue increase.  On the face of that, we are being unfairly treated at local authority level by the central Government authority.</P>
      <P>I recognise&mdash;and the argument is always put up here in the House&mdash; that the amount of money the central Government are giving to local government is increasing proportionately year by year but, against that, let me point out that the case is being improperly made.  Some of the money allegedly given back to local government is the agricultural rebate.  That is not given back to local government.  We do not get one penny of that to spend as local authorities.  It is a hand-out to the local farmers.  I do not begrudge it to them. It amounts to about £17 million per year, speaking from memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider the road fund.  I think £12 million is the amount collected by local county councils for taxes on cars.  In the 1966 Finance Bill local taxation was increased by about <Col N="1968" /> 20 per cent and it was decided at that time throught the office of the Minister for Finance that that increase would go straight to revenue and not find its way into the road fund at all.  For years here there was always a row if the road fund was raided but now it is being done legally, if not legitimately, and this 20 per cent is scooped off before it finds its way into the road fund.</P>
    <P>If you add the amount of money collected on car taxes, plus customs and excise on petrol, from car parks and cars coming in here, it amounts to about £50 million a year.  We should be entitled at local level to receive the full amount from the road fund in view of the tremendous amount of money the Government are getting through cars and from car users.  In general, with a very buoyant revenue at the moment the Government are being unduly penurious with the local authorities this year.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned the balance of payments at Question Time.  I have some of the recent figures here.  Someone asked was our balance of payments deficit ever as big as it is now, and, of course, it was not.  In 1967, we had a surplus of £15 million.  In 1968, we had a deficit of £20 million.  This year we will have a deficit possibly of £60 million, and in 1970 the projection is possibly another £60 million.  Our external reserves have gone down somewhat and the nature of our external reserves has been altered.  We switched from sterling to gold at one time, and then we switched from gold to the International Monetary Fund, and lately we are selling our gold and buying dollars.  Whatever switching we did, we did not do it in time.  We lost about £8 million when devaluation took place because we had left too much of our money in sterling fund.  Our financial authorities in the Department of Finance or the Central Bank were caught there when we lost approximately £8 million by not making that transfer in time.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the trading figures which the Minister for Finance was at such pains to play down.  I had just begun to mention them before Question Time.  I will give the figures again for the record because I am old-fashioned <Col N="1969" /> enough to think that trading figures are still important.  In 1968, our exports were £329.3 million and our imports were £484.4 million, an import excess of £155.1 million.  In 1969, our exports were £366 million.  That showed an increase of £36.8 million.  Our imports were £584.8 million showing an increase of 100.4 million.  That meant that our import excess was £218.8 million. By any standards that, taken in conjunction with the static of diminishing external reserves and a projected balance of payments increase of £60 million, is a serious situation.  No playing around with figures or other statistical data can alter the serious import of those returns.</P>
    <P>To use a common or garden expression, I feel that we are moving into the red.  We have mounting rates, our balance of payments is going against us, the cost of living is rising rapidly and we have, therefore, what is called inflation.  We have increased industrial unrest.  We have the worst record in Europe in industrial employment relations and hours lost through industrial unrest.  We have social discontent. We have an increasing disparity of income between the higher and the lower sections of the population.  We have evolving here a two-or three-tier society.  Our emigration and unemployment problem stands unresolved and we have increasing pressure from the farming community.</P>
    <P>That is not a happy pre-Christmas picture.  It is my duty here to stimulate the already euphoric temperament of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I want to quote now from the booklet from which I have already quoted, the Economic and Social Research Institute Quarterly Economic Commentary, September, 1969.  At page 19 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Even at this stage, genuine moderation in income demands by all sectors of the community would undoubtedly help to solve this dilemma.  A slower growth in money incomes than that assumed here would, in the present inflationary circumstances, probably result in equally rapid growth in real incomes, while perhaps averting the very genuine danger of a serious interruption in economic growth which is <Col N="1970" /> implicit in any directly restrictive action which the authorities might feel obliged to take.</P>
    <P>In the face of that and other remarks in this publication and other publications, what advice can one presume to offer to the Government at this stage? I will make two suggestions.  My first suggestion is that the Government should take the advice we have given them over a long period.  They should make some effort to introduce price control.  They should in some way establish a prices and incomes policy if we are to have stability in the value of money, stability in our society as well as good industrial relations.  The Government are making no attempt to do this.  My second suggestion is that they should have a more effective monetary credit control policy.  Admittedly, the Central Bank have been trying to do this but not too effectively and they have failed to control the private sector and they have failed to control the Government.  Of course, the final responsibility for our economic position lies with the Government.  They have been the greatest offenders and it is difficult to look towards the future with equanimity when you have a Government which raises all sorts of objections, who will not even consider an incomes and prices policy and when you have a Minister for Finance who can only speak of wage control and will not introduce these kinds of scales on a broad front, the only type of front that will be acceptable in a board society.  I can recall when this question of monetary credit control was first mentioned here by us.  It was regarded by then then Deputy Seán Lemass as being a daft notion.  The Central Bank has a very important function in this and it is becoming increasingly accepted that as well as the economic factors monetary credit control is an important factor in planning and fashioning a progressive economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday this debate gave me an extraordinary feeling of unreality, a feeling which persisted this morning before I came back into the House, but today it has taken a turn for the better.  We have had some exceptionally good contributions. I am not saying that the contributions <Col N="1971" /> yesterday were poor.  Indeed I thought that the speeches from the Labour benches were far and away the best speeches yesterday.  There was a feeling yesterday that the Taoiseach was withholding what he had to say until the end of the debate.  At least I can give him this much credit, that it was his own speech and he did not dish out gobbledegook and we had no references to shortfalls, decentralisation and so on.  The Taoiseach is extremely fortunate that he has a few sensible men on his team.  I am including in that remarks the Minister for Labour, the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. If I may, I will repear a conversation which took place on these benches recently. A colleague remarked to me: &ldquo;The Taoiseach frequently looks very worried at Question Time&rdquo; and I looked over and there were four men on his left side&mdash;the Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland and Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Finance, and my reply was: &ldquo;If you had those men on your left you would be worried too&rdquo;.  I am not to be taken as being personal in this; it is purely what I have observed myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Brennan, could charm the birds off the bushes.  Today he ended his speech with the phrase &ldquo;steady as we go&rdquo; and he really was the personification of that phrase during his charming speech.  It was a wonderful performance. To be fair to him and to his predecessor, they have handled a very delicate problem with velvet gloves. Anyway, he certainly set the tone for today's debate and it never really got down to the level at which it was yesterday. It has been a genuined debate. The Minister for Labour pointed out that we have been lucky, which is true. We have had a serious inflationary trend, which he said was everywhere but I would say it was around the western world.  It has been around a long time and it has undoubtedly helped our position.  His main constructive proposal was that he would have discussions with the employers, <Col N="1972" /> the trade unions and this House.  Well, I want to be fair to the parties on this side of the House.  This is just not on. It is the business of a government to govern and I do not believe that it is necessary to have national discussions, the national government kind of idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to unofficial strikes and to what a dreadful incubus this has been.  There will be very few figures in my speech, but let me take one which he mentioned.  He said that 800,000 man days had been lost this spring.  Now, that is equivalent to 3,200 men on the basis of working for 250 days in the year.  The figure of 3,200 per year is not all that great when you have nearly 60,000 unemployed.  In fact, it is one-two hundred and fiftieth of the industrial and other labour forces and, therefore, less than ½ per cent of the total employed.  The Minister's figure sounds very big but when you turn it around as I did, it turns out to be only 3,000 men for one year, a very small part of the total labour force.</P>
    <P>I am not one of these people who believe that you can push the economy around, that you can do major things and get away with it.  The Minister has established a system which he hopes will lead to the early detection of trouble.  My own experience of industrial troubles was that if you were capable of locating where the trouble was likely to arise before people had locked horns you could do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also that he was trying to fix this recent dispute in the ESB.  The ordinary clerical workers had a certain status and when the Quinn Report came out it upset that. The ESB clerks had a status between clerical officer and executive officer and they were demoted to the status of clerical officer.  This upset a tradition which had been established in the late 'Twenties when there was a much tougher outlook in economic matters than there is now.  This attempt to make everybody the same cannot possibly succeed.  You cannot put everybody into the same kind of box.  You cannot interfere with the status of a large group of people in an organisation without sowing the seeds of serious trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1973" /> The Minister then went on to talk about extra taxation to bring up the welfare classes.  We have almost exhausted the possible types of taxation. I would say that in no other country in Western Europe have they so many different kinds of taxation as in this country.  We have income tax in a way in which they have not got it in most of the EEC countries; we have the turnover tax and a large wholesale tax.  There are discussions about an added value tax.  It is said the added value tax would be in substitution for the wholesale and turnover taxes, but that is not the experience here.  Before the turnover tax came in a large merchant in this city said to me: &ldquo;I would have no objection to a turnover tax, but it will be added on to all the other taxes.&rdquo;  That is what happened and, to make matters worse, when the then Minister for Finance was asked how the merchants, who were very concerned about it, would collect it, he made what I presume was intended to be a facetious reply, but it was a very unsuitable reply which brought about a very bad situation.  He said: &ldquo;You can collect it any way you like.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the 12 per cent which the workers received two years ago.  I made a calculation at the time and there had been a nine per cent increase in the cost of living since the previous round of wage increases. Therefore, in giving the workers 12 per cent all that was being provided was something to cover future inflation.  The inflation turned out to be much worse than was anticipated, not for the reason the Fine Gael Party put forward, the 12 per cent, but because of the two and a half per cent turnover tax which put up prices by about six per cent.  Productivity increased in that spring of 1964 and when the workers looked at their 12 per cent they found they were receiving only the same amount as they had been getting before the increase was given.</P>
    <P>I agree with a great deal of what the Minister for Labour said.  He spoke about people maintaining differentials. They are inclined to do that.  He then spoke about the competitive years that lie ahead.  Although the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is incomparably <Col N="1974" /> better than being in the Common Market, it is still the Achilles Heel of our whole industrial system. The Minister is inclined to think that a breakthrough has come and he thought that emigration was at long last receding.</P>
    <P>There is no point in pretending that progress has not been made.  Progress has been made, but I do not like to see Ministers coming into the House&mdash; I am not talking about the Minister for Labour&mdash;and gilding a good case with the most beautiful gold paint. They are not satisfied to tell a good story; they want to embellish it.  In this connection the Taoiseach repeated something about the cost of living&mdash; this is something I was extremely interested in at the time&mdash;that it went up by five per cent in the year 1968.  I received a letter from the Central Statistics Office last year and since my reply was going to be fairly tough I did not like to reply to it at all.  I was pressed by them for a reply, and I shall read out what I said to them. I asked them a question in the letter and they did not reply to me; otherwise, I would not be reading out the letter.  It is addressed to the head of the Central Statistics Office and dated 2nd April, 1969:</P>
    <P>I regret the long delay in replying to your letters...</P>
    <P>It is possible for me, however, to give you a considered opinion about the matter which the Committee... has under consideration.</P>
    <P>This small country contains a large number of people who seem to think that we can do all the operations involving physical effort which are only feasible for countries with a minimum population of 20 million persons.  Admittedly, the Central Statistics Office has had a remarkable record in keeping the country in the forefront of new inquiries but there are limits to the resources available, both physical and financial. So far as I am concerned, it may be taken that in general the statistical information about our economy is adequate and I would like to express my personal appreciation of the services which have <Col N="1975" /> been rendered to me personally since I left the Civil Service about 20 years ago.  That Office is in a class by itself when it comes to providing information for the universities.</P>
    <P>I am, however, aware from comments of technologists and others who think their own work is the most important activity in the world (and unfortunately many really good technologists can be put into this category) that the Central Statistics Office cannot supply them with the kind of detail which they require.  But, frankly, I doubt whether the statistics office of any coutry with a population of less than 200 million could do so</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Central Government current expenditure has more than doubled in the current decade and I think the day for a little economy has long since arrived!</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I was grossly underestimating because, as I pointed out to the Minister for Finance on the Appropriation Bill, Government expenditure in the past ten years has gone up from something like £113 million in 1959, the first year Mr. Lemass was Taoiseach, to something like £365 million this year.  This is a fabulous increase.  I must say that, at one stage, I thought the Minister for Finance, having changed his order when he was talking about the four important factors, was not going to deal with Government expenditure at all, but he did come out with it eventually. I hope he is successful with what he is going to attempt.  I shall continue the letter:</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter about the work in your Office which perturbs me seriously at present.  This is the astounding figure of a ten points increase in the consumer price index of November 1967 and 1968. How does the Office reconcile this with the following simple facts?</P>
    <P>(1)  Both the domestic exports price index and the imports index also showed an increase of ten points but in each case on a base of 113 as against the consumer price index base of 193.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> (2)  Sterling was devalued by 14 per cent and one would need to be very green indeed to accept a statement in the November issue of the Central Bank Quarterly Review and believe that the effects were over by the Spring of last year.</P>
    <P>I do not know who wrote that statement, but let me say what I know about economics.  A devaluation of that sort takes a couple of years to go through the economy.  In reply to parliamentary questions the Taoiseach now talks about the belated effects of devaluation.  They are not belated at all.  It is obvious it takes a long period of time for that kind of thing to go through the economy.  The third item of the letter is a very important one:</P>
    <P>(3) The 11th Round of wages increase took place last year in this country and, if you feel like it, I should be grateful if you would tell me what it amounted to on the average.</P>
    <P>Both of us are old enough to remember the furore when a young and innocent Parliamentary Secretary tried to persuade the people of Ireland in the autumn following the outbreak of the Korean War that there had been little or no increase in the cost of living and I think the verdict of the people went clearly against the view which was purveyed by the Department of Industry and Commerce at that time.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for regret that not a single comment has been made on this occasion.  It seems to me that far from this lack of interest showing greater confidence in the work of your Office, it proves that the general public are no longer interested and this view is confirmed from information which I have had about discussions on wages and salaries which have been taking place recently.</P>
    <P>I ended then with a tribute to the Office.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1968 I made it my business to call frequently on a friend of mine who is a small grocer in order to find out how prices were going.  On each visit he went right <Col N="1977" /> around the shop telling me which articles had gone up and by how much.  The extraordinary thing was that the cost of living index according to the Central Statistics Office showed no increase at all all between May and August of 1968.  I am not arguing that they do not get it right, because in the long run they do get it right.  The Minister for Finance tried to rectify the situation by introducing the mini-Budget. The effect of that was that the Central Statistics Office started a new index in November.  The cost of living went up by 1.1 per cent a month for the three months from November to February and that was before the maintenance strike took place.  In that period there were no wage increases. There was no reason at all for the cost of living to rise, yet it went up by 1.1 per cent.  Perhaps this was a readjustment process.</P>
    <P>During the election the Fianna Fáil Party talked about a five per cent increase in the cost of living last year. Of course, it was not five per cent.  I would say it was approaching ten per cent in the year 1968.  That figure would be right on the simple argument I have read out if the currency is devalued by 14 per cent.  It would take between a year and fourteen months for the effect of this to go through the economy.  My suggestion therefore that the cost of living went up by ten per cent in 1968 is what ordinary commonsense teaches one.  It does not take a B.Comm. or a doctorate to be able to make an assessment like that.  I do not blame the Minister for Finance for being careful about this matter.  On the contrary, I agree with that particular approach.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for taking time about making decisions on the Buchanan Report and the Devlin Report.  As a person who has spent a long time in the Civil Service I do not see anything wrong with the Government's sending the Devlin Report to the Department.  What other way could it be examined properly? I should, of course, say that I have never read the Devlin Report but I understand it recommended that the Land Commission be abolished.  What other way could the Government get <Col N="1978" /> that recommendation examined except by sending it to the Department of Lands?  There is nothing wrong in this approach at all.  It may look strange to people who did not spend as long as I did as a clerk in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The two Ministers who spoke this morning were telling us that we must be careful about wages.  I should like to know to what extent wage-earners contribute to an adverse balance of payments position?  I do not think they contribute to it at all.  They do not buy Mercedes cars.</P>
    <P>I realise the Government are saying that the greater part of the increased imports this year represent capital items, but that depends how one defines the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo;.  Two hundred years ago Adam Smith defined the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo;.  He said, &ldquo;capital is that part of a man's stock from which he expects to derive an income&rdquo;. There are a lot worse definitions of capital than that roaming around Government Departments.  If there is no return for the money invested it is not strictly capital expenditure, it may be social expenditure, it may be a prestige investment.</P>

      <P>Whenever I go around the country and meet the ordinary people on wages I find there are two items they have which could be said to affect the balance of payments. Usually they have a television set.  The second item &mdash;this would not affect the balance of payments; all it does it put a floor under the gentlemen who buy new cars&mdash;is a secondhand car.  We can, I think, forget the secondhand cars. The only thing is that if they were not sold here they would be exported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whitegate cut the cost of petrol to a remarkable extent. I am interested in the suggestion that there should be a seven per cent increase in wages next year.  Do not forget that we have a round of wage increases only every two years and one has, therefore, to take the two years from 1968 to 1970; on my figures the cost of living in those two years has risen about 18 per cent.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance do not believe for one moment that wages will go up by only 7 per cent.  I read in the newspapers that the Irish Hospitals' Trust employees&mdash;mostly elderly women and young girls, had got an increase of £2 a week and will get another 30/- increase next year.  This is an increase of £3 10s.  It is not 7 per cent.  Let not fool ourselvves.  Let me pay tribute to the Irish Hospitals' Trust; it is about the only place in which one can get employment for a poor widow.</P>
      <P>It is no use pretending that there has not been wage restraint.  There has been wage restraint on a large scale.  It is going now.  We all know that.  The workers in Cement Limited claim an increase of £7 a week.  Why should they not?  According to the same newspapers, Cement Limited made a profit of 2½ million last year.  If the workers get their increase of £7 a week the only man who will suffer is the Minister for Finance because he gets roughly 10/- out of every £ profit made by an industrial organisation.  All that will suffer are Government finances.  I have no doubt the workers will not get an increase of £7 a week because there is an extremely right wing conservative approach in that particular organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said there were four matters upon which we should keep our eye&mdash;prices, pay, Government expenditure and the balance of payments.  I have no objection at all to the Minister saying we should keep our eye on these things.  Deputy Hogan dealt with prices.  Now it is no use pretending this Government started yesterday.  Those of us who take <Col N="1980" /> an interest in public life are aware that the Government that existed in this country in the early 1960s did not believe in price control at all.  Until they were pushed into it they did nothing about it and it was during that period that the foundation was laid of the present rapid inflation.  The difficulty about inflation is that, if you can keep it at a modest one per cent a year, or two per cent, it is almost ideal because it makes things slightly easier for progressive people and slightly harder for the people who have already made their money and are in clover.  When, however, you get a situation in which there is the kind of increase in the cost of living to which Deputy Hogan referred and you have the price of money at ten per cent, it is no use at that point thinking about inflation: inflation is the great evil.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour referred to what they described as the very satisfactory increase in industrial exports.  I challenged the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day to give me the figures for imports in regard to Shannon Free Airport Development Company and he told me he had not got that figure.  Now, if one has a good tale to tell, one should not exaggerate it.  The Taoiseach said that industrial exports are greater than agricultural exports.  But it is not the gross that counts.  It is the net and net agricultural exports are immensely greater than industrial exports.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour said there had been a very satisfactory increase in industrial exports.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="1981" /> and Commerce told me that the exports from the Shannon Free Airport Development amounted last year to £42 million.  How much of that represented imports?  The Minister told me he had not got that figure.  Now I have the figures for an earlier year and three-quarters of that amount was for imports, so that we spent £30 million on imports to create £40 million worth of exports.  I do not deprecate that.</P>
      <P>I regarded the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport as a splendid idea.  As it has developed so it has proved.  There is one thing I should like to say to the Government; I do not think they quite appreciate it and I should like to remind them.  They remember, but they do not say it. We have had two remarkable years climatically.  It is remarkable that this year was better than last, or so I am told by the farmers, because the rain came at the right time and the heat came at the right time.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting it generated some heat?  Not all that much.  We were on the receiving end of what heat there was.  We are not doing badly since we came to this House.  We seem to have caused a certain amount of trouble in the Fianna Fáil ranks judging by their behaviour over the past three or four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said our economy is basically sound.  I agree, and such difficulties as are arising arise because of the same thing that was done previously.  The Government fixed up its own finances at the expense of the economy.  One of the best statements made yesterday was that made by Deputy Treacy when he spoke about the shocking amount of income tax people must pay.  In real terms it is at least twice and nearly three times what it was pre-war. I am talking about those subject to PAYE.  It is grossly improper that a farm labourer pays income tax while the man he works for does not.  The point Deputy Hogan made that in inflationary conditions those who get in <Col N="1982" /> first, in particular, gain and they, of course, are the people with resources. They have no difficulty in making their dispensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, for the second time in his speech, said he was anxious to have discussions with the other parties.  This is not the duty of the Opposition&mdash;to help out the Government&mdash;when some of us think that the Government is engaged in a great deal of very wasteful expenditure and generally have shown no sign of the kind of economy in which I believe, including even economy at Christmas time at the expense of Parliamentary Secretaries.  I would believe in that.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to pay attention to the balance of payments in 1970 and it may well be that the balance will come out as the Minister more or less forecast.  I am not so much interested in fiddling with exact figures.  Let us not fool ourselves; they are not so exact.  You cannot come too quickly to a conclusion about them because, taking one month with another, random influences may operate. The Minister also said that our external reserves are still adequate by international standards.  But Deputy Hogan put his finger on a point.  We are in fact independent and we could do what we like but so far we have tied ourselves closely to sterling and, because, I suggest, we are a very small part of the total economy of these two islands when you consider the 50 million population in Britain, we can remain on the wrong side of the ledger for a considerable period, much longer perhaps than we could if we were entirely independent.  Mark you, we would have gained at various periods if we had set up our own independent currency during the thirties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance ended by saying that if there is only a four per cent increase in output next year a seven per cent increase in wages and salaries is not unduly restrictive.  This is not the problem.  The problem is one of maintaining the standard of living of the lowest paid workers.  If I might go back to Ricardo, the greatest of all economists, whom the Americans are now searching for <Col N="1983" /> ideas, he taught&mdash;he lived during the Napoleonic War period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He said that wages are fixed at the level of subsistence.  He went on to make a very shrewd observation and he said that the subsistence level is different at different times.  I regard many of the ordinary workers in my own constituency and in that of Deputy Dowling where there are more of them, as being at the absolute level of subsistence, men trying to rear families on £13 or £14 a week.  If, in fact, since they last got an increase the cost of living has gone up five per cent in one year and seven in the next, making 12 per cent altogether, what use is seven per cent to them?  My belief is that the cost of living has gone up by something approaching 20 per cent.  I believe my figure is accurate.  I do not mind figures of calculation; I look at the field, think about it and reach my own conclusion.  If the cost of living has gone up 20 per cent how can these people who are on ground level live on an increase of seven per cent?  They cannot, but the truth is they will not have to live on it.  I am talking only about the period for which we must compensate.  Recently a serious report in England pointed out that wages in real terms had not gone up there since 1934, that is to say, that in so far as they have gone up, they have gone up, no more than the rest of the economy. There is continuous talk about wages in England.</P>
      <P>Let me come to where I differ completely from some of the Fine Gael spokesmen.  I differ with Deputy Hogan and Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Deputy said it in the House and I took him up on it.  I have a simple view about this matter.  Anybody who believes in a prices and incomes policy in this country is crazy.  If it cannot be achieved in England, where 85 per <Col N="1984" /> cent of the people are on wages and salaries, how can it be achieved here where the percentage of people on wages and salaries is about half the total.  We cannot do it.  The farmers will be all with you when you are putting a floor under them and lifting them up but the day you put a tax on them the story will be different.  Suppose the price of cattle has gone up very high and you say: &ldquo;Let us put a tax on cattle at the point of export,&rdquo; the farmers would regard you as mad.</P>

      <P>Let me come on now to what is really a serious problem and which has been mentioned today on both sides of the House. Last evening the chairman of the St. Vincent de Paul Society came on television and pointed out that there was more absolutely dire poverty in this city now than ever there was before. He is not a politician.  I did not see the programme.  This was reported to me.  He also said, I understand, that the St. Vincent de Paul Society had exhausted its resources.  This has been mentioned already.  I heard it in the House and elsewhere.  Among the weaker citizens I include the unskilled workers&mdash;it is a bad name but it describes <Col N="1985" /> the ordinary worker&mdash;the family man in poor health, the widow and the old people on pensions and children. Many of these people live in the most wretched conditions.  The leader of our party pointed out to me today that a mother with three children gets £4 a week.  There is no use in pretending that this is reasonable.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in children and always have had, for a reason.  I think of the future.  What is gone is gone. There was circulated to us recently a little booklet called <i>The Common Market and the Common Man.</i> This showed that our children's allowances are only half the British rate and it is the lowest in Western Europe if you exclude Spain, Portugal and these countries down there.  This is deplorable in a country like this.  I put forward a solution to this, not once but many times. Whoever in the Fianna Fáil Party put in the first child for a child allowance was mad.  This is nothing to do with social work, nothing to do with people willing to bring up a child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might convey this idea to his colleagues: there are huge numbers of No. 1 children&mdash;300,000&mdash;and the amount that they get&mdash;10/- a month&mdash;is miserable. Nobody worries about it.  If that were transferred to families of four and more children at the other end of the scale it would enable the children's allowances for these children to be doubled.  This is the answer to that problem.  If a man, a ground level worker, has three children he may be in tough conditions but if he has eight or nine children he is in deplorable conditions.  The Minister may take it that Crumlin is full of such people, <Col N="1986" /> people on £13 or £14 a week.  I am not saying one word in criticism of their housing conditions.  That housing scheme was a very fine scheme.  Everybody thought so at the time.  This is with me a basic idea to improve the economy of the country, to improve the degree of welfare in the community.</P>
      <P>A few years ago I was shocked to meet a man in the hills of County Wicklow, an agricultural labourer, who had many small children.  The conditions of the family certainly went to my heart.  It is so easy to solve it. You do not have to spend that much money on it.  It could be done by transferring the money for the first child to the children at the other end of the scale.  There are old ladies who keep cats and bachelors who keep dogs for the cost of one child.  If people are not prepared to pay the cost of one child they should not have got married in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There is another form of discrimination against the children in this city. I referred to it earlier at Question Time today.  It is the disgracefully large classes in schools.  My colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, had an argument with the Minister for Education. They were not talking about the realities, with due respect to them.  The Minister said that he was attempting to achieve a maximum of 35 children in a class.  This city is full of classes of 55 and 60 in the national schools. Let me pay tribute to this Government. What they have attempted to do for education is the best thing they have done.  I do not want to take credit from them.  When they came into office there were as many as 90 children in a single class in this city.</P>

      <P>For the whole country. I protested to the Minister that he was not talking reality.  There may be a small school in Tory Island with perhaps only 15 children.  I will say this for the Fianna Fáil Party, what they have attempted to do for education is one of their best achievements. The Minister's idea is certainly acceptable to me, that is if he could get it down to 35.  There should be no class <Col N="1987" /> in excess of 35.  That is what he said. I take it that he is doing the best he can.</P>
      <P>I come now to a subject on which I have extremely strong views.  I must have needled the Minister for Finance at the end of his speech when I asked him what was the relevance of what he had been saying about our position in regard to the EEC because he threw at me, &ldquo;No man has been wronger oftener than you have&rdquo;.  Nobody makes a statement like that in a serious debate unless you have needled him.</P>

      <P>I asked what was the relevance of what the Minister had been saying.  Of course, it had no relevance. He picked up an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Deputy Corish.  Deputy Corish yesterday said that the EEC was a rich men's club.  The Minister proceeded to prove with bell, book and documents that in fact, the EEC was spending more money each year on the undeveloped countries, the African countries. At one stage in this country, in their enthusiasm, certain officials started writing about this country as an undeveloped country.  Let me pay tribute to Seán Lemass.  He said: &ldquo;No, I will not stand over that.&rdquo;  He said that he would accept that we are underdeveloped. He was absolutely right. This country was a developed country in the year 1900.  It had a full railway system, a telephone system, roads and all the rest.  There is no use in pretending we are all still naked savages who paint our bodies.</P>

      <P>Certain errors have been made by the Government of a minor type to which I might refer: first of all, the way our mining rights have been given away and, in particular, <Col N="1988" /> the way Gulf Oil was given the right to erect this terminal in Bantry Bay without paying any harbour dues whatever.</P>
      <P>By a coincidence, Gulf Oil was owned by a family of Irish extraction from the North of Ireland&mdash;the Mellon family in Pittsburg.  I was a student in the United States when they started setting up Gulf Oil.  They were cutting a chunk out of the Standard Oil empire. I went on a tour from north to south of the United States.  They were putting up these petrol stations all over the place&mdash;untold resources.  This is the company to which we give a present. There is a genuine difficulty in this. The sum of £140,000 which we get from royalties from the mines would not pay an insurance premium on the danger of a break-up of one of these tankers going into Bantry Bay.  It is not the <i>Torrey Canyon:</i> that is an old story. Again, quite recently, a few weeks ago, there was a break-up of one of these huge tankers and 70 or 80 people were lost.  There are all kinds of problems here.  There already was a difficulty of some oil getting around.</P>
      <P>Let me stand over what I wrote in 1961 and which proved to be accurate, namely, that the British would not go into EEC and that we need not be unduly worried about it.  I said the Government of the time were to be praised because they were able to get firms here to improve their methods by drawing attention to this: I had no objection to creating a certain amount of effort on the part of industrialists to prepare for EEC.</P>
      <P>To join EEC will be the greatest disaster since the Famine that ever hit this country.  We were in a common market for 120 years; look what happened to our industries in it.  For quite a period, for about 30 years after the year 1800, it did not look as if anything serious would happen&mdash;then we were wiped out: silk mills, cotton mills&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mean we were in a common market from 1800 to 1920. We were in a common market with a large developed economy.  Our small industries were wiped out; some of <Col N="1989" /> them were not so small; some were very large.  We have put a great deal of effort into developing our light industries.  In my generation, it was a major effort. Are we to sacrifice it all, throwing it overboard?  The Fianna Fáil Party have departed from their base in this.  I think I know the people who sold this idea to them.  Their base, fundamentally, is reasonable protection for our industries. The sell-out took place in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. I said at the time that the Government had sold the long-term interests of this country across the Irish Sea for short-term advantage.  I notice that the Government are still talking about the advantages that will come from this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. We have had the advantages. We shall pay the price from now on.</P>

It would be extraordinary if I were not in favour of it considering the way this party will do at the next election, if it is adopted. I am in favour of votes at 18.  The recent analysis of the results of the last election, which seemed reasonably accurate, in <i>Nusight</i> was intriguing.  It suggested that the young people, on the whole, are more inclined to vote Labour than the people over 45 or 50. This is true, of course.</P>

I find that the nice, quiet approach which was there at the end of the 1950s and in the early 1960s has gone completely except in two Faculties.  It has not gone in Medicine or in Commerce. The reason is that they are the with-it groups.  They can see the future.  But, in general, in the Faculty of Arts, where people are taught to think, I hope&mdash;they should be, anyway: it is by far the most important Faculty in any university&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are definitely revolutionary in their outlook. They are not satisfied.  They have more time to think and they should be trained how to think.  I do not blame him for not doing it but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, promised me he would tell me what it would cost to allow the night students their fees free of income tax.  I asked him if it would be £50,000.  The Minister said it would be much more than that.  I have made a calculation since.  Although there are night Degrees now in UCC, where there were not before&mdash; they started again&mdash;and in UCG, I believe the total cost of the concession would be £35,000.  It is a bagatelle.  It is very unfair to these students who make sacrifices and especially now that they have to go three miles out to Belfield&mdash;we know what bus fares are like now.  That is another point I would put to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might perhaps put to the Taoiseach a question I asked earlier, as the Taoiseach is now in the House. Where did the Taoiseach get his seven per cent?  It is some kind of calculation or is it just a hope or did the arithmetical economists come up with the number?  The Taoiseach's speech yesterday&mdash;I shall end on the same note as I begun&mdash;had one merit: it was his own in the sense that he did not read a lot of gobble-de-gook in the House.  But the figures were not his own.  It was purely a number of figures.  I do not believe that political economy is arithmetic.  I practice the black art, too, just as other professors do.  I have never queried their figures. When I was 21 years of age I thought <Col N="1991" /> you could get an answer to any problem in figures.  I have certainly grown older&mdash;whether wiser or not, I do not know&mdash;and I do not believe any longer that you can get the answer to any problems by figures.  I think that has been proved here in the 1950s and 1960s.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to an incident that took place in this House yesterday-week in relation to the rights of the Deputy and to proper respect for the Chair.  Quite a considerable amount of publicity was given to this particular section.  Statements were issued by the Labour Party Whip which gave a completely erroneous impression of what happened at that meeting.  Many people have endeavoured to indicate that members of the Fianna Fáil Party were responsible for the situation that developed on that occasion.  Leading articles which appeared in a number of newspapers also indicated that members of Fianna Fáil were the culprits.</P>
      <P>In the statement issued by the Labour Party Whip it was also indicated that the conduct of the Fianna Fáil Deputies was to be deplored.  That is not the case.  The irresponsible conduct of the front bench members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party members who were present on that occasion is to be deplored.  Deputies on this side of the House have rights as well as Deputies on the other side.</P>

      <P>In passing I should like to say that a planned attack by the front bench members of Fine Gael and members of the Labour Party to deprive members of their right to speak on a particular motion is to be fully deplored.  There was a concentrated effort of planned interruptions for approximately 40 minutes in order to ensure that a Member from these benches could not make some of the points which he was duly entitled to make on the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.  I should like to point out that on that occasion this was the situation, as reported at column 939, volume 243 of the Official Report.  Deputy Andrews was speaking and he said:</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Labour Party should be absent from a debate with such a high social content....</P>
      <P>Therefore, he indicated in the course of his speech that there was no Labour Party Member present in the Chamber. This is quite true.  Following the termination of Deputy Andrews' speech Deputy Byrne of the Fine Gael Party offered and so did I.  At that stage there was no member of the Labour Party in the Chamber.  As reported at column 941 of the same volume of the Official Report the Acting Chairman, Deputy Carter, called Deputy Byrne. I said:</P>
      <P>This is the third Fine Gael speaker, and there has been only one Fianna Fáil speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> The Acting Chairman said:</P>

      <P>I want to say this in relation to this attack on democracy and on the rights of Deputies.  On that occasion the irresponsible elements in this House on the front benches of the Fine Gael and the Labour Party interrupted no less than 133 times in 40 minutes, and that is allowing for a ten minute interruption for a division. This was a deliberate attempt to deprive Members of the House of their right to speak.</P>

      <P>If I may make my point of order, Sir, the following morning in the papers the situation was represented or misrepresented and the blame for these disturbances was laid on the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy Dowling is trying to be objective.  He is being objective.  He is trying to arrive at the truth of the situation.  We were unfairly blamed for what he is now proving to be the responsibility of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Whatever the case may be the Deputy has been permitted to refer to it briefly but not to dwell on it.

      <P>Again in passing, as regard these disturbances which took place for 40 minutes, one can readily realise how difficult it is to deal with such an important matter in a few minutes.  It would appear that some Deputies regard as unimportant the question of undermining the authority of the Chair.  This is clearly indicated in volume 243 of the Official Report. There were 133 interruptions by the Opposition and no Labour Member was present when I offered to speak. A statement appeared in the press in relation to the conduct of Deputies in the House.  It appeared on 13th December in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the Labour Party Whip, in an effort to cover himself up because there were no Labour Deputies present in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not even made a brief reference to it yet.  I was just outlining the irregularities which occurred and the fact that an effort was made to convey to the public that we were responsible for the rowdyism. Some Deputies come in here on occasions as they did on that occasion, to kick up a row in order to get their <Col N="1996" /> names in the press and show that they have been in the House, and then they go home.  I am here every day and on this occasion I offered to speak on a very important subject.  I want to say that the statement issued to <i>The Irish Times</i>, which was printed in good faith, was completely erroneous and misleading.  It is only fair that when a false impression is given by a Chief Whip that we should be able to correct that statement here because it refers to the conduct of Deputies.  I am quite sure that the Taoiseach would not condone this type of irresponsible conduct and would not tolerate it from these benches.  As I said before, the position was that no Labour Deputy was in the House, but the statement was issued to the press in order to cover up the lack of discipline in the Labour Party but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the speech made by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien <Col N="1997" /> who read a paper here to us here today relating to the Dublin housing situation.  Of course, he was completely wrong and he has no idea of the problem.  One would think that no houses had been built in the city at any time and that substantial numbers of people were in dire need of accommodation. The number of people on the waiting list at present is less than 5,000 but this is one of the problems caused by a fast growing economy and supply and demand.  Because the economy is expanding and because of the expansion of the city, the increase in population, the industries developed by Fianna Fáil, there is a greater number of people in the city now than ever before.  This is as a result of the employment which is available and there will be further opportunities for more employment and people are tending to come home from abroad and take up work in the industrial centres in such places as Ballyfermot, Walkinstown, Coolock and other places.  The further expansion of such sites will attract more skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers from abroad.  This is a very good thing and we will cater for them. One of the reasons for the number on the list is that a more liberal definition of need has been taken into account than in the past and there is a higher priority for elderly people.  A fixed number of dwellings is now being provided for this section, and very rightly so.  In addition, the family of husband, wife and child, where the family is unlikely to increase, is now on the waiting list which was not so before.  This gives some indication of the position compared with another occasion.  If we were to compare the figures on the list now with any other period and take all the factors into consideration I am quite sure that the position is very healthy indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is that higher standards are now demanded.  In the past people were prepared to accept lower standards but now with prosperity and full employment high standards are sought by the people and they are seeking more and more houses and a better standard of housing.  This can be taken in conjunction with the question of urban renewal.  It is our policy to demolish unfit dwellings and dwellings <Col N="1998" /> that do not come up to standard. We have had flats opened at Sarah Place, Islandbridge, and at Keogh Square, Inchicore, and other centres throughout the city.  The flats at Sarah Place were opened a few days ago and they provide an excellent type of accommodation.  A few months ago the disruptive elements in this city tried to prevent the demolition of old stables in which the people were then accommodated.  The housing action group supported by some ex-members of the Dublin City Council endeavoured to prevent the corporation from providing proper homes for these people, demolishing the accommodation which existed so that they could make way for a better type of accommodation. It is worth mentioning that every Dublin Deputy was invited to the opening of the Sarah Place flats but not one Deputy from the Labour Party showed any interest in the opening of these dwellings or thought it worthwhile to be there when they were opened by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>It was stated earlier that certain people could not get housing accommodation and the name of Dennehy was mentioned.  This man refused an offer of accommodation from the Dublin Corporation not so long ago and is prepared to live in a caravan that is being provided for him by some group outside.  This is the person who led the agitation for housing accommodation and now he himself refuses to accept accommodation here in our city.  I do not know who has advised him not to accept this accommodation, but it is quite obvious that he was advised, just as he was advised and paid to carry out the activities which he did carry out in the not so distant past.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy O'Brien's assessment of the situation, the Dublin Corporation have 52,280 dwellings, in addition 15,000 SDA loans have been advanced, 10,700 of which are current loans; and 8,765 repair grants have been made available.  This constitutes over 76,000 dwellings provided through Government or local authority grants, and taking an average of five people per family, it means that about 380,000 people in our city or two thirds of the population of the city <Col N="1999" /> have been housed by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The corporation debt for borrowed money at 31st March, 1969 was £80,060,000.  About 19/6d in every pound relates to housing only and 6d for other services.  Yet people say that Dublin Corporation are doing nothing about housing.  In addition to that, for the last three years the Minister for Local Government has given £1 million to the Dublin Corporation each year for the acquisition of land. Quite a substantial amount of land has been acquired by the Dublin Corporation for its housing programme and for future housing programmes.  I should like to quote from the summary of the housing programme of the Dublin Corporation: schemes in progress, waiting list, 2,077 houses; purchase houses and private sites programme: in progress, 1,238; a total of 3,315 houses.  In regard to schemes about to commence, waiting list, 61; purchase house and private site development 448; a total of 509 houses.  In regard to schemes which are being formulated, many of which will come before the Dublin Corporation within the next few weeks and will be in operation in a very short time, these are the details: waiting list programme, 4,965; purchase house and private site programme, 1,707; total 6,672 houses. Sites acquired or listed for acquisition for waiting list programme, 3,830; for purchase house and private sites 6,000; total 9,830 houses.  This gives a total for the housing programme of 20,326 dwellings.  Deputy Desmond stated the other night we needed 14,000 houses in the city, but the corporation are providing 20,326.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when the corporation housing programme was not progressing as rapidly as the Minister for Local Government would like, he sent representatives of the Dublin City Council to European countries to examine building systems so that an additional number of houses could be built by other methods because of the full employment in the building trade. There is full employment in the building trade in Dublin city at the moment, and if the corporation wanted to double <Col N="2000" /> their output next year they could not do so by traditional means because the labour force is not available.  As a result of this visit to Europe, the Minister undertook the development of the Ballymun scheme where over 3,000 dwellings were erected by the Dublin Corporation outside their own housing programme.  This was done to ensure that there would be a volume of houses greater than the local authority had anticipated.  This is to the credit of the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Neil Blaney, and his successor, Deputy Kevin Boland.</P>
    <P>In case I have not given enough detail in relation to the scheme in progress, I should like to give the following information: Coolock-Kilmore scheme, 36 houses under construction; Kilbarrack East, sections 1 and 2, 288 houses; Kilbarrack East, section 3, 200 houses; Charlemont Street, 36 houses; Queen's Street and Blackhall Place, 54 houses; Dominick Street, 90 houses; Islandbridge, 68 houses; Ballygall Road, 32 houses; Jamestown Road, 17 houses; Sarah Place, 52 houses; Emmet Road and Vincent Street, West, 288 houses; Poplar Row, 122 houses; Dorset Street, 50 houses; Northumber-land Road, 4 houses; Clanbrassil Street-Vincent Street South, 72 houses; Great Charles Street and Rutland Street, 48 houses; Tallaght, East, 32 houses and 188 flats; Tallaght East, section 2, 60 houses and 21 flats; Coolock-Kilmore, 128.</P>
    <P>This gives a total of 2,077 dwellings being built by Dublin Corporation.  As I said before, tenders were approved and contract documents are being prepared in relation to Chamber Street, Ennis Grove and Dublin Street, Baldoyle.  Apart from that, further housing accommodation tenders and offers have been received and are under examination for Hogan Road, Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>This gives a clear indication of the energy and effort that is being put into the housing programme in this city.  It also indicates the remarkable lack of knowledge in relation to the housing situation on the part of Deputy O'Brien and other Members.</P>
    <P>That is in regard to tenancy houses, but on the purchase and private sites <Col N="2001" /> programme, as at 31st October, the following is the position: schemes in progress, Kilbarrack East, section 4, 14 houses; Finglas 2K, 26 houses; Kimmage Road Lower, 24 houses; Old Bawn, Tallaght, 242 houses, as part of the McInerney offer to Dublin Corporaion; Donaghmede, 710 houses, as part of the Gallagher Group offer to Dublin Corporation; Tallaght East (NBA) 184 houses; and Kilbarrack East, 180 houses which makes a total of 1,238 private purchase type houses under construction at the moment for Dublin Corporation in addition to the tenancy houses which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future programme of purchase houses, offers have been accepted and contract documents are being prepared for a further 10 houses in Kimmage Road Lower and a further 22 houses at Kilbarrack East. Tenders and offers have been received and are under examination for 86 houses at Kilbarrack East 5B, 6B and 7; 124 houses at Kilbarrack West sites; and 206 at Kilbarrack West 1, making a total of 448 houses.  With regard to schemes in formulation for acquired sites, site development work is in progress at Rathfarnham, Holylands for 294 houses; Howth Section 4 for 62 houses, and Baldoyle 306 houses.  Layout plans are with the Department of Local Government for the first section of 195 houses at Darndale, and layouts for the balance of 600 houses at Darndale are being prepared; 150 houses at Ballymun Avenue and 100 houses at Ballymun Road making an additional total of 1,707.  In addition to that, sites acquired by agreement have been made available for 6,000 houses. A total area of 970 acres has been acquired by agreement making another 6,000 sites available for private and purchase type sites.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation, the Department of Local Government and the Government as a whole have a definite and complete interest in providing houses for our citizens.  We want to ensure that each person has a home of his own in the shortest possible time, as Deputy Desmond said the other night when he was speaking to thirty people in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They were thirty <Col N="2002" /> people without houses and three of them were members of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The corporation programme vastly exceeds the amount which Deputy Desmond states is required. I have explained in some detail the type of programme that has been formulated and pursued.  I am quite certain that in the quickest possible time, with the labour forces available, we will have the further development by the NBA at Tallaght of 700 houses, at the request of the Minister for Local Government.  In addition to that, there is the development at St. Michael's Estate, formerly Keogh Square.</P>
      <P>It is our intention to ensure that houses are provided not only for those on the waiting list but also for people living in unpleasant or low standard houses.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell has stated that he could provide 20,000 houses in a year.  The capacity of the available working force is in the region of 3,000 dwellings.  This figure has been maintained by the Dublin Corporation in relation to the NBA programme and the corporation programme as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the question the other day about the retention of the factory at Ballymun.  I should like to see the factory retained.  For the Deputy's information the position was that we consulted the building trade group and the unions concerned and we agreed that we would develop Ballymun and when that was completed we would discuss the situation again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a meeting last month; they are quite agreeable to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The understanding was that as soon as Ballymun was completed we would have further discussions to see if the building trade would still be in the position of full employment. If there was still full employment, then an extension of this period would be necessary.  It is highly desirable that large scale developments of the magnitude of the Ballymun estate be made.  I do not hold with the fifteen storey structures but there is plenty of <Col N="2003" /> space available if we can utilise the services of this factory in order to ensure that the programme can progress as quickly as possible.  I am concerned that the people who have been trained in new skills, thanks to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, who brought about this situation and introduced this system, are fully utilised.  These people are a very valuable asset to our economy.</P>
      <P>I have explained the housing programme. I do not think Deputies should be under any illusion as to what the situation is in this city.  A comparison was made yesterday between the housing situation in Ireland and the housing situation in that socialist State across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Which socialist State across the water&mdash;Cuba or Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Great Britain, I shall let Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien take Cuba.  I should like to give some figures so that on the next occasion when we discuss this problem they can be quoted correctly.  I am quoting from the December issue of a magazine called <i>The Word:</i></P>
      <P>This Christmas will be another cold and cheerless one for millions of people in Britain&mdash;for those shivering in 1,800,000 houses unfit for human habitation; for 400,000 families, including 1,400,000 children, living in slums and overcrowded conditions; for 150,000 people sheltering in old buses and broken caravans.</P>
      <P>That is the situation over there in that great socialist State, which we were told yesterday has the answer to all our housing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the last Coalition Government in 1956 we had no building tradesmen and no building workers in the country. A stock of building workers has had to be built up over the years and we now have full employment in the building industry.  That is not to say that tradesmen, labourers and semi-skilled operatives were unemployed.  They were <Col N="2004" /> certainly employed, but they were employed by Wimpey McAlpine on sites in cities like Coventry, Birmingham, London and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have now full employment here and our building workers responded to that happy situation in no uncertain fashion throughout the country in the last general election in ensuring that Fianna Fáil were returned to power so that they could remain in employment in their own country and Fianna Fáil will ensure that they will remain in employment.  In view of the programmes set out, I am quite sure we can continue with full employment in the building trade for many a long day to come because, when sufficient houses have been provided, there will be other building developments to utilise to the full the resources available in men and materials.  The building workers in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and elsewhere can be assured of full employment in the future and they can plan accordingly. Many are now buying their own homes from Dublin Corporation under the schemes available.  The sale of corporation houses to tenants was opposed by the Labour Party for quite a considerable time because Labour realised that when men owned their own houses they would cease to support Labour.  We believe that every man should own his own home and facilities are being made available to that end.  Loans are available without a deposit, if purchasers so desire.  This is an important step forward in the social standing of the individual. Workers are now in a position for the first time to purchase their own homes and the number of tenants who have indicated an interest to date in the purchase of their own homes is 8,300.</P>
    <P>It was alleged here that the number of houses built was the lowest of any country in Europe.  That statement was made yesterday.  Mr. Robert G. Wood, United States Under-Secretary of State for Housing and Urban Development, attended a seminar here on housing in June last and he said that the American delegation were very impressed by the extent of the Irish Government's contribution to housing and planning.  He said that, proportionately, the contribution is considerably greater than similar contributions in the United <Col N="2005" /> States and that recent progress in extending the volume of housing and progress in development and planning was especially notable.  This is the opinion of a neutral person who examined the situation here in depth.  It is very gratifying to have such a statement from someone outside this country and it gives us great heart to learn that there are some who fully understand the situation, even though they are 3,000 miles away.</P>
    <P>The houses we build are amongst the largest in Europe.  For that reason the number may be lower but the accommodation provided is larger.  Families in Britain and elsewhere are smaller than the normal family here and so the demand here is for more larger accommodation. The corporation are building five-roomed, four-roomed, three-roomed and, in some cases, single-roomed dwellings to cater for all sections. This is an aspect that is often overlooked, perhaps deliberately.  Perhaps some people do not understand; I would prefer to think they do not understand and, judging by their statements, it is obvious they do not understand the housing situation here or what has been done.</P>
    <P>The problem of the slums has been largely solved in Dublin, though there are still some small pockets.  In 1967 the corporation assessed housing needs and it was estimated then that 3,423 families were living in dwellings which were unfit and incapable of economic repair.  A substantial number of these families has since been rehoused and the number of dwellings now declared unfit is very, very small indeed.  In addition to what I have already stated, the corporation have made sites available to organisations and individuals to enable them to erect houses of their own.  The sites are as follows: Larkhill, 169; Cabra, 93; Crumlin, 231; Sutton, 33; Walkinstown, 65; Milltown, 30; Ballyfermot, 5; Finglas, 108; St. Anne's 104; Donnybrook, 34; Donnycarney, 14; Rathfarnham, 48; Terenure, 213; Coolgreaney, 127; Beaumont Road, 8; and St. Canice's building society, 64 sites.  This is further proof of the desire to ensure that people who can and will build houses of their own will get an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <Col N="2006" /> Some time ago Dublin Corporation had a scheme to encourage small builders to remain in production so as to ensure that a reasonable price structure could be maintained.  They invited small builders to apply for small numbers of sites which would be developed. Sites and services would be provided and all the builders would have to do was build houses.  At Milltown and at St. Martin's estate in Crumlin we have this type of development.  At Milltown 16 sites were developed by a small contractor and at Crumlin 34 sites were developed by four contractors, a further indication of the desire to make sure that not only big builders would get the contracts but that the small contractors would also have their opportunity.  This was a very creditable development and I trust it will be extended as time goes on to ensure not only a steady price structure but also variety of houses. There will be no monotony because each contractor in the case of St. Martin's estate developed eight houses and each had a different design and different facilities, thus avoiding the monotony with which we were familiar in the past.</P>
    <P>As former members of Dublin Corporation, Alderman Moore, Deputy Tunney, Deputy Timmons and myself and others have played our part to the full.  What I have said is positive proof of it.  We used our influence to ensure that there would be no breakdown in the housing situation.  Many people would like to see the disruption of the housing programme.  Efforts were made to sabotage it and, in the not too distant past, to deprive the corporation of the opportunity to level sites for housing.  There was a situation last week when at a function to which all Deputies were invited not a single Labour Deputy was present.  This indicates their attitude to housing in this city.  Only a few people are aware of the Labour Party attitude to housing and they are the members of Dublin Corporation who had to fight hard through the years to overcome many obstacles placed in their way by the same tactics used in this House a few days ago in regard to the business of the House.  Not alone did we see the disruption of housing programmes but <Col N="2007" /> we saw the eventual abolition of the council because people refused to do their duty.  What can be more convincing than to look at the press reports on the occasion when we had members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties refusing to do their duty because it was the unpopular thing to do?</P>
    <P>Through the years we were aware of the difficulties and the criticism of various contractors that emerged.  On the night we received the offer from the Gallagher Group to provide 800 houses at Donoughmede the first question asked by a Labour councillor was: &ldquo;Who is the contractor?&rdquo; We also heard references to &ldquo;jumbo jet alley&rdquo; by members of the Labour Party trying to terrorise people and paint such a picture that the corporation would not accept the 800 houses offered to them by the Gallagher Group.  This group has made a very substantial contribution to the housing of our people.  McInerney's offered 1,200 houses which, unfortunately the corporation did not accept in full although I and other members of the corporation urged that the full amount be accepted.  If at that time we had accepted the 1,200 houses on a package deal we would have got them at a much reduced rate.  It was approximately £100 a house for 1,200 houses which would mean a substantial saving.  The groups that were in the corporation in greater strength than Fianna Fáil were able to outvote us on this very important issue of getting as many dwellings as possible through a very generous package deal, generous in comparison to the prices we have to pay elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to pay tribute to the two contractors who were almost hijacked by the present vice-chairman of the Labour Party, by other members of that party and by members of the Fine Gael Party who thought they could identify the company in some way with Fianna Fáil.  Certainly, some of the directors are the owners of the company.  That was the sole reason why they did not want to accept these contracts.  They pointed the finger to Deputy Gallagher, a very honourable man.  The contribution they made on <Col N="2008" /> that occasion was just as disgraceful as that which they made here in regard to the affairs of this House last week.</P>
    <P>The 700-house NBA scheme at Tallaght is a very welcome and desirable project and one that will help to rectify the situation that has developed in the city over the past few years in which the only housing accommodation available was on the north side.  This meant half the waiting list who were southsiders and required accommodation on the south side were unable to get it and had to take it on the north side in Ballymun flats or elsewhere. Because of views expressed again by certain members of the Labour Party that the jets would take the top storey off Ballymun, the people were terrified of accepting that accommodation.  We now know that many who refused accommodation in Ballymun are crying out for another offer which they cannot get because Ballymun is full.  That fact proves that the accommodation is acceptable and of a high standard.  The people who are in Ballymun will substantiate this.  There have been problems and difficulties in evolving this great £10 million scheme, the largest single local authority housing scheme in Europe: that indicates the magnitude of the project.  People were deterred by the suggestion that the top storey would be taken off by the first jet that flew over.  I wonder what will be the objection to the Tallaght scheme. We have not heard this yet.  No doubt, there will be some objection or some scare in relation to this scheme before it is finally developed.  Unfortunately, the price of land is a factor.  This development was held up by a speculator for a considerable period because he wanted to get £100,000 that he had been offered by a British construction company for the land.</P>

      <P>There was an offer providing he got planning permission <Col N="2009" /> for housing development.  He did not get planning permission and eventually, after he had hung out for a considerable time, using all angles to try to get planning permission&mdash;many Members of the House will tell you to what length he went to get planning permission&mdash;the corporation made an offer of £60,000.  The scheme was held up for a considerable period and the cost of the construction of the houses has gone up because of the increase in pay rates and in the cost of materials.  I might also mention that this section of the land was sold for approximately £2,000 an acre&mdash;I do not begrudge that to anyone&mdash;while the highest price obtained for land in the same area was £1,700 an acre.  That had an effect on the Tallaght scheme. I shall not mention the man's name.</P>

      <P>Do not push me.  As I have said, the result of the recent general election indicated that the people appreciated the genuine concern of the Fianna Fáil Government for matters relating to development. There was a violent type of agitation witnessed in this city, unfortunately, over a period.  We have seen the statement recently issued by the Dublin Housing Action Group in answer to the speech of the Minister for Local Government at the opening of Sarah Place.  They might as well not have issued it because it is the most milk and water type of statement that ever came from that body.  It shows that they have examined their conscience and are now prepared to be less inflammatory and more realistic than they were in the past in the statements they publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien raised the question of differential rents.  Reading his paper today one could describe it as &ldquo;The Thoughts of Conor Cruise&rdquo;.  Judging by the statements the Deputy made, he is completely out of touch with this country.  Possibly when he has spent a little more time here he will become familiar with the position.  If he reads the Dáil Debates in relation to the housing programme in Dublin he may be brought up to <Col N="2010" /> date and will then be in a position to assess the position properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien is now crying for the Dublin Corporation tenants who were paying differential rents.  I agree in principle with the differential rents scheme.  I do not agree that every section of the scheme is perfect.  I had some resolutions before the Dublin City Council seeking an amendment of the scheme from time to time, some of which were opposed by members of the Opposition parties.  They were opposed purely for the reason that it was a Fianna Fáil member who was trying to ease the burden on the tenants. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien cannot have it both ways.  The scheme was introduced in 1950 during the reign of terror of the first Coalition Government. If differential rents are wrong, it was the Coalition Government that imposed them.  It was a Labour motion before Dublin City Council that introduced the scheme for differential rents.  If differential rents are wrong, the blame must fall on those who proposed and implemented the scheme. The man who proposed it was a man for whom I had great regard, the late Jim Larkin.  I am quite sure that his motives were sound.</P>
    <P>It was absolutely incorrect to make the case to the people during the last local election and the last general election that it was Fianna Fáil that imposed the differential rents and Fianna Fáil that increased the rents. When I challenged statements made by Labour members, people were inclined not to believe me but to take the word of a person who was giving erroneous information.  Possibly the man did not know the position.  He was a Member of this House.  Their campaign during the local election was fought on the basis that rents would be increased in the Crumlin, Drimnagh, Ballyfermot and other housing estates by as much as 35/- and 40/- a week.  This was a deliberate attempt to confuse the public.  I can well understand people, having been brainwashed by members of the Labour Party to believe that their rent would be increased by 30/-a week, deciding how they would vote. &ldquo;Thirty bob a week&rdquo; was all you would hear in the housing schemes and <Col N="2011" /> people believed it.  When the scheme was revised some people got a reduction in their rents and others had to pay 2/-, 3/- or 4/-, which they did not mind.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin are an intelligent people.  The people of the nation are an intelligent people.  From 1932 to the present day there were two occasions when they were misled.  One can pardon a man who sins twice in 31 years.  On those two occasions the people were misled by deliberate lying campaigns just as on this occasion they were brainwashed effectively. That will not happen again.  That happens only once in my lifetime.  I will make sure on the next occasion, despite the moans and groans of the political banshee who went around my constituency, that we will have an answer ready well in advance so as to ensure that the people will have no doubt in their minds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien suggested that there should be an inquiry and investigation into the matter of differential rents.  I suggested that five times in Dublin Corporation.  The matter was discussed but, when the pressure went on, what happened?  The housing manager stated that if he altered the scheme within certain limits, he must get the same amount from the housing pool that, if rents were reduced for one section, they must be increased for another.  The majority of the council were prepared to accept that it was better not to disturb the situation because if a person's rent was increased and if they were somewhat responsible for doing the honourable thing&mdash;reducing the rent for the people in need&mdash; there would be a reflection on them by the people with the £sd who could afford to pay.  I feel a number of parts of this scheme need rectification as, indeed, do also the former Fianna Fáil members of Dublin City Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Former members of Dublin City Council and the other Dublin Deputies have arranged a meeting on this particular item in the course of the next week or so with the city manager and the commissioner, whenever we can get an available appointment, to discuss the things we think are wrong with the system.  We think the system can be adjusted and rectified to the satisfaction of all the people. We shall endeavour now, as we did on previous occasions, to ensure that justice is done in full to the people who are pressed by a situation.  We will also ensure that a person will not be deprived of accommodation because of his inability to pay.  That is to say, we shall have rents at such a level that a person without ability to pay will get a house.  As the Minister for Local Government stated on many occasions, if a person could not afford to pay one shilling, that person should get a house. If he could not afford to pay one penny, that person should get a house.  If he cannot afford to pay, he should get the accommodation if the needs of the person demand it.  That is the Fianna Fáil outlook&mdash;that the person should be assisted right along the line.  That is my view.  It is the view of the other members I have met and with whom I discussed these matters in great detail on a number of occasions and who have recently made certain arrangements with regard to the city manager and the commissioner.  We were always regarded as reasonable people when we were in the Corporation.  We supported what we considered just, whether or not it was popular.  Because of that principle by which we stood, these people have more respect for us than they have for other parties.  I think I have fairly well covered housing.  I have shown that even the American Under-Secretary of State for Housing is in agreement with me, certainly, and that he is in agreement with the policy as laid down and pursued by my party.</P>

It shows it is one item on which these people were in complete agreement.

The Labour Party believe in the direction of labour, the direction of the necessary men.  If at any stage we are under a Labour Government here, we shall have this question of direction of labour and nobody will be sure where he will end his days.  This would be an ideal way to end the housing problem in Dublin&mdash;to send about 1,200 or 1,400 families together down the country and then we would have adequate houses to cater for the remainder of the people.</P>

These are two things I do not agree with and that my party do not agree with and that the members of my party spoke against.  Seeing that it is the policy of the Labour Party, the only other thing I would say about their motion is that, having listened to the estimation of the situation in Dublin and the future prospects, the Labour Party are now aware that the housing programme is on the way to completion. In an endeavour to cash-in, they put down a motion which appeared on the Order Paper and which they discussed. One would think they were the people who built up this housing programme, but it was built up before their motion was put down.  These houses will be produced.  If the houses in this programme were produced after the Labour Party motion went down, the Labour Party would say, in effect: &ldquo;Our motion of December last brought on this scheme&rdquo;.  It was a motion that endeavoured to cash in, but the serious aspects of the motion were the confiscation of land and the direction of men.  I see what is behind that.  This is their method of solving the housing problem&mdash;to move people out of our city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan is a man with a keen sense of rumour. He came into the House yesterday and stated that he was told by a councillor at an election count where the position was that the first two seats had gone against the Government that the ignorant republicans would later make up the balance in favour of the Government. If a person did make that statement to him, the man who repeated that statement is twice as bad as the scoundrel who made it in the first instance, if, in fact, anyone did mention it.  So far as the republicans are concerned, we have great respect for them.  We are the Republican Party.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Donegan and others that we have great respect for the men of uncompromising principle who did not yield to the foreign enemy or the native slave.  We will always respect them.  We will respect their outlook and we will respect the things for which they fought and for which some of them died.  It is deplorable that Deputy Donegan should use his position in this House to insult decent republicans, decent men who throughout their service to the nation gave all they had.  As I said, many gave their lives.  We stand by the ideals of these men.  I do not want to talk about the past.  I do not want to go back on history.  I look to the future.  I will stand up for these great and courageous men who gave everything they had to ensure that we would achieve the freedom we have today and that we will achieve ultimate freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> This is an unfortunate situation.  It is consistent that members of the Fine Gael Party would take occasion in a slick way to try to degrade honourable men such as Deputy Donegan tried to degrade here yesterday.  It did not get the press this morning.  I do not know whether he cut it out of his speech down in the Editor's room.  I can assure the House that this is not the last he will hear about these insults to these courageous men, these men of uncompromising principle, men who would not yield to the foreign enemy or the native slave.  We will not do it either.</P>
    <P>He spoke about the divisions in Fianna Fáil.  I cannot find them and I am a member of this Party.  I can well see the divisions in Fine Gael.  We were well aware last week that the knights with the long knives were in session for a while.  I wonder if Deputy Garret FitzGerald can tell me if Deputy Richie Ryan is completely rehabilitated because I want to say something to him as soon as he appears in this House.  If it will take a longer time to rehabilitate him let me know, because I do not want to take advantage of a man who is going through this process of corrective training in the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I should like to be informed on this. I do not want to attack the man if he is going through this course of corrective training.  If he is completely rehabilitated we will deal with him effectively. As we saw in the course of his speeches some time ago, there are terrible men in that party, terrible people, people who are ready to stab their leader in the back.  They had set a date for it. The assassination of Deputy Cosgrave was fixed for May, 1971.  They even had the date fixed, and probably the place.</P>

      <P>Taca is a respectable organisation. The fund-raising medium of Fianna Fáil is a respectable organisation. People subscribe freely.  If they do not want to subscribe they need not subscribe. There is no coercion, unlike the methods employed in some parties.  In relation to the Fine Gael Party I might mention the £300 a man candidates they had.  In the last election, one man would not be allowed to contest it because he had not got £300.  Each man had to provide £300&mdash;the Just Society. This is Class 4 in the Just Society.</P>
      <P>One can see where they get their money.  They blackmail people into standing for them on the basis of: &ldquo;You are OK.  Give us £300 for national headquarters.&rdquo;  We saw the mess national headquarters made of the Ryan affair.  They issued several statements.  We had statements coming and going like carrier pigeons and they did not know where they stood.  I was looking for some tickets for that fight-in but I could not get them.  I am quite sure that if they issued tickets they would have a very full bank account today.  Many people were interested in the de-briefing session and the confession stage done in the best Russian-style tradition.</P>

      <P>This is quite a respectable organisation.  A number of people have contributed to it voluntarily and have shown their appreciation of the wonderful work done by the party over the years in the development of houses, industries, social services and all the other services we have provided freely down through the years.  There is nothing wrong with the Taoiseach, nothing wrong with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and nothing wrong with the Minister for Local Government.  These are all honourable men who are doing a good job and nobody can dispute that.  Deputy Donegan, in order to try to get more of the dirt across that he tried to get across in relation to the republicans, made this attack on honourable men like the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Local Government.  I cannot say all that I would like to say as Deputy Donegan is not here but I will deal with him on another occasion and I will not be prevented as I was on a previous occasion by people on the other benches.  That is their idea of democracy.  However, I will find an occasion to make Deputy Donegan swallow his words in relation to honourable men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister for Finance say that we should keep a keener eye on prices.  I fully agree that we should.  I should like to say that the prices which housewives in this city have to pay for farm produce are disgraceful. In Ballyfermot, Crumlin and in other places they are paying £61 12s a ton for potatoes in supermarkets where they are supposed to be getting reduced prices.  I understand that those <Col N="2020" /> who produce the potatoes get £18 to £20 so there is cause for concern.  This is one matter which if it was not examined quickly could bring about a variety of situations that might not be controlled so easily.  Housewives are being &ldquo;soaked&rdquo; for farm produce such as eggs, cabbages and other necessities of life.  These are all home-produced products.  Imported tinned vegetables seem to maintain their price levels but we have a fluctuation of prices for farm produce.  I should like to see the farmer getting more than £20 a ton for his potatoes and there is a very good case for that, but some middleman, or &ldquo;muddleman&rdquo; or highwayman is able to extract £41 12s from the unfortunate housewives.  As I say, this matter should be looked into as a matter of urgency, to ensure that the housewife will get a reasonable crack of the whip.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey my strong views on this matter of marketing farm produce to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are a number of rings in this city operating against the housewives. They must be broken and an effort made to ensure that the housewives get these items at a fair price.  That is all they require.  The producers also only want fair and reasonable return for their energies and the services they provide.  Something should be done about this so that the farmer will get more for his farm produce and the housewife will get the farm produce more cheaply, and then everybody will be happy, except the middleman.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to deal with the question of the weaker sections of the community but, as I was deprived of the opportunity on Wednesday week, I want to deal in detail with the weak, the aged, the infirm and those who are in need of one type of assistance or another.  It is necessary to go back in order to examine the position in depth. We can go back to the taking over of the State by a native Government. At that time the British left us a legacy of neglected social problems and the only solution they had to some of the problems was the workhouse. Many of the aids that are available today were not available then.  I agree that some people are existing on a <Col N="2021" /> fairly low level but the bulk of the community have a reasonable income and if they have not got it now I hope they will with the aid of their trade unions and other bodies which make representations on their behalf. This is just to give an indication of the type of mentality that existed in the early days when a former Minister for Industry and Commerce said that they had certain limited funds at their disposal. We also have limited funds at our disposal.  He said that people may have to die in the country through starvation.  That was the outlook of the then Deputy McGilligan and it is to be found in Volume 9, column 562 of the Official Report.</P>

      <P>In 1932, unemployment assistance did not exist, widows' and orphans' pensions did not exist and a variety of other aids did not exist. This position was rectified by Fianna Fáil and they have been progressively increased and in the last Budget substantial increases were given to the various sections which required attention. The Minister for Finance examined the position in depth and a number of contributions were made from the limited funds at our disposal.  The funds were given out by way of increases in children's allowances where some allowances were increased from 15s 6d to 30s and others from 26s 6d to £2.  I might mention that Deputy O'Donovan had a great idea today.  He suggested we should take money from the first child and give it to the fourth: the woman with four children would not get any more if that were done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So everybody has four children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not feel like taking money from anyone.  I would not even take it from an old age pensioner, as some people did.  There has <Col N="2022" /> been progressive increases in all these allowances over the years.  Last year there was an increase of 10s in old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, adult dependants' allowances, unemployment assistance, infectious diseases allowances and disabled persons' allowances.  These people who are in receipt of children's allowances, people with large families, would not like the deduction Deputy O'Donovan suggested should be made in the allowances.  Fianna Fáil have widened the range of social welfare benefits.  There were no widows' and orphans' pensions or children's allowances until we came to power.  There is one thing about this party, if it is necessary to impose taxation for the benefit of the weaker sections of the community we do not hesitate to go into the Division Lobby to vote for increased taxation.  That does not apply to other parties.  The Labour Party did, on occasion, support some of the financial resolutions, but on other occasions they voted against resolutions which were designed to help the needy and the depressed sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Other benefits which have been introduced in the last Budget are increased personal allowances for married men, increased allowances for handicapped children and relief for medical expenses.  This relief is long overdue and I hope it will be reviewed yearly or occasionally.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance spoke very clearly about the problems facing the country, and I hope they will be fully understood by the Opposition, and that when proposals are put forward for improving the lot of the weaker sections they will play their part by going into the Division Lobby and giving us their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cheap fuel scheme was mentioned, and there was an extension of this scheme this year.  This and other very welcome improvements were made available out of the limited resources at the disposal of the Government. Increases were also granted to public service pensioners.  We have not neglected the aged.  There is free electricity, free television licences and free transport.  We have not got a right wing <Col N="2023" /> policy, a left wing policy or a middle of the road policy.  It is Fianna Fáil policy, to look after every section of the community. It is our policy&mdash;Fianna Fáil policy.  We do not have to get it from Cuba or from any other alien source.</P>
    <P>In addition to all the State assistance, there are many voluntary organisations. I should like to refer again to Deputy Donegan who criticised me here yesterday. He indicated that in a speech of mine I praised the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and of the Legion of Mary.  I have the highest regard for these people.  They are doing great work in the city, and it is diabolical for him to say I was wrong to praise them in this House.  There are many other organisations, such as the Mother Mary Aikenhead Social Centres and the Salvation Army, who are doing excellent work in the city for the aged, people who live on their own.  They are giving a service which is not yet provided by the State.</P>
    <P>I want to be associated with such organisations.  Time does not permit me to cover other fields.  If the debate had been going on for another day or so I would certainly have carried on a wider discussion.  I have, however, given you the value of my assessment of the housing problem.  I shall conclude by saying, that I, too, like the Minister for Labour, would like to wish you all a very happy Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to turn rather belatedly at this stage in the debate to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Being a newcomer to this House I am unduly conscientious on this point.  I had thought that was the subject of this debate and I feel before the debate closes reference should be made to that subject, as it has not been done in the last two hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's Department is a small Department.  The Devlin Report said that it is one Department in which there is room for expansion.  The Devlin Report makes a number of proposals which oddly enough, in the light of that remark, involve the transfer of functions from the Taoiseach's Department.  The reason for that the Devlin Report says is that the Taoiseach's <Col N="2024" /> Department should carry out a greater function of co-ordinating the activities of Government.  The emphasis in the report is on the failure of co-ordination, the problems created by a lack of co-ordination and the value to be got from greater co-ordination. That, to my mind, reinforces very strongly the views that have been expressed on this side of the House with regard to recent utterances by Ministers and in regard to the whole business of Government policy.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to deal with a particular point which is relevant to this debate, because it is the responsibility of the Taoiseach, relating to official archives.  There is at the moment a grave danger of the destruction of some official archives, in particular in the Office of Public Works.  There is great concern among Irish historians about the total lack of interest of the public service and, I am afraid, of Ministers for the preservation of archives for historical purposes.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to examine the position and make sure that valuable material, which will be vital to the writing of our history in the future, will not be destroyed.  Over 20 years ago valuable material was destroyed.</P>
    <P>I believe there is material in the Office of Public Works about the Famine, about the running of the ViceRegal Lodge, about the building of our railway system.  There is also a valuable collection of photographs. All this material is in danger of destruction. In view of the fact that archives are at present in the charge of the Taoiseach's Department, and the Devlin Report recommends their transfer to the Public Records Office, I would ask the Taoiseach to examine the position to see that no further records are destroyed.</P>
    <P>We can look to Northern Ireland for example in this instance where the whole matter is extremely well dealt with.  Indeed, I believe there is an offer of co-operation from Northern Ireland in this matter.  We could well do with some assistance from them. In fact, the position is so bad here in regard to the destruction of material that the Northern Ireland people are willing to take over some of our <Col N="2025" /> material and look after it if we are not prepared to do so ourselves.  Because of the limited time for debate I shall not develop that point further, but it is one causing great concern to Irish historians.  While they are divided in their views as to which part of our heritage should be preserved, I do not think they have divided views on the necessity to preserve our archives. The permanent loss of anything which will tell us about our past and which may be used by historians in the future would be tragic and something which the Taoiseach and the Government should not allow to happen.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the question of the role of the Taoiseach as enunciator of Government policy&mdash;as he described it himself yesterday.  I am concerned about this because of the conflict which has arisen.  I say &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; advisedly. I cannot fully accept the Taoiseach's reassurances in this matter which he gave yesterday on the conflict between himself and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to Northern Ireland.  I have examined the record very carefully on this because the Taoiseach kept reiterating that he had already answered the question.</P>
    <P>I think I can show from the record that he has not answered the question. I think there is a real need here for sorting out what the Government's policy is.  There are two separate issues here.  We did try to distinguish them in the Northern Ireland debate, and I thought we had done so successfully, but I am very disappointed with what has happened since.  There are two issues involved here.  The first issue is that of not using force, and our attention has been directed to this issue in the last week.  The second issue, which is also of great importance and to which very little attention has been directed, although it was also the subject of attack by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;the issue that all parties seemed to agree on two months ago when the matter was discussed&mdash;is that there should and could be no question of ending Partition without the agreement of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  That issue, which all parties agreed about, has been contested by the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2026" /> and Fisheries.  I should like to read the relevant portion of what he said because I want to contrast it with what the Taoiseach said.  I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press:</i></P>
    <P>It is important to correct some recent misconceptions about the rights of the majority of the people of Ireland in regard to the Partition of this country...</P>
    <P>It should be made clear here and now that the majority in the Six Counties has no moral right to decide on Partition...</P>
    <P>To say that the majority within the Six Counties should have the right to decide on Partition is to accept that Partition was in the first justified ...</P>
    <P>... it is the majority of the people of all Ireland who alone have the right to decide this question ...</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party had never taken a decision to rule out the use of force if the circumstances in the Six Counties so demanded.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with the question of the use of force because it can be said that the Taoiseach has repudiated in fairly explicit terms the Minister on that point, but not on the other vital one.</P>
    <P>The record starts with the Taoiseach's speech in Tralee, which was encouraging and reasonably explicit, although not as explicit, apparently, as was necessary, if we were going to have this record straight.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>It will remain our most earnest aim and hope to win the consent of the majority of the people in the Six Counties to means by which North and South can come together in a re-united and sovereign Ireland...</P>
    <P>Again he said:</P>
    <P>The unity we seek is not something forced but a free and genuine union of those living in Ireland...</P>
    <P>He also stated:</P>
    <P>Of its nature this policy&mdash;of seeking unity through agreement in Ireland between Irishmen&mdash;is a long-term one.  It is no less, indeed it is even more, patriotic for that...</P>
    <P>I thought that was a very encouraging <Col N="2027" /> development.  We all did.  That was followed by the explicit statement of Fine Gael policy on this issue and I shall read that statement because it received the Taoiseach's endorsement and it is important to note what the Taoiseach has endorsed:</P>
    <P>It is the duty of political parties in the Republic, who must be concerned for the people of Northern Ireland, and especially for the exploited and maltreated minority, to recognise these facts and to have regard to the wishes of this Northern minority.  This duty is reinforced by the self-evident fact that, force as a weapon of policy having been rejected by all responsible political groups in the Republic, the only way in which the present divided state of this island can, or should be modified is with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in the debate in this House had more to say on this subject but, before coming to his endorsement of Fine Gael policy, I will quote what he said in opening the debate:</P>
    <P>As for the long term, it is our aim to win the agreement of a sufficient number of the people in Northern Ireland to an acceptable form of re-unification.</P>
    <P>In closing the debate, he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald made many assertions and many criticisms on behalf of Fine Gael.  After the Fine Gael ten-point plan was announced, I said that it did no more than reiterate Government policy declared on a number of occasions; there is nothing new in it.</P>
    <P>He went on to trace what he described as the development of Fianna Fáil policy since 1921.  His quotations were somewhat selective, and one could have got another list proving the opposite.  But it is, of course, probably true that, if you take any political party for 50 years and all the people who made speeches for it, a careful selection will produce different impressions.  I do not fault the Taoiseach for this.  At the end of his attempt to show some continuity of policy&mdash;I will quote the concluding <Col N="2028" /> phrases of this dialogue, because there was a certain amount of dialogue in it:</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: Would the Taoiseach not accept that the only way in which it can or should be modified is with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland? There must be consent and force is abhorrent.  This is a technical point not covered in the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: What I said is a development of a line of policy.  It is quite clear.</P>
    <P>It certainly was not quite clear.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in everything I have said.  First of all, there is recognition of discrimination and recognition, too, of the need to win over a majority in order to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>It is neither clear nor explicit because, while the Taoiseach had shown the development of Fianna Fáil policy, he did not explicitly endorse, by using these words that Fine Gael had used and Labour had used, that Partition could and should end only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  At this point, Deputy M. O'Leary intervened:</P>
    <P>It is a development which has not been announced in that form before.</P>
    <P>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner): It has been consistently stated for years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: It does not matter who started it so long as we are on the right road.</P>
    <P>I may say that, when the Taoiseach said that&mdash;it is not reported here&mdash; I called across the floor of the House: &ldquo;Well, we will settle for that&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is volume 241, columns 1590 to 1593 of the Official Report.  That is the position in which we were left.  It was a happy position. The Taoiseach himself commented in his concluding speech upon the unity of purpose shown by the House.  Indeed, he congratulated the Opposition parties for their response in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2029" /> There we stood, we thought, united on this matter and, not only united in not using force&mdash;on that we have been united for a long time&mdash;but united on this new principle which had not been asserted explicitly before in this House, certainly not by the Fianna Fáil Party, and I am not sure even if it was made explicit by the other parties either, that Partition could and should end only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  I think we all believed on both sides of the House that the Taoiseach in the words he used, though he did not use explicitly the particular words we had used, was endorsing what we said.  Everybody believed that, south and north of the Border.</P>
    <P>Then what happened?  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries made his speech.  I shall read the Taoiseach's statement on that because there is a very great difference in the tone of the Taoiseach's remarks now and before. Whatever has happened, whatever influence he has come under, whatever reason he may have for pulling back from the position he adopted, as all parties did in this House, there is a change of tone.  This is the Taoiseach's statement; this is the statement issued by the Government Information Bureau.  Asked to comment on the Letterkenny speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government on the partition issue is and continues to be precisely as I most recently stated it to be in Dáil Éireann on October 22nd last.</P>
    <P>Fair enough.  He then went on to quote what he had said in the course of his speech at Tralee on September 20th about not using force.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, however, once more that we have no intention of using force to realise this desire.  I said as recently as 28th August that it was and has been the Government's policy to seek for the reunification of the country by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>Then he quoted from his Dáil speech on the use of force as well and he said:</P>
    <P>This policy has been endorsed again and again by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2030" /> Party.  While Mr. Blaney's feelings on the Partition issue are very deeply felt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was a nice way of putting it and we are not convinced that his feelings are as deeply felt as appeared from the expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he occasionally finds it difficult not to give public expression to them, he knows and endorses Government policy, as he did in his speech in Letterkenny last week.</P>
    <P>In that statement of the Taoiseach's you will note that there is no reference whatever to the crucial point in the Minister's speech, which was not a question of using force, for what he said was that force could be used if the people were being massacred in Northern Ireland; it is not plain, in fact, that force should be used to end Partition.  But the crucial thing in the Minister's speech, which was missed and, mark you, it was missed by the Press as well, was this repudiation of the basic concept, basic to the new policy all parties had adopted, that Partition can only end with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and, in the Taoiseach's reply, there is no reference whatever, there is no mention, of that crucial point in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>There was a question down in the House on the subject and the Taoiseach's reply yesterday was simply to refer to his statement of whatever the date was in the Library, from which I have just quoted.  There were supplementary questions.  I myself put a series of supplementaries.  So did other people.  The supplementaries I put asked the Taoiseach to state explicitly again his position on this question of consent as the basis of reunion and the only reply I extracted from him each time was: &ldquo;I have answered that.&rdquo;  He has not answered it.  There has been no answer to it.  His statement makes no reference to it.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach in this House tonight to set the record straight.  It would be a tragedy if he were pulled by any force within his own party in a direction which could undo the great work done here on October 22nd and 23rd, when a real step forward was taken in the history of this country. <Col N="2031" /> when a break-through was achieved and the three political parties were not seeking to make capital at each other's expense but were concerned only with the national interest and agreed on a policy which had never been explicitly stated before.  This is the only policy upon which reunion can ever be achieved.  That great work is now in jeopardy because one man on those benches, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, up in Donegal, for his own purpose, has been prepared to use this tragic situation in Northern Ireland to benefit himself politically in that area.</P>
    <P>Now that is fair enough.  We know who he is and we know what he is like.  We know how he reacts to things. I am concerned, not for him, because he is small fry, but I am concerned with the Taoiseach as head of the Government and the policy the Taoiseach seemed to enunciate here when he endorsed the Fine Gael statement and when he, at that time, stood firm on this principle that Partition should end only with agreement.  But he is not standing firm on it now.  There has not been one word on that point from him since the &ldquo;Blaney&rdquo; speech was made. There has been a repudiation of the use of force, which is not really an issue in any event, but no reference to this question of consent and there has been from the Taoiseach what cannot but appear as a less than honest series of replies to supplementaries: &ldquo;I have answered that question.&rdquo;  It may be that he thinks he has answered it.  It may be confusion on the Taoiseach's part&mdash;I will be charitable and assume that it is&mdash;but, if it is confusion, let him set the record straight tonight. Let us not lose the benefit of the step taken here two months ago.  Let us not endorse something to the benefit of the particular political interests of a particular Minister in a particular county.</P>
    <P>There is too much at stake for us to play party politics.  The parties on this side of the House did not play politics at that time and have not done so since.  We have not sought to exploit the position.  We had proper criticisms to make of the particular manner in which the Government acted in August and we made them here in a form <Col N="2032" /> which the Taoiseach himself accepted as reasonable, coming from an Opposition two months after the events in question.  We did not attempt in any way to make political capital.  On the contrary, we supported the Government in its policy and we joined with the Government, as we thought, in supporting this idea of reunion with consent, the only basis on which reunion can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach not to destroy what has been achieved but to consolidate it when here tonight he comes to reply.  He is not opposite me now, but there are people there who can tell him what I have asked, who can tell him the line of argument I have pursued, who can tell him how I have searched through his speeches and what I have found in them, what I have read from his statements, and how I have shown that there is nothing in them, nothing in this point <i>ad rem</i> and what this House requires and what he has a duty to give us is a clear specific reiteration of those words which he ought to give us again here tonight.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Taoiseach's role as co-ordinator of Government policy.  He has a role also in ensuring that his Ministers not only do their work but confine themselves to their work and do not undertake activities outside which cut across their work.  At this particular point I want to refer to the position of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice has been accused here of continuing to practise as a solicitor while holding ministerial rank.  There has been no denial forthcoming from him or from the Taoiseach on this point.  The Minister for Justice did say that on a particular occasion he just happened to drive up to the court in a State car and just happened to be talking to a few solicitors in relation to a case with which his firm was dealing, but that he did not happen to be briefing counsel on that occasion and that counsel were briefed by two other solicitors &ldquo;employed by my firm&rdquo; were the words he used.  He made it quite explicit that he is not practising as a solicitor.  I do not think it is acceptable for any Minister, as distinct <Col N="2033" /> from practising as a solicitor, to retain a sleeping partner in a firm.  I am even in doubt about the sleeping partner, but I admit this is an open question. This question has not been settled on either side.  There are divided views on it.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my view that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in giving up his solicitor's practice, put himself in a position of jeopardy if in future he is in Opposition. He took an action which goes beyond what is required by the normal convention of this House and the country and he is to be congratulated for the honourable stand he took.  But I would not fault other Ministers if they did not follow his example and simply remained sleeping partners in a practice. It would be better if they did not, but the convention is that they may, Nobody has suggested changing the convention and therefore I am prepared to leave it at that.</P>
    <P>What is totally unacceptable is that any Minister should practise as a solicitor and what is above all unacceptable is that the Minister for Justice should do so.  I am not a practising lawyer and I am open to correction, but my understanding is that the Minister for Justice has a number of functions to perform in relation to the administration of justice. He is concerned with the appointment of judges, with the courts and with the Garda Síochána and he also has certain functions which enable him in certain cases, in particular cases such as extradition cases, to overturn decisions of the courts.  He is responsible for drafting legislation such as legislation currently being drafted in connection with the rent restrictions code. For any Minister in that position to be a practising solicitor puts him in an impossible position and is open to serious misconstruction.  It means that, if somebody is concerned with extradition, the solicitor to go to would be the Minister for Justice because if his solicitor failed to get him off in court, his solicitor could with a stroke of the pen deal with the matter next day as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>It means that this Minister has clients, all of whom must be either <Col N="2034" /> landlords or tenants and many of whom will be coming to him on matters concerning being landlord or tenant.  It means that that Minister alone&mdash;not any other member of the Government&mdash;knows what he intends to do in regard to the rent restrictions code.  He knows what increase in the value of property or change in rents may occur and, therefore, he alone is in a position to advise his clients as to what the future law will be and how to profit from it.  I do not suggest that he has done so but for him to be a practising solicitor is incompatible with his position as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was questioned on this in the House.  His reply was a non-reply.  I shall read the question and the answer because I think we have a right to require from him tonight an explicit answer to this question. I quote from volume 242 of 12th November, 1969, at column 721:</P>
    <P>Mr. L'Estrange asked the Taoiseach whether any directorships or other positions in any business or other concern are held by Government Ministers; and, if so, if he will state their nature.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: No Minister holds any position that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>On another occasion subsequently I asked another question on this matter and a number of Deputies asked supplementaries but they failed to extract from the Taoiseach any statement as to what positions Ministers do hold. We are entitled to have that information: what other jobs do they hold? The Taoiseach has not disclosed that to the House.  He is simply saying that he has established certain criteria in his own mind which he will not communicate to us, that he has applied them in his own mind and that he is satisfied that no Minister holds a position which is incompatible with his office.  As it now appears that the Minister for Justice is practising as a solicitor while he is Minister for Justice there is evident conflict of interest here <Col N="2035" /> of the most flagrant kind.  If the Taoiseach does not see that this is a conflict of interest and if he regards this as something which could not reasonably be regarded as interferring, or being incompatible with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office, I am not happy to leave to the Taoiseach this decision.  I am not happy to leave it to him to formulate criteria in his own mind and apply them without telling us what they are.</P>
    <P>In the light of that evidence of looseness of thinking on the part of the Taoiseach, of his willingness to adopt an attitude which seems incompatible with the high integrity required of him in office we must ask him to tell us tonight first, what are the principles underlying the holding of other posts by Members of the Government? Secondly, what Members of the Government hold what positions? Let the House then decide whether the criteria are right or not.  If they are not we can put down a motion to discuss them and propose they should be changed and to decide whether the Taoiseach has been applying these criteria thoroughly and properly in the decisions he has been taking.  At present the House can take no such action: it does not know what the critera are or what jobs Ministers hold. It is not a good thing for the country that suspicions aroused in this way should be allowed to continue.  We should know what the position is, what criteria are applied; what Ministers hold what posts.  We should then be in a position to say whether or not we think it is compatible with the carrying out of their duties as members of the Government.  We are entitled to that and I would press the Taoiseach on it.</P>
    <P>I would also press him to tell us what he thinks of the letter the Minister for Justice wrote.  We have heard the Minister brazening it out in this House: it could be called nothing else.  He said explicitly that he took back not a word.  He defended his right to write a letter of this kind as Minister for Justice, signed &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo;, a letter in which he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After discussing and considering <Col N="2036" /> the matter I consider the only thing for you to do is to move in quietly to Mrs. O'Mahoney's house.  Once you are in we will try and find ways and means of keeping you there and ultimately getting you recognised as the official tenant.  All I can say&mdash; and this is strictly confidential&mdash;is that once you are in there I will do my best to keep you there.  For obvious reasons you should destroy this letter and tell nobody on what basis you are getting into the house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice regards that as perfectly compatible with his office as Minister for Justice.  He has told us in this House that to write a letter of this kind encouraging squatting is perfectly all right.  He has in fact given free licence to every Member of the House to encourage squatting, but whatever benches we sit on, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, very few will follow him in that.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city there is a real housing problem which Deputy Dowling managed to make disappear into thin air. I shall come back to that on the Local Government and I shall take him sentence by sentence through his speech. It will be a long speech on my part but worth it to get the record right once and for all.  In this city there is an appalling housing shortage at present. I do not claim to be able to compare it with the past since I have only recently become involved as a Deputy. I know how bad it is now.  I see no sign of any Deputy on any side of the House encouraging squatting.  On the contrary, Deputies of all parties have adopted a responsible attitude and the only person who has not done so is the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach stand over this letter?  We know that the Minister for Justice does.  Does the Taoiseach?  I want to hear him defend or repudiate it in this House.  I want one more thing from the Taoiseach on this subject. We heard some months ago, before the general election, a letter read out here written by a Member of this House at that time in which he referred to certain financial transactions related to local authority matters.  I refer to the former Deputy Martin Corry.  Will the Taoiseach state if he stands over <Col N="2037" /> the appointment of the person who wrote such a letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair wishes to point out that on the Taoiseach's Estimate criticism of a Minister is not in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach whether he stands over this decision of the relevant Minister because on the matter of the integrity of members of the Government the Taoiseach is, as he says himself, the judge and it is the Taoiseach I want to answer on this point.  I want to know if he stands over this appointment; does he consider it to be correct?</P>
      <P>Let me summarise the questions I am putting to the Taoiseach.  His advisers and the Parliamentary Secretary will tell him more fully what I have asked.  First, I am asking him to repudiate not this use-of-force statement by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;that has been dealt with reasonably adequately&mdash;but the statement in regard to the question of the ending of Partition by consent.  There is nothing on the record of an absolutely explicit character on this point from the Taoiseach, although he gave us every reason to believe in the debate here that he endorsed everything that was said on this point.  I have pointed out that in his statement of 9th December there is certainly a reiteration of his views on the use of force but no reference whatever to the question of ending Partition by consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will recapitulate the point, as the Taoiseach has come into the House.  In fairness to him, I think he should know the points I am raising.  I will finish immediately then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I should like to recapitulate them and I have the permission of my colleague here to do so.  It is this question of consent in regard to the ending of Partition.  I do think we are entitled to a clear statement on that.  I have asked the Taoiseach to state what are the criteria he applies as regards the holding of other posts by Government Ministers and what Government Ministers hold what posts and, should he fail to answer this question, I would ask him to state explicitly whether he upholds the situation in which the Minister for Justice has been practising as a solicitor and has admitted to doing so and what view he takes of the letter written by the Minister for Justice. Finally, I would ask him if he will comment on the appointment of Mr. Martin Corry to a post as director of a State company.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was opening the debate yesterday evening he took 30 minutes exactly.  I felt he could have taken much longer and could have covered a lot of points which we would have liked to debate over the last two days.  Deputy Joe Dowling took one hour and forty-five minutes to make his contribution.  Are we to take it that there is another contender for the Taoiseach stakes or is Deputy Joe Dowling now the appointed spokesman of Fianna Fáil, as the only man to put the facts before the House? Is he the person who has been designated by the party to say the things that should be said, I believe, by the Taoiseach if they are to be said at all? What is the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Deputy Dowling's contribution there were one or two points mentioned that are worthy of note.  One in particular was the reiteration of the <Col N="2039" /> fact that the Fianna Fáil Party are the Republican Party.  Some years ago a group of people, including myself, having lunch in a hotel in Stockholm discussed politics in general and Irish politics in particular.  There was a member of Fianna Fáil, a member of Fine Gael, myself of the Labour Party and a doctor, who was also a parliamentarian, from Austria.  He wanted to know what the three parties were.  The Fianna Fáil man said, &ldquo;We are Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party.&rdquo;  The Fine Gael man said, &ldquo;We are Fine Gael, the Party that declared the Republic.&rdquo; The doctor with a certain degree of perplexity, turned to me and said: &ldquo;What party are you?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am of the Labour Party, the only party that was never responsible for the execution of republicans.&rdquo;  When people stand up in this House and call themselves the Republican Party, they should first take a good look back. Deputy Dowling was prepared to trot an awfully long way back and I do not propose to follow him but I think that comment should be made.  It makes me laugh when I see &ldquo;The Republican Party&rdquo;&mdash;granted it is in small print now&mdash;on the Fianna Fáil posters saying that they are the only people who uphold republicanism.  It was an attack on Deputy Donegan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not say anything, usually.  You say you are the Republican Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We are but we do not say we are the only Republican Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would look rather silly if there were more than one Republican Party.  Or, are we all Republican Parties?  If we are all Republican Parties, to put &ldquo;The Republican Party&rdquo; on the posters is sillier still. However, we leave that to the Deputy and to Deputy Donegan in the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a brief comment on the situation in the north which deserved to get more attention <Col N="2040" /> in the Taoiseach's speech and possibly will get a lot more when he is replying. As my accent will reveal, I come from north of the Boyne.  There we are closer to the Border, with the exception of some of the people in Donegal and Louth, than most people in this country.  We spent a lot of time in our young days going over and back across the Border.  Hardly a week passes that we do not go up and down there.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at the start of the dispute, in the horrible, dark days of last autumn made a tactical error.  His first speech&mdash;I grant that he did not intend to do it&mdash;gave the impression to people in Northern Ireland that there was a hope of troops from the south going in to invade the north.  Those who know the facts know that that is not possible.  I am quite sure the Taoiseach did not intend to suggest it but that point was made and the serious situation built up as a result.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Taoiseach, having made his famous speech some time ago in Kerry, did a very good job because he spelled out in very plain words what the Government meant and the debate in this House reiterated on the part of the three parties that there was no intention of sending troops across the Border and there was no intention of forcing the people of the Six Counties into the Republic unless with the wish of the majority.  I think he did a good job.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept a statement, even from the Taoiseach, as long as he allows somebody who is a Member of the Cabinet to state the direct opposite.  Unless the Taoiseach is prepared to say that he does not agree with the statements made by Deputy Blaney and echoed by Deputy Boland, when he gets the opportunity, there will be confusion in this country. It is wrong that that should happen. The Taoiseach, who is an honourable man, should not allow himself to be pulled around because the story going the rounds is that we are back to the old days, that the Leader of Fianna Fáil is on both sides at the same time, on the left hand side of the road and on the right hand side of the road and if there is any danger from the left or <Col N="2041" /> from the right, he immediately runs to the centre and is safe there; there is somebody to say, &ldquo;You are an extremist Republican&rdquo;, somebody else to say, &ldquo;It is all right.  We do not believe in physical force of any kind&rdquo;. Let us have it out once and for all. If the Taoiseach is prepared to stand over his statement, then let him tell the people, who have been degrading him and the Government and the country by making statements which they are not prepared to stand up to and which nobody can stand up to, to get out of the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the people who feel strongly about the situation in the north felt as strongly when the trouble was here, their place, like the so-called IRA, was in the north, the place where they could be of some use.  They were not there when they were wanted. They were not there when the troubles were on.  There is no use now, in the safety of the Republic, shouting across the Border at people, saying, &ldquo;If you try it again, look at what we will do&rdquo;. That little game is played out.  The Taoiseach made a statement which in my opinion was explicit and should not have been changed and he is being degraded by the statements made by other people.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I understand that the Government were anxious some time ago to ensure that the Six Counties would be referred to as Northern Ireland. I do not know why.  I noticed that Deputy Boland today reacted very strongly when somebody accidentally referred to it as Northern Ireland and said there is no such place.  There is such a place, we know, but I do not agree that it is all in the Six Counties. Some of it is and some of it is not.  I do not want to go any further on that issue.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Taoiseach and to a number of Fianna Fáil speakers one would get the impression that this is a land flowing with milk and honey in which everybody is doing very well. Then we see something like this in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 17th December:</P>
    <P>Appeal by St. Vincent de Paul Society.</P>
    <P>Unless there is an immediate generous response to his appeals for funds <Col N="2042" /> for the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Ireland many thousands of poor people throughout the country will have to go without much-needed help.  It collects and distributes about £550,000 each year.  In Dublin, the Society looks after 10,000 families which include the unemployed, the aged, disabled and the destitute and about £200,000 is distributed in the city area which has about 250 conferences.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for people in this House merely to say, &ldquo;Are these voluntary bodies not doing a great job?&rdquo; This appeal does not refer to people who want a little help.  It talks about the destitute.  It talks about people who have nothing, people who are hungry, people who have no homes.  As long as there are such people in the country we should not in this House or outside it try to create the impression that the country is better than ever it was, or, to use Deputy Haughey's expression, that we never had it so good.</P>
    <P>On 18th March he said that the country was in a terrible condition. With tears in his eyes he appealed to everybody, particularly the workers&mdash; it is always particularly the workers&mdash; to make sure that they did not make excessive demands, that they would go easy on the employers as the country would not be able to stand up to further increases.  Mind you, this time the cost of production in this country had risen less over the previous 12 months than in any other country except Japan.  Yet the workers were told: &ldquo;Tighten your belts; take it easy; things are very bad.&rdquo;  Then the general election came along and before the general election came the budget.  The same Minister came into this House and literally said it was the best year of our lives&mdash;his own words.  He talked about the wonderful things that had happened and the wonderful country we have.  The election took place.  During this debate numerous references have been made to that election.  I do not want to follow the trails which have been trod by speakers on both sides of the House, particularly on the Fianna Fáil benches, of how they won the election. <Col N="2043" /> Deputy Dowling was one of the people who talked about it.  I will tell Deputy Dowling how they won it.  Seats were won by certain people because they blackguarded everybody.  If they accused the Labour Party, as they have, of telling lies about rents and other costs, we can not alone accuse but prove lies that were told during the election campaign, particularly about the Labour Party.  I regret it was not totally confined to Fianna Fáil.  Some members of Fine Gael apparently caught the contagion and did the very same thing.  Here we are, in the Labour benches, with neither tails nor horns and the election is over. The extraordinary thing about it is that again here this evening an attempt was made to prove that we were fascists and communists at the same time.  The Deputy thought he was back on the election platform.  We have a clean sheet.  If anybody wants to prove we are one or the other then outside this House is the place to make these statements.  It is a bit ridiculous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are to believe the St. Vincent de Paul Society&mdash;and I am sure we must&mdash;an awful lot of people <Col N="2044" /> are in a pretty poor way.  If they have to spend over £500,000, which they get from the public, then somebody is slipping up.  There is no use in saying that they are not doing a good job. They should not have to take from the public and spend the £500,000 on, what they call the destitute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling and others talked about the position of housing in this country and particularly in this city. Would somebody answer the question &mdash;perhaps, the Taoiseach would answer it when he is replying: &ldquo;Has the Dublin Corporation, or what now acts for Dublin Corporation, got down to less than four in a room for priority for housing?  Is there any chance of rehousing even now a man, his wife and three children living in one room, that is, five in a room?  Have you got below that&mdash;because that was the latest I heard, five people living in one room?  Yet Fianna Fáil say there is no housing problem.  As far as the city is concerned, the housing problem has almost been solved overnight.  That is the proof of it.  If there are 6,000 or 7,000 names on the waiting list in Dublin, then all the blowing of these people who talk about the housing problem being solved sounds awfully hollow.  I think Deputy O'Donovan said that if some of the people who were talking were themselves living under some of these conditions, perhaps they would be a lot easier to talk to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also heard the statement by Deputy Dowling, which he must know was untrue, in reference to two motions by this party.  He said the Labour Party had a motion down that workers should be directed from one area to another.  The only suggestion about direction I have heard from anybody is from the Government benches when they suggested two weeks ago that we should go into the Common Market.  When it was pointed out that if we went into the Common Market there might be considerable unemployment in this country the reply we got was that there is no unemploymen in the Common Market.  That suggests that the people who are out of work here, because of the stupidity of the Government, should be able to find <Col N="2045" /> work in Brussels, Berlin or Paris.  That is what Fianna Fáil call not directing workers.</P>
    <P>The second comment Deputy Dowling made here&mdash;I am sorry to have to repeat his name so often: possibly it is because he talked for so long &mdash;was in reference to the Labour Party wanting, according to him, to confiscate land.  This is one of the gimmicks used during the general election.  The Labour Party policy is very clear on this.  We make no apology to anybody for it.  We suggest that where building land is required within the areas of towns and cities it should be possible for the Government to decide that they and local authorities are the only people who would be entitled to get possession of that land.  It is true that we would suggest that these lands should be taken at a fair price. The Government, who state the Constitution would not let them, at present, confiscate the lands&mdash;that is where I expect Deputy Dowling got the word: the Minister for Local Government used it&mdash;have no objection whatever to the local authorities and to various speculators confiscating the wages of the workers who have to pay for these houses when they are built.  People who want to build their own houses are having their money confiscated because it costs as much as £2,000 and £3,000 an acre for a site for a house.  Then we are told by the Government, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot confiscate the land on these people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speculators can still come in and buy up land here if they know the sewer or water main is going in that direction, and then sell it and fleece our public.  That is all right, according to Fianna Fáil.  But, if you try to take it from the speculator and pay him the price he paid for it, then, that is confiscating. That is the social policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Apparently, also there is no objection at all by the Government to the continuance of the system where furnished and unfurnished flats and dwellings are let at astronomical prices.  We are told the marriage rate is increasing slightly.  I do not know how that is.  Newly-weds have to do one of three things&mdash;(1) to go in temporarily with in-laws; (2) to <Col N="2046" /> take a flat and pay £5 to £10 a week for very few amenities or (3) to live in some hovel with the rats&mdash;and I have known of a case over the past few weeks where rats bit children in bed. Then Fianna Fáil tells these people, in effect: &ldquo;It is too bad but there is not enough money to build the necessary houses and therefore you will have to wait your turn.&rdquo;  We are told by the Taoiseach that it is all right as far as emigration is concerned and that things are getting better.  I think the figure he gave us was 12,000.  I will not quarrel with him but I would say 15,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach did.  I think somebody asked him and he said about 12,000.  Perhaps I am wrong but that is my recollection of it. Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the figure of 55,000 people unemployed and 12,000 to 15,000 emigrating and, if he is not satisfied, why did he not say in his opening speech what he proposes to do about it?  Apparently, as long as things can be kept as they are and the <i>status quo</i> can be maintained everything is grand and there is no necessity to try to do anything drastic to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister for Labour is now talking about bringing people back to this country.  I was rather interested to listen to a comment on the radio which Mr. Con Murphy was supposed to have made about certain areas in England where emigration from here has stopped.  The suggestion was that we had nearly reached the stage where nobody would be emigrating and that we were inviting tradesmen and craftsmen and trained people to come back here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach like to comment on what has happened with regard to training people who are unemployed for jobs that are available?  I know that they cannot be instant tradesmen.  They cannot be instant anything. Surely there must be some people who are partly trained and who, with some attention, could be useful in particular jobs.  We are told that there are many jobs for trained people and apparently we are not doing anything <Col N="2047" /> about supplying these.  We now have the gimmick, because it looks well, of inviting people to come back from England.  I would love to see every Irish emigrant in Britain back in this country and I know quite well that if they came back here the Government in England would not be in office for very long after the next election.  At the same time, it would be most unfair to invite these people to come back and then find that there were not any jobs for them, or that the conditions were not what they were told they were, and most certainly that there were no houses for them.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred yesterday to the question of wages.  I was very interested in this part of his speech and I was wondering what exactly he would say.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach did he give full consideration to the statement which he made here yesterday afternoon?  If he did, what did he mean by it?  He talked about 30s and 7 per cent.  In view of the fact that 30/- would be 7 per cent of £21 per week, what happens to the man who has £10, £11, £12, £13, or £14?  What happens to the State employees who this year were promised 25s from June and £1 from October? That would bring them to the magnificent sum of £12 10s a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, is the Taoiseach aware that some of the drainage workers did <Col N="2048" /> not yet get the increase which was granted to them from June and from October?  They have not yet got it and it is now coming up to Christmas.  I know the reason they did not get it. It is that they are only ordinary workers and that the people who are dealing with it do not give two damns.  The Taoiseach knows what happened when the increase was mentioned here last year.  The Minister for Finance announced that he would include £2 million in the Budget for the purpose of increasing the wages of low paid workers. That evening I commented that I considered it would take about £8 million to give any kind of a decent increase at all.  After that the 25s and the £1 were agreed on.  It has now been discovered that the figure is over £7 million.</P>
    <P>Why is it over £7 million?  Because what I suggested would happen did happen.  The Minister for Finance said this was to bring up the low paid workers.  In fact the low paid workers were granted the £1 and the 25s and the £4,500 and the £5,000 and £6,000 people got 4 per cent.  The result is that the low paid workers are worse than they were before they got the £2 5s which was talked of here.</P>
    <P>What will happen in this case?  Will the Taoiseach say it is 7 per cent and that applies to everyone, or will he say it is 7 per cent with a floor of 30s?  If so he should say so because, if he does not, it will be misinterpreted. I am just looking for information.  I understand that these matters were discussed between the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Finance and the trade unions.  I understand that it was made very clear to those two gentlemen by the trade union representatives that, in view of the fact that settlements amounting to far more than this have been agreed on in certain industries, there was not a hope in the world of having this sort of thing accepted even with a floor of 30s. What happened?  The Taoiseach came along yesterday and made this statement. I hope he will be able to clarify it this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Last summer we heard <Col N="2049" /> talk around election time that the Minister for Finance was arranging the increase of £1 and 25s in such a way that for the first time a principle was being established.  He said it would apply to both men and women without any difference.  Yesterday the Taoiseach said this 30s, the 7 per cent, will apply to male adult workers.  That is the expression he used.  Apparently he considers that what the Minister for Finance said was rash and he does not want to continue it, and women workers who, if they gained anything last year, are now back where they started.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that the Agricultural Wages Board are almost certain to interpret his statement in relation to agricultural workers who are at present on the massive wage of £11 12s, and that they will get 15s.  That is 7 per cent. Why make an ambiguous statement like that?  Why put the already awkward industrial relations in a worse position than they were in before?  Does he not realise that, while we hear a lot of talk here about lost man hours due to strikes, most hours are lost because the employer first offers the lowest possible increase he can think of and battles right back until eventually weeks afterwards, and thousands of man hours afterwards, he gives what he knew originally he could give.</P>
      <P>In passing let me say I think it is a shame that in a semi-State body like the ESB there should be a strike for six months involving a small group of employees.  In addition, people who are at present getting the ESB services and who are making no provision for paying for them will be in a rather peculiar position when this strike is settled, as settled it must be.  I am quite sure that the people at the top of the ESB will have them disconnected when they find that the amount they owe is over the usual bill.  These things may be far too low to be understood by the Taoiseach and by members of the Government front bench&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I never yet saw a strike that had not to be settled around the table.  I am taking no sides on this, but I saw a number of people from the unions side on the television and there was nobody there from the ESB to say whether their case was right or wrong. That was the only forum open to the public for consideration of this matter. They were treated with contempt.  If a semi-State body adopt that line, and are allowed to adopt it, I do not know where we are going.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot of talk about the necessity to prepare for free trade. When the arrangements were made for free trade with Britain some years ago we all remember the debate here, and we remember the then Taoiseach complimenting his Ministers on the big fight they made to get the concessions which they got, he said.  We are still looking for them and we have not found them.  Now we find that bit by bit our industrial sales are being taken over by Britain and retail sales of practically everything.  I was interested to hear Deputy Dowling talking about supermarkets and the prices charged for potatoes.  He seemed to forget that when protests were made from this side of the House about the coming in of foreign supermarkets they were pooh-poohed by the Government who talked about their right to come in and set up here.</P>
      <P>Last year on the Taoiseach's Estimate I challenged him to go into any shop either in Dublin or in Cork and ask for a pair of socks, a shirt or any other wearing apparel and I said that if he was not offered three articles of British manufacture before one Irish-made article was produced I would be making a big mistake.  I know what is happening.  Bit by bit the British manufacturers are taking over our home market while we are standing by with our fingers crossed and saying that we will never break an agreement, that we will reduce tariffs by 10 per cent each July until they disappear and the British Government is laughing at us and sticking on an extra 15 per cent and then 10 per cent on our exports. Is that the way in which a Government should carry on?  If an agreement is made why is it not carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> Reference has been made to the EEC and we said before, and I repeat it, that this country will never go into it.  Britain is having second thoughts about it and I am sure the Taoiseach is well aware of that.  If the Government are not, the people are.  We are an agricultural country depending in the main on agricultural produce; we are subsidising the dairying industry to the tune of £31 million.  How are they going to go into what has been described as &ldquo;mountains of butter&rdquo;? The only solution to the mountains of butter is to subsidise the farmers who will slaughter their cows.  What are the Government thinking of?  The signs must be there for them to see.  It must be more evident to them than to us that things are not right in the EEC. Why make the position worse than it is?  The farmer has a small chance of making a living here now but his chances will be much less if he has to compete against what Deputy Donegan said was the might of French agriculture.  Even with the EEC prices the French farmers, particularly the Breton farmers, are dissatisfied with those prices.  Yet we are asked to agree with the Government that we must go in.</P>
    <P>For four or five years Mr. Seán Lemass, when he was Taoiseach, was always saying &ldquo;We will be in by 1970&rdquo;.  When that did not appear to be coming off and when he moved off the present Taoiseach said that it would be 1972.  If the Taoiseach is there in 1972&mdash;I hope he will be in the House but not over there&mdash;I am sure he will be saying &ldquo;1975 or 1976, what does it matter?&rdquo; This matter has been dealt with as a kind of gimmick. Fianna Fáil are very good at finding gimmicks when things start to go wrong.  If the economic position is bad they think of something that is going to happen, something with no relation to the economic position, and they concentrate on the other thing.  So far, unfortunately, the general public seem to have fallen for this trick.  If the Government can they will keep their minds off matters which are really urgent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> They succeeded very well recently in regard to television.  Whether we agree or disagree with the way in which RTE is run it seems the Government have fairly effectively prevented any Labour Deputy or Senator or other speaker appearing on any public opinion programme which is likely to deal with economic affairs.  There was a programme on every month which at different times was called by different names and it was one in which current affairs could be discussed.  The Government now, with or without the aid of Fine Gael, have succeeded in knocking it out and there does not appear to be any other programme to replace it.  They seem to be happy that the people do not get an opportunity to hear the other side of the story.  As somebody pointed out to me, it is not unusual to see four or five Ministers appearing on television on the same evening.</P>
    <P>A matter which has been mentioned here by a number of speakers is the visit of the Springboks.  I believe that the Taoiseach and the President set a good example but it was a pity that they did not go further.  Why did they not decide the match should not be played.</P>

I heard people from both sides saying that these were sportsmen who were coming and not politicians, that they roll around in the mud and that afterwards they are not interested in politics.  If that is so I have a suggestion: why do the Irish Rugby Union not put a coloured man on their team, or why do they not have a coloured referee?  Then we would find out whether they were sportsmen or politicians and it would settle the problem without any difficulty and without having to have a parade.  I am violently anti-apartheid and practically everybody in this country is.</P>

A person can change his religion and he can change his political views but he cannot change the colour of his skin.  There is a difference if you think over it.  I hope that there will be no matches but, if there are, I hope that if there are pickets that they will be peaceful pickets and I hope that nobody will provoke a row.  Pickets in this city and country have been blamed for a lot of things.  I know more about pickets than anybody in the House through my job as a trade union official and before that.  The ideal picket is the one put on by working men for a decent wage and decent conditions.  Other people who picket in the same way start off doing a good job but the bright boys come along and throw stones or they stand in amongst the picket members and throw stones or try to hit a policeman or they succeed in persuading the policeman to have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at somebody who is carrying a placard which they think is objectionable.  They are the people who cause the trouble.  I hope that if there are pickets they will be peaceful and there will be no trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is becoming short and <Col N="2054" /> there are a number of other matters with which I should like to deal.  I want to be as brief as I can.  I hope the Taoiseach will confirm that the Criminal Justice Bill which was before the last Dáil will not be reintroduced in the same form.  I should also like to know if the Taoiseach will be prepared to say that a public inquiry will be held into the circumstances surrounding the collapse today of the new vocational school in Coolock, with the loss of life.  Thirdly, I should like to say that since the election a number of new people have come into this House.  It has been generally commented that the standard of debate has improved.  This I would agree with. I regret, however, the standard of conduct has not improved.  The trouble is, of course, that the example being given by a couple of Government Ministers&mdash;and I am prepared to name them if it is necessary&mdash;has caused uproar in this House on more than one occasion.  It was suggested that something which happened the other night in this House was caused by a group of people in the Labour and Fine Gael benches.  Everyone who was present knows that was not so.  I heard a Member of this House telling a deliberate lie.  I shall not mention his name because if I did the Chairman would make me withdraw the charge.</P>

Is <Col N="2056" /> there a reason for that?  I suggest there is a very good reason for it.  When we asked that there should be a meeting of the Dáil to discuss the north during the height of the troubles there, the Taoiseach said he did not want that because he felt things might be said which would make the position worse.  We felt it was either the Fine Gael Party or ourselves he was talking about.

      <P>We have now come to the end of this session of the Dáil and we are coming towards the end of this debate.  I want to start my remarks by continuing to refer to the problem which Deputy James Tully has just mentioned.  I have been a Member of this House for many years.  Members of my family have been associated with this House since the State was formed and I speak, in relation to what I have to say, out of a deep love for this House and out of a deep sense of the significance this House has and should have in our democracy.  I want to assert, so that there can be no doubt of what I have in mind, that this session has seen on three or four occasions an effort made by certain Fianna Fáil back bench Deputies to stifle free debate in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach is conscious of that.  I suggest a very simple inquiry among Deputies from his own county will reveal the ringleader, and I shall name him, Deputy Flor Crowley.  Deputy Crowley and some other Deputies associated with him have consistently tried on many occasions to prevent Deputies from this side of the House engaging in orderly discussion.  It was in relation to that that I recently made my own personal protest.  I am glad I did, and I hope the <Col N="2057" /> next session of the Dáil will not see a repetition of what has gone on here before.  If we do not have and do not appear to have orderly discussion here, a fair clash of opinion, a fair exchange of views, then people outside will lose any faith, any confidence, in this Dáil and in this Parliament, and democracy itself will suffer.</P>
    <P>We are discussing here the Taoiseach's Estimate, and the Taoiseach as head of the Government has a responsibility to this Dáil that elected him. He also has a responsibility under the Constitution to see not only that things are done properly but also to see that the Government of which he is the head act as a Government.  In his speech yesterday Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick referred to Article 28 of the Constitution. That article lays down that the Government must meet and act as a collective authority.  I should like to ask any fair-minded Deputy in this House, in relation to events we have seen and the things that have been done in recent months, whether it can be truthfully said this Government have been acting collectively and whether they have been fulfilling their constitutional duty to give evidence of collective responsibility? I assert that they have not.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard the Minister for Lands expressing what he said was his own personal view in relation to agriculture, lands and industry.  We heard him saying, on his own personal authority, that the Land Commission structure should be altered, that the agricultural policy should be changed in many ways.  There was a good deal of sense behind what he had to say.  Of course, in saying that, he reversed the Government decision that the Department of Lands was going to Castlebar. He was answered by the Minister for Justice, and very rapidly we had two members of the Government advocating distinctly contrary points of view. The Taoiseach was hauled into that particular debate and he produced the wonderful expression that the Minister for Lands had a very fertile imagination.</P>

      <P>I take the point.  In any event, here is an example of two Government Ministers advocating two contrary points of view.  I have no doubt that each of them held his view sincerely but why did they not thrash it out in the council chamber and decide there what should be done and then let the appropriate Minister or the Taoiseach speak for the Government? Certainly, it caused confusion in Castlebar and it caused confusion throughout the country.  Nobody knows what the proper land policy is and nobody knows what the object of the agricultural policy is because two Ministers have taken contrary points of view.</P>
      <P>Every time the Minister for Local Government speaks he puts his foot into whatever he is saying.  At the most inauspicious times he produces the most old-fashioned views on this country, on the problem of Partition and on the question of the reunion of Ireland.  He apparently knows no laws. He is not guided by regard for his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs or for his leader the Taoiseach. He says what he has to say merely for the sake of saying it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;did someone think I had forgotten him?&mdash;has flatly contradicted the Taoiseach.  He has made it quite clear that he advocates and believes in a policy which has been disowned and repudiated by the Taoiseach, but still he is Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, although twice&mdash;I think it is without precedent&mdash;the leader of the Government has had to stand up here and retract statements made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. One might ask why he is still in the Government and I suggest the reason is that the Taoiseach is afraid to put him out.  He is afraid he would organise outside the Government and cause embarrassment to the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I sympathise with the Taoiseach in the situation in which he finds himself.  One of his own colleagues has deliberately advocated the use of force, if circumstances require such force, in relation to Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22nd October of this year and <Col N="2059" /> on the days following the Taoiseach's speech in Tralee I thought we had at last achieved something worthwhile in this country.  I thought it had been accepted by everybody, including the backwoodsmen of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the reunion of Ireland was not worth the spilling of one drop of Irish blood.  I thought it was settled and accepted that the reunion of this country could only be achieved by securing for that point of view a majority of those who, at the moment, are separated from us.  That is what the Taoiseach said and it was printed in a special booklet which was distributed throughout this country and the world. Obviously, Deputy Blaney, the man who did not take any part in the debate on Northern Ireland in this House, did not agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  There is a serious principle involved here.  We are or should be in this House seriously concerned with achieving, in the interests of our country, the means whereby all of us who live on this island can accept and take responsibility for the future of this island.  The Taoiseach has said, sincerely and honestly, that we will not achieve that if we have to fight to do it.  We will merely be creating a division more serious.  We will, perhaps, create a division that will last much longer.  We have got to achieve reunification by agreement but the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries by everything he has said and by everything he has done has brought insecurity in relation to accepted State policy. He has caused difficulty and trouble and he has made the job of decent Irishmen like John Hume and Ivan <Col N="2060" /> Cooper ten times worse.  Does everybody not know that after Deputy Blaney's speech last week, in relation to the use of force, an apparent division, an apparent crack, an apparent coming apart of the Unionist Party disappeared?  I would not be surprised if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland sent Deputy Blaney a telegram saying: &ldquo;Thanks, Neil, you are doing well for us&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not mind what problems the Taoiseach may have in his Party but I am concerned with the fact that he is the trustee to the people of this country under the Constitution and it is his duty as trustee to see that collective responsibility is observed by his Government. Where this collective responsibility, in a matter of outstanding importance, is defied, broken and breached by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries I want to know what action the Taoiseach proposes to take. The only action he should take in the interests of the country and in the interests of democracy is to say to the Minister &ldquo;Out you get&rdquo;.  He should withdraw his assignment as a Minister of State but, of course, this will not be done.  In the new year we will have further retractions by the Taoiseach of further speeches by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The credibility gap, in relation to who speaks for the Government of this country, is going to grow wider and wider.</P>
      <P>May I end in relation to this subject by saying that the people of this country are entitled to know that when Government policy is stated by the head of the Government it will remain Government policy unless it is altered or reversed by the Government themselves? Until that is not only accepted, but seen to be done, there will always remain a question-mark as to what is going on behind the scenes and as to who, in relation to Partition, speaks for the Government.</P>

      <P>There will always be a question-mark as to what <Col N="2061" /> exactly is Government policy on these important matters.  Deputy FitzGerald has already raised the particular matter to which I intend to refer now.  On 12th November last Deputy L'Estrange asked the Taoiseach &ldquo;whether any directorships or other positions in any business or other concern are held by Government Ministers; and, if so, if he will state their nature&rdquo; and the Taoiseach replied:</P>
      <P>No Minister holds any position that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.</P>
      <P>Some time later I tabled a question to the Taoiseach asking whether, in view of the fact that the Minister for Justice was a practising solicitor, and had continued to practise after his appointment as Minister, the Taoiseach regarded him as a proper person to continue in membership of the Government. That question was ruled out of order because it was regarded as repetition.  I, therefore, have to raise it now.</P>
      <P>The fact is that a member of the Government, a Minister of State, since his appointment to office, has continued to pursue his profession and to act as a solicitor in competition with other solicitors.  I am sure he is both an effective and an efficient solicitor and the only question I want to raise is whether such conduct is appropriate.  We have heard a great deal about law reform.  We have been told by the Minister concerned of new legislation.  We have been told of changes in the law in relation to landlord and tenant.  There may be many other changes proposed or considered. To all these changes, this practising solicitor is privy and a party.</P>
      <P>A Minister of State some years ago referred to &ldquo;low standards in high places&rdquo;.  That Minister is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  On his appointment as a member of the Government he was a practising solicitor. On his appointment, he sold his practice&mdash;lock, stock and barrel&mdash;and he cut himself off from the practice he had built up.  He was certainly applying proper standards to the high place to which he had been appointed by his Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should there be a different standard, not for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Local Government, or the Minister for Agriculture, but for the Minister for Justice, who, being a Member of the Government practises in the courts of this country as a solicitor? Maybe I am unduly sensitive in these matters, but it would strike me as inappropriate if I were asked to hold a brief in the High Court and I saw that my junior was &ldquo;Mr. J. Lynch, B.L.&rdquo;.  It would be regarded as a bit absurd or strange, to say the least of it, were the Taoiseach to continue to practise his profession, an honourable profession, as a lawyer.  The Taoiseach, of course, would not do that and it is something that should not be done by any person with a sense of responsibility and integrity.</P>
      <P>Membership of Government involves considerable responsibility.  It involves high standards.  The remuneration may not be tremendous.  I do not know what it is now but, big or small, a member of the Government should be a whole-time servant of the people.  I hope the Taoiseach can give us his views on this.</P>
      <P>May I say that when this matter was raised here and the Minister for Justice was taxed with it, he gave Dáil Éireann an example of clowning that has rarely been surpassed?  He indulged in a two-day marathon, in the course of which he threw mud and displayed malice towards all.  Figuratively speaking, he heaved a battering ram at all his special and particular hates.  In the course of that he referred to Deputy Sweetman.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance in the Government of which I was a member.  He also was a practising solicitor.  I assert that never once, from the date of his appointment, did Deputy Sweetman use his office, earn any fees, or have anything to do with the practice of his profession as a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of Deputy O'Donnell, who was also a member of the Government.  He entered into a partnership with another solicitor and he handed his practice over during that time to that partner.  But, here, we <Col N="2063" /> have a member of the Government, who is the sole member in a solicitor's office and who carries on as Minister for Justice simultaneously, as if this was his job and being Minister was just a nice, pleasant &ldquo;mixer&rdquo; in association with the practice of his profession.  I should like to ascertain the Taoiseach's views on that.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to any other member of the Government, but it would strike me as a sorry thing if the Minister for Justice, while he was Minister for Lands, also practised as a solicitor. I do not know whether he did.  I assume he did.  Certainly that does not appear to me to be the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>Might I also ask the Taoiseach to give Dáil Éireann some information with regard to the withdrawal of the prosecution in a particular case in Cork.  This was mentioned some time ago in this House.  I do not know anything about the details, but I do know that a prosecution pending before a district justice in Cork was withdrawn. On the day on which the case was to proceed, senior and junior counsel, on behalf of the Attorney-General, appeared in the district court and informed the district justice that the prosecution was proceeding no further. The district justice, having asked for an explanation, was told that no reason would be advanced.  There may have been&mdash;I am sure there were&mdash;bona fide reasons why the prosecution did not proceed but, in the interests of the administration of justice, the reasons should, I think, have been stated in court.  Since that was not done, and since queries have been raised in the local press, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, and in other national newspapers, I should like to ask the Taoiseach, if he has the information and, if it is possible to give it, to give it to this House.</P>

      <P>A word or two now about the present economic situation: it appears that we are now in the middle of a vicious and dangerous inflation which clearly threatens the stability and security of our economy and the wellbeing and the way of life of thousands of decent people.  I regret to have to say that I believe that this <Col N="2064" /> has come about because the Taoiseach and his Ministers within the past 12 months have failed utterly to face up to their responsibilities and preferred to play politics with the national finances.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach in what was styled as a &ldquo;warning about inflation&rdquo; in this morning's newspapers referred to the great increase in consumption as evidenced by the rise in the index of retail sales of plus 9 per cent in value terms for the first quarter of this year and plus 13 per cent in value terms for the second quarter. The Taoiseach, with a slight change of figures, might well have been quoting himself on 5th November last year when he brought in the Supplementary Budget.  He then referred to the &ldquo;fast rising imports this year directly due to a strong upsurge in personal consumption&rdquo;. He said that retail sales, turnover tax receipts and registration of new motor cars all provided evidence of a significant increase in personal consumption and suggested that the pace of the increase was accelerating. He went on:</P>
      <P>As compared with last year, the volume of retail sales, for example, was up this year by 1¼ per cent, 4½ per cent and 6½ per cent in the first quarter, the second quarter and the month of July respectively.</P>
      <P>Last year because of an increase of 1½ per cent and 4½ per cent the Taoiseach said that the situation was serious and justified an increase in taxation of £19 million.  At that time he thought the balance of payments would be £15 million and he proceeded to take action.  That is only a little more than 12 months ago so that last year the Taoiseach and the Government were on notice, as he said himself, that things could go wrong in 1969.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>We will deserve best to retain the confidence of the people by showing in the coming months both courage and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  Taxation of £19 million was imposed last November.  Then in January there was a special Government announcement that wage increases should be limited to 4 per cent. Then we had the maintenance men's <Col N="2065" /> strike settlement which provided for a figure of 20 per cent.  Following that settlement it was abundantly clear that the economy was facing ugly and formidable difficulties.  Consumption rose steeply.  The balance of payments deficit really began to go wrong.  The Economic and Social Research Institute forecast a balance of payments deficit at that time of £50 million for this year.  In those circumstances of course, the Minister for Finance went on television on 18th March and he gave a dramatic performance.  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>These are serious times.  Calm, responsible leadership by those who wield power in the community and the exercise of restaint everywhere is what we need....  The Government have a fundamental responsibility to keep our money sound, to maintain its value and to make sure that the living standards of our people are not destroyed by inflation.</P>
    <P>Having referred to the difficulties of the budgetary situation which was then developing and to the fact that in 1968 things had gone against us with a balance of payments deficit of £20 million he warned that the balance of payments deficit in 1969 at the very best could be as high as £50 million.  Then he warned:</P>
    <P>The choice before us is simple: either reason is restored in the field of incomes or we face a future that may include a tough Budget, a cutback on social spending, a credit squeeze, import restrictions and all the hardships and unemployment that these entail.</P>
    <P>Strong and courageous words indicative of a Minister for Finance's concern with the facts of an economic situation. What happened?  One would expect that following that television appearance a Government who knew the score and were aware of the danger and who must have been conscious that the savings of the thrifty and hardworking citizens were likely to be eroded and destroyed by rising prices, would take appropriate measures at that early stage to settle the economy, cut out these incipient difficulties and put everything on the correct course. <Col N="2066" /> No. Seven weeks passed and on May 7, the Minister for Finance brought in a Budget which I can most simply describe by saying he made an attempt in it to give something to everybody, farmers, businessmen, workers, old age pensioners, widows and orphans and even to writers, sculptors and artists. He went around like a ministerial Santa Claus with a bag of presents for the people.</P>
    <P>Of course everybody fell for the trick.  A spending spree began and galloping inflation really got under way. Consumer spending soared by 13 per cent: prices began to shoot upwards and our balance of payments deficit surged to an estimated figure of £17 million.  Was this a display by a Government who were going to maintain the confidence of the people by showing both courage and responsibility? Or was it a display of political expediency by a political party that wanted to snatch a quick victory in a general election?  I assert that is what it was, that in May of this year the Taoiseach and his Ministers knew what was necessary, knew what they had to do but knew that if they did it the effect would last throughout the summer into the autumn.  They knew that if they had to fight an election either in June or October it would be the same and so they deliberately acted contrary to the national interest, brought in a Budget which was inappropriate and then dissolved the Dáil and went to the country.</P>
    <P>Now we are face to face with uncontrolled inflation and the situation in which the big spenders are spending the savings of the small people, a situation in which prices have risen beyond control and the value of money has been depreciated.  Our external assets, the Minister for Finance says, have depreciated only slightly.  Of course that is so, because into the country in the past year has come an inflow of foreign capital.  But what kind of capital is it You can go around this city to any of the non-associated banks and banking concerns and borrow money at 14 per cent to indulge in speculation.  That is the kind of money that is coming in at the moment, hot money, slush money.  It is papering over an ugly economic situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> What would happen if this inflow of foreign capital ceased?  Where, then, would we be?  The jobs and the way of work and the livelihood of struggling families in this country would disappear. I charge this Government, everyone of them, with direct responsibility for this situation by failing to display the kind of courage and responsibility which the Taoiseach talked about last year, by preferring to play in a cynical way the political game in this country.  They ran away from their responsibilities, they allowed inflation to get out of control.  They have shaken the confidence that should exist in our economy and then we had the Taoiseach coming in yesterday and warning the people about inflation.  He and his Government have been warned time and time again.  I will not refer to them but there is the Central Bank Report in September, the Quarterly Review from the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>
    <P>Every indicator, every observer, every writer has been warning these gentlemen of the dangers that they were letting loose on the livelihood, not of them, but of ordinary struggling people in this country, the workers, the ordinary people, thrifty and responsible, who have saved and who have tried to make a decent way of life. Nothing was done.  Prices have risen. Money has fallen in every possible way.  In the last six or eight months this economy, this State, has been headed straight for the rocks and nothing was done.  We had cavorting Ministers for Local Government talking about Partition and fighting Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries organising private armies.  We had all this sort of rubbish and the Taoiseach sitting there with folded arms doing nothing. Yesterday he said the situation is dangerous, difficult, the wage increase now must not be more than 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Where has the Taoiseach been in the last two months?  Does he not know that negotiations have been going on affecting almost every industry, that 20 per cent has already been granted and agreed in many respects?  There is not a chance of a snowball in hell of getting agreement in relation to 7 per <Col N="2068" /> cent.  There might have been if the Government had been responsible. There might have been if the Government had been courageous.  There might have been if somebody had done something about prices, if somebody had done something to control the inflation. Now, like so often happened before with members of a Fianna Fáil Government, when the spending spree is over and the bills have to be paid, they want to hand the check to the working people of this country.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say it, a Cheann Comhairle, but it is true, that damage has been done and I do not believe that it is retrievable at the moment.  I believe we are facing a serious and dangerous year ahead and every worker who loses a job, every pensioner who feels the pinch of the pension being depreciated, can blame this Government and every member of it for running away from their responsibilities, for failing to take appropriate action in the spring of this year.  They might not have won the election; they might have lost some seats but, at least, if they went into Opposition then they could have gone out conscious of the fact that they had shown courage and responsibility.  That was not to count. For the purpose of getting, by a political false pretence, an election victory, there was the absurd crisis of March 18th being turned into instant sunshine on May 7th.</P>
    <P>Here we have them now talking about their responsibility and sense of purpose.  The plain fact is that for the last six or seven years we have had a repetition time and time again, as has been pointed out earlier by Deputy Cosgrave, of stop-go, stop-go, restraint, inflation, deflation, and the one constant feature of these periodical ups and downs has been Fianna Fáil still there and growing unemployment.</P>

      <P>Now we are going to have a renewed concern with regard to prices and incomes.  What have the Government been doing about prices and incomes for the last eight or nine years?  Just look at the ESB.  The Taoiseach knows all about it, he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> Did he ever hear of the Fogarty Report?  Was anything done about that?  What is being done about industrial relations in our own State concerns? Nothing whatsoever is being done or ever will be done but when anarchy faces the Government, when difficulties are there, then there is great concern about having to do something about industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that this Government have not in recent years faced up to their responsibilities.  They have been sitting there coasting from crisis to crisis hoping that on the night everything will turn out well.  There has been no plan, no policy.  Talk about economic management, take the Devlin Report which has been referred to already.  They were not even capable of coming to a decision on the Devlin Report.  It has to be sent along to be read by all the civil servants in all the various Departments.  This is the Government that are responsible at this stage for the destinies of this nation, a Government on which the future of every family in this land depends.  I do not believe they are competent.  I do not believe they are capable.  I do not believe they are a government.  I believe they are a group of individuals all speaking with different tongues to the dissatisfaction and trouble of us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that we on these benches have heard Deputy O'Higgins speak exactly in that strain in every economic debate since he became shadow Minister for Finance and before it.  He has spoken about the dangers of inflation, lack of responsibility of the Government, neglect to face up to responsibilities, and so on.  I want to tell Deputy O'Higgins and his colleagues that it is precisely because he and his colleagues did not face up to their responsibilities when they had the opportunity that they are on that side of the House.  I have heard this same speech before each of the last three general elections. I have heard of this alleged failure to face up to responsibilities, this allegation of neglect, incapacity.  Nevertheless, the people continued to show their trust in this Government and not in the Fine Gael Party or in the Labour <Col N="2070" /> Party, because they knew that when they gave them that trust they reneged it and when responsibilities showed themselves they ran away from them.</P>
      <P>I want, Sir, to start by a number of references to what I said yesterday about prices and incomes.  When I used the figure 7 per cent I did so advisedly and I related 7 per cent to the average industrial worker's wage being about £21 10s which would give roughly 30/-.  I want to say at the outset that I put forward this proposition in the interests of the workers themselves and of the economy of the country and in doing so I pointed out what had happened this year and in the previous year.  Let me give a simple example.  If productivity goes up by 4 per cent and wages go up by 10 per cent then inevitably prices will go up by the simple subtraction figure of 6 per cent.  Already, price rises are outstripping wage increases.  The only safe way to have wage increases in this country is to relate them as near as we can to productivity.  It is in the interests of the workers themselves that I have put forward this proposition.  If we continue to let increased wages outstrip productivity, causing, in turn, increased prices, then this inflationary trend is bound to continue.  What I propose is not only in the interests of the workers themselves; not only in the interests of their job security; not only in the interests of the economy of the country but in the interests of the thousands more who are seeking employment in Ireland&mdash; and, thanks be to God, in the past couple of years, we have been able to offer increased employment to about 10,000 or 11,000 extra people annually.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with as many matters as I can.  May I say, at the outset, that I was surprised at the absence of contribution on economic matters in this debate by the Opposition and, more particularly, by the members of the Labour Party.  I think Deputy O'Donovan was the only one who in any way dealt with the subject. Through the Whips, the Labour Party had conveyed to me that they wanted a debate on economic matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that the Opposition Deputies did not deal at any length with the economic situation in the country because obviously they are concerned only with the politics of failure.  Had the figures I gave yesterday indicated failure on the part of the Government to advance the economy then we would have had plenty of comment and contributions on that matter.  Deputy Corish says he does not like statistics but if the statistics suited his book, then he would attack the Government on these statistics.</P>

      <P>I have much to deal with in the time available to me.  I was saying, in relation to the proposed federal solution, that it had been put forward many times over the past 40 <Col N="2074" /> or 50 years.  I admitted candidly that I had no ready-made solution for Partition. I said that, within the federal solution, there may be steps taken, intermediate stages, that could be discussed. If anybody has a solution to this problem then I would be the first one to accord him the highest honour we could bestow.  I am not a monarchist but I would put a crown on him as King of Ireland, if I could.</P>
      <P>I suggested in my second reference to it here in the House that we might conceive of a situation where people in the Six Counties, the North of Ireland, Northern Ireland, whatever term you use, could maintain economic and financial links with Britain and that we would try to build up our economy here in the meantime so as to even up standards and also try to make as much progress as possible to eliminate the barriers of suspicion so that ultimately, standards being equal on both sides, we could have a situation that would be a prelude to the coming together of all our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I have not any precise remedy.  I have, however, initiated some working documents on the proposition.  They are only suggestions.  They could be amended or extended in the course of negotiations, when these negotiations would take place.  I have not in any way finalised my views.  The Government have not considered them yet to any extent. Nevertheless the work is going on to see in what way we could put up some kind of a structure, to see what we could do in order to move towards this re-unification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully recognise in the meantime that there are many difficulties and many psychological aspects in this problem.  We must try first of all to win the confidence and understanding of all the people in the Six Counties. Every effort should be made to try and promote co-operation and understanding between the majority and the minority in the north and in any way we can down here to promote the same kind of co-operation and understanding between people on both sides of the Border, recognising that there are <Col N="2075" /> genuine apprehensions, not just in the case of the majority in the Six Counties, but genuine apprehensions perhaps in many other cases as well.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to pursue co-operation on practical matters that would inure to the benefit of people not only north but south of the Border as well, the people of all Ireland.  I say &ldquo;pursue&rdquo; advisedly because this practical co-operation is not new.  There was in one of the inter-party Governments some legislative co-operation in connection with the Great Northern Railway. There were more particularly, in the term of office of my predecessor, more practical examples of co-operation in these areas.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I promoted the idea of giving certain tariff concessions over and above those that were provided for in the Anglo-Irish trade agreements to genuine Six County manufacturing firms.  Representatives of these firms came to the Department of Industry and Commerce to discuss their problems with officials in that Department and, in fact, some reasonable but not spectacular concessions were given tariff-wise and quantity-wise to these firms.</P>
    <P>When I mooted that suggestion at one time&mdash;and I think this is a fact that might as well be known&mdash;I was interviewed by a BBC commentator from Belfast, a man whose name I think was Flackes.  He asked me would I be prepared to discuss these concessions with the Northern Minister of Commerce, Mr. Faulkner, and I said I would.  He went back to Belfast and told Mr. Faulkner what I said and Mr. Faulkner said he likewise would be prepared to discuss the extension of these tariffs with me.</P>
    <P>About that time&mdash;I did not know it then&mdash;there had been certain contacts made between my predecessor, Mr. Seán Lemass, and the then Prime Minister of Stormont, Captain O'Neill.  I was told this meeting was about to take place and it was suggested to me that my meeting with Mr. Faulkner might be deferred.  I did, in fact, defer my meeting with Mr. Faulkner but, as a <Col N="2076" /> result of the meeting between the two Prime Ministers, an impetus was given to the kind of practical co-operation that was commenced before that.  That impetus was carried further by me.</P>
    <P>I am still prepared to pursue any avenue of practical co-operation again on matters that will benefit people in both parts of the country.  I can say without any tongue in cheek, or without any hint of evasion, or the suppression of any ambition, that I do so and will continue to do so with a view to the ultimate reunification of this country.</P>

      <P>Some references were made to the Common Market, more particularly by Deputy Tully. He, apparently speaking on behalf of the Labour Party generally, and as I understand Labour Party policy, rejects any idea of our entering the Common Market.  I heard Deputy O'Donovan speaking some time before him and he put forward the same point of view. They spoke about the protection of our industries and the maintenance of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest that, unless we go along with this movement of entering trade blocs, where trade barriers are being brought down, obviously giving a greater degree of competition amongst firms within these blocs, we will have to find some alternative.  We cannot live in economic isolation.  I should like to ask the Labour Party what they propose.  What is their alternative? They have never put one forward that I heard of.  They must realise that, if we are to stay out of this movement towards freer trade, we will be faced with barriers in every part of the <Col N="2077" /> world that our protective industries will find it very difficult to get over.</P>
    <P>There is now, following the Hague summit conference of the six member States of the European Economic Community, a definite prospect of negotiations being opened by the end of June.  The communiqué issued after the conference states that the member States have agreed that negotiations should be opened up with the applicants and that the Six should undertake as quickly as possible the essential preparatory work.  After that conference, the representatives of the member States indicated that they expect this preparatory work to be completed within the first half of 1970, and that negotiations could be under way by 1st July, 1970.</P>
    <P>As I think the House is aware, this work has already started.  The meeting of the EEC Council of Ministers on 8th December last, agreed on a list of points on which a common position must be established among the member States before negotiations begin. Deputy Corish mentioned in relation to these negotiations some remark he attributed to the Minister for External Affairs that British negotiations would be long and difficult&mdash;he might have used only one adjective but it does not matter&mdash;and that Irish negotiations would be short and easy.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether he properly interpreted the Minister, but it is well realised that, because of the importance of the specifically British problems in relation to entry, it is expected that the negotiations with the United Kingdom will be more difficult and much longer and that there will, perhaps, be more meetings.  When they made their report not so long ago to the Council of Ministers about the pattern of negotiations the commission acknowledged that fact but did say&mdash; and this is what we have been looking for&mdash;that negotiations ought to open simultaneously and terminate simultaneously and that, in between, on any matters that are common to the other member countries, matters which Britain will be negotiating with either the Commission or the representatives of the Council of Ministers, on any matters that will be common to the <Col N="2078" /> other applicant countries, or would be of interest to them, there should be liaison and consultation between these other member countries as well.  What is important and what we have tried to establish is that ultimately entry, if entry can be attained, will be attained simultaneously by ourselves and Britain and, of course, the two other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>Speaking about international relations Deputy Cosgrave referred to the free trade area agreement and the breach of that agreement which he alleged the British Government committed by the imposition of the special import deposit.  We recognise that this is technically a breach of the terms of the agreement but the British Government under that agreement, as we would be, are entitled to impose quantitative restrictions in the event of balance of payments problems arising for them.  Balance of payments problems did arise for them and had they imposed quantitative restrictions under the terms of the agreement then there is no way in which we could have overcome these restrictions and maintained the level of our industrial exports and, indeed perhaps, our agricultural exports, to the British market.  The fact that they imposed the import deposit obligation enabled us, admittedly at some cost to the Exchequer, to surmount successfully this barrier, or what otherwise would have been a barrier to the entry of Irish goods to Britain. The success of these measures has imposed this Exchequer obligation on us and indeed in the current round of ministerial talks our Ministers are insisting that this factor should be taken into account in reviewing the operations of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the current meetings were only held on one day and they will be resumed early in the New Year.  I come now to Deputy O'Brien who suggested that I should deal with housing.

      <P>Speaking in general &mdash;I will not leave it all to Deputy Dowling&mdash;the House will be aware that in 1964 we put forward a White Paper which tried to anticipate what the housing needs would be and projected how we could, using all our resources wisely, reach the situation in 1970 where we might have between 12,000 and 14,000 new houses annually.  At the end of March, 1969, we had already passed the 12,000 mark and indeed we had passed the 13,000 mark and we were well on the way&mdash;and this is a target I am proud to be able to say we have reached&mdash;of reaching the target of 14,000 in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is not all.  As the House is aware, another White Paper has since been published and it makes even greater projections.  I want to assure the parties opposite, the Labour Party in particular, that when we talk about projections we talk realistically about them.  We do not like to put forward figures just for the sake of cutting a dash, figures that we might not be able to reach.  We have to take account not only of the needs but of all our resources, physical and financial. I can assure the House, and indeed I can assure everyone who is genuinely and objectively concerned with this problem, that every £ of capital that we can spare is being allocated to housing.  If we had some fairy godmother or some philanthropist who could offer us £10 million more a year <Col N="2080" /> free I doubt, having regard to our physical resources, having regard to the limit of skilled workers that we have, if we could use that £10 million.  We must recognise that it takes more than money to provide houses; it takes skilled men and unskilled men.</P>

In regard to <Col N="2081" /> housing, even though I am Taoiseach and some people suggest that it is not expected of me, I still visit my constituents at week-ends, not every weekend. When I came into Dáil Éireann first I used see them in Cork every Saturday.  That was at the end of the war, admittedly, when the building momentum was just being taken up again, and seven out of ten people that I met were looking for houses. Now the proportion is that there is hardly one out of ten but there are about three or four out of ten who are looking for transfers from good houses in one area to more desirable areas from their point of view. Deputies will have read with interest the report of the Cork city manager to members of the corporation that a very high percentage of those on the waiting list were refusing offers of houses because they preferred offers in other areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about the Department of Physical Planning.  I answered a question about this some weeks ago as to why I had not proceeded with it at this stage.  It is a fair question, but when I decided to set up a Department of Physical Planning and Construction, I was not aware then, even though I tried to find out, what the recommendations of the Devlin Committee would be.  It was not available. At the time my idea was that since our resources generally, financially and physically, were limited, it would be a good idea to try to co-ordinate all our building activities, road construction, hospital building, factory building and any other public building of that kind.  The Devlin Committee have since recommended almost the direct contrary. <Col N="2082" /> They have recommended that the Office of Public Works might cease as a building agency and that the building efforts of each Department which has building responsibilities, Agriculture, Local Government, Health, Education and so on, would be confined to that Department.</P>
    <P>Naturally this report by the Devlin Committee was carefully considered.  I want my view considered against the recommendation of the Devlin Committee, but I still adhere to my view.  I think mine is right, but I want to make sure, before I make another move, that I am absolutely right and that I should not do anything else.

This brings me to the forthcoming visit of the Springbooks rugby team.  I was invited in my capacity as Taoiseach.  I declined the invitation. Our views about apartheid and about discrimination in any form are well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I just declined.  I gave my reasons verbally to an officer of the IRFU.  Incidentally the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was invited, not as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but in his capacity as President of the Football Association <Col N="2083" /> of Ireland.  I want to make that clear, because some questions were asked about it.  I was asked a question in the Dáil and I was asked supplementary questions, and some of the answers to the supplementary questions were misinterpreted and subsequently misused by some of those people who are pursuing this protest.  In reply to a question by Deputy Desmond about selection of teams on a racial basis, I said I abhorred the selection of teams on that basis.  I did not abhor anybody or anything else.  I said I abhorred selection of teams on a racial basis, and I shall always stand up for selection on merit.  Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien asked what about the reception of racially selected teams?  I said I was not receiving them.  I was reported the next day as having snubbed the Springboks. I want to be quite fair to them and to myself.  I said I was not asked to receive them.  Indeed, I was never asked in my present capacity or any other capacity to receive a visiting rugby team.</P>
      <P>The Irish Rugby Football Union are pursuing their lawful activities.  They arranged for this match and invited the Springboks to come here.  They are entitled in a free country to select an international team to play whatever team they like.  I recognise that people are entitled to protest because of their deeply felt convictions about apartheid, but let us hope these people who protest will recognise that other people have rights as well.  Let us hope, above all, that whatever protest takes place will be peaceful.</P>
      <P>I was asked a couple of questions about the Minister for Justice and his alleged practice as a solicitor.  I raised this matter with the Minister and I received this reply from his office:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister is the owner of the firm bearing his name.  The firm employs a solicitor and, in accordance with the rules of the Incorporated Law Society, the name of the solicitor appears on the firm's letterhead. The solicitor now employed is Mr. R. O'Connor, who was appointed recently.  Mr. O'Connor's predecessor, a woman, resigned to get married in August.  The Minister <Col N="2084" /> did not, as alleged in the Dáil, appear in the High Court in Galway to instruct Counsel.  The instructions were given by two Solicitors, who have authorised him to disclose that fact publicly.  Their names are P. J. McEllin, Solicitor, Claremorris, and W. B. Gavin, Solicitor, Galway.  The Minister was only in Galway for about three hours on the Monday in question and left at lunchtime for Dublin.  The only case that was contested from the Minister's firm went on before the Court on Tuesday (when the Minister was in fact in Dublin).  It was settled on Tuesday morning and W. B. Gavin, Solicitor, instructed Counsel on behalf of Michael Moran and Company. Neither has the Minister appeared in court on any other occasion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept that from the Minister</P>

      <P>I have very few minutes left, and again I did not interrupt anybody, no matter what they said, for me or against me.  I listened quietly to Deputy Tully opening a tirade on me, fair enough it was hard hitting stuff.  I am not hitting anybody; I am telling the facts as I know them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been criticised for making these suggestions.  He spoke in Galway on 8th November on the subject, &ldquo;The Law of Ireland in the Future&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
      <P>The idea of a unified profession should get far more thought in this country, and I believe that unification should be our ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>This was said in the context of the previous sentence he uttered, that lawyers of one member state of the Common Market can practise in the courts of any other State.  He mentioned that in Germany there was only a unified profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position will be.  The legal profession itself recognise that its system of practice is not perfect.  Even if it were perfect, most old systems, as this is, would become imperfect by evolution of time in any event.  I want to assure the legal profession, whatever changes will become or <Col N="2086" /> have become necessary, that any changes will only be made after full consultation with them.</P>
    <P>Reference has recently been made in this House to particular decisions in court and, while anything that happens in any part of this country is a subject matter for comment, and, if necessary, debate in this House, I think we should try to refrain as much as we can from discussing decisions made by impartial judges.  A reference was made to a court decision in a traffic accident in County Laois&mdash;I know nothing about the facts, but I think we should try to refrain from references to these decisions.  We know nothing of the facts and I think we would object if members of the judiciary started commenting on what we said and did in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to deal very quickly with the case in Cork.  I heard about that case, without knowing anything about the facts, from the Fianna Fáil director of elections some days before the election came up.  He told me that the party in Cork was concerned about the suggestion that this case was not being prosecuted.  I heard that there were four, five or six youths involved&mdash;I forget exactly how many&mdash;who were alleged to have committed a series of offences, involving joy rides in cars over a period of some months in August, September and October of 1968.  In the course of these jaunts they stole small sums of money, including sums like 1/8 from a charity box in a church.  They were charged with a big number of offences representing the same incidents.  The charges in all amounted to 208 and the total amount of money involved was £100.  The mother of one young fellow discovered he had been engaged in this, and his father questioned him and extracted a full confession from him.  I believe he literally frogmarched the boy to the Garda station and made him repeat to the Garda Síochána the statement he had given to him implicating the boy's colleagues.  As I have said, the amount involved was about £100 and the parents of the boys paid back the money.  The Attorney-General had doubts about the validity of the statement as admissible evidence.  I told <Col N="2087" /> the Attorney-General that whatever doubts he had, I for one, would like to see the case go on and justice be done and be seen to be done.  However, I am not the man to tell the Attorney-General his business.  He stated his view of the case and decided to enter a <i>nolle prosequi.</i> I would like to deal with that at greater length, but unfortunately I cannot.</P>

I did not and still do not know the name of the man.  The implication was that because it was in my constituency I had something to do with it.  No member of my party had anything whatsoever to do with it, and, in fact, until the matter was a <i>fait accompli,</i> knew nothing about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion for the setting up of the Tribunal investigating the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme has now been passed by both Houses.  I have had consultation with the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court, and I have been able to procure the services of the following judges: The Honourable Mr. Justice Seán Butler, a Judge of the High Court, as chairman; The Honourable Mr. Justice Denis Pingle, a Judge of the High Court; and the President of the District Court, Mr. Justice Cathal <Col N="2088" /> O'Flynn.  In case there is any comment on the absence of a Supreme Court Judge, I was unable to procure the services of one for a number of reasons. I was asked by the President of the Circuit Court specifically not to appoint a Circuit Court Judge, and there were genuine reasons for not doing this.  I think we have an impartial and competent Tribunal.  The appointments will be notified formally.</P>
    <P>I would like to say of Deputy Corry that no better man than he could be appointed to the Sugar Company.  I do not believe there is a man in Ireland who knows more about beet growing and the sugar industry than Deputy Corry.

I resent and reject the suggestion of Deputy O'Higgins that the fault is on our side.  The fault is on all sides.  I shall not attribute blame to anybody or identify people.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to enter into any discussion with the leaders of the other parties to ensure as far as I can that our debates will be conducted in future in an orderly way, as this debate has been, by and large.  I think Deputies are entitled to commendation for that.</P>
      <P>I want to wish all Members a happy Christmas.  I make every allowance for the fact that the Fine Gael Members opposite are still suffering from the aftermath of their recent earth tremors.
