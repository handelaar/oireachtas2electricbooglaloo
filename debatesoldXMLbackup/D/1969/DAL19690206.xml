      <P>When progress was reported last night I was outlining some of the riduculous things that my colleague, Deputy Clinton, had said about the necessary rearrangement of the County Dublin constituencies.  I pointed out that even Deputy Clinton must know that the area he suggested should comprise the North County Dublin constituency would barely be sufficient to justify two seats under the existing constitutional provisions.  I pointed out that even if North County Dublin were to be a three-seat constituency it would still be unavoidable that some population would have to be taken from the No. 3 electoral area. So that these delusions of persecution from which Deputy Clinton is suffering are completely without justification. Deputy Clinton is perfectly well aware that I reside in the same locality as he does and that any taking away of part of that area affects me just as it affects him.  In fact, unlike Deputy Clinton who has announced that his roots are in County Meath, I have my roots in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Clinton knew anything about the area he would know that.  However, the position is that in so far as any locality affects Deputy Clinton it affects me as well.  The considerations <Col N="399" /> here were that there had to be two extra seats squeezed into this small area of County Dublin.  As there are no constituencies returning more than five seats, there were two ways of doing this: having one five-seat and two three-seat constituencies or, as our proposal is, having two four-seat constituencies and a three-seat constituency. Obviously this would leave Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown a four-seat constituency and North County Dublin a four-seat constituency and the area comprising the surplus population from these two areas a three-seat constituency which is the new constituency of South County Dublin.  That is the area I propose to contest and in which I have no doubt whatever it will be possible to elect a second Fianna Fáil TD as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the question of the unfortunate disruption of the long association between myself and Deputy Burke.  This is one of the most regrettable things in this whole unwelcome operation that I have to perform.  At least for a temporary period this very felicitous association between myself and Deputy Burke has to come to an end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The total population of the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas is 57,822 which is 4,461 short of the average for three seats.  Even after the Baldoyle ward from the city area had been added, and that was essential because of the distribution of population and because of the fact that there were only 38 seats available for the Dublin area, the addition of that would not be sufficient to make a three-seat area because the population that would be left would be too many for the <Col N="400" /> number of seats that had to be squeezed in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us how he got 57,822?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I got it by the process of addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might be a little more civil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I got it by the addition of the population of the No. 1 electoral area to the population of the No. 2 electoral area.  If the Deputy will write down 31,412 and underneath if he will write 26,410, draw a line under that and add them, even he will get 57,822 and if he adds to that the population of the Baldoyle ward which is 2,097 he will get 59,919.  57,822 is the population of the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas. If he adds to that the population of the Baldoyle ward which is 2,097 he gets 59,919 and if he deducts that from the total population of the County of Dublin including the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and divides the resulting figure by the remaining number of seats which is eight, Deputy Clinton will find that the result would be over the allowable figure of population per Deputy.  Therefore, it was necessary even in order to create a three-seat constituency comprising the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas and the Baldoyle ward to take some population from the No. 3 area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact which Deputy Clinton can work out for himself but maybe he is only able to do the addition, maybe he is not able to do the subtraction and division that are also involved in this.  Therefore, some extra had to be taken and the obvious place to take it from was the Walkinstown area and since figures of population are available only on a townland basis it was decided to take all that area and make the North County Dublin area a four-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Deputy Clinton that this has been done to make a safe seat for Deputy Foley <Col N="401" /> it might be no harm to remind Deputy Clinton of the result of the last general election in the area.  In 1965, County Dublin was a five-seat constituency and for Deputy Clinton's information there were two Deputies elected on the first count with substantial surpluses&mdash;my distinguished and gracious colleague Deputy Burke and myself &mdash; Deputy Burke with a total of 19,076 and myself with a total of 14,022.  Deputy Dunne was elected on the fourth count and on the sixth count Deputy Foley was elected, again with a substantial surplus of almost 1,000.  That left the remaining seat, the fifth seat, to be allocated to Deputy Clinton without a quota.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But with nearly two quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Without a quota.  He had the distinction of getting the sole Fine Gael seat, the last seat, without a quota.  Therefore, there is obviously no need whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He is quite safe.  With regard to the suggestion that the purpose of this operation is to separate me from my colleague Deputy Burke, the figures of previous elections will show quite clearly that, so far from there being any reason why I should wish to do that, there is every reason why I should wish to remain in that distinguished company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful to remember the first time the Minister was elected.  It was a good job he was in the constituency then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the first time was in 1957 when the constituency of County Dublin was a three-seat constituency and the quota was 9,561. Here again Deputy Burke was as usual elected with a substantial surplus of <Col N="402" /> 2,498 and the next Deputy on the first count was myself with 9,412, 149 short of the quota.  Of course on the distribution of Deputy Burke's surplus I got ten times more than the small number of 149 that I required.  It took four more counts and on the fifth count the third seat was filled by the then Deputy Rooney who is now Senator Rooney.  At the next election of 1961 when County Dublin had become a five-seat constituency again my colleague Deputy Burke was elected at the head of the poll as is his wont with the substantial surplus of 1,835 votes.  I was elected also on the first count with a substantial surplus of 1,622 and as is usual in County Dublin we were the only two who were elected on the first count.  It took until the seventh count to elect anybody else.</P>
      <P>I do not think those figures show any reason for me to try to get away from my colleague, Deputy Burke.  In fact, as he has often said himself, we have formed a great team and our association has certainly done a great deal to ensure the continuance of good government in this country by ensuring a Fianna Fáil majority in the constituency we represented.  Indeed, in the near future when I will be attending a round of social functions to mark the 25th anniversary of my colleague's election to Dáil Éireann I can assure Deputies that there will be many sincere expressions of mutual regret at the breaking up of this association.</P>
      <P>The arrangement that has been made with regard to County Dublin is the most suitable one that could be made. The line dividing the constituency of North County Dublin from South County Dublin is taking account of the necessity to follow district electoral divisions and townland boundaries as far as possible, the line running as closely as possible east and west, and the description given to the constituency, which is the logical one for the area lying north of that line is North County Dublin and South County Dublin to the other area and the description of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had the <Col N="403" /> effrontery to come here last night and accuse us on this side of the House of wasting time.  We all know that he and his Government have wasted the time of this House and of the country, as well as a considerable amount of public money, in a referendum that was unwanted by anybody except the Minister and a few other power-thirsty bullies in his own Party.  However, we are speaking here this morning on the Bill. The Minister said very little on the Bill.  He spent himself in his efforts to humiliate me but he has not succeeded, I can assure him.</P>
      <P>I stood before the people in County Dublin on five occasions&mdash;three local elections and two general elections&mdash; and the people in County Dublin honoured me on each of those five occasions by electing me, which is more than the Minister for Local Government can say about the people of County Dublin.  As far as he is concerned, it took him a long time to get in.  That, again, is far away from the Bill.  However, I shall take the Minister's own figures and I shall prove that it was not necessary to take in the No. 3 area in order to get a three-seat constituency in North County Dublin.  For the area that we have known as the No. 1 area in North County Dublin, he gives a figure of 31,412 population and, if I got his figure correctly, 26,410 for the No. 2 area, making this 57,420 odd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not quibble over a few figures one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have to, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have plenty. We shall add 2,092&mdash;that was the figure for the Baldoyle ward that was added&mdash;and we arrive at 59,900 which is as good as 60,000 and, without using the tolerance, we have place for three Deputies.  Who, now, cannot do addition? I take it that it is the Minister for Local Government who cannot do addition because it is obvious to me that it is made for a three-seat constituency without coming into the No. 3 area at all and using largely the well-known boundary of the Naas Road.  However, <Col N="404" /> the Minister came into the No. 3 area with the deliberate intention of splitting my council vote&mdash;I say it again because I know that it has been done.  The Minister has not succeeded in proving that that has not been so.  He spoke about my reference to the Navan Road as a natural boundary and referred to it and to the Naas Road as boundaries well known by the people and a natural boundary.</P>
      <P>What I meant by the Navan Road was that the nearest point the people in County Dublin would recognise as North County Dublin would be the right-hand side of the Navan Road as you go towards Navan from Dublin.  I think the Minister will agree that that is so.  A nearer point would not be recognised by anyone as North County Dublin.  Now he speaks about the impossibility of creating a three-seater on that side of the Navan Road.  I see no impossibility at all.  We had Sutton and Howth that were formerly in County Dublin.  There is a population there of about 20,000.  Furthermore, we had the position in North-East Dublin where they could easily give us 20,000 and more in order to accommodate a three-seater constituency in County Dublin. The Minister has set out deliberately to misrepresent me.  He finishes up then by glorifying Deputy Foley and saying that, of course, Deputy Foley was elected before I was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the constituencies <Col N="405" /> stood as they were, he would get no seat the next time.  The Minister knew that.  He set out deliberately to take that part of Baldoyle that he knew to be a Fianna Fáil stronghold and he put it into Deputy Foley's lap in order to get him elected.  The Minister for Local Government is not fooling anyone when he tells this House that he was doing the best he could in all the circumstances to provide compact constituencies that were easily worked. Anybody who would describe a constituency running from beyond Balbriggan to Kimmage Manor as a compact constituency cannot be taken as speaking seriously when it was completely unnecessary to pass the Naas Road to get a three-seater constituency in North County Dublin that would serve the people and serve them well&mdash;but, then, Deputy Foley would not have been elected and the Minister knew that. That is the reason for making it a completely unnatural four-seater constituency. However, the Minister has made his decision.  He tells us now that he is going to do well.  He told us the same on the referendum&mdash;that he was going to do well.  However, the people come in here somewhere.  I know what the people will tell him in South County Dublin.  If he does not get two seats in North County Dublin then certainly it will not be for the want of trying very hard in gerrymandering the area: he has done that very effectively.  Not only has he done that to us but he has done it to Labour.  He has made sure that he has thrown all the Labour support into North County Dublin so that they cannot possibly get a seat in South County Dublin.</P>

I think that this was deliberately done in order to put so much of the Labour support into North County Dublin that it would be <Col N="406" /> impossible for them to get a seat in South County Dublin.  Those are some of the motives and I am sure I can think of others: I shall leave it for the moment.  I have effectively proved that the Minister had a perfect three-seater constituency without coming into the area or splitting it.</P>

      <P>I just want to express my views on this matter and to say that I am glad to see that there is a bit of a change of heart as far as Deputy Clinton is concerned.  Of course, we can understand the dismay in his attitude because he himself is probably basing his own Party on the figures of his own election at the last general election.  If this is correct, and it seems to be so, it is no wonder Deputy Clinton is so worried about it because if I, myself, were the last Deputy elected out of five Deputies in the county in the last election, I should be worried too.  However, if I can put his mind at ease, I would say to him: &ldquo;Do not be too worried about me, Deputy Clinton, or worried about Deputy Burke because we will survive, as we proved to you in the last election, when you scraped home dragging your feet just because you deprived an honest man, who is now Senator Eamonn Rooney, of his seat.&rdquo;  We all know that Deputy Clinton utilised the man who is now Senator Rooney to gather votes for him in the last general election.  However, I do not think this will happen again because Senator Rooney is now based on the North side.  Deputy Clinton does not know where he is based.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt in the world about my being elected.  I have a large circle of friends in that area.  I have a large circle of supporters and I can muster up a considerable amount of support.  I do not think the Minister was trying to protect me because he brought in a large portion of South County Dublin.  Naturally, since I live on the north side I do not command a lot of support in it but my support is growing and increasing in that area and I have no doubt that, in the next election&mdash;whenever it may be&mdash;Deputy Clinton will have to eat his words once again.  He has expressed dismay here on my behalf.  I will express that dismay on behalf of Deputy Clinton at the next election, because I fervently feel it is his own seat he is worried about.  From a Party point of view, he is not interested in whether Fine Gael get two seats, three seats or how many seats they get.  His particular interest is that Deputy Clinton stays here, at the bottom of the poll, shall we say?</P>

      <P>In conclusion, if it eases Deputy Clinton's mind, I can assure him that the amount of work I have put into the constituency I represent is very substantial.  He uses the national press to try to drag down any work which I have done.  Because I do not go seeking publicity in the public press for every step forward I take on behalf of my constituents, Deputy Clinton and his colleagues are inclined to believe that I shall not be elected again.  But the people of County Dublin are firmly convinced that I have worked hard on their behalf and I shall continue to work on their behalf.  I have no doubt that when the next election comes they will satisfy critics such as Deputy Clinton and even critics in the Press by re-electing both Deputy Burke and myself and possibly even another colleague in North County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Foley for having disclosed publicly here the mind behind the introduction of this Bill by the Minister for Local Government.  It proves conclusively what we said during the referendum campaign and what we have been saying in the House and outside it since the Bill was published, that it was designed and conceived solely for the purpose, as Deputy Foley has just admitted as one of those in politics who sometimes blab things out by mistake, of benefiting the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and for nothing else but to do what the Minister can to destroy other Parties opposed to Fianna Fáil.  That is not the way any Minister for Local Government or any Minister in any Government should <Col N="409" /> approach the national duty of his office. We are grateful to Deputy Foley for having exposed the manner in which the Minister has put his Party before his national duty.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of this constituency that we are now discussing? The purpose of its being drawn as it has been drawn is to provide an end to what I heard the Minister for Local Government describe as a felicitous association.  It was a felicitous association for Deputy Burke, I suppose, because he was always able to lead the Minister for Local Government.  The constituency is drawn for the purpose of ensuring that there would be an unnatural division between North and South County Dublin.  I do not know whether Deputy Foley will remember or not, but I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, if not the Minister himself, will remember that somewhere about 18 years ago the all-Party Committee of the Mansion House published certain pamphlets showing in relation to the North of Ireland the exact shape in which gerrymandering had been carried out.  If anybody cares to look in the Oireachtas Library he can find one of the pictures in those pamphlets which is more or less an identical copy, or an original if you like, of the manner in which the Minister for Local Government has drawn North County Dublin. The unnatural shape shown in parts of the Six Counties is reflected exactly in North County Dublin by, for example, putting in part of Kimmage across the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Foley for having disclosed to the House and the country what we knew to be behind this method of drawing the constituencies. Is it not lucky that the people here were not codded by the commission that the Minister wanted to set up because, if it had been, then, if the commission had fairly done its work the Minister, in pursuance of the intention declared by Deputy Foley, would then come along and change the work of that commission?  But the people said overwhelmingly last October that they would not be misled in that way&mdash; that they knew the Minister for Local Government and his Fianna Fáil colleagues would not approach the task <Col N="410" /> of defining constituencies in a national way but that they would do it in a Party way.  That was the reason why in Deputy Foley's and the Minister's constituency, as well as everywhere else, the people gave such an emphatic answer a few months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to answer a few points the Minister made.  He said he was born in County Dublin.  I do not think he has ever lived in County Dublin.  He was born in Fairview and Fairview was never in County Dublin.  I have lived 36 years in County Dublin and have been six years outside it.  Admittedly, some of the area goes into Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, but I lived in County Dublin most of the time.  When the Minister read out the results of the voting in the last general election, he pointed out that Deputy Clinton got the last seat. That is so, but the next person was a Fine Gael man.  Fianna Fáil barely got three quotas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a lot of that was because one man was a Gaelic footballer.  Labour got just more than a quota and Fine Gael got just short of two quotas.  Therefore, this latest effort of the Minister is another example of misleading the people, as he did before the referendum.  Let us take the Minister's figures of 31,000 in the No. 1 area, 26,400 in the No. 2 and 2,092 in the other, a total of 59,900. The Minister says you cannot get more than two seats in these areas combined. You could get three seats with the tolerance, it being 57,000 without the tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the north side of Dublin is growing outwards. Plans for houses are increasing the city by between 5,000 and 8,000 people.  In the areas I have mentioned, therefore, the Minister should start at the lowest possible figure of 57,000 because in the next year or two the figure will rise to 60,000 and in a few years the population will have reached 65,000.  The Minister wants to ensure that Deputy Foley will be in on this.  At the moment, the rumour is that Deputy P. J. Burke and Deputy Foley will stand in the north side&mdash;two Fianna Fáil <Col N="411" /> Deputies with their roots in the north side.  Deputy Burke would probably go south, but that would not suit the Minister because he might get the boot there, there being only three seats in it. The position at the moment is that there are two Fianna Fáil Deputies there.</P>
    <P>However, if there are only three seats there what will happen is that one Fianna Fáil, one Fine Gael and one Labour Deputy will be returned and there will be no chance of Fianna Fáil getting two seats.  So what does the Minister do?  He moves right across to the far side of the city, as far as Kimmage Manor, passing the North-East, North-West and South-West and around the tip of South Central to hit Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  How often have I heard Deputies Burke and Foley and Deputy Clinton and others say that it is a tremendous distance for a Deputy to travel, particularly across a busy city, to see his constituents?  It has been the Minister's argument in relation to country constituencies.  It is the argument in relation to a constituency in which one has to travel 20 to 30 miles, from Balbriggan, through Swords, to the Wicklow mountains.  It is far worse when a Deputy has to travel through a busy city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has four seats in North Dublin in order to keep two Fianna Fáil Deputies.  He has moved in a bit of North-East Dublin where you can easily pick out the Fianna Fáil vote, the Fine Gael and the Labour votes. In no other city area can you pick them out so easily because there are changes as the areas become built up. The Minister brings in portions of the old County Dublin where he knows the vote and, because Deputy Foley comes from the north side, he will get that, the Minister thinks.  I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>In the south side there might also have been four seats but they wanted to get rid of Deputy Seán Dunne so they move him into the city.  He has gone, so the south is to have three seats.  Not being from the country, there is only one main point of criticism I wish to make in relation to it and that is the butchery of Leitrim. Beyond that, I have not been worried <Col N="412" /> about the country constituencies, though the Minister wanted, of course, to do the best he could for Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Therefore, in country areas he proposed there would be three-seat constituencies and in Dublin, where possible, four seaters. We must consider Dublin North in which Dublin North-East becomes involved. Where there will be Labour representation, Fianna Fáil provide for four-seat constituencies but where there will not be Labour representation they keep to three-seaters.  They hope to take two seats in the four-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>In the last general election, Fianna Fáil's percentage of the vote in Dublin was 30.6.  In North County Dublin, if there were three seats the representation would be one Fine Gael, one Fianna Fáil and one Labour.  In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, a five-seater, the representation would be two, two, one.  In the North County area, with a four-seater, Fianna Fáil might get two, going on the last election, Fine Gael would get one and Labour one.  In the South County, it would be one, one, one; and, as I have said, in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown it would be two, two, one, making the representation in these constituencies Fianna Fáil five, and six against them.</P>
    <P>We could take an alternative and say that with a three-seater in North County Dublin the representation would be one, one, one; in South County Dublin, with three seats, it would be one Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael; in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, a five-seater, it would be two Fine Gael, two Fianna Fáil and one Labour or two Fianna Fáil and three Fine Gael.  However, by gerrymander, Fianna Fáil can possibly get five seats out of 11 though they should get only four.  That is what they tried to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, where Labour have a chance of winning a seat, they make the constituency a three-seat constituency, which would give one Labour, one Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil. Where, however, there is a chance of Labour getting one seat and Fianna Fáil two, they make the constituency <Col N="413" /> a four-seat constituency.  There was the proposal in the referendum with regard to the setting up of a commission. Had Fianna Fáil won the referendum they would now have 144 constituencies with one seat each.  I would be quite happy if the Minister decided to have every constituency a three-seat, a four-seat or a five-seat constituency. I would not mind that because, if one loses in the country, one gains in the city and vice versa.  The whole western area is divided into three-seat constituencies but Dublin is divided into four-seaters because that is the area in which the Government hope to hold on.  Now the western area is practically all Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  Labour comes in only in Cork and Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that these four-seaters should be three-seaters. Last night, when the Minister was discussing Donegal, he also discussed Clare, Leitrim and the West of Ireland generally.  I am discussing three-seat constituencies as against four-seat constituencies and I say there should not be a four-seat constituency in North County Dublin.  The Minister is making it a four-seat constituency because it suits him but in the west he is making three-seat constituencies, because it suits him.  That is the kernel of this whole Bill and that is the fundamental gerrymander.  I think I am quite entitled to refer to this.</P>
      <P>The question then arises of the number of votes necessary to secure so many seats.  With 50 per cent of the vote, where the result is usually one/ one/one, the result will be 66? of the seats or two seats out of three.  In a four-seater constituency all one needs in order to get two seats is 42 per cent of the votes.  That will be the result in North County Dublin.  If it were a five-seat constituency the result would be two/two/one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked last night if we could add and subtract in order to get the figures.  He almost bordered on impertinence.  I have added the figures. The electorate in North County Dublin is 59,892, when one takes in the No. 2 <Col N="414" /> area.  Yesterday the Minister said one had to split the No. 3 area in order to get a three-seat constituency.  You have this and you have the tolerance; within 100 votes of the tolerance you can get three seats, taking the No. 2 area.  The Minister said it could not be done.  He contradicted Deputy Clinton's argument. On his own figures it can be done.  He has admitted that.  In the city of Dublin it is perfectly obvious that Fianna Fáil are fighting for their lives to hold on to seats and their object is to get two out of four.  In the country areas they are hoping to get two out of three.  I believe it will take only a very small swing of the pendulum to defeat their calculations.  The Minister is as remote from the grass roots now as he was when he held the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton tried to brazen out his suggestion that the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas in County Dublin, with the addition of the Baldoyle ward, would be a feasible proposition and would permit of a three-seat constituency.  I do not believe Deputy Clinton is incapable of investigating the figures of population in the Dublin area more intelligently than that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the light of the existing interpretation of the constitutional requirement.  The population of the administrative area of County Dublin, including the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, is 226,275.  It is quite true that, if it were permissible to deal with this area on its own, it would be possible to have 11 seats in the area, without any addition from outside; but that would leave 27 seats for the city area and the population of the city area is 568,772.  If one allocates 27 seats to that area one gets an average of population per Deputy of 21,065.  That, of course, is outside the permissible tolerance in accordance with the interpretation of the constitutional requirements by Mr. Justice Budd.  Even if one could arrange a division with that kind of mathematical exactitude, which one could not because it would involve not only dividing streets but dividing <Col N="415" /> households, everything would be all right; but that kind of accuracy is impossible and, therefore, the city area, in order to contain only 27 seats, must lose something more than 1,000 of population.  For practical reasons it would, of course, obviously have to lose some more because one cannot divide constituencies with this kind of mathematical exactitude.</P>
      <P>The two smallest wards in the city are the Phoenix Park ward, with a population of 1,907, and the Baldoyle ward with a population of 2,097.  If one starts on the basis of trying to keep the city and the county as separate as possible and, since the city must lose something over 1,000 of population in order to accommodate the 27 seats within the constitutional limits, one must obviously decide to transfer one of these two smallest wards from the city to the county.  Because the Baldoyle ward was until recently in the county it was decided to take this ward, with a population of 2,097, and add that to the county.  That leaves the county then with a population of 228,372, giving an average of 20,761 for 11 seats and an average of 62,283 for a three-seat constituency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton was not very accurate in his calculations, but he agreed roughly with the population figures I gave for the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas with the addition of the Baldoyle ward.  It is true that, if one could consider that area in isolation, a three-seat constituency would be permissible, but one cannot do that because the population then in the rest of the County Dublin area would be 168,453 and there are eight seats to be allocated in that area; eight divided into 168,453 gives 21,057, which is again outside the limits permissible in the High Court interpretation of the Constitution.</P>

Anyone who has any knowledge of the area and of the area of influence of my colleague Deputy Foley would realise that the surest way to consolidate him would be to give him some of this area in which he is so well known and so well thought of.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was something which I considered seriously.  It would be a feasible solution to the whole problem.  To ignore the city boundary would give more compact areas generally speaking, but I do not think it would prove very acceptable to the Opposition.  If we were completely to ignore the city boundary, as has been suggested now by Deputy Clinton at the instigation of his colleague Deputy Belton, in this instance, I am quite certain that the criticism it would draw would be even greater than the present criticism.  What was decided in fact was to adhere to the city boundary so far as possible.  I have demonstrated that we took from the city area the absolute minimum, the second smallest ward in the area, the Baldoyle ward with a population of 2,097, and that was done only because the population of the city was too great for the 27 seats available to it.  I think that is fairly obvious.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman intervened to claim that Deputy Foley's speech had exposed that this whole thing was done in the Fianna Fáil interest.  In fact, he disclosed the exact opposite.  He disclosed that Deputy Clinton's suggestion would have been the ideal one so far as he personally was concerned and, since Deputy Clinton has been basing his whole case on the contention that the objective was to consolidate Deputy Foley's seat, I think Deputy Foley's speech completely disposed of that argument by demonstrating that it was Deputy Clinton's suggestion which would have done that much more effectively than the actual proposal I have put before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that if one looks at the shape of the proposed constituency of North <Col N="418" /> County Dublin it seems an unnatural type of constituency.  This is because of the fact, for which I am not responsible, that it is cut almost in two by the city of Dublin.  I did not build the city of Dublin.  The city of Dublin is there.  It is not my fault.</P>

Apart from the fact that the city intrudes on the constituency, the constituency of North County Dublin is just about as natural as it is possible for a constituency to be.</P>
      <P>All this song and dance that has been made about the Terenure district electoral division being incorporated is nonsense, because Deputy Clinton suggested that it should be only the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas, and part of that area is actually more southerly than the Terenure district electoral division.</P>

    <P>Deputy Belton claimed that I said that the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas were sufficient only for two seats.  I did not.  What I did say was that in the area Deputy Clinton maintained could form North County Dublin, that is the area north of the Navan Road, the <Col N="419" /> population there was barely sufficient for two seats.  The average for three seats in the area of County Dublin plus the Baldoyle ward would be 62,288 and the No. 1 electoral area plus the No. 2 electoral area plus the Baldoyle ward give a total population of 59,919. That would leave 168,453 people in the remainder of County Dublin which is too many for the eight seats which must be put into it.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were the four-seat constituencies &mdash; Longford-Westmeath, East Limerick, South Tipperary and Mid-Cork&mdash;and another four-seat constituency is North-East Cork which is being reduced from a five-seat constituency because we are adhering to the Cork County Borough boundary. Therefore eight of the four-seat constituencies are in the Dublin area where there is a total of ten constituencies and where I would say it would be difficult to find names for any more constituencies. As I said, the tendency obviously was to go for three-seat constituencies in so far as it was reasonably feasible in the Dublin area generally.  The actual point at issue here is whether North County Dublin or South County Dublin should be a four-seat constituency and which should be a three-seat constituency. The decision we made was obviously the more feasible one, the one that appears to be best from looking at the map.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton is suggesting that we should have South County Dublin a four-seat constituency by including practically the whole of the district electoral division of Terenure, which we could not do.  That would be in fact the more northerly part of the No. 2 area, which Deputy Clinton admits would have to be in a three-seat constituency of North County Dublin.  It is obviously a matter of opinion which should be the four-seat constituency and which the three and we think it should be the north side.</P>

      <P>He now finds that he cannot lose a few votes anywhere in any of the city constituencies.  If he made a three-seat constituency Deputy Foley would go.  This is a Fianna Fáil Bill, a gerrymandering Bill, the same as the Referendum Bill, and we have exposed this and intend to continue exposing it.  That is why we have gone to some trouble to feed the Minister with his own figures, to prove that he did not use the tolerance and still had enough people to form a three-seat constituency.  I thought the Minister might have told us something about his plans for bringing part of Kildare into County Dublin.  What happened to that idea?  Was it the Celbridge Deputy who kicked over the traces and would not let it happen?  Or was it just a further falsehood?  Two nights before the referendum the Minister had leaflets circulated in the area of Newcastle and Rathcoole and the area bordering Kildare stating that, if the people did not support the Government, they would find themselves in Kildare. I saw those leaflets which were put into the people's letterboxes.  These are the methods used to cement Fianna Fáil in power against the wishes of the people &mdash;threats.  They will not work any longer and this Bill will be seen for what it is, another effort at gerrymandering to retain the maximum number of Fianna Fáil seats.</P>
      <P>I gave the reason why it was important to split the No. 3 area and I am sticking to it.  It was important because I headed the poll in three different elections, and by a long shot, and the Minister wanted to split that vote in two so that it would be more difficult for me to be elected on either side.</P>

Why did he not go the other way and make a four-seat constituency by bringing in the area I have just mentioned?  This portion would have suited me admirably.  The only regret I have is that the Minister did not decide that that portion should come in to North County Dublin because Baldoyle happens to be my parish.

The only regret I have is that this did not happen.  As for Deputy Clinton's support on the North side I do not think he need worry about what he is going to lose because it is very difficult to lose something you have not got. Therefore he will not lose much anyhow. He said the Minister tried deliberately to cut his vote in two.  If the Minister tried to cut his vote in two he would eliminate him completely because Deputy Clinton was the last Deputy elected in the last general election and he was elected without reaching the quota.  He was the only Fine Gael Deputy elected in North County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton never reached the quota although he did increase his vote.  I reached the quota and exceeded it.  It is an extraordinary thing that a man in that position would try to betray me by saying to the people of County Dublin that he knows I did not work on their behalf during the past four years, practically.  He knows quite well, and the people of County Dublin know quite well, that his statement is untrue.  Deputy Clinton is only trying to secure for himself a press which will popularise his misinformation. He knows he has failed to capture the imagination of the people in County Dublin and therefore he has to resort to some devious means to try to get a public press so that the people will realise that there is such a person as Deputy Mark Clinton, the one Fine Gael Deputy for North and South County Dublin.  It should be borne in mind that Fianna Fáil represent not <Col N="427" /> only the Fianna Fáil people but the Labour people, the Fine Gael people and the people who have no Party at all.  That is the policy of Fianna Fáil. We represent each and every member of the constituency of County Dublin and this is where Deputy Clinton has failed.  It might pay him well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is given to you. That is just to hide something.  The Minister gave us plenty of figures.  It is a question of doing addition.  If I understood him correctly, we should divide 27 into 56,772.  The figure he should divide is 20,000 and that gives us 28 seats and there would be no trouble seeking where to put the votes.  That is the division he must also do in the country areas.  The Minister is giving a favourable tolerance to them and an unfavourable tolerance in the city of Dublin, which is a growing area.  If we divide likewise in respect of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown we get our 11 seats and 6,000 over and if we add it into Dublin we have 14,000 over and that can be used as a tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that they had four-seat constituencies in the country.  He mentioned East Limerick. He would not change that because Fianna Fáil have two seats out of four there.  Tipperary: four seats.  Fianna Fáil have two seats there.  If he changed that he would be hurting the Fianna Fáil Deputies and would also lose a seat for Fianna Fáil.  Wexford&mdash;Fianna Fáil have two seats out of four there and that could not be changed.  Longford&mdash;they happen to have two seats there and an Independent who is favourable. That could not be changed or there would be terrible trouble; they would lose one and maybe two seats in that area.  The Minister also mentioned that, if he were to change at all, he would have to divide streets.  How can he divide Dublin except by crossing streets?  He has already done it.  His argument is beyond explanation.  Take my old constituency of Dublin North-East and the constituency of North <Col N="429" /> Central.  How did the Minister divide them?</P>
    <P>Going up the old Howth Road you find that is divided again on both sides of the road, across and down with a bit in and a bit out.  This is done right through the city.  The Minister said he did not like taking pieces of the city and putting them in the county or putting bits of the county into the city but he has done it to suit Deputy Foley at Baldoyle.  Ballyfermot, which for years was in the city&mdash;I do not know the number of votes but I know that Deputies Seán Dunne, Mark Clinton and the Minister get so many votes out of it&mdash; voted in the county.  What is wrong with continuing that?  The Minister wants the county kept separate.  Why does he keep Dún Laoghaire and the county separate?  The big thing in Dún Laoghaire was that he moved a section out of it because the next seat after four had to go to Labour or Fine Gael, not to Fianna Fáil.  Labour would have the better chance, I agree.  In the case of that seat if you left Mount Merrion area in it, the fifth seat had to go to either Labour, which probably had the better chance, or Fine Gael.  Fianna Fáil had no chance.  This is the reason that Dún Laoghaire is not getting it, not to be good to Dún Laoghaire or anything like that or to keep county and city separate.</P>
    <P>My understanding was that as far as possible we should elect a Deputy to represent 20,000 with a tolerance either way but the Minister has decided to give only 27 to Dublin.  Then he divides by 27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is no point in putting the facts before Deputy Clinton.  He insists on coming back with the same unsubstantiated statements that he knows are completely wrong.  He claimed that he has nailed the falsehood that it is impossible to have a three-seat constituency comprising the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas and Baldoyle ward.  I have proved to Deputy Clinton from the figures that that cannot be if&mdash;and I agree with this &mdash;you have only 38 seats for the Dublin area.  It cannot be done on the present interpretation of the constitutional provision. It cannot be done except by exercising a greater tolerance from the <Col N="430" /> national average of population per Deputy than 5 per cent which we believe is the maximum that we are entitled to use.</P>
      <P>I have given Deputy Clinton the figures taken from the Census of Population. These are the only figures we are entitled to use and the Deputy knows that, if you have a three-seat constituency made up as he suggests of the No. 1 and No. 2 electoral areas and the Baldoyle ward, then there is too great a population left to contain the eight seats that remain in the County Dublin administrative area including the Borough of Dún Laoghaire. Deputy Clinton knows this and he cannot contradict the figures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that part of Kildare might be put into County Dublin, of course there are many different ways in which this problem could be solved and this would be one of the possibilities but we decided to try so far as possible to adhere to the boundaries of County Dublin and adhere to the boundaries of Dublin city and it was only in this case where it was forced upon us that we had this slight transfer of population from the city area to the county area.</P>
      <P>As has been fairly well established, the suggestion that has been made by Deputy Clinton&mdash;I do not know whether it is on behalf of the Fine Gael Party or not because apparently nobody can speak for the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has a copy of the census he can get the figures.  If he wants to be accurate and truthful he can look up page 88 in the census report and he will see there that the population of Beann Eadair ward is 7,377. The population of the part of north County Dublin north of the Navan Road, which Deputy Clinton thinks should be the border, is approximately 42,300.  It is not available with absolute accuracy because whoever designed the Navan Road decided for some reason or other not to adhere to the boundaries of district electoral divisions or townlands but decided instead to cut corners and so on.  So, the nearest approximation that we can get to the population of County Dublin north of the Navan Road is 42,300.  If you add the population of the Beann Eadair ward and the Baldoyle ward to that you get 51,774.  As I have shown, the average for three seats would be in the region of 62,300 so that another 10,000 or 10,500 would have to be added to this area from some other part of the north city of Dublin.  This would suit Deputy Foley even better because these could only come from the Coolock or Raheny wards.  As Deputy Clinton is aware, and Deputy Belton even more so, this is an area that would suit Deputy Foley even better than North County Dublin.</P>

Admittedly, this could all be done in a different way if we had an extra seat for Dublin city as Deputy Belton advocates. I should like to know is this Fine Gael policy, that instead of there being 38 seats in Dublin there should be 39? Can anybody speak for Fine Gael? Deputy Belton says it should be dealt <Col N="432" /> with by putting 28 seats instead of 27 into the city of Dublin and leaving the 11 seats in the county.  That means an extra seat for Dublin.

      <P>Last night we had six Fine Gael Deputies in the Front Bench and four of them put forward four different solutions which they said were their solutions for one corner of the country. Now Deputy Belton says that the way to deal with this is to take an extra seat from the rural areas and put it into Dublin city.  But what part of it? Will Deputy Belton tell us where it is to come from?  Has he cleared this with the Fine Gael Deputies concerned and with his Party?  As far as I can see there is only one thing certain that Fine Gael are agreed on in regard to this Bill and that is to delay it as much as possible by a concerted effort with relays of Fine Gael speakers coming in here making ridiculous suggestions without any consultation with each other, contradicting each other at every juncture and on every part of the Schedule with the sole object of delaying the passage of the Bill as much as possible so as, they think, to make the possible date of the general election as far distant as possible.

      <P>Again, the Minister has tried to misquote what Deputy Clinton said.  Deputy Clinton said &ldquo;Sutton and Howth&rdquo; and the Minister refers to &ldquo;Howth, Beann Eadair.&rdquo;  He speaks of Howth and Sutton, and he should know from his own Department that it takes in Kilbarrack where, at the back, many houses are built at the moment and they vote in Sutton schools and some of them go to Baldoyle. Howth should be taken into it. The Minister should not be trying to mislead by taking one section of what the Deputy said.  I know it is all right for the Minister to get the average vote that would elect a Deputy, which is 20,000.  To find the number of seats you divide by 20,000.  This is what the Minister did.  That is the number of seats we can now have with a tolerance of five per cent.  That is the way to do it.  But the Minister says &ldquo;No, I am giving only 27 to Dublin and we can divide 27 into it and now we shall see how we can get rid of the surplus.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has a fleet of civil servants to help him to prepare this. The civil servants had to do what he said.  I am not saying they are behind this proposal but the simplest thing the civil servants could have done was to divide 20,000 into the total votes.  If you take Dublin with 568,000 and divide that by 20,000, it gives 28 seats with 8,000 votes as a surplus.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is 226,000, approximately, according to the Minister's figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Sorry.  Dividing that gives you 11 seats with 6,000 to spare which is quite a good tolerance on both.  There is nothing to be got rid of.  All I am doing is dividing it. Yesterday, the Minister had Deputy Harte telling him that what he was doing was retaining an extra seat in Donegal but it is an extra Fianna Fáil Deputy he is retaining, not an extra <Col N="434" /> seat.  I did not hear the Minister denying that in the four-seat constituencies being retained in rural Ireland, two out of the four are held by Fianna Fáil.  If Fianna Fáil held only one seat in these constituencies, they would have been changed very quickly.  If there were five-seaters in Dublin they know the trouble they would be in.  In every election since 1961, Fianna Fáil have been losing ground in Dublin.  In general elections, in local elections and in the Presidential election, they continued to go down.  Deputy Foley spoke about North County Dublin and County Dublin.  In the referendum the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote was 15,755 and the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote was 32,073&mdash;two to one against.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not fear for Deputy Clinton in those circumstances. When he spoke earlier, I appealed to the Minister to tell us something about Kildare.  He wants to hasten this debate but I want to tell him something about the threats he had circulated during the referendum campaign in the County Dublin area bordering Kildare to the effect that the people there would find themselves in Kildare before the next general election. However, the Minister sat down <Col N="435" /> without dealing with this and it was a serious oversight on his part.  Obviously he had other plans for that area until his colleague in Celbridge upset them by kicking up and saying he would not have it.  It must have been possible to make some other adjustment there and the Minister must have had some other adjustment in mind at the time. He put forward various plans today for the constituency but we have not heard about the area I have been referring to.  I hope that before we finish the debate the Minister will tell us something about it because I feel sure there is an interesting alternative.</P>
      <P>In order to make a point, which was not valid, about portion of the No. 2 area in Dublin, to the effect that that portion was more southerly than the portion of the No. 3 area which he has broken up and taken in, the Minister spoke about half a dozen votes and, in derogatory fashion, he spoke as if I did not know the area.  The people of Dublin County know that they see me far more often in the various areas there than they see the Minister.  Let the Minister know&mdash;he will learn it later&mdash;that the people realise who is doing the work, without having it advertised some days before with the Minister's assistance and the assistance of other people.</P>

The figure for voters, compared with the figures for population, show that, even on the basis of the present proposals, the number of voters per Deputy in Dublin will be substantially fewer than in the rest of Ireland.  Deputy Belton suggested there should be an extra seat in Dublin.  I admit that is constitutionally permissible.  What we are proposing is also, we believe, constitutionally permissible and also fairer.  Do the Fine Gael Party agree with Deputy Belton that there should be a seat taken from rural Ireland and given to Dublin?  If so, then I agree with Deputy Clinton's solutions for Nos. 1 and 2 areas.  They would be possible, but only on the basis of an extra seat which Fine Gael propose, through their spokesman, Deputy Belton, to take from the country and put into Dublin.</P>
      <P>I must admit that on the second occasion when Deputy Belton advocated this he indicated where the seat should come from&mdash;from County Donegal.  There is one thing consistent about Fine Gael in this.  It is their concentration on the possibility of getting rid of Deputy O'Donnell in Donegal. What exactly did Deputy O'Donnell do that there should be this concentration on exporting some of his constituents to Connacht, and on this deduction of a seat from that area and its allocation to Dublin?  I do not know what the idea is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of putting part of Kildare into County Dublin <Col N="437" /> or part of County Dublin into Kildare. It is one of the ways in which this situation could be dealt with&mdash;one of the many, the infinite number of ways &mdash;but one of the decisions we came to was not to mix up parts of County Dublin with some other county.  It would be feasible to deal with the situation in Kildare by adding part of South County Dublin to it, which apparently is what Deputy Clinton is advocating apparently realising that he has not got a particularly good chance in the constituency he has been misrepresenting for some years.  What he wants to do is to get himself put into Kildare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a possibility.  The population of Kildare is too great for three seats and too small for four, and one of the many ways in which the situation could be dealt with is by transferring Deputy Clinton, as he apparently desires, from County Dublin to Kildare.</P>

      <P>It would have suited Deputy Clinton better to have cut him off from the area he has been ignoring in County Dublin.  It would have suited him better than the present arrangement. However, I think it is quite obvious that the sole object of Fine Gael is to delay the passage of the Bill, remembering that they had to have a joint effort by the Leader of the Party and the Whip to get Deputy Belton and Deputy Clinton to keep the debate going while Deputy L'Estrange went out to round up some more of his Party to delay the Bill further.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister, nobody is surprised at his hypocrisy, his effrontery and his ignorance. He has been a Deputy of this House for some 20 years and he should know that when the register of electors is being compiled people in hotels and hospitals are not put on the register for either Dublin city or county but are put on the register in the area from which they come, let it be Westmeath, Louth, Monaghan or anywhere else.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The Minister knows that as well as I do, but he does not want to admit it. His one idea seems to be to cause confusion and to delay the passage of this measure.  The Fine Gael Party are not here to delay the passage of this Bill. We are here to do our duty as an Opposition and to show up the unnecessary butchering and gerrymandering in this Bill in an effort by Fianna Fáil to keep themselves in office.  As far as we are concerned, we believe in one man one vote.  The Minister asked on whose behalf Deputy Clinton was speaking.  Deputy Clinton was speaking on behalf of a united Fine Gael Party not on behalf of a Party divided as the Minister's Party is at the moment.  In a recent speech the Minister stated that, if Fianna Fáil did not go back to their principle of abolishing the Border, there would be a second Republican Party started.</P>

      <P>The plan in relation to North County Dublin is quite plain.  It is also plain in relation to Dublin city.  The idea is to gerrymander. In Dublin city and county Fianna Fáil support has dropped to around 30 per cent of the vote&mdash;the figures are there to prove it&mdash;and it is Fianna Fáil's idea now to create four-seat constituencies in the hope that, by some miracle, they may get two out of four. In 1947 Fianna Fáil had a majority of the votes in Dublin.  There were no four-seat constituencies in Dublin at that time; there were three-or five-seat <Col N="439" /> constituencies.  Now that the support has dwindled they want to make the constituencies four-seat constituencies in the hope that they will get two out of the four.  In 1961 there were only two four-seat constituencies.  Now the proposal is to have eight plus one in County Dublin, making nine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>If the Minister will say now that at the end of this discussion we will have a general election we will give him all Stages now.  That offer puts an end to the foolish argument that we are delaying the Bill.  He said it was constitutionally possible to have another Deputy in the Dublin area.  If that is so why has it not been done? Talk about worrying about the people in rural Ireland where the population does not exist did not work even in the referendum.  Tolerance was held out as the carrot to win the referendum in rural Ireland, but it was rejected by the people because they believe in the principle of one man one vote.  We now have a constituency of North County Dublin which no one recognises as North County Dublin and no one ever will recognise as North County Dublin running from Balbriggan to Fortfield Road in Terenure.  This is done for the purpose of splitting the No. 3 Area.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I am not competent to say that we will have a general election tomorrow or any other time.  So far as I can see, every Deputy in the Fine Gael Party has a completely different and personal solution to this problem.  I admit that many solutions are possible.  Deputy Clinton asked why, if it is constitutionally possible, we did not allocate an extra seat in the Dublin area.  I have told him the reason already.  It is also constitutionally possible to allocate the number of seats we have decided to allocate to the <Col N="443" /> rural part of the country.  The decision we took was to allocate the maximum number of seats to that area.  That left 38 seats for Dublin which I think, and which the Fianna Fáil Party think, is adequate representation for that area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton and Deputy Belton think that an extra seat should be taken from rural Ireland.  That is their opinion.  We think otherwise.  I want to know was this a Fine Gael Party decision.  No one can assume that because Deputy Belton and Deputy Clinton say it is Fine Gael policy, it is Fine Gael policy, because no one knows what Fine Gael policy on anything is.

      <P>The purpose of the amendments is to transfer the townlands of Mount Merrion South&mdash;district electoral division of Dundrum&mdash; Brennanstown, Kerrymount, Kilbogget, Loughlinstown, Blackthorn, Carmanhall, Carmanhall and Leopardstown and Carrickmines Little&mdash;all in the district electoral division of Ballybrack&mdash; to the proposed constituency of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown from South County Dublin in exchange for the district electoral division of Rathmichael &mdash;except the townland of Shanganagh. It has been represented to me that these changes are desirable for the convenience of electors and to improve the boundary line.</P>
      <P>This proposed adjustment between South County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown will enable the part of Newcastle district electoral division which is in the proposed constituency of North County Dublin, that is, the townlands of Ballymakaily, Brownstown, Coolscuddan, Gollierstown, Grange and Mullauns, to be taken into South County Dublin and the amendment also proposes to make this transfer.  This will bring the entire Newcastle district electoral division into the proposed constituency of South County Dublin and I believe that it is an obvious and desirable thing to do.</P>

      <P>In Dublin Central for the first time for quite a while&mdash;it may have happened some time back&mdash; there is a situation where a four-seat constituency has been set up which Dublin rarely had.  There were a five-seater and a three-seater in Dublin but now there is a four-seater.</P>
      <P>As the support of Fianna Fáil has been dwindling, they are hoping, by having four-seaters in Dublin and three-seaters in the country, to hang on to power.  If it were a three-seater in North County Dublin, the result would be one/one/one and if it were a five seater, the result would be three/two against Fianna Fáil but they are looking for a four-seater in the hope that they will get two out of four.  In order to do that, it would be necessary for them to get 42 per cent of the vote but this they will not get.  However, they have set this out and have gerrymandered the whole country in the same way hoping to get the best out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton maintains that it is not necessary to cross the boundary of the River Liffey.  I do not know if Deputy Clinton has left his copy of the census behind but if he has and if Deputy Belton looks at page 88 he will see that the population of the north part of Dublin city is 287,846 <Col N="447" /> and with the Baldoyle ward taken out of that, the population will be 285,700 odd.  The population of Dublin South City is 280,926.  On the basis of 38 seats for Dublin, that is 11 in the county area and 27 in the city area, it must be quite clear to Deputy Belton that the boundary of the Liffey cannot be adhered to.  I will agree that if we take what now appears to be Fine Gael's official suggestion&mdash;since, unlike some of their other suggestions, it has not been contradicted by anybody else &mdash;we should have taken an extra seat from rural Ireland and then we would have 28 seats for Dublin.  It would not then have been necessary to breach the traditional and physical boundary of the Liffey but with 27 seats and with the distribution of the population this, of course, was unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Squeezing these two extra seats into the confines of Dublin borough boundary made it inevitable, if we were to have any kind of rational constituency at all, to create this extra constituency, to have seven constituencies instead of the existing six and to create this extra constituency of Dublin Central which, as I have said, inescapably takes in areas on both sides of the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if, as the Minister says, it would be possible to have this extra seat in Dublin, and it would be constitutionally correct, the fact that that would leave North Dublin and South Dublin as two distinct units, should have had a bearing on it. Prior to the last local elections when the south side came in on the north side, the Minister regarded it as the correct thing to do to make a clear-cut division between north and south.  At that time every member of the Party and of every other Party agreed with him that it was a major advance but now he has gone back on that for Dáil purposes and he has the north and the south coming into one constituency. Surely, if the allocation of an extra seat could have avoided this, that should have been the course adopted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

      <P>The Minister is using this argument hoping that in some way he will get publicity which will help him to take a seat from the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The Minister first got the answer he wanted and then worked backwards. The proper way to do a sum is to start at the beginning and get the answer but the Minister wanted to know the answer first and then work back from there to suit himself and this is what he has done.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the basis of ministerial effort in setting up a constituency in Dublin was to have five-seaters and, if this was not possible, to go down to four or three, whichever was suitable. In this particular area of the north side where there are 14 seats, why would it not be possible to have two five-seaters and a four-seater?  Something similar could be done on the south side.  The Minister is trying to safeguard some of his Deputies and he is doing his best to hold on to these two seats.  It is just a gerrymander.  What he could not do in the referendum he is now trying to do in spite of the people's wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister here, one would be pardoned for thinking that it was a very reasonable proposition that he has put before the House and that it was the only thing that could be done.  It is neither reasonable nor the only thing that could be done.  In fact, the Dublin constituencies can be split up in any way and should be split up in more five-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of PR is largely defeated if the constituencies are made too small.  Generally speaking, over the whole country the three-member constituencies have been enormously increased and the five-member constituencies have virtually disappeared; I think there are two left in the whole country. The Minister's argument that the only way to divide the city was in four-member constituencies is not true.  His Party have decided, for various reasons, all political, that the four-member constituencies will get the maximum return from the Fianna Fáil vote in the city of Dublin, north and south.  If they had split them up into three-member constituencies in certain areas they would probably only get one person in.  Likewise, they were afraid, if they split them into five-member constituencies, they would not get three seats.  They <Col N="449" /> think they stand a better chance of retaining two in four-member constituencies than of getting three in five-member constituencies.  It is a kind of statistical game, and I do not suppose it will be completely clear until after the next general election, but the alteration of the Dublin constituencies has been done for no other reason than the advantage of the Party in power.  That is the sole reason, and that is why we have this anomaly in Dublin of crossing the Liffey.  It has been done in the past on occasions, but it was broken away from whenever it was possible.</P>
    <P>The Liffey is a natural boundary running through the centre of the city &mdash;I have referred to this earlier on the Bill&mdash;and the interests of the North side and the South side are not always exactly the same.  Any electoral boundary which has crossed the Liffey in the past has never existed very long.  It was inevitably put back with its natural components; in other words, the South of the Liffey stood for a big constituency and the North the same way.  But the purpose of this crossing of the Liffey is a purely political move.  The idea that it is necessary in some way to have four-member constituencies is nonsense.  If it was desired, it is possible to have seven or even 11-member constituencies.  I am not necessarily advocating those, but there is no reason why they could not be made, so the contention of the Minister that we must have four-member constituencies is incorrect.  The truth of the matter is that whether you have 27 or 28 Deputies who represent the city of Dublin, you can divide the seats up any way you like.  It is possible to have so many five-seaters, so many six-seaters and so on.  I must, therefore, contradict the Minister's statement that this somehow was the only thing to do.  This is not so.  It was done for political reasons.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton says this should have been done in the very noble cause of trying to avoid a Dublin <Col N="450" /> constituency crossing the Liffey.  It would not, of course, matter if this involved a rural constituency crossing the Shannon.  Contrary to what Deputy Belton says, it is not just a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the western side of the Shannon.  I am coming to that.  We are not crossing the Shannon; we are adhering to the Shannon boundary.  It is not just a question of the allocation of an extra seat.  There is also the question of the deduction of a seat from some other part of Ireland.  While Fine Gael have told me that we should allocate this extra seat to Dublin, they have not told me where we are to take the seat from, and this is something it is essential to know.  Contrary again to what Deputy Dockrell has said, there is no way of avoiding crossing the River Liffey with some constituency except by the allocation of this extra seat to the city area.  Deputy Dockrell must know that, deducting the Baldoyle Ward from the North City area, if you have a population of 285,749 there and in the South City area a population of 280,926, with 27 constituencies available and approximately the same population north and south of the River Liffey, whether you use an 11-seat constituency or not you cannot avoid crossing the Liffey. Deputy Dockrell must know that.  The furthest you can go is to have a 13seat constituency and a 14-seat constituency, but either of these would be in breach of the constitutional provision in regard to equality or near equality of the ratio of population per Deputy.  Any other arrangement whatever that Deputy Dockrell or anybody else suggests in the area of Dublin city on that basis of 27 seats must involve some constituency crossing the boundary of the River Liffey.</P>

      <P>I agree that on a previous occasion, when constituencies in Dublin crossed the Liffey boundary, they were found to be unsatisfactory and had to be changed.  As far as this one is concerned, I would not have agreed to it unless I had to do it.  I hope that with the passage of time it will be possible to change this as well and go back to recognising the Liffey as the boundary which it has always been for Dublin city.  This is only done because of the situation that is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another thing there.  The Minister was quick to say he could not have nine-seat and seven-seat constituencies on the north side without crossing the Liffey.  He could have three- and four-seat constituencies and he could have some three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies. The Minister must have a very good reason for going for the four-seat constituencies.  We could have three- and four-seat constituencies but the Minister is insistent on four-seat constituencies and he has a reason.  He wants to get back at the people and get his own way which was rejected in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton says that we could have 12 seats on the <Col N="452" /> north side and 12 seats on the south side of the Liffey but that could not be done because there are 27 seats.  Let us say that the 12 was a slip of the tongue and say it is 13 instead.  He would then find that the population per Deputy would be too great on the north side or the south side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy if we had 28 seats but we have not.  If Fine Gael were doing this I would agree they would have taken two seats from rural Ireland and put them into Dublin, but we decided not to do that.  There are only 27 seats, not 28.  If there were 28 seats this difficulty of the Liffey boundary would not arise. It arises because there are only 27 seats and the population is much the same north and south of the Liffey.  I never said, as Deputy Belton suggests, that there was only one possible way of arranging the constituencies in the city of Dublin.  There is an infinite number of ways of doing this.  You could have one 27-seat constituency, you could have three nine-seat constituencies or you could have nine three-seat constituencies.  We have decided we should have seven constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The five-seat constituencies have proved to be long, straggling constituencies in the city of Dublin and it was quite obvious in arranging some five-seat constituencies on this occasion that there would have been great difficulty in division of streets and in straggling areas stretching from one to the other.  As I said, we in Fianna Fáil believe the most suitable type of constituency is the three-seat constituency.  But this would involve thinking up extra names.</P>

      <P>I just want to say as regards Dublin North-East that the same thing happened here as happened in a Mayo area.  It was divided so that it would suit two Ministers.  It is the same thing here.  In the last general election we had one Minister and a member of his Party got another 300 or 400 votes.  He would not have come into the Dáil otherwise.  They made sure this would not happen.  They split the area in the hope of giving one of their Ministers a viable vote in another area.  It is a four-seat area.  I do not know why it could not be a five-seater and a three-seater which would suit geographically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> That cannot be done, but there is the River Tolka and the canal which could be used.

      <P>Deputy Belton knows this is not so.  The constituency of Dublin North-East was not split for the purpose of separating two Ministers. It was revised because of the fact that the present population of Dublin North-East is 139,163 and it cannot any longer continue as a five-seat constituency. It is agreed that it could have been made a seven-seat constituency but we decided against that.  We think seven-seat constituencies are ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the constituency as amended, anybody who looks at the map in relation to this and sees the way in which the two parts are taken in from Roscommon cannot fail to appreciate and understand that that must have been done for a quite deliberate, sinister purpose.  Part of the sinister purpose here is to ensure that Roscommon would be down so much in relation to population that the necessity would arise to bring in the portion of Athlone that has been brought in for the sole purpose of serving the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole of this Bill there is no more glaring gerrymandering ramp than the manner in which a substantial part of the town of Athlone has been deliberately transposed into Roscommon simply and solely for Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Education. On the calculations, the Minister could not have brought that bit in in Athlone unless he had taken these portions off Roscommon.  When the Minister went to take them off Roscommon they were not even taken off in a cohesive part. They were taken off in two separate splits.  This has been done.  These people in Roscommon have been thrown out of their own county simply for the reason I have given and for no other reason.  I am sure the parts in question will be very welcome to North-East Galway but that is not the point we are discussing.  The point we are discussing and considering is the reason for it.  The reason for it is <Col N="459" /> simply and solely to devise an extra chunk of support for the Minister for Education in that Athlone corner.  The Minister for Education will find when an election comes along he is not going to have his own way, as he thinks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The parts of Roscommon added to this constituency are obviously the only parts that could reasonably be taken.  When this necessity arises to transfer population from one county to another one must take areas contiguous to the county into which they are being transferred.  This transfer has obviously been kept to the minimum since the population per Deputy in the constituency of North-East Galway will be very near the minimum that is allowed.</P>

      <P>The basis of amendment No. 22 is to change only a very few townlands because these townlands have been accustomed over the years to voting in the Kilcock polling booths and it seems desirable that, in so far as one possibly can, one should stick to this.  The Minister knows that I can be political if I want to be, and so can he, but this is purely an administrative matter.  It seems desirable not to change people's habits in regard to polling booths which they have attended. The townlands concerned have a population of 142 and for as long as I can remember they have always gone to Kilcock to vote.  It is most undesirable to have in the same place booths for two constituencies and if this change is not made the result will be that the people in these four townlands will have to change their habits and go to Newtown to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Section 7 provides for making suitable arrangements for electors in polling districts that are split. I would imagine that there would be a number of instances in other parts of the country where this happens also and that a case could be made for similar amendments in other areas. However, I can see the undesirability of this where traditional voting arrangements have been in existence for some time.  The only point I would like to make is that if these amendments are accepted it will increase the population of Kildare constituency and reduce the population of Meath constituency.  It is taking a positive step to put the population per Member in these two constituencies more out of line than the original proposals as they are aimed at getting the population per Member, as near as practicable, the same.  It is a fact that the proposals in the Bill go nearer in that direction than will be the position after this amendment, after <Col N="462" /> the acceptance of amendments No. 22, 23 and 25, which is one of the possible alternatives, and will increase the population of Kildare to 61,994 and reduce Meath to 59,651.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They will, but as between the two, and this is the only point I am making, the result of accepting these amendments will be to increase the disparity in population per Member between the two constituencies compared with what it is in the Bill at present.  However, if Deputy Sweetman thinks that is all right I have no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But it will be amended.  I am intrigued by the manner in which the constituency of Kildare, leaving out the small borderline variations, was prepared.  I am surprised that I do not find my colleague, Deputy Crinion, here today to discuss this section in the Schedule.  Deputy Crinion of course does not live in County Kildare; he lives in County Meath and the part of County Meath in which he resides is now being transferred back into the county of Meath and a large part of the county of Kildare, including Carbury, which I may say was one of the areas responsible more than any other in County Kildare for sending me into this House, has now been transferred from the county <Col N="463" /> of Kildare into the county of Meath. Its eight polling districts which are contiguous to where Deputy Crinion resides have been transferred and I have a very strong suspicion that when the Minister was drawing up Kildare in this way he believed that Deputy Crinion was going to move over into the county of Meath.  In fact rumour has it that Deputy Crinion also believed that but that the Minister for Defence would not have him and threw him out of the Meath constituency and this carving that was done out of the kindness of his heart by the Minister for Local Government to assist Deputy Crinion as he thought is now, in fact, boomeranging against Deputy Crinion and Deputy Crinion is no longer moving over into the Meath constituency. Rumour has it that the Minister for Defence indicated that he would not have him under any circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not offering any comment on that.  The comment I am making is that the people of Carbury are now going to have to suffer under this Bill by being taken away from the rest of Kildare because the Minister for Local Government wanted to assist Deputy Crinion by giving him eight polling districts next door to him when the Minister believed that the Deputy was moving over into the plains of Meath.  However, that apparently is not to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also intrigued to see that the district electoral division of Cloncurry and the polling district of Newtown in that district electoral division are likewise being transferred.  Of course, that polling district contains one of Deputy Crinion's strongest backers in the whole of Kildare-Newtown polling district&mdash;about which I think the Minister for Local Government knows a little because he visited it one day during the by-election with the Minister for Education if my memory serves me correctly.  The whole of that North-West corner of Kildare from Kilpatrick to Carbury, to Clogherin-koe, to Broadford and Cadamstown, <Col N="464" /> is now to be cut off from its natural home which is of course the rest of County Kildare.  The part that is going will be my loss personally in Kildare but it certainly will be Meath's gain and it is a little humorous to say the least of it that this having been done for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Deputy in the constituency he now has been forced to spurn the gift that was given to him by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman knows of course this had nothing whatever to do with the proposed transfer of these areas to County Meath.  It arises from a completely different reason altogether.  It arises from the fact that the population of Kildare is 66,404, the population of Louth is 69,519, the population of Meath is 67,323, the population of Cavan is 54,022 and the population of Monaghan is 45,732.  It arises from the fact that the county of Kildare cannot of itself constitute a three-seat or a four-seat constituency, that the only way in which these areas could be left in Kildare is by joining the whole county with the county of Carlow as some people have suggested or else making some other two-county arrangement such as that and that the decision was to have in this area where there is a total population of 303,000 five constituencies, one based on each of these five counties. This involved a transfer from Kildare to the part of County Meath remaining after Monaghan, Cavan and Louth had been dealt with.  When a transfer such as this is being made it is natural that it is the areas that are contiguous to the County Meath that would be dealt with and as Deputy Sweetman has pointed out Deputy Crinion lives in County Meath and these areas are contiguous to the area in which Deputy Crinion lives, therefore obviously also contiguous to the county of Meath and are the natural areas to be transferred when such a transfer is made inevitable because of the constitutional position.</P>

      <P>I must say I am amused by the Minister.  It is such an extraordinary coincidence but what he <Col N="465" /> is saying of the district electoral divisions that are being transferred does not happen to be entirely true.  Carrick, Kilrainy, Cadamstown and Dunfierth are contiguous to County Meath but then he has gone on and stuck a dagger right down in the heart of Kildare with Carbury, Windmill Cross, Kilpatrick and Donadea.  I am quite prepared to accept that Lullymore was a genuine mistake because I do not think it was realised when looking at the map that the canal was there between the two. I make no case for Lullymore more than that.  It was a genuine mistake. Because of the canal it had to be brought back because otherwise one would have had to travel into the polling district of Kilmeague North in order to go anywhere.  It would not be worthwhile putting a booth in Lullymore for 52 voters.  However if the contiguity argument was to be made what was being moved would have been entirely different.  These areas go right down into the centre of Kildare so a wedge was deliberately inserted there for the purpose of ensuring that Deputy Crinion standing in the Meath constituency would have a nice bloc of home votes all round.  It did not work that way, whether it was because of the intricacies and the power grabs within the Fianna Fáil Party or not.  The only point I want to make is that the people in those areas can blame Deputy Crinion and no one else for being transferred out of their home county.</P>

      <P>I was going on to point out, when I was unnecessarily interrupted, that the adjustment between East and West Limerick constituencies is made purely and simply because of the fact that the Census of Population carried out in 1966 disclosed that the population of West Limerick is now 54,335 and that this figure divided by <Col N="468" /> three, which is the number of Deputies for the area, would not be in accordance with the constitutional provision. On the other hand, the population of East Limerick is 83,022 and these two figures added together give 137,357 which is sufficient for seven seats, just barely, and therefore it is not necessary to go outside the boundaries of County Limerick in order to adjust the situation. However, this slight disruption of the boundary between the two Limerick constituencies is necessary in order to comply with the Constitution. I think anybody would agree that the place at which the adjustment is made is the most logical place to make such an adjustment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In Longford-Westmeath area there is a transfer of Athlone urban to Roscommon. Athlone urban has been traditionally associated with Longford-Westmeath. I gave the Minister figures yesterday to show that this transfer of Athlone urban to the north-west counties, taking them as a group, was unnecessary and that as we agreed to accept some four-seater constituencies, three four-seat constituencies on the western seaboard, it would be unnecessary to move the population of Athlone urban into the western counties.</P>
      <P>For example, I mentioned that Roscommon itself could stand as a single constituency by just bringing in Taghboy and Ahascragh.  These are two small areas, Taghboy with 290 votes and Ahascragh with 663 votes.  That small number of 953 people taken from Galway would allow Roscommon a single three-seat constituency which is a far better arrangement than what the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, Galway, even after giving some to Clare, could remain and have sufficient population to form West Galway as a three-seater and East Galway as a four-seater.  Similarly also, you could have Donegal as two three-seaters and Sligo-Leitrim as a four-seater, and there would be a transfer <Col N="470" /> of only a little over 5,000 of population out of Leitrim.  The Minister has argued here that we gave him no proper suggestions and that, in effect, we did not know what we were talking about.  I have given details, so far as one can in a debate, of all the transfers that may be made and the populations and the amount of transferred population outside administrative areas in the scheme which I put to him was less than one-sixth of the transferred population under his global scheme of ten three-seaters.  The alternative I suggested of three four-seaters and six three-seaters, leaving reasonable constituencies of reasonable size and manageability and paying respect to administrative areas, would leave something like 9,000 people transferred.</P>
    <P>In fact it is possible, as regards the entire country, to merge constituencies and give reasonable results with a transfer of population outside of administrative areas of something a little over 19,000&mdash;I have totted the figures since&mdash;as against his figure of 101,000. I admit it would pare things rather fine but it is possible to elect 30 Deputies from the area I mentioned, the western seaboard, the north western counties, without impinging at all on Athlone urban.  I realise that this quite unnecessary transfer is being done for political purposes and in the interests of a specific Minister but it is not necessary under the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Yes, but this movement of urban population from Longford-Westmeath, this moving of the Athlone urban population, is being done to get the necessary population for all that group area. Under the method which the Minister has used he has found it necessary, and will be able to argue statistically that it is necessary, to move that population into the western seaboard, if you call it that, in order to provide the ten three-seat <Col N="471" /> constituencies.  If he were prepared to accept an arrangement of six three-seaters instead of ten, and three four-seaters, which would give the same representation to all these counties west of Athlone, it could be done without moving the urban population of Athlone into that area.  I can give him the areas and the figures whereby he can still have three seats in West Galway, four seats in East Galway, still retain four seats in Clare, four seats in Longford-Westmeath and have his two three-seaters in Donegal.  Mayo does not come into it because it is an internal rearrangement that is being made there. This is statistically quite possible under the Constitution, but apparently the Minister does not want to hear of it that way and wants to proceed to establish ten three-seat constituencies.  To do that, you have to drag in Athlone urban which, as I have shown, is quite unnecessary.  I can give the figures again, if he wants them, showing how all these arrangements can be made within the Constitution.</P>

      <P>It is situated west of the Shannon and in fact Athlone west urban is the county town for a large part of South Roscommon.  The Athlone No. 2 rural district is, in fact, in the administrative county of Roscommon and it is to this part of Athlone that is west of the Shannon that all the people of that area of Clonowen, Drumlash and Taghmaconnell and Curraghboy and so on come to do their business.  It is looked upon, and always has been looked upon, as the county town for that part of south Roscommon.  In fact, Athlone west urban is known locally as Irishtown, that part of Athlone west of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still adhering to the Shannon boundary in that particular area. Deputy Hogan says he gave me figures <Col N="472" /> but he gives incomplete figures.  We must consider this in the context of the whole western area and in the context of the average of population per Deputy.  Deputy Hogan keeps putting forward this alternative of the transfer of Taghboy and Ahascragh from Galway to Roscommon but, of course, that transfer is from Galway.</P>
    <P>The Athlone west urban area is traditionally associated with that part of South Roscommon which is roughly divided by the Athlone No. 2 rural district, and there is nothing anomalous in it.  It is a rationalisation rather than anything else.</P>

However, he has treated the spread of population so generously, having liquidated Leitrim completely and having treated Roscommon so harshly, he has left himself without population and he had to draw on Athlone in order to redraft Roscommon.  It suited him to do this also for political reasons.  Had he desired to confine himself to the counties concerned, he would have found sufficient population, though it would have been cheeseparing, without using Athlone west urban.  He could have left most of the counties concerned intact. He has wiped Leitrim completely off the map and has cut up Roscommon.</P>

      <P>The point of dividing it east and west now is to prevent the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health being in the same constituency. Again, as in many other constituencies, the traditional pattern is being changed simply and solely to suit Fianna Fáil.  There is no other reason. We all know it and it is perfectly patent on its face.  The more one examines this Bill the more one sees that it was drawn up by the Minister purely for personalities in his own Party and not in pursuance of the national interest.</P>

      <P>In consideration of certain circumstances to which I do not at present propose to refer, I have not participated actively in this debate regarding the realignment of constituencies, particularly that which I have the honour to represent, but when the issue of Mayo arises, and when Deputy Gilbride, who is an experienced Deputy, intervenes to say that East Mayo was for a considerable time incorporated in Sligo, I think the voice of protest must be raised.  I never remember any time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suppose the time has come when my memory might be called into question.  I do not think, however faulty it may have become with the passage of time, that it fails me now.  I have lived personally and vicariously in the constituency of Mayo for almost 100 years now and it has never been part of Sligo as far as I know.  My father represented it from 1883 to 1918.  Mr. de Valera represented it after that, having defeated my father in 1918, and East Mayo was a constituent part of Mayo down the years.</P>
      <P>I intervene at this stage of the Bill in relation to Mayo and the handling of the county for reasons which I think Deputy Sweetman has rightly pointed out.  This is a device employed by the Minister for Local Government to separate Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Health, from Deputy Moran, the Minister for Justice.  One can fully sympathise with the Minister for Local Government in his desire to separate these two Deputies because their contiguity in the past has given rise to more than one dramatic incident in the electoral history of this country.  As a Mayo man, I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that, apart from the immediate political gerrymandering that is being carried on in various areas in the country, I think those of us who are concerned with public decency ought in respect of the areas where they are ordinarily resident &mdash;Mayo is that for me&mdash;to register a protest against the form of this Bill and its Schedule.  I am prepared to stake my reputation that there is in the Department of Local Government at this moment a draft Bill for the redistribution made necessary by the previous census which would have breached virtually no county boundaries and that the Minister for Local Government has rejected that draft preferring to bring in this crazy patchwork for the purpose of wreaking vengeance on the people because they turned down the Government proposals in the referendum.</P>

      <P>That is the fact.  There is a healthy local patriotism amongst our people.  They like to be associated with the counties to which they have traditionally belonged.  I understand that in this proposed redistribution Ballaghaderreen is being moved back to Roscommon.  Ballaghaderreen constitutes part of County Mayo and has done so from time immemorial.  The first time it was ever transferred to Roscommon was for the purposes of parliamentary elections subsequent to 1918.  It is an interesting thing to note that, when the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed by the British House of Commons for the purposes of local administration, the area of Ballaghaderreen was moved to Roscommon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I am aware of. Neither Dr. Farren, whom I never heard of before, nor any other doctor represented Sligo or East Sligo.  It is interesting to remember that, for the purposes of local government, the British House of Commons transferred part of what had been the administrative county of Roscommon for parliamentary purposes; they recognised the traditional loyalties of people to their own county and they left Ballaghaderreen in the constituency of East Mayo.  It was for that reason that the famous anti-conscription meeting was addressed by my father and the father of Deputy Vivion de Valera in Ballaghaderreen 51 years ago, because it was part of the constituency of East Mayo, which was then the constituency of the Leader of the Irish Party in the person of my late father.  I think the present procedure shows a vindictive desire to affront our people because they asserted their right in the referendum to reject the radical proposal the Government put forward anent the crooked vote and the single seat condu <Col N="477" /> stituency.  I think that is all wrong. I think it is indicative of the vicious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy may say it is nonsense, but I ask the Deputy to reflect and to ask himself why it is <Col N="478" /> that this Government of the Republic take a different line in regard to this matter from that taken by the Imperial Parliament in Westminster 70 years ago.  Why did the Imperial Parliament 70 years ago, at a time when it would have been convenient to put Ballaghaderreen into Roscommon for county council purposes, not do so?  Why did they say to themselves that these people look upon themselves as Mayo people and why did they decide they should be left in Mayo for parliamentary representation? I think it was because they recognised traditional loyalties. The Bill before us at the moment, which is designed at butchering the county, is not drafted for the purpose of securing satisfactory parliamentary representation.  It is drafted as a kick in the teeth because the people refused to respond to the crack of the Fianna Fáil whip and the Fianna Fáil majority in this House.  I think that is wrong. I deplore it.  The Government have a majority in Dáil Éireann and they will be able to force this Bill through.  Mark you, there is an uneasy tittering amongst Fianna Fáil Deputies; I do not mind Deputy Booth because he lives down in Monkstown, or somewhere, and he does not know what is happening in the country, and never will, but the Deputy from West Galway &mdash;I do not see any smile on his face&mdash; and the Deputy from Sligo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am at present engaged in a review of the organisation of the Garda Síochána and have reached a tentative conclusion to accept the advice of the Commissioner that about 30 of the 750 stations in the country ought to be closed.</P>
      <P>A redistribution of manpower in the Garda Síochána is long overdue having regard to the changes that have taken place during the past 40 years in population, in the incidence of crime, in local traffic densities and so on. There has also been a great improvement in roads and in travel and communication facilities.  Further, the expansion of the Garda transport fleet and the more efficient radio and telephone networks which operate within the Garda Síochána are also reasons for the redistribution of strengths.</P>
      <P>In the case of each one of the stations which are recommended for closing, the Commissioner has certified that the centre in question can be policed from adjoining stations with a saving of manpower and without loss of efficiency.  The Commissioner has been pressing for substantial increases, as a matter of urgency, in the number of Gardaí at some larger centres of population, to deal with crime and traffic problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why the requirement that travel cards be returned at the age of 70 in certain instances should be regarded as an insult; it is in no <Col N="488" /> way intended as such.  When the free travel scheme for veterans of the War of Independence was introduced last year it was made clear in all relevant statements and Press advertisements that the scheme would not apply to persons eligible for similar concessions under the scheme for old age pensioners already in operation and administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Payment to the appropriate transport organisations is made by my Department in respect of the provision of free travel facilities for veterans and by the Department of Social Welfare in respect of old age pensioners.  When the holder of a travel card qualifies for an old age pension, his pension book entitles him to free travel under the Department of Social Welfare scheme.  If his travel card were not withdrawn and cancelled, public funds would be liable for a duplicate payment in respect of the provision of travel facilities in his case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is a fact that, as a consequence of the system of compensation for cost-of-living increases awarded to serving civil servants in 1964 being withheld from officials who had already retired, there are now several different rates of pension varying by over 30 per cent being paid to persons who retired from exactly the same position with exactly the same qualifications and responsibilities; and, if so, if he will investigate the possibility of taking any steps to eliminate such anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As pensions are based on retiring pay and as pensioners in the same grades have retired on different pay levels the amounts of their pensions differ.  However, pension increases granted up to 1st August, 1967, resulted in all civil servants receiving pensions equivalent to not less than rates based on seventh round pay levels.  These amounts were further increased by 28¼ per cent, so providing full compensation for the rise in the consumer price index from December 1959, when the seventh round pay increase was granted, to June 1966, the date of the tenth round.  The 5 per cent increase in pensions given last year has brought the percentage up to almost 35 per cent.  Pensioners who retired on or after the eighth round pay increase of November, 1961, but before the ninth round of February <Col N="497" /> 1964 have, in general, had their pensions increased by about 28 per cent, being the rise in the consumer price index between the eighth and tenth round pay increases, plus 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>These increases have applied to other branches of the public service as well as to civil servants and they compare very favourably with practice outside the public service.  The question of further increases is a matter for consideration in the context of the budgetary position.</P>

      <P>This matter has already received full consideration by my Department.  The children in question reside 3.6 miles from Whitechurch National School and only 2.1 miles from Rathduff national school. Accordingly, under the rules governing <Col N="508" /> the operation of primary school transport services, transport cannot be provided for these children to Whitechurch school since it is not their nearest national school.</P>

Indeed, in very many cases, pupils up to the age of 16 years pay less than they did formerly.  This has been possible because my Department is paying a special subsidy to CIE at an annual rate estimated at £130,000.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of the fare structure of CIE, however, pupils over 16 years who are not entitled to free transport are charged adult fares and these fares carry the recent increase of 12½ per cent.

I have nothing to add to that statement except to remind the Deputy that the total remuneration which is now being offered to a secondary teacher here is £161 per annum more than has been offered to the comparable teacher in England in the past week.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECONDARY TEACHERS' STRIKE.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education feels that he would be lacking in his responsibility towards the public if he were not to place the following facts before them:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> (1)  A teachers' salaries tribunal was established in December, 1967, with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  To recommend a common basic scale of salary for teachers in national, secondary and vocational schools.</P>
    <P>(b)  To recommend what appropriate additions might be made to the basic scale in respect of qualifications, length of training, nature of duties, etc.</P>
    <P>All three groups of teachers agreed to the establishment of this Tribunal and presented their individual cases in fullest detail to the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Tribunal reported in April, 1968, and recommenced a common basic scale for all teachers, with additions in respect of qualifications and length of training, and with allowances, heavily weighted in favour of secondary teachers, for posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Government accepted the findings of the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Association of Secondary Teachers, having previously expressed dissatisfaction with the recommendations of the Tribunal, submitted a separate salary claim on the 23rd September, 1968.</P>
    <P>(5)  As the salary scales for all three groups of teachers fell to be discussed in the light of the tribunal findings, and having regard to the 11th round general wage increase, discussions between the Minister and representatives of these three groups took place on 4th, 10th and 18th October, 1968. Separate discussions with the teachers and managers of secondary schools took place on 14th and 15th October, 1968.</P>
    <P>(6)  Arising out of these discussions a formal offer comprising a common basic scale and additional allowances for qualifications and posts of responsibility was made to national, secondary and vocational teachers.  This offer was accepted by the national and vocational teachers but was rejected on the 18th November, 1968, by the secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>(7)  On the 20th November, 1968, <Col N="513" /> the Association of Secondary Teachers was informed that the proposals for a common basic scale of salary necessarily involved a single scheme of conciliation and arbitration for all teachers and that the Minister considered that the acceptance of the proposals by the national teachers and the vocational teachers precluded the possibility of a claim for a separate salary scale for secondary teachers being considered independently of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>(8)  On the 16th December, 1968, a further communication was addressed to the secondary teachers in which the facts referred to at (7)  were repeated. It was suggested that discussions be held with representatives of the secondary teachers' conciliation panel with a view to facilitating arrangements for a three-sided meeting between <Col N="514" /> managers, teachers and official representatives. No reply was received to that communication.</P>
    <P>(9)  At the request of the Council of Managers of Catholic Secondary Schools the Minister met representatives of the School Managers and the ASTI on 16th January, 1969.  Arising out of the discussions at that meeting it was arranged that a meeting of the Secondary Teachers Conciliation Council be convened on 17th January, 1969. The Council met on that date and subsequent meetings were held on 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 27th January, 1969.</P>
    <P>(10)  The outcome of these meetings was that proposals were framed which resulted in the scales of salary and allowances set forth in the following tables:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Column A. figures include non-pensionable element of £80 for Probationer to £200 at maximum of scale.</P>
    <P>Column D.  figures are all pensionable.</P>
    <P>Additional allowances varying from £100 to £175 would be payable for honours qualifications.</P>
    <P>(11)  It will be seen that these proposals involved in the case of women and single men increases in total remuneration of 13% at the minimum and 21% at the maximum, including the allowance for definable responsibility. The respective increases for married men would be 14% and 19%. In weekly terms a single man or woman could have a total remuneration of £35 (an increase of £6) and a married man a total of £42 (an increase of over £6.10).  It will be readily seen that for probationer teachers the percentage increases are very much greater.</P>
    <P>(12)  In connection with the claim of the ASTI that it should continue to be given private arbitration notwithstanding the recommendation in the Report of the Teachers Salaries Tribunal that there should be a common Scheme of Concilliation and Arbitration for all teachers, the ASTI must be aware that the other two groups of teachers have already made it clear that they are not prepared to tolerate <Col N="516" /> a position in which matters vitally affecting them would be discussed and decided upon by any form of machinery in which they were not involved.  The Minister for Education must accept that matters like levels of work and allowances for qualifications are such as should not be decided by an Arbitrator hearing only one group of teachers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Minister is concerned that there should be mobility within the teaching service in the interests of education generally and that this will never be achieved if each group of teachers proceeds separately. This has been recognised long ago in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland where there is a common scale of salary and allowances for qualifications and posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear to the ASTI that he is prepared to arrange for immediate arbitration on their claim provided right of hearing is given to the other two teacher groups. There could be no question in connection with such arbitration of any group of teachers being outvoted by other groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> The Minister feels that the scales of remuneration now proposed are such as to make strike action on the part of the secondary teachers wholly unjustifiable.  He must deplore the fact that this action will deprive the pupils who must be his first concern of their education.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed.  We must be very responsible about this matter.  I would refer the Deputy to the very detailed submissions and the factual survey of the whole situation which appeared by way of public advertisement in the two Sunday national newspapers last Sunday. As it happened, the Burnham Commission of Britain has been sitting for some time on the question of the teachers' salaries in Britain and they came out with their recommendations on the 31st January.  That report also appeared over the weekend.  They synchronised. Our maximum levels which were put in the form of proposals to the Association of Secondary Teachers (Ireland) run ahead of the proposals in the Burnham Commission Report for England and Wales.  Our maxima run ahead of theirs by £161.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that at all levels the increases do not run below £3 10s per week and range from that up to £6 10s per week. We are talking in terms here, percentage-wise, of increases that range from 12 and 13 per cent up to 65 per cent at the early level.  We are talking here in terms of a substantial offer which we made.  Furthermore, I want to say that it has been made clear, on television and in the public press by the Association of Secondary Teachers that the money is not at issue at all. This has been made quite plain and in fact has been said by their spokesman. It comes down to one question, the hub of which is: will they agree to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Vocational Teachers' Organisation sitting around a table at arbitration to make their case on an equal basis with the secondary teachers' case without any prejudice to the secondary teachers putting their claim and not being outvoted in any way by the representatives of the other bodies? All that is involved is the elementary, democratic right of all teaching bodies making their case before agreed arbitration.</P>

A further medical certificate was due on 19th December, 1968 and there is no doubt but that this was handed in in due time at the local office.  After that, and despite the special steps which are taken each year to guard against the possibility of interruption or delay in payment of benefit over the Christmas period, this particular certificate went astray or was mistreated in some way which it has not been possible to determine.  The result was that no further payment was made until 27th December when the two weeks benefit due were paid.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only increases in the price of coke approved by me since 1st January, 1967, have been for the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company, the Monaghan Lighting Co. Ltd. and, in the case of Welsh Foundry coke, the Dublin Coal Importers.</P>
      <P>As regards the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company the price of coke on the 1st January, 1967, was £10. 16s. 0d. per ton.  An increase of £1. 0s. 0d. per ton was allowed on 19th February, 1968.  This increase was due to the effect of devaluation on the price of Polish coal.  A further increase of £1. 9s. 0d. per ton was allowed on the 19th December, 1968.  This increase arose from the fact that oil has now largely replaced coal in the manufacture of gas and the company has to supplement its own production of coke with dearer imported coke, all coke being sold by the company at an average price of £13. 5s. 0d. a ton.</P>
      <P>As regards the Monaghan Lighting Co. Ltd. the price on the 1st January, 1967, was £10. 0s. 0d. per ton.  An increase of £3. 11s. 3d. was allowed on the 14th August, 1967 due to the fact that the company changed over from coal to propane in the production of gas, and coke had to be obtained from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Welsh foundry coke sold by the Dublin Coal Importers the price on the 1st January, 1967, was £17. 9s. 0d. per ton.  An increase of £1. 6s. 0d. per ton was allowed on <Col N="528" /> 29th January, 1968.  This increase arose from an increase in the f.o.b. price by the British National Coal Board.  A further increase of 4s. 6d. per ton was approved on the 11th December, 1968, due mainly to wage increases.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have gathered that there are different prices for different grades of coke.  I think he may have missed the point in regard to the supply of coke by the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company which is that there is a demand which <Col N="529" /> they have to meet and with the switching over to oil they are producing less and less coke themselves and in order to meet the demand which still exists but is decreasing they have to import coke to supplement what they produce themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the Minister's reply will he now take steps to see that all native coke which is the by-product of coal from gasworks will be utilised before any imports are allowed because we have the experience in Limerick that at the Limerick Corporation Gas Works we have mountains of coke and we cannot get rid of it.  Would the Minister like to comment?  I am not pressing him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am aware of in regard to the situation in Limerick is that the price of coke from 1st January, 1967, was £12 5s per ton and that has been increased to £14 due to an increase in wages and coal prices. I am not aware that there is any surplus of coke available.  In fact as the Deputy will be aware with the switchover in most places to oil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to his question which was answered in Dáil Éireann on the 20th March, 1968.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission has all the powers necessary for performing its statutory duties of reviewing the conditions which obtain in the supply and distribution of goods and of carrying out investigations where these are necessary.  I see no need at present to add to these powers or to establish an additional body.  I am, however, keeping myself informed of developments in the distributive trades in general and in supermarkets in particular, and if the situation appears to require it at any stage I will be prepared to consider what measures may be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  I furnished the deputation with information in regard to inquiries I had been making over a period.  The Deputy will appreciate that one of the difficulties here is lack of precise information.  For this purpose, I set up some time ago in my Department a research section to get <Col N="539" /> information on this.  I gave the deputation some results of that research and indicated some further action I proposed to take.  In turn, they will give me some further information.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Fair Trade Commission have refused to investigate complaints of favoured treatment being given to selected traders such as advantageous advertising campaigns, special promotions, handbacks and special discounts and that the Fair Trade Commission have indicated either that they are powerless or, if not powerless, indifferent to these practices which are far greater than the type of restrictive practice which presumably was in the minds of the legislators when the Fair Trade Commission was originally set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct in the way he describes the attitude of the Fair Trade Commission to this matter.  It is true that there have been difficulties in investigating these matters.  Indeed, this was part of the items I had investigated, through my Department, when trying to obtain necessary information about the kinds of practices of which the Deputy complains.  This is the kind of information which it is extremely difficult to obtain.  As I have indicated, in so far as there are any results available at the moment, I do not think it would be wise or prudent at this stage to make the information public.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy means that, at a time when, if we had complete free trade, tyres could come in free from somewhere else and that, in those circumstances, we would allow in tyres from those countries but not allow these people to sell on the home market, well, that is something we ought to consider when that situation arises. <Col N="543" /> The Irish company are carrying out a rationalisation of their production. They will be selling certain kinds of tyres on the home market and also not been doing to any substantial degree heretofore.  It is possible that tyres, required for the home market, will not be made by the company and it is possible that this new company will be asked to supply them, in which case I should not be disposed to refuse but it will not be to the detriment of the Irish company.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the increase follows the introduction at the end of 1967 of agreed arrangements under which facilities for the importation of built-up vehicles at reduced rates of duty are being afforded in return for assurances by the firms concerned as to the maintenance of the assembly industry on a long-term basis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce how long it takes the Companies Office to approve draft memoranda and articles of association lodged there; the reasons for the growing delays; and what steps will be taken to shorten the period to meet the reasonable requirements of persons seeking to incorporate companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Draft Memoranda and Articles of Association are usually approved by the Companies Office within three to four weeks.  Cases which are stated to be urgent are given priority and are generally available within a week.</P>
      <P>The reason for the growing delay is the increasing volume of work in the Office.  Additional accommodation is being sought as a matter of urgency to enable additional staff to be provided to deal with the increase, and every effort is being made to ensure that the Office is adequately equipped to meet the requirements of persons seeking to incorporate companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly like to pay a tribute to the efficiency and courtesy of the staff in the Companies Office.  No reflection was intended in tabling the question.  I wonder would the Minister say whether, in arriving at the estimate of an average of three to four weeks, the cases which were given special expedition were brought into consideration?  My information and experience is that the normal period for some time past has been up to eight <Col N="547" /> weeks.  It should not require that special treatment be given to some people who make particular representations. Everybody should be treated equally and nobody should be taken out of turn.  Would the Minister ensure that we would return to the happy situation which he must have experienced in his time in private practice when memoranda would be approved within a fortnight of being lodged without any special representations being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of three to four weeks is the figure made available to me in regard to ordinary cases.  The period suggested for those where urgent priority is requested is one week.  I would agree with the Deputy that it would be more desirable that all cases should be treated in the same way but I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that certain circumstances can arise where, if there was to be a delay of three to four weeks, considerable difficulties could ensue for the people concerned and in those circumstances I would prefer to think that the Companies Office would exercise a discretion and get the cases through faster. The Deputy, I am sure, will appreciate from my reply that the problem is additional accommodation.  We cannot fit any more staff into the premises available. We are anxious to locate the Office in the general vicinity of where it is for the convenience of those who deal with the Office.  This is being pursued as a matter of urgency but we must get other accommodation before we can increase the size of the staff further.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might also be interested to know that the number of new companies registered in recent years has been going up steadily.  In 1965 it was 1,157, in the next year 1,166, in the following year 1,359 and last year it was 1,991, which is, of course, a fairly accurate reflection of the increasing prosperity of the economy brought about by this Government.</P>

      <P>Since early October, 1968, when I became aware of the possibility of the new, A/2Hong Kong/ 68, strain of influenza virus reaching this country, my Department has been in close contact with health authorities in the matter.</P>

    <P>Chief Medical Officers were advised to keep the situation in their areas under review; to make arrangements <Col N="549" /> so that they would have early warning of any untoward rise in the incidence of influenza; to make the public aware of the simple precautions they could take to prevent the spread of infection and reduce the risk of complications.</P>
    <P>In the meantime my Department had been making every effort to obtain supplies of the special vaccine against the Hong Kong strain.

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Health the social welfare pensioners from whom deductions are made in public institutions; whether there is a standard practice between one health authority and another; if not, if he will state in respect of each health authority where such deductions are being made for (a) county homes, (b) county hospitals and (c) district hospitals the amounts being deducted in each case; and if he will now consider abolishing these charges or deductions at least in regard to old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons in receipt <Col N="551" /> of non-contributory social welfare pensions are, in general, members of the lower income group and as such are entitled to hospital services free of charge.  The circumstances of some persons in receipt of contributory pensions may be such that they would be regarded as being in the middle income group and liable for a hospital charge which would not normally exceed 10/- a day.</P>
      <P>Deductions from Social Welfare pensions may, however, be made in the case of those pensioners who are in receipt of institutional assistance, that is, shelter and maintenance, and these deductions, are made in accordance with the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965.  These regulations provide that where a person while receiving institutional assistance is in receipt of an income in money exceeding £1 per week, he may be required, out of so much of the income as exceeds £1 per week, to contribute such amount as the health authority consider appropriate towards the cost incurred by the health authority in providing him with institutional assistance.</P>
      <P>The decision as to whether a charge is made in any individual case is a matter for the health authority concerned. I am asking each health authority to furnish information as to the basis on which deductions from income are made in respect of pensioners maintained in their institutions.</P>
      <P>In determining income for purposes of the Institutional Assistance Regulations, the health authority is required to deduct amounts payable for items such as rent, rates, insurance, etc.  In view of the wide safeguards against hardship provided for in the regulations, I consider that there are no grounds for abolishing the charges altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of allottees is a matter that is exclusively reserved to the Commissioners.  I am informed that the County Sligo property on which the disappointed applicant mentioned in the Question sought an allocation contained 59 acres, the bulk of which was allotted to four adjacent smallholders in March, 1966. As is commonly the case where land is being divided, the area available fell far short of meeting the demand and, regrettably, some applicants had to be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who received an allotment of 27 acres was a married man in his late thirties with four young children.  His existing lands comprised 12 acres, valuation £12 3s, and he was reported to have the use of a 43 acre <Col N="559" /> holding &mdash; mostly poor quality land &mdash; valuation £9 5s over two miles away. Thus, the total valuation of all the lands owned or used by this allottee would amount to less than £22.</P>
    <P>The disappointed applicant referred to by the Deputy was a middle-aged married man with no children living on a holding of £5 15s valuation.  In April, 1966, following the division of the lands in question, he had an interview with an official in the Land Commission. At this interview his case was fully discussed and he was given a full and fair explanation as to why his application was not successful in the competition for the limited area of land available.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, one of the successful applicants surrendered the division &mdash; 12 acres &mdash; given to him and in February 1968 this area was allotted to the disappointed applicant.  At that <Col N="560" /> stage he had a nephew aged about 15 living with him for over a year.</P>
