    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a publication by An Chomhairle Ealaíon called <i>Modern Irish Painting</i> in which the 1916-22 war against the British is described as a senseless war; and, if so, what action he intends to take in regard to this publication in view of the fact that the Government appointed six nominees on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 3 of the Arts Act, 1951, it is a matter for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, by such means and in such manner as they think fit, to stimulate public interest in the arts, to promote the appreciation and improve the standards of the arts and to organise exhibitions of works of art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a copy of the publication mentioned which is a catalogue of An Chomhairle Ealaíon's travelling exhibition of modern Irish paintings: the words referred to are contained in an introduction to the works of the late Jack B. Yeats contributed over his own name by the writer concerned, who&mdash;it is understood from the council&mdash;is an authority on the artist's works.  The council inform me that the inclusion of the introduction in the catalogue does not, in the circumstances, imply any responsibility by the council for the views expressed therein, that these opinions are the writer's own and that, as may be inferred from the context of the words, the writer's adverse views on <Col N="2012" /> war are of a general nature and are not related only to the history of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the words &ldquo;senseless war&rdquo; refer to the 1916-1922 war in Ireland; and, as the Arts Council are sponsoring this tour of works of art in Scandinavian countries, that they should have edited this publication so as not to give a false impression?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the reference is obviously to the 1916-22 period.  I agree also it should have been edited. I believe it was, in fact, but that because the person who edited it thought the writer's views should not be abridged in any way, he left the reference in the script.  I think it was unfortunate and that it should have been excised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the unusually high incidence of infective respiratory tract illnesses in the Ballymun housing development; that this has led to considerable loss of earnings and expenditure on drugs by the people affected; and of complaints that this is attributed to the existing heating system; if he will carry out a survey to ascertain if this is so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has any information of any survey carried out abroad by any official body, including international health organisations, which indicates a <Col N="2014" /> link between central heating and the increased incidence of upper respiratory tract illnesses, including the common cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is a link between central heating and increased incidence of upper respiratory tract illnesses.  I am not aware of any survey carried out abroad by any official body which would indicate such a link nor, indeed, am I aware of an unusually high incidence of respiratory tract illnesses in the Ballymun housing development. Moreover, the chief medical officer of the Dublin Health Authority who has responsibility for the public health in the Dublin area is not aware of an increase in illness in the Ballymun flats as alleged.  I do not feel called upon, therefore, to take any special action in the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's reference to considerable expenditure on drugs by the people affected I would remind him that people who are not eligible for general medical services cards may be given drugs and medicines, free of charge if, in the health authority's opinion, it would cause them undue hardship to meet the cost privately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the University of Zurich have carried out research on upper respiratory tract illnesses associated with central heating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not seen that particular report but the engineers involved informed us that in the planning of central heating they took account of the latest British and Continental authoritative opinion in relation to the heating of high-rise buildings, and that, having regard to the general conditions of humidity in this country in ordinary times, they did not feel that any special action needed to <Col N="2015" /> be taken.  This report from Zurich must be a very isolated one because we have no such records in our Department, although we have access to a wide variety of reports on medical research from all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If an independent survey were carried out in the Ballymun flats as distinct from Ballymun houses where they have control of central heating, and if an increase in upper respiratory tract infections in the region of 30 per cent is indicated, as reported from Zurich, would the Minister then suggest the provision of humidifiers in accordance with the recommendations of Zurich University?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not possibly take the Zurich authority as applying to this country.  I shall continue to rely on the advice of the chief medical officer of the Dublin Health Authority in regard to this.  If he should report that in his opinion there was an increase in the incidence of respiratory tract illnesses in the Ballymun housing area, that would have to be compared with other housing schemes of one kind or another where there is central heating in order to get any proper basis for consideration.</P>

      <P>Approval was given on 4th September, 1969, to the planning of a 280-bed hospital at Tralee.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the planning of a hospital of this magnitude will take some time.  It is not feasible at this stage to say with any certainty when it will be possible to commence building work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions to be decided.  Firstly, the total number of beds, which we think should be 280 and, secondly, whether beds for a certain number of disciplines are required more urgently than others. These are matters for planning and consultation between the health authority and my Department.  It is bound to take some time, as it does in the case of all hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister examine the proposals submitted by the Kerry County Council to provide a complement of 300 beds because the local authority are very anxious about the nurses' training school there?  At the moment they find it very hard to get nurses in the county.</P>

      <P>There are no funds available from which a direct grant can be provided by me towards the cost of such projects. Health authorities are empowered, however, under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, to give assistance, subject to Ministerial approval, to any voluntary agency which is providing accommodation of approved standards and meeting needs which otherwise would fall to be met by health authorities.  The usual contribution towards capital costs is within a limit of £600 for each place reserved for persons to be sent by such health authorities to the homes.  A contribution is made available from Exchequer sources towards the expenditure incurred by health authorities in assisting voluntary agencies who comply with requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated last Wednesday in reply to Deputies Burke and Fox, who are interested in hospitals in other parts of the country, the reorganisation of the hospital system on the basis of the general principles of the Fitzgerald Report will take considerable time and will involve heavy capital expenditure.  The first priority must be accorded to the pressing needs <Col N="2018" /> of Dublin and Cork and I have, therefore, not taken a decision on the detailed implementation of hospital changes in the midlands.  As I said last week an interim improvement in the hospital arrangements outside the cities must be achieved principally through closer association by neighbouring hospitals including some sharing of medical staff.  I have put this proposal to Offaly County Council and I look forward to their co-operation in implementing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as Offaly is situated in the centre of the country it would be ideal to take cases from the west and the north?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy I am not speaking frivolously when I say that, naturally and humanly, a great many people in a great many areas consider their particular hospital is central to the area around it.  On the basis of the Fitzgerald Report there are quite a number of towns in the midlands to be considered.  A number of towns in the midlands can make the case that they should be the centre.  If there is a modern hospital there, things can be argued one way or the other. Each pressure that is exercised has a contra effect on pressures from other areas.  The Deputy will realise the difficulties that any Minister for Health will experience in making a final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fitzgerald Report recommended Tullamore for a regional hospital; does the Minister accept that Tullamore is ideally situated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any decisions in regard to the Fitzgerald Report on county hospitals.  It is quite evident that the proposal in regard to Tullamore is one that has some validity; but if one accepts the pressures coming from other areas the case for a particular hospital being a centre alters, as I have already indicated. When one looks at the hospitals in the midland area &mdash; Kilkenny, Clonmel, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Mullingar and Roscommon&mdash;one can see there are plenty of headaches involved in making a decision and in trying to satisfy everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the increase in venereal diseases over the past three years; what the incidence of these diseases is in the Dublin area; and if he has any evidence to show a relationship between this increase and the increase in drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increase in the number of new cases of venereal disease undergoing treatment by health authorities over the past three years.  The number of such cases treated by Dublin Health Authority for the years 1966, 1967 and 1968 were&mdash;163, 242 and 404 respectively.</P>
      <P>I have no information to suggest that the increase in the numbers undergoing treatment is connected with drug addiction.</P>
      <P>The matter is at present under review in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the chief medical officer's report for 1968 shows there is a far higher incidence of new cases of venereal disease among the male section of the population of the Dublin area than amongst the female section?  It is possible to derive from that report that there is a pool source of infection amongst females which could possibly be related to those in the profession, namely, the prostitutes, operating in the Dublin Health Authority area.  Would the Minister consider compulsory examination of any lady of ill-repute who is arrested by the Garda Síochána to determine whether or not she has one of these contagious diseases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of very grave import.  A great number of issues are involved, including the Deputy's suggestion of court proceedings. This country has the lowest incidence of venereal diseases of all countries in Northern Europe.  It would be impossible for me to reply to the Deputy's question, apart from telling him that the matter is under review.  I can also tell him that we have ample facilities for the treatment <Col N="2021" /> of those suffering from those hideous diseases.  They can get free treatment. The diseases are notifiable.  More than that I do not propose to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if there are any records to show the number of accidents occurring to children as a result of playing with fireworks; if there is any law prohibiting the sale of fireworks to children under a certain age; if so, how it is enforced; and how many successful prosecutions have taken place in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics which would show the number of accidents occurring to children as a result of playing with fireworks are not collected in my Department.  There is no Act or other statutory instrument which precludes the sale of fireworks to children specifically.</P>
      <P>The general position in relation to fireworks is that they are not manufactured in this country and their import is prohibited except under licence issued by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>The quantity of surplus millable wheat of the 1968 crop amounted to approximately 91,000 tons.  All of this wheat has been purchased and paid for by An Bord Gráin.  Approximately 4,000 tons remain in stock at present.  This wheat is being sold as ordered.  At the beginning of the current cereal year the flour millers held stocks of 1968 crop native wheat amounting to approximately 75,000 tons as compared with a normal carryforward of 50,000 tons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that three nets were seized in the Kerry area in May, 1969, because they were overlength and, also, were found on board boats during the prohibited weekend close period.  Following examination of the circumstances in these cases, the Limerick board decided to reduce the nets to proper length and give them back for the time being, pending a court verdict on the alleged offences.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware that in two other cases of forfeiture of nets in the Kerry area, the nets were retained by the Limerick board but evidently a request was not made for their return on a similar temporary basis.</P>
      <P>Following court convictions in all five cases, the Limerick board have made recommendations to me on final disposal of the nets and these are being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some such complaints have been made.  The flats at Ballymun are heated by underfloor hot-water coils which are an integral part of the Balency system as adopted there.  It would not be practicable, at this stage, to provide for control of the temperature in individual flats.  The decision of Dublin Corporation not to have tenant-controlled heating was based, mainly, on capital cost considerations, and the need to provide the most efficient service, at the most economical cost to tenants.</P>

      <P>Private housing grants and subsidies for local authority housing paid by the Government and local authorities in 1967-68 and 1968-69 were £12,320,000 and £13,100,000, respectively.  Expenditure, financed largely by loans, on local authority housing, houses provided by the National Building Agency and other State agencies and on house purchase and reconstruction loans totalled £20,420,000 and £24,410,000 respectively in the same years.  The provision for these items in 1970-71 has not yet been settled but it is unlikely to be less than the sums mentioned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if as a matter of urgency he will introduce amending legislation to abolish the ground rents of the Proby Estate in the Constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown comprising (a) part of the lands of Bullock, Glasthule and Sandycove containing 345 acres, (b) part of the lands of Dalkey and Parkmore, containing 44 acres and (c) part of lands of Stillorgan and Newtown containing 852 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, provides, in effect, for the abolition of ground rents by enabling the lessee or tenant to purchase, compulsorily, the landlord's interest.  The Act applies to the bulk of tenancies covered by the Deputy's question. However, it has come to notice that the Act does not apply to a relatively small number of tenancies on the Proby Estate.  This matter was specifically dealt with by the Landlord and Tenant Commission in their second report, published last year.  I expect to bring my legislative proposals based on the commission's recommendations <Col N="2030" /> before the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>As I have explained to the House on previous occasions, the new legislation will not cover cases where tenants have already made binding agreements with the estate for the purchase of the fee simple or for a new lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask how the Minister in general reconciles his reply in defence of ground rents and the purchase of ground rents by people if they so wish, which is not very much availed of, with the much vaunted Republican aspects of his party, bearing in mind that this is to protect property of a questionable kind owned by the much maligned absentee landlords who have been periodically vilified by his party and who are now given such adequate defence in the context of ground rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first statement is a lie.  I am sorry.  It is untrue. This legislation was introduced for the purpose of enabling tenants to buy out their ground rents.  This legislation is being extended and expanded under the proposals I am now bringing before the Government.  As far as dealing with ground rents and landlords this party have a record that the Deputy or his party can never hope to touch or smell if they live for 1,000 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister says that the legislation has been expanded and amended how does he reconcile in equity the fact that some people have been caught by the legislation, as it previously was, within a period of two to three years before this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in connection with a few cases in this estate the people had freely made agreements to purchase their houses the same as people normally do and form agreements for new leases.  You could not have retrospective legislation to provide for those people getting their purchase money back because, to start off, it would be unconstitutional and, secondly, I believe it would be unfair and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously contend that agreements were, <Col N="2031" /> as he describes, freely made, when in fact, as he is aware from repeated submissions by those tenants and, indeed, by the leader of the other Opposition party, Deputy Cosgrave, that those agreements were entered into under considerable duress by the ground landlord concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who did not make agreements with the ground landlord concerned came within this legislation.  Some few people who had made those agreements, who had signed contracts and who had I understand paid over what they considered to be the value of the house concerned &mdash;there were a couple of houses involved at that time&mdash;had to live up to their contracts.  My information is those who did purchase got very good value.</P>

In so far as the Rent Restrictions Acts apply, the tenants being overcharged have, of course, a legal remedy.  Otherwise the amount of the rent is a matter for agreement between the parties.  The scope of rental control came under review as recently as 1967 during the debates on the Bill of the 1967 Rent Act. I have at present no proposals for legislation to extend rent control.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has any <Col N="2033" /> proposals for price stability in this country, as rising prices can produce undesirable inflationary conditions; if he is aware that living costs have outpaced social welfare payments; and what plans he has for a prices and incomes policy which is so urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As price increases are caused by a number of factors, many of which&mdash; such as the higher cost of imports&mdash; are not within our power to control, absolute price stability cannot be ensured by the Government.  If, for example, pay increases beyond the growth of national productivity are negotiated, price increases are, in practice, inevitable.  The Government's objective must be to keep price increases within the limit of unavoidable cost increases and, for this reason, they have recently extended the provisions of the Prices Stabilisation Order to 6 April, 1970.  Applications for price increases will be critically scrutinised by the Department of Industry and Commerce to see that firms have done everything possible, including bearing some of their higher costs out of profits, to keep increases to a minimum.</P>
      <P>It is quite incorrect to say that living costs have outpaced social welfare payments. As was indicated in the Budget Statement, the increases in those payments in recent years have been far in excess of the rise in the Consumer Price Index and have substantially raised the real value of those benefits.</P>
      <P>In regard to a prices and incomes policy, the Government are pressing ahead, on the lines indicated in Chapter 12 of the Third Programme, with their examination of the problems of achieving an effective policy.  In addition, the National Industrial Economic Council are currently considering the matter.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Labour and I have recently resumed our general discussions on the current economic situation with the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement of the President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to which the Deputy refers.  I do not agree that the Government have failed as suggested. On the incomes front, to which the <Col N="2035" /> statement referred at length, I would draw attention to a number of specific steps taken during this year.  First, there was the detailed statement issued by the Government on 24 January about increases in pay and other incomes in 1969.  Secondly, the Government made clear in March last the dangers of an extension of the maintenance settlement throughout the country.  Thirdly, the Minister for Labour and myself took the initiative in May to secure a reasonable Public Service Agreement weighted in favour of low paid workers.  Fourthly, we have recently resumed discussions on the current economic situation with the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the average rate of increase in incomes was of the order of 12 or 13 per cent last year and this year, whereas the average increase in prices was 6 or 7 per cent per annum?  This is a more rapid rate of inflation, as far as I am aware than the rate of inflation in any other country in Western Europe. Is the Minister not aware also, that this has been due in large part to the Government's failure to take any practical action arising out of the many recommendations of the NIEC in November, 1965, on incomes policy and would he now take some urgent action to implement those recommendations before the situation becomes critical?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that we have inflationary problems but at the same time I would point out to the Deputy that, as he knows quite well, the world at large is in the grip of one of the most widespread inflationary situations it has ever known.  This problem, as I have already indicated, is exercising the minds of the governments of all the developed countries. Our inflationary trend is a worry but it is not altogether out of line with what is happening around the world <Col N="2036" /> generally.  I do not agree that the Government have been inactive in this matter.  I think that one of the most useful and constructive things that have happened in this sort of situation in this country for a long time is the cooperation which we were able to achieve between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers earlier this year.  The type of agreement which we were able to reach for the public services generally should have set a headline for everybody concerned and I am not unhopeful that we may be able to do more as a result of these meetings that we are having at the present time.</P>

      <P>There was a situation in 1965 when Deputy FitzGerald, among others, demanded vociferously <Col N="2037" /> that the Government do something about the inflationary situation that was then developing.  When the Government did something about it, Deputy FitzGerald became equally vociferous in saying that we overreacted to the situation.  I have already said that the management of an economy is not a very easy business and it would be very misleading for the Deputies to suggest that some magic wand could be used to deal with all these problems.  The only thing we can do is to keep an eye on the situation and take whatever corrective action that appears to us to be necessary and appropriate at any time.  It is equally as bad to over-react to a situation as to do nothing about it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us how he regards the 16 per cent increase each year in Government expenditure?  Is that the action the Minister is talking about?  I do not agree with Deputy FitzGerald regarding increased incomes of 12 per cent which are a result of these large increases in prices brought about by the huge Government expenditure.  Surely the Minister is the man responsible for controlling Government expenditure but he has not done so in the past four years.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Agricultural Credit Corporation that no new restrictions on credit have been introduced and that there has been no recent change in the corporation's arrangements for collection of arrears and instalments.  I am satisfied that the corporation are prepared to issue loans for directly productive purposes to all farmers who are likely to benefit from the use of credit, and in fact the total of loans issued during the year ended 30th April, 1969, was £6.0 million compared with £4.5 million in the previous twelve months period. Loans are issued on favourable terms as to interest and repayment.  The corporation have always exercised considerable leniency as regards the collection of overdue instalments and there has been no change in this policy. I see no good reason for any modification of the corporation's present arrangements.</P>

Has the Minister any figures as to what amount of money was advanced to the farmers who applied since 18th June?  Further, is it not a fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are now devoting all their energies in endeavouring to get in the amounts of instalments and interest but that they are not bending their energies towards assisting farmers who have applied for loans in recent months?  I have experience of that and I can assure the Minister that there is a restriction on credit by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some few years ago we had to review the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation because we found they were lending money for the purchase of land which, in the view of many people, should have been directed into other channels. As a result of the examination made at that time certain restrictions were placed on the lending activities of the corporation.  These restrictions were designed mainly to ensure that the resources of the corporation were directed to productive agricultural purposes and not to less desirable purposes. Since that time there has been no addition to these restrictions at all. In fact in some instances they have been mitigated.  The resources made available to the corporation for the purposes as defined have been increased very considerably, with the result that they are now lending this year 50 per cent more than they did last year.  I have not the figures for this operation between now and June but I am satisfied that there is no falling off in the rate of lending.  If the Deputy has some particular cases which he considers meritorious and in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation have not been forthcoming, I would be happy to hear from him about them.  My own experience with the corporation is that they have been adopting a very sensible and very flexible attitude towards lending to farmers in general.</P>

The Deputy knows we brought in legislation recently which changed the method of operation of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in regard to the <Col N="2041" /> mechanics of making loans in order to facilitate their operation.  My recollection is that the county registrars' offices were involved in the simplification of procedure.  There is no change in their policy or in the tempo of their operations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The permissible size <Col N="2042" /> of the balance of payments deficit in any year depends on a number of factors such as the level of our external reserves, the size of the capital inflow, future external trading prospects and the extent to which the productive capacity of the economy is being expanded through investment.  The outlook for the current year is for a balance of payments deficit of the order of £55 million which is broadly in line with my Budget forecast.  In view of the continued high level of external reserves, the large net capital inflow, the sharp rise in investment and prospects for an improvement in the trade returns, a deficit of this order of magnitude in 1969 cannot be regarded as outside the permissible limits.  As I mentioned, however, in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 23rd October the fact must be faced that deficits of the size expected this year are not sustainable for long without seriously depleting our external reserves. The Government, therefore, will continue to review the situation and will take any appropriate measures to ensure that the balance of payments does not go outside acceptable limits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency was set up in 1960 as a company under the Companies Acts with the primary object of facilitating industrial expansion through the provision of houses and ancillary services where this need could not be met appropriately by local authorities or was not being catered for by private enterprise.  It was placed on a statutory basis by the National Building Agency Limited Act, 1963.  Two years later the scope of the agency's activities was extended to cover any housing or related operations which the Minister for Local <Col N="2053" /> Government might assign to it from time to time.</P>
    <P>The work of the agency now falls into three broad categories&mdash;the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion, the provision of houses for State employees whose duties involve occasional transfers of residence for them, and housing operations undertaken on behalf of local authorities.  It is with the first of these categories that this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>The agency's industrial housing service is comprehensive and extends to the acquisition of land, the design and planning of the scheme and the financing and construction of the houses. Within broad policy outlines determined by me, industrial housing is provided by the agency in consultation with the various Departments concerned, the Industrial Development Authority and the local housing authority.  Normally the dwellings are provided at the request of individual industries and are financed by way of mortgage loans, granted by the agency either to the firms or to nominated individual employees, and by the usual State and local grants.  A small proportion of houses is provided for letting.</P>
    <P>In the industrial growth centres of Galway and Waterford special arrangements have been made with An Foras Tionscal to provide industrial housing on a more general basis related to the anticipated growth of the industrial estates as a whole, rather than for specific industries.  As indicated in the recent White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> it is intended to extend these arrangements to the provision of housing for industry on a more general basis, to the order of the Industrial Development Authority.  A wider role is also envisaged for housing authorities in this field by the decision that houses built by the agency, in association with local authorities, for key workers in new or expanding industry should qualify for subsidy at the higher rate.</P>
    <P>The agency's operations for the provision of housing, and ancillary services related to industrial expansion, are financed by repayable advances made <Col N="2054" /> by the Minister for Finance under section 6 of the 1963 Act.  Provision is also made in section 7 of the Act for the Minister for Local Government to guarantee moneys borrowed for this purpose by the agency.  Under section 9 of the 1963 Act, the aggregate at any time of advances and guaranteed borrowing obtained by the agency and still unrepaid may not exceed £2 million. No guarantee has as yet been given under section 7, but the full amount of £2 million has been advanced to the agency under section 6.  The accounts of the agency are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>By the 30th September, 1969, a total of 751 houses for industry had been completed by the agency, 109 were then under construction and 378 were being planned.  It is estimated that further advances amounting to £3 million will be required over the next five years or or so to finance the agency's industrial housing activities, hence the proposal that the limit of £2 million specified by section 9 of the 1963 Act should be increased to £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be a relatively simple Bill.  The Minister has told us that he envisages increased and expanding activity in the National Building Agency and is seeking an extension of lending permission from £2 million to £5 million.  I am sorry that the information which has been made available by the National Building Agency in regard to their activities in general has been rather scant.  One would expect that an agency which engaged in such extensive activities, particularly over the last couple of years, would give more comprehensive information in their annual report than they do.  I had occasion to look up their annual reports dating back to 1960-61. They have submitted about eight reports and while it was understandable that they would not have as much information in the early reports I was surprised at how little one could glean from looking at them.  There was a question tabled yesterday by Deputy Bruton as to when the various reports were laid before the House and I have a copy of the reply here.  It states that in 1964 the report was produced on 3rd <Col N="2055" /> December; the report for 1965 was produced on 13th January, 1966; the report for 1966 was produced on 3rd February, 1967, and the reports for 1967 and 1968 respectively were both presented on the same day, 27th March, 1969.  I cannot understand why two different annual reports should be laid before the House on the same date. I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General audits these reports and I am sure he had completed his audit before then but, whether he had or not, the report for 1967 was not laid on the Table of the House for a year afterwards.</P>
      <P>Again, the report merely contains a balance sheet, an income and expenditure account and just one page from the managing director.  There is very little information as to where the houses are being built or the number in each area.  One would expect an agency handling some millions to state at least where the houses were built and how many in each area.  That kind of general information should be given. I would ask the Minister to ensure that the reports in future are not limited to just one page, a page which is a simple summary of the auditor's figures and fails to go into detail in relation to the housing activities in general of the National Building Agency.  I do not know whether some special report goes to the Minister, but this is the only one we were told about when Deputy Bruton put down this Parliamentary Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our duty to offer criticism of the activities of a body of this kind, particularly when such bodies come before the House looking for extra financial help.  I want to deal now with one particular instance in which the NBA was concerned in my constituency of South Tipperary.  I refer to the Ballingarry mines housing estate.  For many years these mines were under government management and considerable sums were spent on their operation.  Ultimately they were sold to the present proprietor.  They were an immediate success, providing good employment and good wages on a production basis. There was, however, always a difficulty about housing and buses had to bring <Col N="2056" /> workers for surrounding villages to Ballingarry.  Believing housing might help to solve labour difficulties, the proprietor approached South Tipperary County Council time and again but, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil is the largest political party in that local authority and the gentleman in question is a strong supporter of the party, the council could not be persuaded to provide houses.  The main objection came from the then county manager who believed that the provision of houses for one employer as against other employers was not justified.  He also took the view that if the mines failed&mdash;mining is a speculative business &mdash;one might be left with a number of houses on one's hands.  The proprietor failed to get the houses built by the county council.  With the advent of the National Building Agency, he presumably approached that body.  As far as mining was concerned, he was an excellent operator and he made a great success of the mines, having received, of course, considerable financial help in the way of grants from An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>Now the National Building Agency were not as optimistic as he was from the point of view of the number of houses the proprietor would be able to fill and they cut down his demand considerably but they did, however, build a number of houses outside the village of Killenaule.  A number of these houses are now unoccupied and are falling into decay.  A local agent is running around trying to get them off the agency's hands.  In South Tipperary we have not got the demand locally for these houses and no one from other parts of the local authority area is prepared to come in and take the houses, even through there are schools, shops and so forth in the area.  It looks as if they will be a drag on the hands of the NBA or on our hands if we purchase them.  I believe the building of these houses was an error on the part of the NBA, an error made in all good faith, perhaps, but an error which has created considerable local comment.  Because of the political associations of the man for whom the houses were built it is widely accepted that the National Building Agency were pressurised into building this housing estate for the <Col N="2057" /> Fianna Fáil proprietor of Ballingarry mines.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to elucidate one point in the reports and returns which I quite fail to understand.  I am not an accountant.  I understand the Minister is an experienced one and he may, perhaps, be able to help me.  The manager, Mr. Kearns, in the second last and in the last report gives a summary of the expenditure to date under the headings of State housing, local authority housing, health authority housing and industrial authority housing.  He gives a figure for State housing of £1,055,565; he gives a figure for local authority housing of £3,173,698; he gives a figure for health authority housing of £6,102 and for industrial housing as £105,086.  This makes a total figure of £4,340,451. Then, for 1967-68, the figure for local authority housing jumps from £3 million odd to £8 million odd.  I am unable to reconcile that figure with the audited returns and perhaps the Minister when replying will explain it to me because it would seem that if you are comparing like with like the figure should be £3,884,788.  I would ask the Minister if he would explain that because I was quite unable to understand it.  I am sure there is a good explanation for it.  Certainly, it is beyond me.</P>
    <P>This National Building Agency raises in a very pertinent form the entire question of the Minister's Department and the question of planning control.  There is a Bill coming before the House entitled Local Government (Planning and Development) No. 2 Bill, 1969, which has not yet been printed. I do not know whether the Minister in that Bill contemplates setting up some other authority to deal with planning appeals rather than his own Department and himself.  Here we have a National Building Agency.  I am jealous of the reputation of Government Departments and of administration generally, but I feel that here we have rather exposed ourselves.  We have a National Building Agency to which appointments of the directors are made by the Minister and made annually, I believe.  It is the Minister who is responsible for feeding this <Col N="2058" /> organisation with the necessary funds with which they operate.  This is an organisation which can buy up property, can develop property and can expend considerable amounts of money and yet this is an organisation which must subject itself to planning controls the same as every other enterprise, individual or local authority.  Local authorities conduct their affairs in a more open fashion.  You can speak of them as following the practice of open conventions more openly arrived at. Private developers are utilising their own money.  But, here is a building agency utilising public money, utilising it as a developer and under the control of the Minister for Local Government and if they look for a planning appeal they go back to that same Minister.  I believe you have a kind of circular arrangement here which is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should take another hard look at the situation, particularly now that it becomes very obvious when one sits back and reflects on the position of the National Building Agency.  The Minister should consider seriously and consider it in the new Planning Bill that he is introducing or in any amendments that may be introduced to that Planning Bill to that effect, the question of divesting himself, for his own sake, of this authority as being the final arbiter of all planning appeals which may come before him.  When you consider a body like the National Building Agency that is so closely interlocked with the Minister's own Department and his own activities, it would be desirable in a case like that that planning appeals from such a body&mdash;indeed all planning appeals&mdash;should be submitted to some kind of public tribunal so that, to quote the old aphorism, not alone is justice done but that it may be seen to be done.  I would urge the Minister strongly to consider that aspect of the administration of his Department and particularly with respect to the question of planning appeals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party Deputies certainly welcome the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister is to be commended for showing foresight in its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry, as we <Col N="2059" /> know, in this country, now employs the best part of 96,000 people in the public and private sectors and any legislative innovation such as we have before us this afternoon which will extend that major sector of the economy most certainly is worthy of support.  At the same time, I should like to make a number of observations on the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I would suggest to the Minister, on a tentative basis, that while undoubtedly at the moment we are faced with a very scarce allocation of the national resources, it may well be that in a few years, a very short period of time, if the NBA extends as we would wish it to extend, he may be back looking for a sum well in excess of the £3 million allegedly required here for the next five years.  If expansion of the size that we would wish to see does, in fact, take place, then an increase from £2 million to £5 million may not be adequate.  That is the first point that I should like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it can be said that the record of the NBA, notwithstanding the fact that it did not assume statutory functions until 1963, while laudable and acceptable, has been one of slow growth overall.  I do not think that we can record ourselves as being entirely satisfied with the position, as indicated by the Minister, that a total of 751 houses for industry have been completed by the agency, that there are currently 109 under construction and that 378 are being planned.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister both currently and in the pasts has had, perhaps, a surfeit of complaint that not enough houses are, in fact, being built. Frankly, we would envisage a much greater expansion of the role of the NBA.  I would respectfully suggest that when one considers the far greater dynamism displayed in Northern Ireland, particularly by the Northern Ireland Housing Trust, in the provision of industrial housing and of housing for key workers in key areas and growth centres, there is a lesson to be learned here and an example which we could very usefully follow.  Their rate of expansion in house building and in industrial house building has been much more effective than ours and has <Col N="2060" /> made a major contribution to industrial development in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill I would point out to the Minister and to the House the critical situation which exists in many of the major urban areas in this country in respect of industrial housing. It is no secret that houses are at a premium.  In such major growth areas as Galway and Drogheda, industrial workers are being exploited in the matter of rents.  These areas could do with very rapid expansion on the part of the National Building Agency bearing in mind that many local authorities are rather sluggish in regard to advanced planning and preparation for industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>We are sanctioning today an increase to £5 million.  Government policy in relation to ancillary services and in relation to industrial expansion generally should urgently be clarified.  The previous Deputy mentioned Ballingarry. Unless Government policy is clarified it could happen that a good deal of money would be misallocated on an area basis.  If I were working in the IDA, I should find it rather difficult to be precise, particularly in long-term indications to the NBA, when I would be unaware of the Government's decisions in relation to the vital Buchanan Report.  The end result might be a situation of increased capital being given to the NBA, with it necessarily going off and working on its own volition, at the request of local authorities, of Government Departments, of the IDA, and so on, when, in two or three years time, the other outlines of the policy decisions of the Government in relation to the Buchanan Report could affect quite dramatically the allocation of these scarce resources.  This is an interwining of State policy with that of industrial development which is lacking in this country at the moment due to the reluctance of the Cabinet to face up to difficult decisions.  There seems to be a complete inability to ensure that development.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we certainly welcome this Bill.  I have no doubt but that, in time, the NBA will expand quite rapidly.  It is quite in accord with the policy repeatedly advanced in this House by the Labour Party that there should be State responsibility, national responsibility, <Col N="2061" /> for the development of housing, particularly housing for industrial workers so that they would not be at the mercy of the capital market in areas close to major industrial growth centres and in suburban areas.</P>
    <P>The NBA is now nine years in existence. My experience, though not very wide, has at least been extensive enough on the trade union side and I regard the Department of Local Government and its allied agencies as the best in the State in terms of Government Departments.  Certainly, I rank it as vastly more effective, progressive, farseeing and generally more enlightened than the other Government Departments. However, I do think there is sufficient internal imagination in that Department that could very usefully be harnessed.  Perhaps, the Minister would consider issuing a White Paper on the future role of State expansion of industrial housing in Ireland.  The NBA has been of slow growth.  It is now almost a decade in operation.  I have in mind a White Paper analysing particularly the experience of the NBA in relation to contracts it has placed; in relation, perhaps, to the NBA itself taking much more initiative in undertaking construction projects; its experience in planning and in relation to local authority applications and so on. A co-ordination of the experiences of the NBA in those regards would be extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>In brief, the sum is inadequate.  We should like to see a greater expansion of the role of the NBA.  We should like a White Paper on this essential aspect of national development.  It is difficult to talk about this in the absence of the Buchanan Report and the Government decisions in relation thereto.  Nevertheless, we give full welcome to this Bill.  We wish the expansion of the NBA every success notwithstanding the reservations recently expressed by Mr. Reynolds of the Federation of Builders on State involvement in certain types of construction projects.</P>
    <P>We do not, I think, share his view. We wish to see a more rapid expansion of this agency in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I should like to associate myself with the support expressed <Col N="2062" /> of this agency.  Its effectiveness is indicated in the Minister's speech and also in positive results at Ballymun and elsewhere in largescale development.  It has brought new techniques to Irish workers.  It has coordinated very well with the trade union movement in a very effective way in that particular development at Ballymun in relation to which we in the city must appreciate the efforts of the agency in overcoming the many difficulties and obstacles placed in its way from time to time.  The positive result is there now.  I am quite sure that, with additional capital, it can go much further afield.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that many industrialists in this country are not aware of the facilities offered by the NBA in relation to house-building for workers.  I suggest that the Minister or his.  Department should give further publicity to the facilities which are available.  We may have industrial concerns who have an appreciation of their workers and who would be prepared to erect and develop houses for their workers, thus assisting the authorities in the city area in the relief of the housing shortage.  This is what we would expect by virtue of the fact that they attract many skilled workers from outside the city area.  Industrialists have themselves a responsibility to such workers to ensure that homes are provided for them.  We have an effective agency here to assist them in that respect. I would ask the Minister to publicise the fact that such an agency is available which can assist industrialists in having houses built for the types of skilled workers required in some development industries within the city limits.  This may also apply to other areas but I am mainly concerned with the city where there is a housing shortage.  Furthermore, the housing shortage may have hampered the return of some such people from abroad.  I am quite sure that if some of the industrialists were aware of the full position they would be only too happy to avail in some small way of the services which are there for the asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, I want to associate myself with the work that has been done and particularly with the Minister's foresight in relation to all the <Col N="2063" /> developments in recent times and the projected developments in Tallaght and elsewhere that are being brought along by this agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it provides an extra £3 million for the building of houses for key workers in industry.  Indeed, if we are to expand in the industrial sphere we cannot expect emigrants to come home unless we have adequate housing.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I wonder whether the National Building Agency is superfluous to the needs of this country. Local authorities have done excellent work in providing houses and I see no reason why the Minister could not have worked with the local authorities to provide these houses.  It leads me to wonder whether this is a move by the Minister's Department to hive off the powers of local authorities in the matter of housing.  I am sure the Minister could clarify his Department's stand on this issue.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful also if the Minister could tell the House the procedure which the agency adopts for building new houses.  Is it by tender?  Is it by direct labour or is it by the Minister sanctioning a particular building company? This is a rather important issue and I have no doubt that the Minister will clarify it for me.  I certainly hope it is not by the method whereby the Minister himself sanctions and appoints a particular building company.</P>
      <P>I should like to know also what powers the actual agency have in taking on employees and what power the Minister holds over any decisionmaking policies within the agency.  I should also like to know the rates of interest which the Minister for Finance demands on loans to the NBA.  I hope the rate is a nominal one because we are very short of houses for key workers throughout the country and I can assure Deputy Dowling that there is a shortage of houses throughout the country as well as in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure and I pay tribute to the National Building Agency for the very excellent work they have done in recent years.  In my experience they have fulfilled a very <Col N="2064" /> welcome purpose especially when they operated in conjunction with local authorities for the erection of houses for the working classes and I would be concerned if in respect of the £3 million we are providing today it would be provided solely for industrial activities.  I appreciate the importance of industrial expansion and the necessity of providing houses for industrial workers.  It is very laudable, indeed, but to confine the National Building Agency to industrial activities of this kind would in my opinion be lamentable.</P>
      <P>The National Building Agency have provided homes for categories of people who could not afford to build houses of their own, who could not take upon themselves the commitments involved in repaying the normal type a loan that goes with the erection of a house today.  By reason of the utilities which the NBA devised they were, most commendably, able to bring down costs and to bring houses within the means of the ordinary working classes.  I refer to the category of workers in the £800 to £1,000 a year bracket&mdash;the tradesmen, the artisans, the industrial workers of this country. These are people who would normally have to be rehoused by the local authority, who could not rise to a home of their own and who were pleased to avail of the opportunities provided by the NBA to take on the reasonable commitments there and the very definite lower repayments on the loans which were offered by the NBA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The houses which the NBA have been building have not been of the traditional type.  They have been devising their own plans.  The industrial unit type of house or the semi-prefabricated type of house is the house which we have seen erected by the NBA.  Consequently, costs were lower, consequently these categories of persons to whom I referred were able to avail of them. However, I want to sound a note of admonition here.  By reason of the alleged lowering of standards from the traditional type of house I fear that the NBA house may quite quickly get a bad reputation.  This is not to say that they have been badly built but the <Col N="2065" /> durability of this type of house is very definitely in question.  I should like the Minister to ease our minds in that regard, to ease the minds of all those people who have committed themselves to this type of home.  I hope he can tell us that they are as durable as the traditional type of house and that they will not require the kind of annual repairs that many envisage.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Hogan, has already referred to housing schemes within our constituency.  If the Minister were to pass along by Ballingarry tomorrow and look at the NBA scheme there&mdash;a very lovely scheme originally &mdash;he would see that today it presents an appalling appearance&mdash;houses clearly dilapidated, with windows boarded up with sheets of galvanise and materials of that kind.  The lovely scheme that we envisaged there is now a colossal eyesore.  It is a blot on the map of Killenaule, the town in which these houses were erected.</P>
    <P>The plain truth of the matter is that the sponsor of this scheme was unable to provide the number of families earlier envisaged for rehousing.  The need was not there seemingly for a grandiose scheme of this kind.  Our council in Tipperary South Riding are anxious to secure some of these houses for the rehousing of our own people and we are in active negotiation with the agents or the owners of this property towards that end.  However, it is worrying in the extreme to see the deterioration which has obviously taken place in this scheme in a relatively short time.  True it is that many of these houses were never occupied. True it is that when a house is unoccupied, neglected in this manner, it does deteriorate, but there are reservations about this type of house.  There are misgivings about this type of house especially as regards maintenance and durability and I should like the Minister to clear up our anxieties in that respect.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the NBA coming to the rescue of our housing authorities, many of which are clearly remiss in rehousing the working classes and in directing their energies towards this <Col N="2066" /> end in a definite and urgent way.  I, therefore, hope the local authorities can continue to call on the NBA for aid in rehousing our people.  I should like to see the NBA aiding and stimulating the activities of housing authorities rather than that they should be regarded as builders in industrial estates only.  They have been building houses for State employees, assisting local authorities in providing housing for workers and also building in industrial estates.  There is no reason why they should not continue this three-pronged activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the many questions asked in the House about NBA houses in our constituencies.  We had a very pleasing group of houses erected at Gurtmalogue, Clonmel.  They were quickly taken up by the Clonmel workers and there was no difficulty in finding tenants for them but we were perturbed at the long list of defects which became evident in this scheme and in respect of which we could get no redress without raising the matter here.  The defects were numerous.  Some were minor but others were certainly serious and we were concerned about the undue delay involved in getting the NBA to acknowledge the defects, in the first instance, and in getting the contractor back to carry out necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>We had another difficulty in respect of the otherwise very excellent lay-out of the grounds around these houses. The frontages of the houses were open and devoid of any railings or walls and presented a very pleasing appearance.  I approve of open frontages and would like to see this kind of frontage extended to different parts of the country. But when it comes to the provision of electric current in this case, instead of the cables being laid underground, poles and overhead wiring were suggested. Any layman would know instinctively that these poles and cables would utterly destroy the fine, open appearance of the frontages concerned.  I hope that problem has been amicably resolved now.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see the State engaged in this important job of house building when so many thousands of our people <Col N="2067" /> are homeless and so many local authorities remiss in discharging their obligations and when there is a threat of a capital shortage for this essential work.  It is good to know that there will be a State agency in existence with the task of helping to resolve this great problem.</P>
    <P>That is why we support this measure very strongly and our only anxiety is, as I have said, in respect of the type of house which the NBA have been providing.  We should endeavour to clear up certain anxieties about the future type of house.  While we are concerned to economise we should also ensure that the type of house we build will be as durable as the traditional type to which we are accustomed. When replying, the Minister might let me know if, in fact, there is much discussion of the type of house the NBA propose to erect in the future.  I should hate to think that we would supply a stock type of house indiscriminately all over the country and certainly, in the many schemes I have seen I found that stock type of NBA house with two colour tones, industrial unit construction, prefabricated in part.  This may make for efficiency, reduce costs and so on but if that type of house gets a bad name there is no point in continuing to construct it.</P>
    <P>With these sentiments I support the measure and wish the NBA every success in their efforts to resolve the problem of the homeless.  I hope they will not be restricted in that project and that while the Bill mentions industrial purposes the Minister will clear up any misunderstanding that may exist and make it clear that this will not inhibit the NBA from embarking on the traditional type of work in which it has been engaging such as housing State servants and, in particular, aiding local authorities to resolve their individual housing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill and my remarks will be equally brief. The Bill gives the House and opportunity of welcoming yet another measure from the Minister for Local Government and is further evidence of his dedication to the housing problem <Col N="2068" /> generally.  The fact that the Bill has been welcomed by all sides of the House shows the sincere desire of all parties that we should deal as quickly as possible with our housing problem. The fact that the Minister has introduced this Bill to give further power to the NBA is a vote of confidence in the work the agency has done in the few years of its existence.  I do not think it amiss to pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Blaney, who founded the NBA and guided its first steps towards that major contribution to housing it has already made, as instanced by the Ballymun housing project.</P>
      <P>This is the signal for the agency to go ahead with the greatest confidence because it has carried out one of the biggest single housing projects in Europe at Ballymun, Dublin.  The fact that there are now over 3,000 families living there is proof that even in its present form the agency is a dynamic factor and the fact that the Minister is giving it more powers now ensures that its future will be, indeed, bright and that those people in Dublin or outside it who are still awaiting proper housing will have more than hope to go on. When the agency was set up it had many problems to overcome.  The type of industrialised building which it undertook was something new in this country.  Despite some very big obstacles which it had to overcome, the Ballymun project, which was very much criticised, will now be finished in time&mdash;in the time suggested by Deputy Blaney the then Minister when he initiated the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It posed questions for many interests and for the trade unions also because this was a new idea in building which might affect the traditional interests of the craftsmen.  Be it said, in fairness to the unions, that they rowed in with the Government and the Ballymun project got under way and, today, we have over 3,000 families living there.  I often feel that the NBA has, perhaps, more powers than the local authorities.  I get this impression because it seems to be able to tackle things in a speedier way than the local authorities.  It is only <Col N="2069" /> right that the Government should garner all possible help in the housing drive.  They are doing this because the NBA relieves the local authorities of much work which has to go into the preparation of a housing scheme.</P>
    <P>It may be that in this Bill people may see a type of provincial bias because of the fact that we are providing houses for industrial undertakings, but that is not quite true when the Bill is read.  This is happening in Dublin, too. Deputy Dowling suggested that we should bring home to industrialists the benefits which can be had from using the NBA to provide houses for workers and that this should be publicised as much as possible.  I have always felt that we are inclined to look upon the local authorities as being the sole provider of houses.  We are tackling this on all fronts now and it augurs well for the future.  This year about 30,000 homes will be built in the country. Many of these will be NBA houses.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the Northern Housing Trust and said it was comparable to the NBA.  Deputy Dunne and I inspected the position in Belfast some time ago and saw the very fine job which the Northern Housing Trust has done.  At the same time, it is not quite right to draw a complete comparison or analogy between the two bodies.  The Northern Housing Trust does very fine work, indeed, and spent a tremendous amount of money in putting up a magnificent scheme near Belfast.  The NBA had, perhaps, greater difficulties to overcome but it has overcome them. Today in this Bill, we are giving more money which is the sinew of building, and we are getting greater encouragement from the attitude of Deputies on all sides of the House to go ahead and try to solve the housing problem. When I talk about solving the housing problem I may say that I am one of those who believe that in a growing economy you will never be without a housing shortage.</P>
    <P>With the work done by the present Minister through the local authorities, through the private sector, and through the NBA, we will reduce the problem as much as possible.  I want to congratulate the Minister on his fine work <Col N="2070" /> on housing.  He has been criticised in relation to housing but, if one studies the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> one sees the amount of work he has put into the housing drive.  I am sure he is heartened this evening by the support he has received from all sides of the House.  Let us say to him: &ldquo;Go ahead and press on as far as you can with housing because you have the whole House behind you.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill which calls for short speeches.  It recommends itself not only to every party but to every Deputy.  One of the major concerns of Deputies, as public representatives, is the housing of our people.  All of us know that there is at the moment a real and a great demand for houses.  I want to pay tribute to the work which has been undertaken by the National Building Agency.  I have seen some of its work.  I have seen and inspected that design of the houses which it constructed.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the design, layout and finish of houses erected by the NBA.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is easy for us to find fault if we want to find fault, but the only fault I can find with this Bill is the question of whether it provides sufficient money to do the job properly. We know this is only a step towards the completion of the housing of industrial workers and State servants and many others who will be calling on the NBA for assistance.  All of us who are members of local authorities know that it is becoming increasingly difficult for local authorities to respond to all the demands for housing made on them. The setting up of this body in 1960 was a step in the right direction.  When we look back on nine years of work we find that roughly only 126 or 127 houses per year were built by the NBA. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>By the 30th September, 1969, a total of 751 houses for industry had been completed by the agency, 109 were then under construction and 378 were being planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot count houses which are being planned as erected or constructed and, therefore, we can say that in the nine years since the agency was estabgratulat <Col N="2071" /> lished 751 houses were provided for industry and 109 are under construction, I presume also for industry.  I wonder has the NBA carried out any survey because, if we are to plan for the future, we should have a target and, therefore, a survey should be carried out.  If State servants are to be housed in houses provided by the NBA, and others who will not come within the scope of being provided with houses by the local authorities, the NBA will have a very difficult task to perform in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that in every district where we have a Garda station a house should be provided by the NBA for every married member of the Garda.  There is nothing more humiliating than for a garda to have to occupy a third-rate or fourth-rate flat in a town.  Many of these flats have not got the facilities which young married people would expect.  As a matter of fact, I expressed surprise before that the Garda Representative Body have not made a more determined effort to secure more support for members of the Garda in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>We have also in this country a large number of people known as foresters who are working in our various State forests.  They do not come within the scope of local authority housing but they most certainly are State servants.  I would certainly recommend that the NBA, in consultation with the Department of Lands, should undertake a survey of the housing needs of our foresters and the officials and officers of the Forestry Division and see that those houses are erected in towns where there are educational facilities and which are at the same time convenient to the various State forests.</P>
    <P>We are embarking upon an era of expanded education and the great difficulty being experienced by many vocational education committees and secondary school authorities is that where we now have large schools the local authority is not in a position to expedite housing to accommodate the various teachers that are now required in our vocational and secondary schools.  There are many towns, particularly in my own constituency, <Col N="2072" /> where there are first-rate vocational and secondary schools, and the big handicap is the lack of housing accommodation for teachers.  Therefore, I would respectfully suggest to the Minister for Local Government that in consultation with the directors of the NBA, a national survey should be made at the earliest possible date in relation to the housing needs of all State officers and servants who require the assistance of the NBA.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency the NBA have provided what I consider to be the best type of houses that I have ever seen erected, in record time and to a plan and a design second to none.  I feel the NBA are entitled to that tribute.  Unless we provide accommodation for key workers, industry cannot be run efficiently.  We have an obligation to provide houses for those key workers through the National Building Agency, and we also have a responsibility to the promoters and proprietors of our secondary schools and to vocational education committees who are at their wits' end in regard to housing accommodation for teachers.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that the rate of industrial expansion will continue.  I should like, without going unduly outside the scope of the Bill, to make reference to the Buchanan Report.  There does not appear to be any scope for industrial expansion from Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Laois-Offaly, you might say from the coast of Wexford right up to the town of Athlone.  I hope the NBA is not going to study the pages of the Buchanan Report in order to ascertain where houses are to be built for industrial expansion.  I have always held the view that the State should have as one of its primary responsibilities the provision of houses for all our people.  I am glad to see that in the NBA we have one State-sponsored body that is prepared to tackle this problem energetically and enthusiastically.</P>
    <P>If there is to be greater progress by the NBA I would suggest that the agency consider the establishment of three sections in that organisation: one section to deal with the city areas, and we have heard glowing tributes from Deputy Moore and others as to the progress which was made in Ballymun <Col N="2073" /> and other areas in the city; there should also be a section to deal with newly established industrial estates and the areas where industrial estates are about to be established; and there should be a third section to deal with the rural areas where there are no extensive industrial activities but, nevertheless, where housing accommodation must be provided for gardaí, teachers, foresters and the other sections of the community to whom I have referred and who do not come within the scope of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>If a survey was taken of the housing requirements, say, over the next five years in relation to people who cannot be housed by local authorities, the amount of money being provided in this Bill would pale into insignificance in comparison to the amount that would be required.  However, it is a step in the right direction and I presume the NBA, now nine years old, is only a little over the use of reason. Agencies of this kind usually suffer from teething troubles, but I hope the NBA are beyond that stage and that within the next nine years, between now and 1978 they will be able to show a significant improvement in the output of houses.  As the Minister has outlined to us here, in nine years they have provided 751 houses plus 109.  We do not take into consideration the houses that are being planned because Government offices throughout the length and breadth of this city are crammed with plans many of which are on the shelves of the various new offices covered with dust and surrounded by cobwebs. Therefore, we shall not take into consideration what is planned but only what has been erected, what has provided a roof over a family.  That is the right test of progress.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that there should be a greater measure of co-operation between the NBA and the local authorities.  At one time an urban area council known as the town commissioners was a housing authority. Under legislation town commissioners are no longer housing authorities.  The housing authorities are the county councils and the urban district councils. Due to the demand by people to be housed by county councils and urban district councils, there are many areas <Col N="2074" /> where there are town commissioners and where the rate of progress does not seem to be very significant.  For that reason I was wondering if at some future date the NBA might undertake, in co-operation with the town commissioners, the erection of houses in various townships which are urbanised but still not housing authorities.  For many years to come, with people marrying younger and with the steady increase, however slow it is, in employment, there will be a great demand for houses in this country.  No matter how quickly or efficiently we proceed with housing we shall never find it possible to reach the day when we can say our ambitions in relation to housing have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The job before the NBA is a very great one.  In the past nine years they have built approximately 126 houses per year.  This is not very significant progress for a national building agency. Nevertheless, it is as significant as the money, which was voted by this House, allowed, especially when one realises that building materials are soaring and that building workers are likely to be making increased demands for a proper wage in order to meet higher living costs.  When one takes into account all these increased costs one realises that the amount of money being sought by the Minister under this Bill is not very great.  I would have preferred to have seen a far greater State investment in the NBA.</P>
    <P>With these few words I most certainly endorse what has been said by other Deputies in relation to the NBA but I should like to hear from the Minister what his opinion is of the future needs, not alone for key workers in industrial employment, but for the other sections of the community who look upon it as the duty of the State to provide housing for them.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister for Local Government comes into the House with legislation seeking money to provide houses for our people I always feel he will be met by Deputies who realise the necessity of providing houses for our people.  In the past the provision of houses has not brought much credit to the State.  It has been handled in a very patch-like manner.  Nevertheless, <Col N="2075" /> the NBA as a result of this increased money is about to make greater strides and greater progress.  We hope and trust that their efforts will be crowned with the success they deserve.  It is the desire of all Deputies in this House to see that the housing needs of this country are satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the previous speaker that we must produce more houses for the wellbeing of our people.  In saying this I would welcome houses from any organisation or local authority able to provide them. Since election to this House I have heard sad stories about housing in Dublin.  The same situation exists in the country.</P>
      <P>In Kilkenny at the present time we have 300 applicants on our housing list and in the city alone we receive three applications per week for houses. We had a vaccum for a number of years but during the past two years we have provided a large number of houses.  We still have a long way to go. We have young people who will be three and four years married before they have a hope of getting a house.  I regard the NBA as carrying out a very essential service.  Anybody who provides houses for our people is doing a very worthwhile job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to question the position of local authorities &mdash; this is outside the county boroughs &mdash; because I feel the local authority in Kilkenny can provide the same houses at the same cost as the NBA, which will be purchased by a certain category of worker over a 30-year period.  I heard a previous Deputy say that these houses are provided at a very low cost.  We have facts to go on in Kilkenny and I do not think there is any great difference in the cost of the two houses, but the finished product is vastly different.  In Kilkenny we have NBA houses which need a lot of attention once they are built.  The NBA are very slow in carrying out these repairs.  In fact, I have had representations from people in other areas, living in NBA houses who feel these houses are substandard and again the common complaint is that the repairs necessary after completion of the house are carried out very slowly.  I make this <Col N="2076" /> point because I feel the local authority would be in a better position to build this type of house for the people for whom they are meant because they have local knowledge and local engineers who are able to supervise the project.</P>
    <P>The people who buy these houses take anything from 25 to 30 years to pay for them and it is a hardship on these people if they have to pay year after year for repairs to their house because of bad quality.  I would urge the Minister to look into the matter and make some sort of regulation to ensure that these houses will be of the quality people are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>The agency is being expanded but I have reservations about this because they are a specialist society.  If the money channelled to the agency was channelled to the local authorities they would build all the houses needed. There is a lack of money: we all know this and planning has been held up over the year because of it.  The Minister has said that houses can only be built when money is available to finance them.  The finance which is available should be channelled through our local authorities.  We in Kilkenny &mdash;</P>

      <P>I was led to believe that I could raise the question of housing generally and I apologise if I went outside the scope of the Bill.  Finance which provides housing for our people comes from the same source, the Minister for Finance, whether it be to the NBA, to the local authorities or to any other body.  It was on that reasoning that I raised the question of the advisability of expanding the NBA.  They have to get the money from the same source, from the Minister for Finance, and I was saying that this money, at least in the rural areas, should be channelled to the local authorities concerned. I have first hand knowledge of what the local authority in Kilkenny have done during the years both in the provision of council type houses and houses for purchase.  They have done a very good job and I am quite happy with the quality of the houses they have provided by comparison with <Col N="2079" /> NBA houses, at related costs.  It is from that point of view that I question the advisability of expanding the NBA because I think better work would be done if more money were channelled to local authorities.</P>

As I understand it, section 1 of this Bill seeks to amend section 9 of the 1963 Act which covers advances to the NBA by the Minister for Finance.  On my reading, section 9 of the 1963 Act is not limited to industrial housing.  It covers all the activities of the NBA and, therefore, Deputies are entitled to discuss all of their activities.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the NBA do a great deal more than building industrial housing and I am thankful for that fact.  In 1967-68 <Col N="2080" /> they spent a considerable amount of money on State housing, local authority housing and industrial housing and I think Deputies should be allowed to discuss the entire scope of their existing and potential activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the provision of further money for this agency.  The general concept of having a National Building Agency, which probably have a greater degree of flexibility and are not tied down by the same amount of red tape as a local authority, is definitely an advance and we must welcome the provision of extra capital to allow such a body to expand their activity.  This flexibility is very important because in an expanding economy it is necessary to avoid the bottlenecks which might occur through delay in the provision of housing for industrial expansion.  The NBA by reason of their greater flexibility can proceed with greater speed than the local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, in approaching this Bill and the provision of this money, the Deputies must find themselves in a very awkward position as regards the supply of information.  The annual report, as the shadow Minister has pointed out, is, to say the least, skimpy.  It consists of one measly page of foolscap and tells us very little about the general policy considerations which lie behind the decisions of the NBA.  We are not told, as far as I know, where the houses are built.  Therefore, we cannot consider whether the location of NBA housing is in line with the needs for such housing.  We cannot consider whether it is in line with the general policy of regional development, of growth centres and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general reports it is essential that we should be told where those houses are being built not just the number of houses built.  We are not told what size of houses are being built and for what income groups they are catering for. This is another matter which is very important if we are to consider the activities of the agency.  We are not <Col N="2081" /> told either the cost per unit of room space of houses put up by the National Building Agency.  In view particularly of the fact that there is a certain amount of boasting that the NBA produce a cheaper product than certain other building agencies surely they should be prepared to present the cost per unit of room space per house in their report.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Northern Ireland Housing Trust which is generally acknowledged as being very successful in its field, as was pointed out by other Deputies, publishes a very comprehensive report which is available not just in the Dáil Library and to Deputies but to the general public for purchase at a reasonable price from the Government Publications Office. This should be the practice with the NBA.  They should publish a comprehensive and freely available report.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to a fact to which the shadow Minister also referred.  Why was the report for 1967 not brought out until March of this year?  Other Deputies have referred to the alleged rather poor quality of some of the houses built by the NBA.  While I am certainly no expert on housebuilding such complaints have also come to my notice.  I understand that the walls of some of the houses are supposed to have buckled but I do not know to what extent.  However, I have heard that those houses are, to say the least, not earthquake proof.  I also understand that repairs have to be carried out on those houses at a much earlier date and at much greater frequency than is normal with most houses built by other authorities.  This would suggest that the finished product put forth by the NBA is not all that it might be when one considers repairs have to be carried out so soon afterwards and to such a great extent.  This is also a matter which might be treated in future annual reports of the agency.  They might tell us something more about the rate at which repairs are needed and the general average interval which elapses between completion of the house and the need for repair.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that in my constituency the National Building <Col N="2082" /> Agency carried out repairs to a house at Dunboyne and they did not complete the job.  They left a hole in a wall and went away before the job was completed. It was months afterwards before they came back to fill in the hole.  This may be a minor example but it is symptomatic of the general trend.  The agency would appear to be rather lax on the question of repairs to property and the speed at which it carries them out.</P>
    <P>Are the houses built by the National Building Agency of the same quality as those of similar capacity built by local authorities and would they meet the standards laid down for local authorities by the Department of Local Government which they must come up to if they are to get grants?</P>
    <P>There are some needs which the NBA could consider meeting.  I understand that in many towns there is a need for small houses, houses for single people and perhaps a married couple, which is not being met at the moment.  Many people are forced, as I think another Deputy pointed out, to live in rather uncomfortable bedsitters. This need could be met by the NBA on a greater scale than at present particularly in view of the fact that the NBA are more flexible in the type and size of houses they build than the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on an experiment tried out by the NBA with regard to building expandable houses.  I believe the Minister was particularly interested in this project and I would be grateful if he would give us some information about future plans which he has with regard to expandable houses and if the experiment has been a success so far.  I would go a little bit further than Deputy Flanagan in regard to carrying out the survey.  I think the NBA should carry out a comprehensive survey of all housing needs in the country based on a demographic basis with a prediction for, perhaps, 20 years ahead to ensure that we will have some proper basis for planning houses and that it will not take place in a haphazard manner.  If the NBA carried out such a survey, while it might not pretend to meet all the needs, it would <Col N="2083" /> provide a useful basis for local authorities also.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the NBA are considering building houses in Navan.  As the Minister probably knows, Navan is rapidly expanding and it is quite possible that the need for houses there will outrun the capacity of the local authorities to provide them quickly enough.  I would commend to the Minister and the agency the idea of making some effort to provide houses in Navan.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Collins referred to the method by which contractors are taken on by the National Building Agency. He asked the Minister to tell us if this is carried out on the basis of an open and public tender.  I sincerely hope it is because certain rumours have come to my notice &mdash; I do not know whether to give them any credit or not &mdash; that in relation to the distribution of contracts by the NBA there is a certain element of political discrimination in favour of contractors who support the present governing party.</P>
    <P>I should also like some information on the relations between the NBA and the Board of Works in the matter of providing houses for gardaí.  The report does not give all the information that I would like to have on the relationship between these two bodies and the general degree of co-operation between them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can explain something about section 5 of the Schedule to the 1963 Act regarding superannuation schemes and the necessity for having these approved by the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister could give me some information on this and the consequent red tape involved I should be very grateful.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that perhaps the greatest blot on the NBA is not its work or the lack of work done by them but the fact that they are not prepared to provide comprehensive information on their activities. It is essential that we should have such information in consideration of the amount of money that is being spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Chair's ruling and from the Minister's speech that this Bill is for <Col N="2084" /> the extension of credit to the NBA from the sum of £2 million to £5 million and that it is solely for the purpose of expanding industrial estates.  I am considerably confused as to what is the state of affairs because the NBA have existed, as stated in the Minister's speech, since 1960 so it must have had some funds with which to carry on.  There is a considerable staff in the NBA.  They have carried out a considerable amount of work other than expansion for industrial estates.  From where did they get the money for these things?  How did they carry on to date in the other activities in which they are occupied? Do they request the money solely for the purpose of industrial expansion? That poses another question: if one does not happen to live within the particular industrial area does that mean that that part of the country is entirely obliterated from the benefits in this Bill?</P>
      <P>In his opening address, the Minister told us very little.  He said:</P>
      <P>The work of the agency now falls into three broad categories &mdash; the provision of housing and ancillary services related to industrial expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Does that apply to a particular area or does it apply to the whole country?  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the provision of houses for State employees whose duties involve occasional transfers of residence for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House knows that the number of State employees is increasing. There are certainly not fewer civil servants than we had three years ago &mdash; there are a great deal more than we had five years ago.  However, to continue with the quotation from the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and housing operations undertaken on behalf of local authorities. It is with the first of these categories that this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I take it that the money which the Minister is now asking for is solely concerned with industrial expansion. It is very difficult if the operations <Col N="2085" /> of a housing society such as the NBA, whose principal function is the expedition of housing, are confined, instead of its being taken out of direct State control and being made a semi-private organisation.  Regarding my own constituency &mdash; I am glad to see Deputy Browne here to represent the same constituency as I do &mdash; are we to be entirely cut off from the £3 million that is being voted here this evening? We have no particular industrial expansion, though goodness knows we have looked for it often enough.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the most important Bills to come before this House in recent years.  We are all actively concerned with the shortage of housing just as we are concerned with any legislation that may be introduced for the purpose of expanding housing in any way.  However, I am restricted in discussing fully what I consider would be the most expeditious and perhaps the most reasonable means of expanding housing to make it available to all sections of the community. The tragedy of this is that the three categories concerned exclude State employees, the people who have been sitting on the fence waiting for houses for years &mdash; houses that could very easily be provided for them if only the NBA which is an off-shoot of the Department of Local Government would expedite the housing situation in the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in his reply to this debate he would indicate to the House what exactly is the real purpose behind this Bill.  Is it solely for the purpose of expanding industrial estates?  Where are the industrial estates?  Does it apply only to places like Ballyfermot and Ballymun, the areas in which most of the industrial estates are springing up?  Are the people of rural Ireland, who pay taxes and pay the loan charges, to be excluded from the privileges of this sum that is being granted to the NBA to expand industrial estates most of which are in Dublin?  Perhaps it will benefit some of the other larger centres in the neighbourhood of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the NBA in my own constituency I have found that they are largely a sponsoring body.  Their function is to sponsor <Col N="2086" /> housing authorities and to start housing schemes wherever they may be or for whatever purpose they may be.  A great many of the houses that are built are built on the loan system.  I found in the housing estates that the people were unable to secure from the State the benefits that are normally given to anybody who builds a house until such time as the loan had been sanctioned. Therefore, there was this Gilbertian situation whereby the Department of Local Government did not pay the grant and the NBA did not sanction the loan until the grant was paid, so that the position was that it was impossible to get a loan without getting a grant and it was impossible to get a grant without getting a loan.</P>
    <P>I am happy to tell the Minister that after a prolonged interview with the Department of Local Government, when I received the greatest consideration and satisfaction from the officials concerned, and after lengthy telephone calls with the NBA they decided to meet each other half way and the situation was resolved.  This was the situation in quite a sizeable housing estate in the constituency which I represent. The people concerned were waiting for a period of over 12 months before the matter was resolved.  I do not know whether that situation prevails now.  In my constituency the National Building Agency have now quite an extensive scheme and, I hasten to assure the Minister, it is concerned with the building of houses for industrial employees.  When the people take over the houses I hope that the situation will not obtain that they have to wait until they get the loan before getting the grant, or where, on the other hand, they are told that they cannot get the grant until they get the loan.  I hope that will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more on the National Building Agency.  I feel it is one of the most important things in this country.  It would be a most important body if it were fully expanded and given full authority as a semi-State body.  In that way it could go a long way towards solving the housing question.  Of course, no semi-State body is, as a rule, given full authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> From a previous ruling of the Chair it seems that we are confined practically entirely to industrial estates.  Therefore, I regret that I must resume my seat without saying many things which I would like to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for agreeing to this Bill which is intended to provide for the extension of the permissible borrowing powers of the National Building Agency from £2 million to £5 million for houses for industrial purposes.  I suppose it is because everybody was unanimous in agreeing to that simple purpose of the Bill that there is very little reference to it in any of the speeches that were made.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with some of the points made, although they had not anything to do with the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the scanty information available in the annual reports of the National Building Agency.  I am inclined to agree that it would be desirable to have more comprehensive annual reports.  I will request the agency to publish more comprehensive reports and to make them generally available to the public. If this is done it should also cover the point raised by Deputy Desmond with regard to his suggestion that a White Paper analysing the experience of the National Building Agency should be published.  Much was made of the fact that this year two annual reports were published on the same day.  There was no sinister motive in that.  It was merely due to inadvertence and to change of personnel in the agency itself.  There was not any reason why the 1967 report should have been delayed until this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Ballingarry housing estate, it is a fact that the houses were never fully occupied.  The owner of the mines in question expected that miners from the Castlecomer area would move to that area and occupy the houses because of the availability of employment in his mines. His expectations were not realised with the result that this housing estate was never fully occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> With regard to the question of the standard of these houses, either Deputy Treacy or Deputy Hogan referred to the dilapidated appearance of the estate now.  This is not due to any fault in the houses themselves. It is due to the fact that there was a great deal of vandalism in that particular scheme.  Much destruction was done on these houses which were vacant through no fault of the agency. The fact that this destruction was done does not in any way reflect on the durability of the houses, either there or elsewhere.  With regard to the whole question of durability I may say that before the agency developed the cross-wall system of building now used, and before this system was accepted for loan and grant purposes, exhaustive investigations were made.  Deputies can be assured that there was no doubt about these houses being any less durable than the traditionally-built houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan also referred to the fact that there was a sudden jump in the expenditure by the National Building Agency on local authority housing. This was due to the Ballymun scheme. I do not know what planning appeals the Deputy was referring to.  I have no recollection whatever of any planning appeals involving the National Building Agency.  I am at a complete loss to know to what he was referring.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Desmond, raised the question as to whether the extension of the borrowing powers from £2 million to £5 million would prove to be sufficient.  It is to be expected that there will be a need at some future stage to increase further the borrowing powers of the National Building Agency.  Experience to date would lead us to assume that this extra £3 million should be sufficient for five years probably.  It may then be necessary to extend the borrowing powers again.  On the other hand, it may not be necessary to do so.  I think it is adequate at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond thought that the growth of the National Building Agency in respect of the building of houses for industrial purposes had been rather slow.  I can only say that no reasonable request for the provision of these houses has been rejected.  Deputies, particularly Deputy O.J. Flanagan, <Col N="2089" /> referred to what they described as the low number of houses built by the agency.  These Deputies were forgetting, or ignoring, the fact that this is only one aspect of the activities of the agency.  The figures Deputy O. J. Flanagan quoted here refer only to houses for industrial purposes.  Expenditure on local authority housing by the agency has to date been well over £12 million.  The agency have in fact built a total of 4,635 houses and they have 3,779 dwellings now in their present programme.  These are the figures for the overall performance of the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling felt that industrialists in general were not aware of the services available through the agency. Well, the agency have been in touch with the Federation of Irish Industries on two separate occasions in the last couple of years and prevailed on the federation to circularise to industries details of the services that are provided by the agency.  The IDA also bring to the notice of industrialists that these services are available.</P>
    <P>There was only the one Deputy who felt that the National Building Agency were not desirable.  Deputy Collins said that the NBA were superfluous. The work that has been done by the agency should be substantial proof of the fact that this is just not so.  The huge building scheme that was provided at Ballymun in Dublin was additional to the maximum possible output of Dublin Corporation and similarly in so far as the Cork and Limerick projects were concerned.  Certainly the Cork project could not have been tackled by Cork Corporation.  Again, the NBA are undertaking on behalf of Dublin Corporation the provision of 700 houses at Tallaght.  In general, we can say also that the industrial schemes which the agency have provided could not have been provided by housing authorities, particularly those which had a substantial backlog of social housing demands.  This type of housing just has to get priority from the local authority and they would not be in a position to provide houses for facilitating the establishment or expansion of industries.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have also dealt <Col N="2090" /> with houses on the basis of the priorities. Again, the NBA have done valuable work in developing the cross-wall type of construction which has resulted in a lowering of costs.  I do not think that any housing authority would have had the resources or the initiative to undertake that type of things.  Therefore, I certainly reject the suggestion that the NBA are superfluous.  There is not, as Deputy Treacy seemed to think, any suggestion of trying to confine the NBA to this particular type of activity. As I said, the agency at present are commencing the erection of 700 houses in Tallaght.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is specifically for industrial purposes.  I explained in my opening statement that this is the manner in which the agency operate for the provision of houses and ancillary services related to industrial expansion and it is purely dealing with that.  There is a limit on the amount that can be borrowed at any one time by the agency of £2 million and that is being raised to £5 million.  I agree, of course, that section 9 covers all borrowing and I did not in fact object to anybody discussing that aspect of the agency's activities. I did suggest to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at a certain stage that it did not seem desirable to allow the debate to develop into a general discussion on the housing position in the country, not that I have any objection to discussing that, but the more appropriate occasion would be on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  The extra money that is being provided for in this Bill is for industrial housing only.  All that I was objecting to was a general discussion on housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the other activities of the agency are concerned, the money comes from direct recoupment from local authorities for local authority housing, recoupment from house purchase moneys and grants and recoupment from any other non-industrial grants such as are given by the Departments of Health, Justice and so on.  I <Col N="2091" /> may say that I am glad that the agency's services have been availed of to the extent they have been.  This Bill will enable the agency to provide a very useful and essential assistance to the extension and expansion of industry throughout the country generally.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides for the waiver of rates by local authorities in certain cases and for the introduction of an effective system of payment of rates by instalments.  These two purposes are distinct and I will deal with them in turn.</P>
      <P>First, the waiver of rates.  A major criticism of the rating system has been that it is unduly rigid and that local authorities have not sufficient discretion in its operation, particularly in relation to the more needy sections of the population. The existing power of local authorities to strike out rates which are uncollectable at the end of the financial year is not satisfactory, for many reasons.  This power implies that some effort has been made during the year to collect the rates with all the anxiety for the persons concerned that this involves.  It puts local authorities in the position of demanding and accepting rates in cases where, if the ratepayer concerned refused to pay, they would, because of his poor circumstances, be willing to strike out the rates as irrecoverable.  On a more general level it requires local authorities to adopt an inflexible approach to the whole problem.  Any new system should as far as possible give definite rights of exemption from rates to clearly defined groups, while at the same time preserving a reasonable degree of flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, which is drafted in very wide terms, gives to each rating authority the power to make and carry out a scheme for the waiver of all or portion of the rates due by ratepayers or classes of ratepayers or in respect of a class of hereditaments.  This power is a reserved function exercisable by the elected members of the rating authorities and is subject only to such regulations as may be made by the Minister <Col N="2093" /> under section 4.  It is intended that these regulations will contain two main elements: provision for essentially procedural matters and a stipulation that each scheme shall require the consent of the Minister.  As experience is gained of the working of the schemes it is hoped to modify the regulations to provide for a general form of consent by the Minister which will in practice give a wide measure of discretion to local authorities, and will dispense with the need for individual consents, provided specified general guide lines are followed.  When the system is fully in operation, I would envisage each rating authority making a scheme which would specify the classes of ratepayers who may claim total or partial remission of rates, due regard being had both to the circumstances of the local authority area and to the requirements of regulations made by the Minister. Persons covered by the scheme would, on application, be entitled to full or partial exemption as of right for the year in question.  I would hope that the scheme would be administered as liberally as possible by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have already adopted provisional schemes in relation to the present financial year.  In accordance with the advice contained in a circular letter from my Department these schemes for the time being are confined to social welfare beneficiaries of the means test categories, except in cases of special hardship. Present indications are that the cost of these schemes will be relatively insignificant; in the country as a whole the cost is unlikely to be very much greater than the 0.7 per cent of the rate warrant struck off as irrecoverable in former years.  Local authorities will, no doubt, review the position further in the light of experience gained in the present year.  I might mention that a feasibility study for a project on the impact of rates on households prepared by the Institute of Public Administration is being considered in my Department.  One of our difficulties at present is that we have insufficient knowledge of the incidence of rates on different categories of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> The second purpose of the Bill is to provide for an effective system of payment of rates by instalments.  The present legal position is that rates are payable in two moieties, one in respect of each half year.  Although local authorities have been urged by my Department to provide adequate instalment facilities on an informal basis the response has generally been poor. Section 3 of the Bill will confer a legal right to pay rates by instalments on occupiers of rated hereditaments of a class to which the section has been applied by order under subsection (2) or (3).  My intention is to apply the section to all dwellings, holdings of agricultural land and possibly other hereditaments as well.  The general outlines of the instalment system, particularly the manner of calculating the amount and number of instalments and the dates on which they are due will be dealt with in regulations.  While I have an open mind on the form of the instalment system my present intention is to spread payment over the period April to February inclusive, each instalment becoming due on the 1st day of the month and with provision for a period of grace.  I would draw particular attention to paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) of section 4 which give extensive power to alter the actual method of paying rates when paid by instalments.  The aim here will be to devise the most efficient system possible even if this means departing from traditional methods.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted this is essentially an enabling Bill.  The waiver of rates depends effectively on the making of schemes by rating authorities and the instalment system will be determined largely by the regulations made under section 4.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House, I wish to make clear that I will welcome suggestions not only in relation to the terms of the Bill but also in relation to its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One welcomes, in general, the terms of this Bill so far as it relates to relieving the underprivileged sections of our community. As the Minister said, the Bill deals chiefly with the social welfare classes. <Col N="2095" /> Our rating system has always been extremely rigid, as one will see on examining the returns from the various local authorities or the annual report of the Department of Local Government. The collection rate runs in the region of 98.9 per cent, 99 per cent, 97.6 per cent.  Very often it is 98 per cent or 99 per cent.  A collection rate on that level must of necessity cause social pressures, social pressures we sometimes hear about and sometimes never hear about. Every local authority is, of course, given a list every year and the authority wipes out a number of debts deemed irrecoverable.  The words &ldquo;deemed irrecoverable&rdquo; connote some effort being made and the person involved being pressed to find money from some source to pay the rates.  The obligation on the rate collector to collect the rates is a very strict obligation and, judging from the figures I have quoted, it is clear that a more liberal attitude is long overdue.  Apart from that, there is, of course, a defect in the rating system generally.  The Minister is well aware of that.  He has had, I think, three extensive reports prepared for him on the question of rates and the examination of alternative systems of taxation. It is a very difficult matter.  No Government can throw aside £35 million or £36 million a year, or whatever the figure is, and ask the Minister for Finance to give the money instead.  It is agreed by everybody that rates as a method of taxation have considerable defects; they are not always related to the person's capacity to pay.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said in his speech he has sent out a circular to all local authorities.  Some local authorities have adopted his suggestions and they have prepared a scheme of their own. They have done so in the constituency that I come from in the South Tipperary County Council.  At first we protested and refused to do it and then at a later meeting it was adopted.  I think there are two other bodies in the county who have refused so far to adopt any scheme of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While welcoming the principle of the Bill and the relief it will give to the more unfortunate people in our <Col N="2096" /> society, I feel that the Minister should have met some of the burden which the Bill will impose on the main taxpayers in each county.  If the Minister said, &ldquo;I will pay all the extra cost which the local authority will have to meet as a result of this concession to the poorer ratepayers of a local authority,&rdquo; then it would be a question of Bob's your uncle, the local authority would probably be tempted to derate to an undesirable level, but I think the Minister should at least have offered a 50 per cent grant and should have gone half-way to meet the extra cost which this will place upon the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that in the initial stages it will not cost more than 0.7 per cent of the rate warrant which is perennially struck off on an average by all local authorities.  This is the initial stage.  Even of that 0.7 per cent I see no offer from him that he will meet 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>If rates are an imperfect form of taxation, here is a Minister using that imperfect form of taxation now for the very laudable purpose of helping the less privileged members of our society but his method of doing it is not particularly laudable.  It is easier, of course, to unload that just as previously the Office of Public Works unloaded some other activities on to the local authority.  Nowadays the local authority seems to be the old jockey horse.  In connection with any unwanted service the first object of central Government Departments is to see how they can unload it on to the county councils.  They do it in various aspects of social services.  This concession now is, in effect, a form of social welfare.  The Minister or the Department of Social Welfare should have made some subvention, perhaps, a controlled subvention, if you wish, to local authorities who were prepared to adopt that scheme.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Minister's speech to say how this will be financed. The assumption&mdash;I take it to be a correct assumption&mdash;is that the local authorities will have to face this bill.  I repeat that I welcome the Bill in so far as it will give relief to distressed <Col N="2097" /> persons and even in a more generous manner than the Minister has adumbrated here but, from the point of view of the local rate, I would have felt that the Minister should have been more forthcoming and should have made some subvention to local authorities who will have to place on the rest of society the cost that further helps in this direction will entail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that of all the systems of taxation, direct and indirect, the rating system is the most unjust, the most inequitable and the most crushing and overbearing imposition on our people.  It has been said time and time again that the incidence of rates has reached saturation point and that the burden is becoming more and more unbearable.  The Minister was given this unique opportunity of considering this inequitable rating system and of bringing in a worthwhile measure designed to provide a fairer rating system whereby the burden would bear on the backs best able to take it.  It is to be deplored that, instead of doing that, he has introduced an instrument of political policy.  This Bill was mentioned prior to the general election.  This Bill is ill-conceived.  It was hastily designed for the purpose of courting votes in the last general election.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill are worthless. I regard the Bill as a piece of deception which purports to give relief of rates or exemption from rates to all sections of our people.  The announcement of the Bill prior to the last general election was a really worthwhile political gimmick.  When we saw the translation into law, local authorities were sadly disillusioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme for exemption, abatement or easement in the payment of rates is designed solely for the benefit of social welfare classes&mdash;non-contributory classes&mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo;&mdash;who, in the main, live alone.  I submit that these categories of persons of slender means could not pay rates and were not paying rates and had not been paying rates over the years.  They are destitute classes in our society whose rates were struck off as <Col N="2098" /> irrecoverable each year.  Therefore, there is nothing in this Bill to benefit these categories of persons.  They had always been exempt from the payment of rates simply because they could not afford to pay them out of their small pensions.  Humane rate collectors and considerate county managers have always accepted that position, that the rate demand on these persons was irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>What appalled me was that the Minister, purporting to give relief to certain categories of unfortunate persons, the non-contributory social welfare classes, did not take the necessary steps to provide the money.  County councils, corporations and urban councils are rightly indignant because the Minister is passing the buck to them, passing this extra burden of rates on to the rest of the ratepayers.  It is not a question of passing the burden from the poor to the rich, from the relatively poor to the affluent ratepayers in our towns and villages.  It is passing the burden of rates from the non-contributory classes to the contributory classes because, in fact, they are not provided for in the type of scheme submitted by the Minister's Department to our local authorities.  Therefore, we can have a situation where a non-contributory widow or old age pensioner, living alone, will be exempt from rates &mdash; as if he or she was not exempt from the payment of rates in the past &mdash; and we shall have, side by side with them, the contributory pensioners, the persons with the contributory pension or old age pension &mdash; living alone, again &mdash; with relatively little difference nowadays in the same pensions, a fraction.  Nevertheless the contributory pensioner will be expected to pay the rates demand.</P>
    <P>We know that the vast majority of our pensioners are contributory pensioners. We know that there is at present little difference between the non-contributory rate and the contributory rate.  Indeed, the non-contributory categories received a 10/- increase last August and the contributory categories will have to wait until January 1st next to get their 10/-.  Therefore, the pension rates are, in the meantime, very largely being equated.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that we should have <Col N="2099" /> a scheme of that kind, differentiating between widows and old age pensioners. I appreciate that this is a matter that, very largely, is one for local authorities.  This is a reserved function of ours, as local authorities, and we can include those other categories which the Minister and his advisers have recommended to be cut out &mdash; the contributory classes.  We can include them; we can extend the scope of this Bill; but we shall merely be increasing the already crushing burden of rates on our people at large.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that this scheme has met with such a cold reception.  Many county councils, corporations and urban councils have rejected it outright by reason of the fact that the Minister expects them to provide the money, thereby increasing the rates still further.  If the Minister were sincere about providing genuine relief for our people who are caught up in the throes of this vicious rating system he would provide the money in this House and let it be paid out of the Exchequer rather than pass it on to our local authorities who simply cannot find that kind of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister well knows that the incidence of rates is so great, so crushing, so overburdening on our local authorities that it is completely frustrating in recent years to be a member of a local authority.  We cannot provide the ordinary amenities for our people.  We cannot provide adequate amounts of money for housing, maintenance, lighting, sewerage, water, and so on, because of the genuine concern and alarm about increasing rates beyond the ability of our people to pay them.  It is a most inhibiting and frustrating system.  It calls out for immediate redress.</P>
    <P>Here is a Minister with a golden opportunity to give us a measure of this kind which would give genuine relief in respect of the burden of rates; to give us a more just and equitable system of valuation.  We get this paltry gimmick which was launched before the last general election merely to court votes on a shabby pretence.  Realising the anger of our people in respect of this matter of rates, this thing was devised in order to placate all our <Col N="2100" /> rate-paying public into thinking that something worthwhile was being done for them by this Government&mdash;and this is what we get.  We get the audacious suggestion that home assistance recipients, unfortunates in long, continuous unemployment, people who are chronically ill, non-contributory widows, non-contributory old age pensioners, will be exempt from rates&mdash; they tell us.  This is a fraud.  This is deceit.  This is making a mockery of the most unfortunate and harassed and deprived section of our people.  We reject this Bill as worthless.</P>
    <P>There is genuine relief of rates in this country for the farming community &mdash;and they are entitled to it.  There is the abatement of rates for them in respect of employees on the land.  There is no relief whatsoever for the town dweller, for the small shopkeeper, who is trying to eke out an existence in competition with the giant supermarkets. There is no relief for the ordinary house-dweller in our towns and cities.  If these people, these business people, these dwellers in our towns and cities, attempt to improve their property, even by painting and decorating, they do so under the threat of having their valuation and their rates increased.  It is highly discouraging, highly frustrating, that we should have this situation.  I think it is only fair to alert other people in our country to the fact that, in respect of the provision of grants for repair and reconstruction, after the expiration of the seven years grace, valuations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not a great pity that we did not have a genuine piece of legislation, carefully considered, recommending at least some of these salient and important points of the commission which sat for some years in respect of this whole problem of our rating system, an antiquated and archaic system, revision and review long overdue?  Yet we get this paltry piece of legislation which purports to give relief.  It has no hope of succeeding in anything like its intentions because most of our local authorities are opposed to its implementation. Many of them have refused to implement it unless they get a guarantee from the Minister that he will fund this measure, back it up by the necessary money and are not at all impressed by the meagre percentage which is mentioned in this Bill as being the kind of money that it will cost local authorities. We have memories of another Minister for Finance and Health, Dr. Jim Ryan, when he told us that the cost of the Health Bill would not exceed 1/- in the £.  We all know how much health is costing us in respect of rates in our various counties&mdash;ten, 15, 20 times more than that surely.  Unless the money is provided to extend the scope of this Bill to take in all those who are in urgent need of the abatement of rates the scheme is worthless, because already our local authorities have reached saturation point in respect of the rates that they can impose. To bring in extra sections of our people will only be buck-passing, robbing Peter to pay Paul.  This is a wrong approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be serious about it the Minister must provide the money.  The money should be provided by the Exchequer to meet the genuine relief of rates envisaged in a Bill of this kind.  This measure, therefore, is in essence an insult to the intelligence of all of us in this House.  It is a shabby pretence of giving relief of rates to people who are already getting relief of rates.  The terrible anomaly of differentiating between the contributory and the noncontributing classes is disgraceful in the extreme.  I know the terrible disappointment <Col N="2102" /> experienced by old age pensioners when they were told by public officials in South Tipperary: &ldquo;The scheme for the abatement or relief of rates applies to non-contributory pensioners only.&rdquo;  It did not apply to them even though they were living alone.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was drawing up his memorandum of advice to local authorities he did us all a serious disservice when he specified these categories.  I submit that he should look again at the categories of persons who genuinely need relief of rates, reconsider it and apply it to the contributory sections as much as to the non-contributory sections.  This is the least justice we can do to try to make this scheme anything like worth while. We want to see genuine relief of rates. We want to see a more equitable system but this Bill does nothing to satisfy us along these lines.  It was ill-conceived, hastily designed, a panic measure designed to placate the ratepayers, who are becoming more and more enraged with this unjust system. Many people had high hopes of getting relief under it but they have been completely frustrated.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the Bill that one naturally welcomes.  I do not want to be misconstrued as saying that I am against relief of rates for a non-contributory pensioner or a person depending on home assistance or on the dole or ill over a long time.  I submit that these categories have always enjoyed exemption from rates.  You just could not collect it from them. They did not have it anyway.  I am concerned about extending the scope of this measure and I am concerned about the shabby pretence that it is.  I am concerned to see it backed up by the necessary financial resources in the clear knowledge that our local authorities are unable to provide additional money for the extension of a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>The payment of rates by instalment is to be greatly welcomed.  We all know that more and more people are buying their own homes and the payment of rates in two moieties can be a tough financial imposition and has caused <Col N="2103" /> hardship to many people I know.  It is to be welcomed that they can now pay the rates by way of instalment on a monthly basis.  This will give some relief but here, again, we must face the fact that this will mean increased costs for local authorities.  It will surely mean additional staff and additional work for local authorities and thereby further increase costs in the collection of the rates and in a situation where we are crying out to have the cost of the health services made a charge on central funds, the provision of 50 per cent or a little over by way of State grant is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell on this or to bring in any extraneous matter but it is disturbing to realise that the Health Bill which we expect to have before the House very soon does not provide for any further extension of State relief in respect of the health services.  That is all the more reason why, when this Bill came to be considered, the Minister ought to have considered it logically, seriously and responsibly and this, I submit, he did not do, in the throes of a general election.  This gimmick was designed like many other gimmicks. I am sure it won some votes for the Government in the last general election but the people who were gulled then are now in for a rude awakening because I submit that there is nothing in this measure for the relief of rates for the people of this country who are crying out for a measure of amelioration.</P>

I believe that when the inter-departmental committee submits the final report and it is considered then there will be comprehensive overhaul of the present rigid, out-of-date and antiquated rating system and I look forward to that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I believe that in the meantime where relief can be brought to the very weakest sections of the community <Col N="2104" /> this should be effected, rather than allowing those sections to suffer it out until such time as the commission reports and the decision is taken to overhaul the system in its entirely.  I believe that this section is the very weakest section and it is wrong to say that local authority tenants at the moment are relieved of rates.  In the Dublin city area local authority tenants who do not pay their rent which includes rates are evicted. They have been evicted and are continuing to be evicted if they do not meet the rates that are imposed on them by the local authority.  This Bill caters for the very weakest section.  There are many other sections in need of some support in relation to the payment of rates and I am positive such support will come in the overhaul of the rates system which has been promised and on which there will be reports which must be studied and analysed.  I shall welcome the day when such an overhaul is accomplished.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Deputy Treacy that the measure now before the House is as far as the Government are prepared to go in this matter is ridiculous and irresponsible.  As I have said, there are many sections of the community in need of easement as far as rates are concerned and therefore I welcome this Bill and the promise that in the near future we will have a system of rates levy which will be acceptable to most people.</P>
    <P>Referring to the last section of the Bill, the Minister said he wished to make it clear that he would welcome not only suggestions in relation to the Bill as it stands but also suggestions which would widen the scope of the Bill.  In other words, the Minister has left the door open to Deputies to put forward ideas.  Up to now, however, no such ideas have been put to the Minister as to how the scope of the Bill could be broadened.  There is no doubt that rates have become an unbearable burden to many people.  I am aware of a case in the city of Dublin where a person had to sell a piano in order to pay the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been a good piano to pay his rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done.  I do not <Col N="2105" /> wish to broaden the scope of the debate.  The Bill is a short one to deal with a very limited section of the community. It has limited scope and I welcome particularly the section which provides for the payment of rates by instalments.  I should point out that for some time Dublin Corporation have in operation a successful system for the paying of rates by instalments. Strangely, the demand for such a system was not as great as anticipated.  It was, however, welcomed by many people in the middle income group who preferred to pay their rates in this manner rather than in two moieties as at present in general operation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to make it quite clear that this is not the end product of our efforts to relieve rate burdens.  I should like him to tell the House that there will be a comprehensive Bill which will ease or eliminate altogether the many defects in the present out-of-date rates system. I should like to repeat what the Minister has said, that if Deputies have any ideas which would widen the scope of this Bill they should indicate them to the Minister because any effort that will relieve the weaker sections of the community would be welcomed.  Of course, somebody must pay and if the rates burden is to be shouldered by way of general taxation the people now burdened by rates will still have to bear a share.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the line should be drawn.  The cost of local services must fall on somebody's shoulder and I would hope that in future we might let it fall on the shoulders of those best able to pay.  I have in mind business concerns and I would have no objection to a section being introduced in the Bill providing that business people in this city who are making vast profits should be asked to contribute more towards the provision of local services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As has been stated by the Minister, the objects of the Bill are two-fold. First of all there is the proposition to put on a formal basis the payment of rates by instalments and also the proposition to waive rates levied on certain <Col N="2106" /> necessitous classes.  For the purpose of remarks I shall make later, I wish to emphasise that this is, as the Minister has stated, an enabling Bill.  It may be implemented or adopted by local authorities or it may be ignored, and it is very important in view of the proposed method of financing this Bill and the schemes to be worked out under it that we should bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>I do not think we need to waste much time with the second objective of this Bill, namely payment of rates by instalments.  Most local authorities, and in particular most rate collectors, have always acted in a reasonable way in this respect and have accepted rates by instalments where there is an obvious hardship on the ratepayer to pay in two moieties.  I agree that the putting of this system of payment of rates by instalment on a formal basis is a good thing because people on not very large fixed incomes will find it easier to pay by monthly instalments than twice yearly.  They will not be subject to the temptation of spending the money on something else and then finding, when March and September come, that they have not the money available.  I agree that this would probably add something to the expense of collecting rates but it is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to grant relief to necessitous ratepayers, to exempt them from rates, and this will enable local authorities to bring into operation schemes which will relieve those needy people of payment of rates.  I was quite pleased early this year when, in ignorance of the fact that such a measure was contemplated, I put down a question asking the Minister if he would exempt social welfare classes from rates and I was informed by the Minister that he was introducing such a measure and that it would be open to local authorities to operate it during their current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear this because in my capacity as a public representative I have learned in the last years that this question of rates is a genuine hardship on people living on small incomes. I knew, for example, that people living on old age pensions and widows' pensions had to contribute as much as <Col N="2107" /> 10/- weekly for rates.  I had to make representations about the rent of a county council cottage occupied by a person living on an income of just over £7 weekly and I was amazed to find out that out of a rent of just over £1, approximately 10/- was attributable to rates.  This I regard as unjust and unfair.  Therefore, I welcome the promise by the Minister to introduce legislation to enable relief from payment of rates to be given to these classes.</P>
    <P>I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed with the measure as it stands.  It will not achieve even the limited objects which it sets out to achieve.  That is the principal objection I have to it.  It will not achieve the very limited but desirable objects which it sets out to achieve.  If it does, it will impose hardship on other categories of ratepayers who are already feeling the pinch and finding it very severe.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the social welfare beneficiaries of the means test categories. That is, broadly speaking, the type or category of person who is to be exempt from rates if the local authorities implement this measure.  Added to that class will be cases of special hardship. Before I go on to the point I want to make in particular, I want to say that I sometimes find it hard to see why the Minister, in granting a relief such as this, differentiates between the social welfare classes of the means test section and the contributory section.  Take two old age pensioners, one in receipt of a contributory pension and one in receipt of a non-contributory pension.  Assume that neither of these pensioners has any other income or any other assets.  I think the difference in their income is so little that it does not matter.  It is only a matter of shillings.  Yet, in this measure the Minister proposes that the exemption shall apply to the means test category only and cases of special hardship.</P>
    <P>I would welcome this measure so far as it goes, and I would welcome it even if it only applied to this very limited class of people, if the Minister were providing the money to pay for it, <Col N="2108" /> but he is not, and that is my principal objection to this measure.  Deputy Dowling who has just spoken agrees that the present rating system is outdated and out-moded.  Although he did not use the expressions, I am sure he would also agree that it is unjust and inequitable because it does not have any regard to the capacity of the ratepayer to pay.  I have been riding this hobby horse in the House for some time.  Even the Minister for Health, speaking on the Health Estimate earlier this year, or speaking on some of his estimates or some measure he introduced, conceded that there was a lot to be said for and against making the health charges a national charge.  He said that the principal argument in favour of that was that it fell on a broader back and was a more equitable way of getting money.</P>
    <P>I say that the present rating system is unjust and inequitable because it does not have any regard to the capacity of people to pay and that, if it were shifted to the national Exchequer, it would fall on a far broader back.  Section 2 of the Bill enables the local authorities to make schemes providing for the waiver by the authorities of all or portion of the rates due to them by ratepayers or classes of ratepayers or in respect of hereditaments of a class or classes specified in the scheme.  That is provided in subsection (1).  Subsection (4) of the same section provides that the cost of implementing the scheme shall be borne by the other ratepayers of the county.  In effect, that is what it says, according to my reading and understanding of it.</P>
    <P>The people in the classes proposed to be covered by the proposed scheme will be relieved of rates if the local authorities prepare a scheme, but the cost will be passed on to the other ratepayers who will not fall within these classes.  I want to go on record as saying that the payment of rates by a great many of these other ratepayers is already an extreme hardship. There are many small business people in the towns of this country who, due to the change in the system of distribution of goods and the coming into operation of the supermarkets and that sort of thing, find themselves with little <Col N="2109" /> or no business.  Many of them are advanced in years.  They are living in houses with valuations of £20, £25 or £30 and they are paying rates of from £80 to £100 each year on those houses.</P>
    <P>These people are to be asked by the Minister in this measure to defray what, in effect, is a social service, because I regard the provisions of that section of this Bill, the waiver of rates in the case of necessitous people, as a social welfare service, as something the same as an old age pension, children's allowances, or a widow's pension. These people who are already finding it extremely difficult to pay their rates and are feeling the pinch of the increase in rates&mdash;and they are increasing year by year by something to the tune of 10/- in the £&mdash;are to have this additional burden imposed on them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing a measure like this he should have availed of the opportunity to start phasing out the rating system.  He should have said that the Exchequer would pay the amount of money involved in this relief.  Perhaps it is only right that we should ask ourselves: is there any precedent on the Statute Book for granting a relief from rates? Of course there is.  The farming community have enjoyed partial relief from rates and for a few years back the farming community, within certain valuation limits, have been totally exempt from rates, but the other ratepayers in the country, the other farmers in the country, are not asked to foot the bill. No, the Exchequer foots it; the Exchequer pays by way of additional agricultural grant or under some other heading the amount involved in granting exemption to the category of farmers who enjoy either partial or total exemption from rates.  Why are we adopting a different approach here? Why are we asking the other ratepayers to carry this burden when we do not do it in the case of the relief granted to farmers?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister when replying to tell us how many county councils have so far acted on his circular and prepared a scheme for exemption from rates in respect of this year.  I would also ask him to tell us <Col N="2110" /> how many local authorities have either refused point blank to prepare such a scheme or have adjourned consideration of it until such time as the Minister is prepared to undertake the cost involved.  I think many county councils have either refused altogether to implement the scheme because of the cost involved or have adjourned consideration of it until such time as the Minister decides to accept responsibility for the cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, in the closing sentence or two of his speech, asked the House for suggestions not only in relation to the terms of the Bill but also in relation to its implementation.  I think the Minister will have the unanimous support of this House, including his own Party, too, if he at this stage is agreeable to make this a national charge.  I want to emphasise that if he does not, two things are likely to happen.  Local authorities will not avail of this enabling measure at all, and that would be a great pity, because so far as it goes it is a highly desirable measure; it is a move in the right direction.  However, I am convinced that many local authorities will not implement it simply and solely because the rates in their own functional areas have already reached saturation point: £4 in the £ now is commonplace and, as we know, in some county council areas the rates are more than £5 in the £.  That is point No. 1.</P>
    <P>Point No. 2 is: if the local authorities to decide to go ahead and implement the scheme they will be imposing a very severe burden, indeed, on the categories of persons I have mentioned, that is, the people living in polite poverty in houses in respect of which they have to pay £80 or £100 a year rates.  As I have said previouslythe present rating system is so outrageously unjust that you may have side by side two semi-detached houses each of them with a rateable valuation of £20, one house occupied by a family with a total income of £40 a week and the other house occupied by somebody with an income of £8 or £9 a week.  The people in both of those houses are going to be asked to pay £80 a year rates and both of them are going to have their rates increased <Col N="2111" /> under this measure, if it goes through, to defray what is really a social obligation on every man, woman and child in this country who is earning. Surely the provision of houses for the people is a social obligation and what is involved in this measure is a measure of social welfare, a discharge of a social obligation of the community to these people in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>It might have been said that when local government was first introduced, I suppose, nearly 100 years ago and when rates were first introduced, only people with property, only people who occupied houses or owned land, had money and could afford to finance schemes such as this, but surely that is not the position now.  We all know that money is being spent freely; we all know that many people who are not married, who are living in digs or who are living at home with their people are in receipt of good salaries.  A scheme like this should fall on the broadest possible shoulders.</P>
    <P>I am not firing the measure back in the Minister's teeth and saying it is an insult.  I am saying that what the Bill sets out to do is a move in the right direction, the relief or the exemption from rates of people in necessitous circumstances. I am emphasising to the Minister that it will not achieve that object because the local authority will not implement it.  I am also saying that this is the wrong way to finance it.  The Minister and the Government concede that the present rating system is unjust but they are saying it will take time, and I suppose a long time, to find a better scheme.  That is the argument the Minister will put up and that the Government have been putting up.  If that is the position, surely it is wrong to keep adding charges to the rates which are more properly defrayed otherwise.  I accept, therefore, the Minister's invitation to offer suggestions for the implementation of this measure, and I appeal to him even at this late stage to have second thoughts about it and to make it a national charge.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister says that the amount involved in <Col N="2112" /> implementing the proposed scheme will be very small indeed.  I think there is an error.  It is very hard to read that section of the Minister's speech, but I think he meant to say it is only about the equivalent of what is written off each year as irrecoverable.  We have been told by our county manager that the amount involved in this could be substantial.  However, if what the Minister says is right, that it will take a very insignificant sum of money to implement it, is that not the best argument in favour of making it a national charge and dealing with it in the same way as the exemption from rates in respect of farmers on agricultural holdings is dealt with?</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any answer to the case I am making.  I trust the Minister, between now and the Committee Stage, will see fit to delete subsection (4) of section 2 and substitute another section for it.  If Deputy Hogan or any other Deputy on this side of the House puts down an amendment to do that I know it will be ruled out of order as imposing a charge on the Exchequer; but the Minister can bring in such a measure and if he is genuine and sincere in granting relief to this necessitous class of people he will do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has already dealt at some length with the main objections which the Labour Party have to this short Bill.  I should like to make some further small objections and a few suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill under its two provisions brings some small measure of relief, the Labour Party is supporting its enactment.  However, we are against this method of rate collection under three main headings.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has mentioned one: that the income of ratepayers or householders is not taken into account when rates are being levied.  As a matter of fact there are many instances where households who have lost the breadwinner find themselves with a very large house, paying very high rates and their only way out is to sell the house and buy a smaller one.  We feel the Minister could come to the aid of this type of individual under the Bill if he <Col N="2113" /> were to provide some small relief for people in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second objection we have is that valuations vary greatly from house to house and from area to area.  Indeed, houses of almost equal size or similar area are rated differently inside the same county.  This is true in the case of older houses, particularly in the towns, which are valued at much less than the newer buildings.  In the last few years buildings have been valued more on their floor area than on their location as was the practice in the past.</P>
    <P>An urgent revaluation of all property in the State is called for.  Relief could be given if some Departments, who have large holdings in the counties, were made partially rateable depending on the type of property they had.  In my own county the Forestry Division have large areas which are completely exempt from rates.  If some measure of rating were put on that land it would reduce the overall amount of rates to be paid by the rest of the ratepaying community.</P>
    <P>Our third objection is that there is a patchwork of uneven rates from county to county and even within counties.  In my own constituency we have three different rates all of which are higher than the rural rate.  The result is that we have a lot of development on the boundary of each urban area and just outside it because people find it cheaper to build just in the county areas and they gain some measure of relief by that method.</P>
    <P>The first main provision of the Bill is the waiver of rates but the fact is that very few people are going to benefit under this provision.  The regulations which the Minister has laid down have reduced the numbers who will benefit to a very small figure.  In my own town the amount of relief which will be given is about £300 and that, in a warrant of about £44,000, is almost negligible.  This £300 will have to be paid for by other ratepayers, some of whom may be in a worse position than the people to whom the benefit is being given, and this makes it all the more objectionable.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for some relief to be given to a category of <Col N="2114" /> ratepayers who occupy small dwellings. &ldquo;Small dwellings&rdquo; under the Act are dwelling with a valuation of £6 and under.  In many cases the people in the small dwellings do not pay any rates at all because many of the houses are owned by landlords and landlords are liable for the rates.  If this provision were to go through the people in these rented houses may not benefit by the Bill at all.  It could even happen that the owner of the premises will be the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Under the second provision, dealing with instalments, the Minister plans to introduce payment by instalments from April to February.  As anybody who has ever dealt with rates knows the estimates are prepared and put before a meeting of the council in March but the rate is not struck until later in the financial year.  By the time rate books are made up it may be the middle of July before the rate collector starts his first collection.  The amount of each instalment cannot be accurately gauged at the beginning of the year until the complete figure is known.  As this may take until the middle of June or July it means that the instalments cannot be equal instalments.  As the year goes on, with rates getting higher each year, the later instalments may have to be changed in order to take into account increases from the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked for suggestions and I should like to make a suggestion under this provision of instalments. Instalments are to help people living in urban areas, particularly those paying rates for the first time, who may have a new house.  Many of these will be paying SDA loans.  These loan payments are due at the beginning of the financial year and in April and again in October.  I would ask the Minister if he could combine the two instalments so that the people paying SDA loans could pay the loan and their rates by instalments as equal as possible over the 12 months.</P>
    <P>Instalments relate more or less to people in urban areas.  I do not think payment by instalment would be of any great benefit to the farming community. Their rates payments are <Col N="2115" /> usually made in October when they are paid for their produce.</P>
    <P>Rates are divided into two moities, the first being due on demand, which could be July or August, and the second being due on demand on 1st October.  Because of this system, a person in a rural area, particularly a farmer, could find himself called on to pay a full year's rates at once after 1st October because he had failed to pay his first moiety during the period April to the end of September.  The Minister could give some relief to the rural community by extending the period for the collection of the first moiety to the end of October.  It would also regulate the time which the collector has to collect his rates, usually about nine months.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention what the position of rate collectors would be when the new system is introduced. Rate collectors are paid either by way of basic salary or by bonus, the bonus being paid at certain times throughout the year.  The Minister did not say how the instalment system, if brought into general use, would cut across the law relating to rate collectors.  As far as I am aware, a collector is entitled to demand the first moiety as soon as he gets his warrant, and the second moiety on 1st October.  Under an instalment system, the collectors' bonus periods would have to be altered in county and urban areas.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister consider carefully the question of rate collectors.  This Bill will affect their positions and their incomes very definitely.</P>
    <P>A colleague has dealt with the objections we have to the Bill.  However, because of the relief which the Bill will bring to certain categories, we support it.  We hope that the relief given to certain ratepayers will be financed from some source other than the ratepayers who get such relief in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I regard it as a very progressive step and a further indication of the Minister's desire to secure a greater levelling up of the standard of living of our society, even though I realise the reliefs contained in this Bill will be applied mainly to social welfare classes.  As <Col N="2116" /> a public representative of some years standing, I have received many callers and many letters from constituents welcoming this measure as a first step, a recognition in any case of the need to remedy anomalies in our rating system.</P>
      <P>Year after year in Dublin Corporation, particularly during the sensitive period of the consideration of estimates preparatory to the striking of a rate, we have had appeals and protests against the striking of a high rate.  Inevitably, appeals are made in respect of widows and pensioners.  We are told about their incapacity to meet the rates burden.  This measure is designed, and we welcome it in that sense, to relieve these classes.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced as a first step to easing the burden of rates and is the result of a recommendation of the interdepartmental committee set up by the Government.  It is to be welcomed for the relief it will give to a very deserving section of ratepayers, and I should like to regard it as just an instalment of further legislation to try to deal with this complex question.</P>
      <P>With demands on local authorities, particularly in Dublin city, for more housing and more educational and recreational facilities, the cost of providing these services will be considerable and I look forward to the day when a more equitable system of raising finances to meet these demands may be evolved.  Certain speakers have been critical of this measure because they suggest it puts the burden on the local authorities.  Any citizen with a social conscience should welcome it and realise that the less well-off section of the community should be helped.  The Minister has taken a very humanitarian stand in introducing this measure which I welcome and commend.</P>
      <P>On the question of the interdepartmental committee, there is a feeling outside that, perhaps, it might be wiser to bring other interests into the deliberations so that on this very complex problem their views might be obtained. I should like the Minister to deal with this matter because there is a feeling that no matter how excellent the people in the Civil Service are it would be wise if outside interests were consulted and their views obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> I welcome the section dealing with the question of payment of rates by instalments.  This has been in operation in Dublin city and county and I think the extension of those facilities is a very progressive step on which I congratulate the Minister.  We have had criticism here that this suggestion was a political gimmick.  I do not think that is so because we all know that this committee has been sitting for a number of years and a gradual public opinion was developing for the redress of the rating system.  The first people we must seek to help are those least able to bear the burden of rates.  In that context this Bill covers that category and I am very glad to be able to speak in support of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the last speaker said, a Bill of this kind deserves the serious consideration of every Deputy.  He extended congratulations to the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  If there is any congratulation due to the Minister it should be to the Minister's sense of humour for bringing in a Bill of this kind.  Everybody who reads the Bill carefully and studies it knows that this Bill is a fraud and that the proper short title of the Bill should be The Rates Gimmick (General Election) Bill, 1969.  If we read the provisions of this Bill, we see that it authorises local authorities to waive the rates in the case of certain poor people who would not have the money to pay rates one way or the other.  Those people always had the rates waived by local authorities and by county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next section deals with the payment of rates by instalments.  Every Deputy associated with local authorities in the country knows that any ratepayer who wanted to pay his rates by instalments approached the sympathetic rate collector who always accepted the rates by instalments.  We always knew that rate collectors closed their warrants on the spot but then they proceeded to collect because they knew if they did not close their warrants on the spot they would not be paid their poundage.  This Bill merely authorises local authorities not to collect rates from the non-contributory old <Col N="2118" /> age pensioners and the non-contributory social welfare recipients.  Is it not true to say in many cases, if not in all cases, that such people never had to pay rates?  At least that has been my experience for 26 or 27 years as a member of a local authority.  During that time I have always found that an old age pensioner living alone with no other source of income did not have to pay rates.  However, it is correct to say that this is the first time we have had it set out in a Bill.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that this was a Bill which would assist the poorer sections of the community.  It is not but it will certainly put an additional burden on the ratepaying community. If the Minister desired to be generous, and as he says himself it is a most insignificant sum which is concerned here, why did he not add that insignificant sum as a contribution from the Exchequer to local authorities for the relief of rates?  There is a responsibility on a rating authority to provide from the rates the allocation for housing, a very substantial allocation for health services, the allocation for special lighting, county road repairs, maintenance, water, sewerage and other public services.  It is also correct to say that the farming community legally enjoy what we can describe as a substantial abatement in rates providing they can certify that they have in their employment certain qualified employees for whom they can claim the abatement.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is no abatement, reduction or concession for the urban ratepayer, the town ratepayer, the small country shopkeeper who is being put out of business by the supermarket combines, the small shopkeeper who is being crushed out of existence by increased overheads, the urban dweller who, if he carries out any small improvement on his property, has a revaluation which will mean a very substantial increase in his rates.  Here we find the Minister bringing in a Bill to give concessions to certain ratepayers but he is, in fact, making concessions to people who already enjoy those facilities.  He is providing for the payment of rates in instalments although we all know that this has already been <Col N="2119" /> in operation.  Our rate collectors are reasonable, humane people who never implemented their warrants for collecting rates on people who could not pay.</P>
    <P>The most serious objection that the public and members of local authorities will take to this Bill is that it gives nothing to the local authorities or ratepayers out of the Central Fund. So well the Minister can pose as a generous man if he is giving nothing. This is a case in which there is nothing given to any local authority to make up for the rates that will be waived as a result of the passing of this Bill. In other words, the amount to be collected on a warrant from the recipients of non-contributory pensions will be switched to the well burdened shoulders of the ratepaying community who must pay, that is, the town dweller, the owner of a private residence, the agricultural community, the owners of business premises, factory premises or whatever they may be. That is the serious objection members of local authorities have to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister invited suggestions.  I would say the most practical suggestion that can be made to him is not to ask the ratepayers, who are already finding it difficult enough to pay the rates, to pay more rates.  Other Deputies pointed out that the rates have now gone to almost £5 in the £ and this Bill will be an additional burden on them together with having to meet the increases that have taken place, and are due to take place, in every county in Ireland where they are preparing the estimates for the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider this Bill.  As he says, a small amount of money is involved.  I would ask him, however small that amount is, to give it from the Central Fund and not impose it on the shoulders of ratepayers who are already put to the pin of their collar to pay the rates.  The Minister has differentiated in this Bill between contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners both living alone.  Would it not be the proper and decent thing to do, in so far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned, where you have recipients of either home assistance or any kind <Col N="2120" /> of social welfare benefits not to make any distinction between them?  Give them all the benefit of this Bill for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>The Minister could do this by providing the amount necessary to compensate local authorities from the Central Fund and by extending this Bill to all social welfare recipients, whether contributory or non-contributory. These are two practical suggestions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the payment of rates by instalments, I have known this to be in operation in my local authority for as long as I can remember.  Perhaps there are local authorities in which this practice is not followed.  If there is to be any advantage from that I presume that the advantage would be to those ratepayers whose rates may be in the region of £700 to £1,500 and who would avail of the advantage of paying by instalments so that they could leave whatever money they have on deposit account to earn interest. However, it will be of no benefit to the very small ratepayer and that is why I say that it is a great pity that the Minister, when he was introducing the Bill, did not consider the plight of the already overburdened ratepayers who have been expecting some relief and who are entitled to some relief.</P>
    <P>The granting of concessions to people who have never paid rates and never will pay rates because of their very poor family circumstances is an effort to put over a fraud on the local authorities so that it may be used as a publicity gimmick for those who are not affected.  If the Minister seriously wishes to help the one way in which he can do so is by providing the necessary moneys out of the Exchequer. That would be welcomed by members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I heard some Deputy say that there are some local authorities who are not accepting the provisions of this Bill. It would be most regrettable if local authorities did not accept the reasonable provisions of any Local Government Bill but, nevertheless, this Bill is an effort by the Minister to push over a burden on the ratepaying community. It is giving no relief to the country in general and no relief to the taxpaying <Col N="2121" /> community; rather, it is adding an additional burden to those who always paid their rates and it is not providing any improvement for those who have never paid because they could not pay and cannot pay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to include provisions at the next Stage of the Bill for the inclusion of all recipients of social welfare benefits, contributory and non-contributory.  The Minister should give us more information as to what legislation we are likely to have during the next 12 months regarding the whole rating system.  I presume that we cannot debate it on this Bill but the ratepaying community of this country are seeking such information. They are anxious for some relief because the stage has now been reached when the last straw has very definitely broken the camel's back.  Our rating system has failed and we have reached the stage where the ratepaying community are becoming exhausted in their appeal to have some measure of relief brought about.</P>
    <P>While the motives for this Bill are very much political I consider it desirable, at the same time, that we should have a measure on the Statute Book that will give some relief to the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to both rate collectors and county managers who have always exercised great sympathy and understanding in so far as the problems of the less fortunate section of the rate-paying community were concerned.  I am sure the Minister realises that when the local government auditor visits the various councils to conduct his audit he is very particular when examining cases in which rates were waived.  We can say that in no case has a person in dire poverty ever been asked or compelled to pay rates. Therefore, the measure of relief this Bill brings is an added burden on those who are already paying more than their share of rates; and I trust that the Minister, as a result of whatever enlightenment he has received from this debate, will sympathetically consider the provision of moneys from the Exchequer.  Again, with regard to the paying of rates by instalments, it would be no harm to have it in writing, <Col N="2122" /> although the Minister knows as well as everybody else that there was always a system, in rural Ireland at any rate, whereby rates could be paid in this manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister should lose no time in coming to the aid of local authorities who now find that the whole rating system is rendering it impossible to provide the services to the ratepaying community that are now being demanded. I do not know what measure of relief the ratepayers will get as a result of the new Health Act and the taking over of certain link roads by the Minister but I do know that the patience of ratepayers has been exhausted in so far as promises are concerned. That is why I expressed concern at the manner in which this Bill was introduced in so far as it provides relief for people who never had to pay rates while at the same time gave no concessions to local authorities by way of a contribution from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, may I go on record as not being opposed to the measure?  It is not a measure which one could oppose, but it is a measure on which one could make constructive suggestions as to how it should be improved. In its present form the Bill is a fraud and until it comes in its next form it will not be of any benefit particularly to any rating authority.  I hope the Minister will act on the suggestions he has heard from Deputies Fitzpatrick, Treacy and Kavanagh tonight.  They made intelligent and sensible suggestions. The Minister is not pulling the wool over anyone's eyes by a short Bill of this kind.  The ratepaying community are wise, smart people who can see around corners from time to time.  They are not going to be hoodwinked by a Bill of this kind that bestows no benefits on them.  The proper title of this Bill should be the Rates (Fraud and Gimmick) Bill, 1969.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for the first time in the Nineteenth Dáil, I am pleased to discuss such a Bill as this. I am particularly pleased that this Bill is, in essence, already functioning in that the Minister has already notified the county councils that they can allow easement of rates in the cases of necessitous persons.  We are all aware that <Col N="2123" /> until now when a rate bill was presented the demand had to be paid in full or not at all.  The local authorities had no power, as such, to cut the bill in half where this could have been possible and would have been acceptable to the person on whom the demand was made.</P>
      <P>For a long time I, with almost every other Member of the House, had been urging that something should be done to effect an easement of rates on certain classes of people.  Many people live on fixed incomes.  There are people whose incomes have not risen in line with those of other sections of the community. There are people living on pensions or small annuities.  During the general election campaign, I was constantly under fire from people about the high rates bill.  Everyone who has studied the rating system has finally come to the conclusion that there is no alternative to it.  The reports issued by the committee set up to examine the rates question came to the same conclusion.  One of the great faults which I found with the system was that people could only pay their rates in two moieties.  Provision was made by certain local authorities for people to pay the bill in instalments if they wanted to.  This idea of introducing an instalment scheme has not come too soon.  I can well imagine the agitation that would exist throughout the country if people were to get their electricity, telephone or gas bills for the year to be paid in two moieties.  I remember reading one of the reports of the committee in which it was pointed out that a person who smoked 20 cigarettes a day would pay to the Exchequer, at today's prices of cigarettes, £65 a year approximately. If that sum had to be paid in two moieties fewer people would be smoking today and there would be a tremendous outcry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission brought out another point.  It pointed out that the person who drove an average-size car 10,000 miles in a year paid to the Exchequer approximately £70 a year.  If one had to pay this sum in two parts it would really focus attention on how much money was being paid out.  The rates are no exception.  I should like to see every local authority introducing a <Col N="2124" /> system where people could pay their rates either every month or every two months.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan was critical of the fact that this would not apply to contributory pensioners.  This scheme is for non-contributory pensioners.  My understanding of this Bill is that anyone who can prove to a local authority that he does not have the money to pay the rates will get an easement of the rates bill.  I am surprised to see in the Minister's speech that the cost to the country as a whole would be approximately 0.7 per cent of the rates.  I do not know whether I am correct in assuming this is the amount of the rates collected which would be set aside for easements.  The report suggested two per cent of all rates collected should be set aside for easement to necessitous persons.  I feel the community at large would not begrudge paying an extra two per cent on their rates if such sum would help people in dire need. I know many people would object to this but there are many people who are put to the pin of their collar to find the money to pay the rates.  People have had to go to hospital and have lost wages, or may not have any income during such period, but they still have had to provide the money to pay the rates on the threat of their furniture or belongings being taken away from them and being sold to pay the bill.  I am sure this did not happen, and I hope it did not happen, but the threats were there.  I would hope that the Minister would make it very clear to each rating authority that the basic necessity for an easement of rates is the fact that a person just does not have the income to pay the rates. I am quite sure this easement will not be given too recklessly.</P>
    <P>When I hear people in this House complaining about the high cost of rates and about the high cost of health charges on the rates I feel that these are often the most generous people for trying to get medical cards for applicants. I am quite sure they do not ask anyone &ldquo;Do you realise that your fellow citizens are having to pay for your medicines?  Are you sure you cannot provide for medical attention yourself?&rdquo; Most county councillors try to outdo one another in getting <Col N="2125" /> medical cards for people.  I am in favour of medical cards for those who need them, but I sometimes feel that there is not a conscientious approach on the part of many people in examining the cases or recommending medical cards for people.  From time to time I have made representations for people who have asked for medical cards.  I have written to the Dublin Health Authority and had a reply from them stating that the persons in question had refused to provide certain information to the inspector calling on them.  This would indicate that the persons had some other means which they did not want to disclose.</P>
    <P>As I see it, this Bill sets out to ease the burden on the person who just cannot meet the bill, to ease the position of people who have had to sell the homes in which they lived all their lives because they could not afford to keep them any longer.</P>
    <P>Thank God Fianna Fáil were returned so that they could have the Second Stage of this Bill.  As you are aware, Sir, the First Stage of the Bill was introduced in the last Dáil and I am delighted that there has been no delay in introducing the Second Stage. I hope that no unfair advantage will be taken by members of county councils who, hoping to get extra votes, might aid or abet people to obtain an easement of their rates which they do not really need.  No doubt this is something which the local authorities will be quite expert in detecting.  I hope, through this Bill, we will be able to increase the help we give to these unfortunate people who up to now have been in dread of the rates system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Briscoe's opinion of county councillors in general does not coincide with mine. As we are aware, many of the people serving on county councils are giving their time and effort almost in a voluntary capacity and I must say that I found the councillors whom I have met to be generous and hard working in the main.  As far as the Bill itself is concerned, year in, year out the rates have increased significantly and have placed an almost intolerable burden on householders and farmers all over the country. The increases, which have been <Col N="2126" /> considerable, have applied to everybody in rural and urban areas.  However, the rates have to be found because they help to pay for such services as dispensaries, hospitals, roads, libraries and so on, and we are all agreed that these are essential services and must be provided.</P>
      <P>There has not been agreement, however, up to now about the method by which rates are collected.  Anybody would be perturbed to see such people as widows or old age pensioners having to meet a heavy rates demand every year, a demand which they might not be able to pay.  This imposed a burden on them and, indeed, was something that can be described as a glaring imposition on those people.  I am pleased to see that this Bill goes a certain distance towards relieving the situation and in so far as it does I am in agreement with it and welcome it.  It will help to give relief to a section of the community who really need such help because not alone have their incomes not kept pace with those of other sections but in many cases have fallen considerably behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that many people in this section have not up to now being paying the rates and that is true. Many of them were unable to pay the rates demanded of them.  At least this Bill will help to legalise the situation and help to allay the fears of many people who each year were faced with this demand, who paid it if they were able and who did not pay it if they were not able.  In regard to the mechanics of the scheme, I hope the Minister will ensure that the county managers will treat all those who are to benefit with as much courtesy and kindness as possible and also see that the matter is dealt with in as private a manner as possible.  I hope many people will benefit, that there will be many people who can prove they are deserving and are not able to pay the rates.  In regard to proving their inability to pay, I hope the county managers will approach them in as fair, open and reasonable a manner as possible.  I know that in the case of other schemes such as the provision of free lighting, free television and so on, many people who applied were turned <Col N="2127" /> down for various reasons.  In a number of cases I applied on behalf of people and their claims were rejected.  I hope in this instance they will be treated as fairly as possible and that this scheme will not be just a gimmick but a sincere effort to benefit these people.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is based on a recommendation from the committee on local taxation which reported in July, 1968.  They made other recommendations and one was that rates should be stabilised over a number of years.  This is something that is very necessary but it is outside the scope of this Bill and I hope to deal with it on a future occasion.  As has been said already, the Minister should endeavour, if at all possible, to see that this taxation burden which is now going to be placed on the councils should be transferred to the Exchequer.  Somebody has to provide the money but it would be more equitable if the money was paid from the Exchequer instead of from the local authorities and I would recommend that that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall intervene very, very briefly to support this Bill.  It is noteworthy for the large element of social justice which has gone into it. There have been many complaints in the recent past about the way our social welfare classes have been treated from the point of view of rates.  This initial step in the charter of social justice will prove a welcome relief.  The Bill gives effect to some of the fundamental philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have always been conscious of the need to favour those who can ill afford to look after themselves.  One of the most penal taxes in our society is that of rates, more particularly when applied to those who cannot afford to pay them.  Certain rural Deputies have argued that the Bill will be ineffective in the context of their particular areas. As a Deputy representing a Dublin constituency I should like to remind them that, day in and day out, one is literally besieged with callers to one's home and to Leinster House, and with telephone calls, bringing to notice appalling cases of hardship.  I believe this Bill will put an end to such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> The Minister pointed out there are two elements in the Bill&mdash;the right to waive rates, on the one hand, and the provision for the payment of rates by instalments on the other.  With regard to the right to waive rates in necessitous cases I would strongly make a case for the widow with five, four or three children, living in a non-local authority house.  There are many widows in the constituency I represent who are trying to educate their children and who have to work in order to do so.  Some may be lucky enough to have a small pension. In most cases there is no pension at all and the only alternative to nonpayment of rates is for them to get out and go to live in a flat or in some abode entirely unsuitable from the point of view of the way of life to which they have been accustomed when their husbands were alive.  They should receive particular consideration under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the Bill.  It should be recognised that this is but the beginning of the real alleviation of the rates problem in general. In my constituency provision has been made for a number of years past for the payment of rates by monthly instalments.  This is greatly appreciated. This Bill represents a tremendous step forward in the context of social justice. Deputies should recognise that.  We have a very important function from the point of view of social justice.  We have a duty to look after these people and to assist them in every way we can.  I am grateful to the Minister for what he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody agrees that those in need should get relief from rates and that the less well-off should be allowed to pay their rates in instalments.  I agree with those speakers who said the Exchequer should pay and I agree with Deputy O.J. Flanagan that the discrimination between contributory and non-contributory is wrong.  Deputy Dowling said that business people should pay for this amelioration of the position of the less fortunate amongst us.  Deputy Dowling must know that business people look on rates in the same way as they view electricity, water, wages, <i>et cetera.</i> Rates are an overhead and if these <Col N="2129" /> rates are paid by businessmen then these businessmen will, in turn, transfer these costs to the customer.  Eventually it is the customer who will have to pay. The relief involved here is not very large, but it will have to be paid by somebody.  If business people carried this relief without passing it on to customers the Government might decide they had been overcharging.  Automatically costs will go up and the person getting relief will have to pay those increased costs.  This relief should be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Our rating system is outdated.  Small shopkeepers all over the country are being put out of business by the supermarkets. They are not able to pay the high rates.  All rates should be borne by the Exchequer.  The Government could find this money by increasing income tax.  At least, when one pays income tax, one has earned the money on which to pay it.  Very often people are asked to pay rates when they have no money at all.  They may have to borrow to pay their rates.  Any increase in rates will hit workers paying up to £80 or £90 per annum on valuations of £20.  These extra charges will create a big burden where they are concerned and they, in due process of time, will look for increased wages.  All we are doing is relieving one person and putting the charge on another who in turn is looking for compensation.  Nobody will object to the lower paid or badly off people getting what is a social benefit but this social benefit should not be put on the rates.  The Exchequer should pay for it.  Then tax somebody for it.  Put it on anyone you like but pay it out of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, we have two annual Budgets and now a hidden budget in the rates. This new scheme will mean that in certain counties where there are many social welfare recipients there will be very few left to pay the rates.  I am thinking of the west of Ireland.  These few will have to pay for the majority. If they are business people they will have to increase their charges to compensate themselves.  There will be different standards in different counties. In County Cork as compared with the city the scheme will be operated differently. There will be jealousy because some people in Cork city will get relief <Col N="2130" /> while others in the county will not get it.  The same will happen in Dublin. The same will happen in the west of Ireland.  There should be some standard laid down by the Minister to be complied with.  It is wrong that the city manager, who has to regard things academically, should grant the relief or not.  The matter should be one for the public representatives on the local authority.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to consider having the cost of this scheme borne by the Exchequer.  We all agree with the principle but disagree as to where the money should come from.  Some people say that it should come out of the rates, others say it should not.  In my view it should come out of the Central Fund as a social welfare benefit.  Everybody agrees that those in need should have relief. There is general agreement that the rates should be paid in instalments. There is not agreement on the point that the burden should be borne by the rates.  On this side of the House we believe that the health charges and the cost of the scheme set out in this Bill should come out of the Central Fund and not out of the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of rates by instalment is something which has been accepted in many counties for quite a long time but there has been great divergence of opinion with regard to this matter over a long period and it is time that legislation was introduced to bring about some rule or regulation which would be complied with universally.  Up to now county managers and rate collectors have taken various attitudes towards this question of whether to allow rates to go uncollected or to collect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has suggested here that there might be abuse by the intervention of county councillors.  I do not think that would happen, certainly not in my county.  Rates, as we know them today, are a completely outmoded method of taxation.  No matter what any committee or member of a committee may say it is wrong to continue along the existing lines.  For instance, there may be a doctor who may be a semi-millionaire who would be paying no rates because he was a boarder in somebody else's house while the <Col N="2132" /> unfortunate person in whose house he was living would have to pay a tremendous amount of rates.  Rates should be related to capacity to pay. It is in that respect that we have fallen down.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is anxious to get in and I do not want to delay him.  I believe that the present rating system is crazy.  I hope that some proper method will be thought out of distributing this terrible imposition in some fairer way.  The people who are really hit are the small shopkeepers in country towns.  While farmers have been given a rebate of rates on valuations up to £20, and all that kind of thing, the shopkeeper has got nothing. His position is deteriorating as a result of the advent of supermarkets and the big men.  His rates have increased.  If he paints the front of his house and some smart alec reports him, his valuation could be doubled.  If he builds on a few square feet to his house his valuation could be doubled.  He is the sufferer.  It is on his behalf that I appeal to the Minister to make it possible for him to exist.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It brings a great deal of good to some people and certainly cannot bring anybody any harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O.J. Flanagan typified the Opposition approach to this Bill when, almost in the same breath, he described it as a fraud conferring no benefit on anybody and then went on to refer to the crushing impost this was going to put on the backs of certain ratepayers.  Now, surely even Deputy O.J. Flanagan can see the contradictory nature of those two statements.  If a crushing impost is going to fall on somebody's shoulders as a result of this, then this measure must be going to result in the raising of a considerable amount of money, and where is that money going to go? If the money is going to be raised and used then it surely must confer some benefit on somebody?  But, because the Opposition parties could not find anything in the proposals in the Bill to attack, they had to adopt this typically contradictory approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> I do not think anybody could reasonably say that, in introducing this Bill, I tried to represent it as doing anything more than what in fact it does.  I did not suggest for a moment that this was a proposal to deal in any comprehensive way with the objections many people have to the system of rates, to the payment of rates.  I do not know of anybody else who ever contended that it did, either.  However, that does not mean, as Deputy Treacy said, that the proposals in the Bill are worthless.  They are not worthless.  I agree, and I said myself before anybody on the Opposition benches suggested it, that, in general, those who are likely to be exempted by the local authorities&mdash;who, by the way, will themselves decide on the classes of persons to be exempted from paying rates &mdash;are people who do not in fact pay rates now.  But that is the point: in general, they do not but some of them do and some of them do because of the fact that there is a requirement on rate collectors now to take every possible step to collect the full rate warrant.</P>
    <P>People are of different types.  Some people will be tough enough to resist the demands of the rate collectors. Some people will be well enough advised, maybe by public representatives, of the fact that, if they do not pay these rates because they are not able to, they will in fact be struck off at the end of the year.  But others are not; others, when they get a demand, and another demand, and then a final demand, make it their business to scrape up these sums for rates from some source and pay them.  All that this Bill does is that it enables local authorities to exempt these people from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and, in doing that, to exempt the rate collectors from the unpleasant duty that is on them at present of compelling people to pay rates when they know, themselves, that these people just are not capable of doing this.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, in the circular, we suggested that recipients of non-contributory pensions, recipients of social assistance should be one of the classes to be excluded but I also, I think, made it clear that other cases of hardship could be included also.  I also made it <Col N="2134" /> clear that it is in fact the local authorities themselves who will draw up these schemes.  If they know of other classes of people to whom the payment of rates is an unbearable hardship then they can include these.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who objected to what he called the discrimination between recipients of contributory and non-contributory social welfare.  The thing about the recipient of a contributory pension, for instance, as opposed to a non-contributory pension is that we do not know anything at all about the means of the recipient of a contributory pension&mdash;nothing at all.  He could have any means.  We do not know anything about his means by virtue of the fact that he has this type of social welfare pension.  However, in so far as the social assistance classes are concerned, we do know that they have already been means tested.  It is admitted, I have never denied, that the rates of social assistance are low. Therefore, if a person has been subjected to a means test and is in receipt of social assistance it has already been established that such a person is in fact unable to pay rates because of lack of means.</P>
    <P>I do not think I claimed, either, that the provision for the payment of rates by instalments was any major proposal.  I adverted to the fact that in many cases arrangements were made for the payment of rates by instalments but it is not done universally and it is resisted in certain local authority areas. It is not a convenient way of collecting rates.  It is much more convenient to do it in the present way.  This Bill confers a statutory right on practically all ratepayers to pay their rates by instalments. It will not lessen the amount that any ratepayer will pay but I think, in general, it will make it easier for the ratepayers to make this contribution.</P>
    <P>One of the big difficulties and one of the big objections to rates is that they have to be paid and that they are demanded at present in the form of two comparatively large lump sums. During this debate, there has been from a number of Opposition speakers a demand for transference of the proportion of local authority finance that <Col N="2135" /> is raised by means of rates to this mysterious thing called the Central Fund, that is, to the general taxpayers. One thing that is certain is that if this demand were conceded, the ordinary taxpayer, the ordinary consumer who pays a proportion of his taxes by virtue of the fact that he is a consumer, would in fact pay more.  Certainly, in the city of Dublin, 50 per cent of the total rates are paid in respect of commercial properties.  This, in fact, is a suggestion to transfer this amount that is paid in respect of commercial property to the ordinary general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the tax system would not succeed in ensuring that anything approaching the same amount of rates was paid in respect of a lot of these premises.  Therefore, if this were done, the general taxpayer would clearly pay more.  I agree, however, he would pay it in a less painful way because he would pay it gradually. This proposal with regard to the payment of rates by instalments spreads the payment of rates over a longer period.  They are paid more gradually &mdash;something approaching the manner in which ordinary taxation is contributed. While it does not reduce the amount that any taxpayer will have to pay it does make it easier to pay it.  A number of Deputies said that this facility is there already but the position is that this gives a statutory right to it and it will now be available in all areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy suggested that there had been widespread opposition by local authorities to this and widespread refusals to operate it on the basis of the circular sent out by my Department but even in the county of Tipperary itself the majority of the rating authorities have in fact adopted the scheme and presumably are implementing it.  Tipperary North Riding County Council, Nenagh Urban District Council, Thurles Urban District Council, Clonmel Borough and Carrick-on-Suir have adopted schemes and the other local authorities&mdash;Tipperary South Riding County Council and Tipperary Urban District Council&mdash; have adopted schemes subject to being <Col N="2136" /> recouped the cost by the Exchequer. In the country as a whole 14 county councils, three county boroughs and 27 urbans, in other words 44 out of 87 authorities, have adopted schemes.  As I said, this is an enabling measure and local authorities are entitled to either adopt the scheme or not adopt it according as they wish.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about this being confined to social assistance recipients.  Of course that is not so at all.  It is not confined to them but it is suggested that that class should be covered.  However, the circular also recommends that there should be a relief clause included to deal with hardship cases outside the specified classes</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the cost of this particular proposal should be transferred to the Exchequer is clearly an unrealistic one.  Since it is the local authorities themselves who will be making the schemes I think it is unrealistic to suggest that there should not be any financial implications in so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that the scheme should be designed so as to ensure that this crushing new impost fell on the broadest possible shoulders.  In fact it seems certain that the total amount that will be struck off will be only marginally more than the percentage of the warrant that is at present struck off.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton suggested that the rates should be transferred to income tax.</P>

      <P>The result of this proposal would be to increase the standard rate of income tax by 50 per cent.  This Bill does not specify who will actually pay for the relief.  Whether it will be the Exchequer or the local authority. There is nothing in the Bill to say that it must be paid by the rates or that it will be paid by the Exchequer.  That would be a matter for the Finance Bill. This Bill does not commit the Government one way or the other.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening when speaking on this subject I suggested that there were five principles of foreign policy that should underlie the policies that we should adopt and indeed that any country perhaps should adopt in regard to foreign policy.  These five principles were: (1) to seek to secure the preservation of peace; (2) to secure the economic independence of our country, which in our case, perhaps more than in the case of many countries is threatened by the nature of our historical and geographical relationship with Britain; (3) positively to create the conditions in our international relationships most favourable to the advancement of our economy, especially our rural economy, and consequently to the maintenance of our separate culture in this country; (4) to secure the voluntary reunification of our country; (5) to make the maximum contribution to the world in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the point where the debate concluded I was proceeding to seek to <Col N="2138" /> apply these principles to the particular situation in which we find ourselves and to try to see what kind of foreign policy would emerge from such an application of principles.  I suggested that as regards the preservation of peace we have a role to play in Europe, that we should be seeking to contribute to a <i>détente</i> in Europe by diplomatic activity within Europe itself and not merely confined to the United Nations and that we should be playing our part to try to create an effective buffer between the two great powers, the tension between whom can be, and has at times been, a threat to our security and that of the world.  Secondly, I had said something in more detail about the need to eliminate our economic dependence on the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the third point, that is the need to create conditions in our international relationships favourable to the advancement of our economy, here again it is clear that our future lies in a European policy.  If we look at our agricultural sector, still of vital importance to our economy, we find that it is suffering from the peculiar nature of our economic relationship with Britain and from the particular policies that Britain had pursued and which she has pursued in an intensified from since the introduction of the deficiency payments system in the early 1950s.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the only way in which we can create conditions in which Irish agriculture can operate successfully, conditions of reasonable price stability and reasonable price levels, is within a European economy which operates an agricultural policy of an equitable character, involving no exploitation of one country by another, but fair and equal terms for all.  It is a fact that within the European Economic Community such conditions have been created.  One of the remarkable features of EEC is its common agricultural policy, which is fair to all, and in which the same price structure applies throughout the Community and where one country cannot maintain a different agricultural policy and through it exploit, as Britain does, its agricultural suppliers in the Community.</P>
    <P>One does not need to become very <Col N="2139" /> technical and discuss price differences at a great length to see the obvious benefits to us of such an arrangement. It is a fact that the level of beef prices &mdash;vital to us&mdash;within the EEC is something like 50 per cent or 60 per cent above our normal level.  It is a fact that at the moment, although this could be less enduring, milk prices are perhaps 30 per cent or 40 per cent higher. Even if, as seems likely, the milk surplus situation leads the Community at some point in the not too distant future to modify its price structure, it is fairly evident that the political pressures within the Community are most unlikely to permit a lowering of that milk price to anything like the present level of our milk price and that, even if there are drastic changes in milk policy, the milk price in the Community will remain, by our standards, attractive, and one that would give our farmers a much better return than they get at present and which, in conjunction with the very much higher beef prices, which look like being an enduring feature of the market, would particularly benefit an agriculture such as ours which is primarily pastoral and primarily dependent on cattle.</P>
    <P>Indeed, had we the opportunity to design an agricultural policy for Europe that would benefit us particularly, we could scarcely have done better than to draft the kind of policy which has emerged within the last ten years from the balance of interests of the different countries involved and from the long and often arduous discussions that sought to bring these interests together to shape this particular policy.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, the prospect is less clear.  In the past we have been told at times that industry would suffer heavy losses in conditions of free trade: certainly it would not benefit in anything like the clearcut way that agriculture would.  I have, however, consistently held throughout this period that the potential losses to industry are much less than has been feared.  I can recall during the first period of EEC negotiations, back in 1961 and 1962, the campaign that was waged on both sides about the merits of joining EEC. On the side of those who argued against it there was, for a period, a tendency <Col N="2140" /> to throw around figures such as that 100,000 jobs would be lost.  Fortunately, studies were carried out at that time which brought the problem into perspective&mdash;the Second Programme consultations, which were based on the assumption, a fairly stringent one from our point of view, of full membership of EEC by 1970.  These studies were carried out in full consultation with industry and were based on the judgments of industrialists themselves, who had no reason to suggest that the outcome would be more favourable than it would be&mdash;quite the contrary.  This study showed that industry, under conditions of free trade, could and would continue to expand.  Of course, there would be losses in some areas and gains in others.  But the expansion of the home market should be accelerated by the much more favourable conditions for agriculture to be achieved during that period as a result of EEC membership.  This expansion of the home market would provide conditions in which it would be possible to accept the loss of part of the home market to imports while still ensuring for Irish industry continuing expansion of demand.</P>
    <P>I looked again at these figures recently, seeking to apply them in the context of EEC membership now much further off than 1970.  What seemed to me to emerge is that we could expect, should we become a member of the EEC in the years immediately ahead, that Irish industry might lose something like ten per cent of its market in this country in the mid-Seventies but that this loss would be offset in part by the opening up of the European market to our products and this would occur over a period in which the natural growth of demand would be expanding at a rate of about six or seven per cent per annum.  So that what we are talking about is not the danger of a decline in Irish industry but the fact that over a period of years, over this transitional period, some fraction of the growth that would occur in that period would not take place or would take place as a result of export demand rather than home demand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that we should be in any way complacement about <Col N="2141" /> this but I want to put the problem in perspective.  Complacency is perhaps a threat, just as at that time undue pessimism was a threat, to a realistic policy or a realistic assessment of what our policy should be.  There are dangers ahead of us but they are dangers that derive, I think, not so much from the prospect of free trade as from the prospect of our failure to organise properly our own affairs, by pricing ourselves not just out of foreign markets, but out of the home market.  There has been a disturbing tendency in the last 18 months for the import share of the Irish market to expand rapidly. This is something one might think, at first sight, might be due to the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Indeed, politically, it would be in my interest to suggest that was the cause of it: I have to say that it is not, to any substantial degree.  The Free Trade Area Agreement will hit this country quite significantly in the years ahead but it has not begun to do so now, nor was it expected to do so until 1970 and afterwards.  No, what is even more disturbing is that we are losing the home market to imports not because trade is being freed&mdash;that problem lies ahead of us&mdash;but because of inability to supply the home market on competitive terms.  It is clear that in the last 18 months there has been a radical change in the position and that the increase in imports on the home market is a result of our failure to be competitive and to supply the goods to the home market under conditions which, for all practical purposes, are unchanged as regards the effect of free trade.  This loss of part of the home market in this period has been greater and faster than anything we foresaw happening or anything that is likely to happen because of the freeing of trade.</P>
    <P>The real threat to this country, to the economy and to industry, lies not in the freeing of trade but in the damage we can do to ourselves by inflating our costs as we have been doing in this particular period.  From the industrial point of view, we should look to the stimulus and the opportunities that membership would give to Irish industries. I think, taking a broad and a long view, that the extra opportunities it will give, plus the extra stimulus to industry <Col N="2142" /> to adapt and become competitive in foreign as in home markets, will at least balance the losses that will occur in the home market through the freeing of trade.  At the end of that transition period our industry will be, by definition, competitive.  What survives&mdash;I believe that 90 per cent will survive&mdash;will be an industry competing with imports, competing in export markets with the products of other countries, an industry fully competitive and capable from then on of expanding rapidly, as indeed our industry has been doing in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that even on the industrial side the gains and losses will largely counterbalance each other, and on the agricultural side the gains for this country through the better price structure, and the impetus and incentive to increase output, could involve a transformation of rural Ireland, a transformation for which, perhaps, we are not ready; a transformation which would call for efficient production of a kind which many Government policies are designed to inhibit rather than encourage. I shall return to that point later.</P>
    <P>So much for the question of favouring economic growth.  That economic growth is essential for our survival as a nation.  It should be clear to anybody who lived through the late 1950s that the greatest threat to this country, to its cultural identity, is the danger that its people, faced with adverse economic conditions, would leave in such numbers and elect to participate in the culture of another country to such an extent that our culture would be irrelevant because there would be nobody here to share in it or to practise it, if that is what you do with a culture. Therefore, as a pre-condition of the maintenance of our cultural identity we have to secure the maintenance of our people in Ireland.  That requires successful economic policies.  It requires the kind of stimulus and opportunity which membership of the EEC would give us, and would particularly give to agriculture, and would particularly give to the rural part of our country.</P>
    <P>The second leg of this particular aspect of our foreign policy to which I am referring is that of positively favouring the maintenance of our cultural <Col N="2143" /> identity and it is, indeed, on this ground that membership of the EEC has been criticised by many.  I think their criticisms are misconceived.  The threat to our cultural identity does not come from the multi-lingual countries of the continent of Europe.  It comes from our near neighbour, Britain, and our further neighbour on the other side of the ocean, the United States of America.  One of the reasons why our cultural identity is threatened is that our orientation as regards external cultural relations is exclusively towards these two countries, these two Englishspeaking countries.</P>
    <P>If we look to Europe we will find there several countries which are not nations in the sense in which Ireland is a nation but which have survived despite the lack of any clear sense of nationality and despite the lack of a common language.  I refer to Belgium and Switzerland.  It seems to me that if you consider the cases of these two countries you are forced to the conclusion that the reason they survived is that they are, in effect, multi-lingual and multi-cultural.  Belgium is divided between the Flemings and the Walloons. They do not get on together. But each prevents the other joining one or other of Belgium's neighbours, France or, in the other case, Holland. Belgium survives because of that tension as well as, perhaps, despite it.</P>
    <P>The same is true of Switzerland.  If Switzerland were a German-speaking country is it likely that it would necessarily have remained independent? Perhaps it might, as Austria has.  Perhaps it might not.  The protection of these countries and their identities lies in the fact that they are multi-lingual. The danger to us lies in the fact that we are mono-lingual, so far as external languages are concerned.  Bilingualism as regards the use of Irish at home does not meet this problem.  Indeed, it can be said&mdash;and I have always felt this&mdash; that one of the dangers of excessive concentration on the Irish language was the fact that it had the effect in the 1920s of contributing&mdash;and I say no more than contributing&mdash;to a decline in the teaching of foreign languages in our schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> Some Deputies will know that in 1914 virtually every secondary school child in this country studied French. Certainly all the girls did and twothirds of the boys, and half the girls and many of the boys studied German. Many Deputies will know that that study of modern languages died out in the years that followed.  The blame for that can by no means all be put on the shoulders of the Irish revival.  Indeed, what really seems to have hit it was the Latin revival of the 'twenties and 'thirties, an aspect of Irish education to which very little attention has been directed.  If one examines the statistics for language teaching year by year, as I had occasion to do, one finds that the growth of the teaching of Latin in our schools was what pushed out French and German perhaps more than the growth of Irish.  But both contributed to it.</P>
    <P>There has been a danger that in seeking to revive Irish we have been so concentrating our attention on that language and, of course, on our generally spoken language, English, that we have tended to lose our facility in modern languages, until recent years when they have been revived.  There is a danger that the effect of that could have been, and was, to some extent, to cut us off more and more from the culture of other countries and to confine our cultural relations to Englishspeaking countries.  It seems to me that the more we can diversify our cultural relations, the more we can be in touch with the cultures of countries like France and Germany, the less danger there will be of our being swamped by Anglo-American civilisation.  I do not see any danger to this country in contact with French-speaking France and Belgium and Switzerland, or German-speaking Austria and Germany.  I do see a danger in confining all our contacts to Britain and America.</P>
    <P>Again I think the more we have direct relations with the countries of the Continent of Europe the more we shall lose our inferiority complex and become more sure of ourselves, and less anglo-centric in our attitudes.  The fact is that in our relations with English people and Americans we tend to be influenced by our knowledge of their stereotype of us.  We know, or think <Col N="2145" /> we know, what the Americans and the British think of us, and we tend to respond, sometimes playing up to them unfortunately, and sometimes reacting against them.  We are not always quite ourselves in these relationships.</P>
    <P>I find that when Irish people are dealing with people of other cultures and other languages, these artificialities of attitude do not creep in.  Because we find in talking to the French and Germans that they treat us simply as another European country and do not have pre-conceived ideas about us, we are more self-confident in our relations with them.  Certainly that has been my own experience and in watching other Irish people in their relations with people from different countries it has struck me that that is an element.</P>
    <P>I feel that within a European community, we would grow increasingly sure of our identity and increasingly anxious to assert it.  We all know of the inclination we all have abroad to assert our nationality and, perhaps, to use our native language more freely. When we meet an Orangeman from the north we know how we tend to share with him an Irishness which is less evident in the streets of Belfast or Derry.  The more we are involved in Europe the more we will grow in the sense of our national identity and in our strength of conviction about our national identity, and the more we will lose the inferiority complex which has been the mark of this country as a result of its long relationship with Britain and, perhaps, latterly to some extent with the United States.  I have no fear that participation in Europe will in any way weaken our cultural identity.  I believe it will strengthen it and to believe that it will be weakened seems to me to hold a belief based on a very superficial consideration of what is involved.</P>
    <P>The fourth aim of our foreign policy should be, I suggested, to secure the voluntary reunification of this country. I shall not dwell on this now because it is something which we dealt with and which I myself spoke about in the debate last week.  I shall merely mention again the two main points I made. First, the adoption of a common agricultural policy.  Its application to the <Col N="2146" /> United Kingdom and ourselves would eliminate one of the two major economic obstacles to the reunification of our country: the difference between the conditions under which agriculture operates north and south; the fact that if Northern Ireland joined us today, her farmers would lose very substantial agricultural subsidies.</P>
    <P>Within the European Economic Community there would be no such subsidies.  Their farmers and ours would both be receiving fair and equitable prices.  The reunification of this country in those conditions would impose no hardship on the farmers of Northern Ireland.  That is not a major or compelling point, but it is one further point which we have to consider.</P>
    <P>More broadly, however, there is the other point which I mentioned in the other debate: the fact that participation in a European Economic Community, in which power would increasingly be concentrated in the case of Northern Ireland in Brussels, for many major economic and social decisions, and in Belfast for decisions affecting the people of Northern Ireland more directly in their local affairs; that such a situation would be one in which the relevance of government from London or Dublin would become less and, therefore, the tensions arising out of the argument as to whether sovereignty should rest in Dublin or London would become much less.</P>
    <P>I can forsee a time, perhaps several decades hence, when this question of whether the thing called sovereignty should rest in Dublin or London could not arouse the same tensions as today because all the decisions of importance would be taken in Belfast or Brussels, and the question of the role of London or Dublin would be so diminished as to be of less importance and, therefore, less a cause of tension.  In these ways, it seems to me, that membership of the European Economic Community tion of this country.</P>
    <P>It would also help because it would, perhaps, help the cause of the reunification, dwarf our problems.  Just as the Orangeman and the Republican meeting abroad on holidays feel they have something in common, so the two <Col N="2147" /> parts of Ireland faced in discussion and debate with other Europeans in the European Economic Community, faced with the otherness of the people of those countries, would come to feel that they had more in common, and realise they had more in common.  This again would put in perspective the irrelevant historical differences that divide us and make them a less potent cause of continuing division in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, I said that a foreign policy should involve a contribution to the world in general.  We have a unique role to play here within a European community.  We are the only ex-colony in Europe, the only country which was colonised in that way and threw off the colonial yoke.  We have an understanding of the third world which other European countries do not find it easy to have.  Somebody who had reason to know something about this commented to me yesterday that, in discussing the affairs of the third world with other European countries at a diplomatic level, one often found a certain lack of sympathy, a continuing colonialist attitude still there, years after they have lost their colonies.  That is something we do not have.  We have a role to play in Europe in interpreting the third world to Europe and also in helping relations the other way, by interpreting Europe to the third world.</P>
    <P>In all these ways it seems to me that a European policy is appropriate to our needs and that the other policies we have pursued in part and which have been divergent and contradictory strands in our foreign policy, particularly over the last 10 years, are in varying ways damaging or irrelevant to our interests.  It seems to me we should think out more clearly than we have done what are the basic requirements of a foreign policy.  We should then examine them, as I have tried to do in a necessarily superficial way, particularly in relation to the question of the European Economic Community and our participation in it.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are arguments against membership.  There are sensitivities in this country to anything which involves participation in a group which might involve the loss of neutrality. <Col N="2148" /> Last night I referred to this point in my opening remarks and suggested that we have not perhaps thought out what neutrality was all about in the last war, or just how relevant the attitudes at that time are to us today.  The fact is that in the world today there is no such thing as a really independent nation.  The degree of interdependence between nations has been growing all the time, perhaps so imperceptibly that we have not realised fully its implications. We are interdependent with other countries in so many ways that to think of cutting ourselves off in some way from the countries around us is irrelevant to the point of absurdity.  The idea that we could be neutral in an atomic war shows a certain lack of realism about the nature of the weapons involved and their contaminating power.</P>
    <P>We need to take a new perspective and to realise that as the world gets smaller, as with technological developments people come closer together, the countries of Europe must come, and are coming, as we see, to lose something of the sense of basic hostility which informed them for so long, and are gaining a sense of something they hold in common, a sense of common &ldquo;European-ness.&rdquo;  This is something which has developed greatly because of the fact that since the war two great powers have dwarfed Europe on either side and all the countries of Europe are coming to feel that they should draw together in their own common interest.</P>
    <P>We, perhaps, have not shared that feeling as much as the other countries of Europe.  Our geographic isolation, our cultural isolation from Europe as a result of centuries of domination by Britain, a country that never wished us to have much to do with the Continent of Europe, these are things which perhaps have together with neutrality in the last war, prevented us from sharing fully in the development of this sentiment. In the 1950's a policy was pursued, at least by some Governments of that period, which was not at all sympathetic to European union.  I can recall about seven years ago when television started in this country, I played a part in preparing some programmes on the Common Market.  Somebody <Col N="2149" /> told myself and others who were preparing these programmes that there existed a recording of a radio broadcast by our President when he was Taoiseach on the subject of European policy, and that this would be useful to illustrate the development of Irish thinking, and indeed it was.  The Government Information Bureau, a little innocently perhaps, gave us a copy of the recording which was used in the programme.  The sentiments expressed then of great distrust for the development of European unity are ones which our Government would not want to have echoing around the world today, and I am sure the recording has been safely locked up and will not come to life as easily as it did in early 1962 when I looked for it for that programme.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we in this country have been slow to develop this sense of a common identity with other European countries.  However, it is something which began to develop in the 1960s and it is a fact that a public opinion poll showed in 1962 a very strong feeling in favour of membership of the Common Market, stronger indeed than in some of the member countries in Europe.  Another public opinion poll taken more recently has confirmed that that opinion persists right up to the present year.  There has therefore been an evolution in Irish thinking and Irish attitudes.  We have become more conscious of our common European identity and the development of a European policy has become more easy for us.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the opposite case: suppose we decided not to participate in a European community, suppose we decided to opt out, what would the consequences be? We would then be as open to exploitation by this vast community as a whole as we are today open to exploitation by Britain.  It is surely bad enough that our agriculture should be exploited in the way it is by the price policies of the United Kingdom without facing a position in which the whole European market would have ganged up against us and we would have opted out of it and decided to let our farmers suffer in that way rather <Col N="2150" /> than participate in this community.  Is that what we want to do for rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>Again, if we opted out we would be in the position that we would have no voice in the policies adopted by this European Economic Community that would affect us.  It is a delusion to think that by opting out of such a community we would be opting out of the effects of this decision.  Such a community, in its trading and commercial policies and in its political and military policies would affect us radically and perhaps in a very adverse way if we have no voice in making these policies.  It would be very foolish for us to give up the opportunity of having a voice in the making of policies which are bound to affect us, and very foolish indeed to think that by opting out of the community we would be saving ourselves from suffering the effects of these policies if they are adverse to us.  If we opted out we would also lose the benefits of that cross-fertilisation of cultures with Europe which would help to preserve us from the consequences of the present concentration of Anglo-American culture from which we suffer.</P>
    <P>In some of the attitudes adopted to the question of membership of the EEC there is a confusion of shadow and substance.  There is a tendency to elevate something called political soverignty, something which is highly theoretical, to a level of enormous importance, and to disregard the harsh realities of the modern world.  The important thing for us is to have a real share in decisions that affect us wherever they are taken.  The decisions taken in Brussels will affect us far more than any decisions we can take in Dublin, and they are decisions in which we must have a voice.</P>
    <P>The real issue for us should be: what kind of Europe do we want to participate in?  We should be thinking about this, because it may well be that the obstacles that have hitherto stood in our way will disappear in the years immediately ahead.  Of course, bearing in mind that we have had two previous exercises that did not succeed, anyone who says this today is bound to be regarded as having cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; too <Col N="2151" /> often, and it is, of course, true that for one reason or another these negotiations may not succeed this time. There is a possibility that the British may decide to terminate them this time, not the French&mdash;a further hazard we did not face before.  However, there is a very real prospect that negotiations will take place from next spring, and a very real possibility that these negotiations will succeed.  In these negotiations we are going to be asked to state our commitment to a united Europe and we are going to be expected to have some ideas as to the kind of a united Europe we would like to see, and to be able to communicate these ideas. I do not think it will be enough for us to come along to these discussions with a few phrases of lip-service to the European idea, and even if that is enough to get us in, it would leave us in the position as a member of having little influence if we do not give a clear idea of what we want to achieve as a member of the community.</P>
    <P>Let us then give some thought and discussion&mdash;and I mean discussion&mdash; in the months ahead to the question of what kind of Europe we would like to see.  Surely it would be a Europe united economically and politically, in some form of federation, which would, however, encourage and protect the cultural diversities of its member states. It would be a democratic Europe with strong parliamentary institutions controlling its public administration&mdash;the European Commission of today&mdash;controlling its budget which is already running at £1,000 million a year, over which the present European Parliament has no control whatsoever.  It would be a Europe which would be peace-loving, not militaristic, a Europe orientated towards the Third World and concerned with helping the Third World with the problems of its development, and a Europe with a regional policy designed to minimise the centralising economic force which will exist in a powerful form in a united Europe, to minimise these forces and to ensure that they are not only held in check but are counterbalanced so that the peripheral regions of this community like ourselves, Brittany, south west France and southern Italy will <Col N="2152" /> develop not just as rapidly as, but more rapidly than the rest, so that we will catch up with the central part of this area which is the most prosperous economically.</P>
    <P>These, surely are the kind of things we would like to see happening in this Europe.  If we want them to happen we will have to be clear that they are our objectives; we will have to work towards them and we will have to give a good deal of thought and consideration to our European policies.</P>
    <P>I believe we can influence such a Community.  I come back to what I said in my opening remarks about the role we played in the British Commonwealth in the 1920's, which should, I think, prove conclusively that, however small we may be, if we set our minds to the task we have the ability in this country to exercise an influence over others more numerous and stronger than ourselves.  We should not underestimate our abilities in this respect.  In recent years at the United Nations we have exercised a disproportionate influence, even if at times the policies we have followed have not, in the view of this side of the House, always been well adapted towards that end.</P>
    <P>We must remember, too, that in this Europe we shall have allies.  I have found a tendency when people talk about Ireland in Europe to think in terms of Ireland having one vote out of 25 and all the rest against.  To my recollection that has never happened in any decision within the European Economic Community.  The Community is composed of diverse nations with various differences.  There are agricultural countries and industrial countries; big countries and small countries; there are liberal countries and the more authoritarian countries, in their methods of administration, for example.  There are countries with liberal transport policies and countries with restrictive transport policies. Depending upon the issue which comes up, different alliances are formed.  The French and the Dutch might agree on an agricultural policy and perhaps disagree on everything else.  We would find ourselves in such a community not as one voice against 24 but as one extra vote added to another group of votes which with our vote could constitute <Col N="2153" /> a majority and without our vote might not constitute a majority.  Our influence would be exerted on issues on which we would have allies.  On agricultural policy the French and the Dutch would be with us and the Germans and British against.  I cannot speak for the Italians or the Belgians; it depends on what the particular foodstuff is.  On issues of parliamentary control we would have the support of Britain, the Scandinavian countries and Holland in particular. On each issue we would find new and different allies, but we would not be alone.  Indeed, we would have to be particularly skilled to find an issue on which we would be alone.</P>
    <P>In the perspective of history, as it may be written a century hence, historians will see the Irish Independence Movement as very timely.  I think they will see that, after many centuries during which Irish nationality was submerged, it was recovered and reestablished in time&mdash;and perhaps only just in time, because 50 years in history is not very much&mdash;in time to enter into a united Europe as one of its component parts.  Whereas, if a united Europe had evolved 50 years ago we would have been part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and while no doubt our public servants and our politicians would have played some role in that, Ireland would not have been there as an identifiable unit, as a separate cultural unit in that community.  But, because we did recover our independence 50 years ago, we are now going to play a separate part.  Our voice, our views and our culture will be represented in Europe as fully as those of any of the other nations represented there.  We have the advantage in this respect, at the moment anyway, over countries like Scotland, Wales and, indeed, for the moment, of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The alternative for us is to remain isolated, economically depressed, an exploited offshore island at the mercy of the decisions of the great European union with no voice in the making of these decisions, an economy without access to any markets for its agricultural produce and faced with restrictions on imports of its industrial products to its neighbours.</P>
    <P>When we get down to it, I think <Col N="2154" /> everybody in this House, some with reluctance, some with enthusiasm, will agree that if Britain joins the EEC we have to do likewise.  My fear is that we might join it with the kind of minimalist attitudes which are evident amongst the British themselves.  If we join it grudgingly and try to minimise the concessions of sovereignty we have to make, trying to hold back all the time as much as possible, we shall not exert the kind of influence we could exert in the policies of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I can see this already in the British approach.  I can see it in the reactions of the Continentals to Britain.  One can perceive when one attends any meetings between EEC and the British representatives, the tensions between them, the feeling on the part of the Continentals that the British do not understand what it is all about and do not particularly like what they see.  If we, on our side, can show, as I think we have shown at these meetings, that we are different, that we do know what it is all about, that we do not share the superiority complex of the British and their attitude, which at times I am afraid is a rather arrogant attitude, we will have the opportunity of playing a part which Britain will not easily play.  We are, indeed, more acceptable than Britain and if we are prepared to play a full part, not to hold back and not to put up with these minimalist attitudes, then I think we can have a great influence.</P>
    <P>If we do not, one of the by-products of adopting that kind of attitude is that we could gain the reputation that we had in the past of being a British satellite.  In the 1950's we lined up with Britain and Scandinavian countries in favour of anti-European policies and it is amusing, looking back on it, to remember that that group was known at times as &ldquo;the protestant powers&rdquo;. That description is one which is clearly a little inappropriate in this part of the country but it is an indication of the extent to which we were identified with Britain.  Indeed, so closely were our policies identified with Britain, I am afraid there were times when we were regarded as a British satellite, voting automatically with the British.  We could hardly expect the Europeans to understand that we voted with the <Col N="2155" /> British for a federation with the maximum degree of sovereignty because we had only just won it from the British and against the British.  It was too much of a paradox to expect people to understand, but that in fact was where we stood.  The British wanted to hang on to their sovereignty because they had always had it and they have this superiority complex and we wanted to hang on to ours because we had just got it from Britain.  The effect of these two diverse and opposite attitudes was that we both had the same policy. It would be greatly to our advantage if our attitude were much more positive than that of Britain in the European context.</P>
    <P>What of the negotiations to come? I believe these negotiations will start; I am less confident about their success. I think they will start in the spring. What preparations have we made for them?  I think the Minister should say something about them.  On previous occasions we have been well prepared for these negotiations.  Frankly, it would surprise me if we were not quite well prepared now.  But it would be helpful if the Minister would tell us something about this.  Are we right in thinking that the main responsibility for these negotiations has been transferred from the Department of Finance to the Department of External Affairs? Will we hear more about this?  It seems to me basically a sound decision but there are always some doubts when responsibility for something is transferred from a Department which is known to have handled it well to one whose handling is necessarily, until we have experience of it, something we cannot be certain about.</P>
    <P>Personally I am confident that the Department of External Affairs, if it has taken control of our European policy, will, especially under the present Minister, make as good a job of it&mdash;even a better job&mdash;than was made of it in the past.  I have no fears on this score but I think we should be told something about this change if it has taken place.  Hitherto for reasons which are obscure and which I think the Government had a little difficulty in explaining to some other countries, <Col N="2156" /> we had two foreign policies: the European policy run by the Department of Finance and the United Nations policy run by the Department of External Affairs.  One policy-making Department and control of policy in one Department is likely to lead to a more coherent external and foreign policy than we have had hitherto.  If this change has taken place I believe it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>What are our plans for the negotiations? Britain has announced that she has appointed a Minister, Mr. Thompson, and a senior civil servant brought back from retirement, Sir Con O'Neill, as chief negotiators.  What are our plans in this respect?  Presumably we have given some thought to this.</P>
    <P>What are our views on the issues on which we shall be called upon to express views?  The Minister will be familiar with the opinion of October 3rd, the opinion of the European Commission on the question of membership by the applicants and with the annexe to that opinion.  I note that in his opening remarks he referred to an unofficial translation being available in the Library.  The official or EEC translation, as distinct from our own translation, is I think now generally available and is something which all of us should read and be familiar with. One feature of that opinion is its emphasis on two different things, the strengthening of the Community and its enlargement, to go hand in hand with each other.  There is determination evident in every line of this document that the enlargement of the Community must not weaken it but on the contrary the opportunity of enlargement must be taken to secure agreement within the Community, and from the applicant members, for the strengthening of the Community.  We shall be asked our views on some of these matters and even if we are not, if we have views and put them forward this will be taken&mdash;any anybody who has had experience of the people concerned in Brussels and the other European capitals will accept this&mdash;as a sign of real interest and a good mark in our favour in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>We shall be expected to have a view for example on the voting procedure in <Col N="2157" /> the Council of Members.  This must change when there are new members added because it is a voting procedure which is somewhat complex and delicately balanced with a different number of votes given to countries of different size.  A new balance must be struck.  Have we thought this out and have we any view as to what kind of balance would be good for the Community and what kind of voting rights would be appropriate for a country of our size?  This is something on which we will have to negotiate.  It is true that it will not be the first thing to be negotiated; it is true that the pattern of negotiations as now foreseen will involve initially negotiations with each of the individual countries on matters affecting that country's particular interest; but those individual bi-lateral negotiations will be followed by, as I understand it, a multilateral conference of the ten powers involved, which will hammer out the institutional changes required to ensure that this enlarged Community will not be weakened but rather strengthened by the admission of new members.</P>
    <P>In that multilateral discussion we shall be expected to put forward proposals on such matters as the voting procedure in the Council of Ministers. Have we studied this?  What are our views?  Also about the Commission&mdash; how big should it be?  How should its members be appointed, because the present method of appointment is notably unsatisfactory since it effectively gives a right of veto to individual countries?  There has been evidence that if some members of the Commission offend an individual country they may be vetoed when their appointment comes up at the end of a fouryear period.  Clearly this is unsatisfactory. Have we a view on this?  Do we think that such appointments should be made or vetted by the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>What about this Parliament itself? What views have we on its powers at the moment?  At present this body is effectively powerless.  Its only power is such a strong one that it is never used, the power to dismiss by a two-thirds majority the entire Commission or Executive of the Community.  Do we <Col N="2158" /> feel, as I think we should and as I think most of us would feel, if we thought about it, that the bureaucracy, the civil service, the public administration of EEC should be brought under parliamentary control?  Do we feel that the powers of the Parliament should be strengthened so that the Commission would be more directly answerable to it?</P>
    <P>Do we feel that it would be a good thing for that Parliament to be directly elected?  This is a matter of current interest and something with which we should concern ourselves, something which has always interested me personally. When the 1961 election took place I can recall that writing in the newspapers a weekly article, and wishing to show that I knew an election was on but at the same time not to write about it in any way that would be interpreted as politically partisan, I took perhaps the coward's way out by writing a humorous article foreshadowing a possible European Parliament election in North Connacht in the year 1968.  The date was premature; some of the humour may have been misplaced; but I think it was something which perhaps might have helped draw people's attention to a reality&mdash;we shall face such elections.  Are we in favour of them?  I think we had better be, because I think they are coming.  In March of this year the European Parliament, after waiting nine years for something to happen about its proposals prepared under the Treaty for direct elections to that at present indirectly selected Parliament, brought forward a proposal in very firm terms that direct elections should be introduced, a proposal which is directly related to the terms of Article 175 of the Treaty under which if any body in the Community fails to act in accordance with the Treaty it can be brought before the European Court of Justice.  The Parliament is threatening in very clear terms that if its proposals of 1960 for direct elections are not implemented in the very near future, it will bring the Council of Ministers before the European Court of Justice for dereliction of duty.  Indeed, on its reading of the relevant article of the Treaty I think it has quite a strong case because the Article in the Treaty <Col N="2159" /> is quite specific that the Parliament, having put forward its proposals, having decided on them, the Council of Ministers &ldquo;shall&rdquo; take a decision. At any rate in the French version the future tense is used.  I never quite know in translating French into English whether the future is &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but it is the future tense that is used here, and parliament clearly feels that it means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this case. It should also be said that throughout the countries of the Community resolutions are before the national parliaments on this matter and in several countries these resolutions are likely to be fully adopted by parliament in the near future.  In fact the Germans and Italians are thinking of moving ahead themselves to direct elections in their own countries if the other countries drag their heels and fail to agree to direct elections throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>What views have we on this?  It is not a simple matter.  There are many issues that arise on this to which we must give attention, we in this House particularly, for, this is a matter for this House, not just for the Government. Are we in favour, for example, of people being Members of this House and of the European Parliament?  This is a much debated point.  It is something in which there is deep disagreement among European parliamentarians. Some believe the two roles are totally incompatible.  Others believe that they can be combined, just as in this country many parliamentarians believe that we should combine membership of county councils and Parliament.  Have we a view on this?  I think it is clear that it would be pretty difficult to be a member of a county council, of this Dáil and of the European Parliament, a hat trick which few would achieve with complete success.</P>

      <P>I can think of another gentleman on this side of the House also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only question that arises.  How is this Parliament to be elected?  Is the same election system to be used throughout the Community?  If <Col N="2160" /> so, should we try to get them all to adopt PR?  In fact, some of them have given some consideration to it but it is not used in our form in any of these countries today.  Is each country to adopt its own election system?</P>
    <P>Moreover, should there be a transitional period during which the Parliament would consist perhaps of a minority of members selected by their Parliaments, as they are at present, and a majority elected directly?  That is a proposal which is being considered. Again, what kind of representation should each country have?  In the present European Parliament the smaller countries are represented completely disproportionately.  Luxembourg has over four per cent of the membership, with barely 0.1 per cent of the population.  Should this be continued? Our national interest suggests it should &mdash;we may feel &ldquo;Let us have as many representatives there as we can&rdquo;.  Does our belief in one man, one vote preclude us from pressing this issue?  This is something we ought to be considering.</P>
    <P>What kind of constituencies would we have?  This brings this matter nearer home.  Travelling to London recently to a meeting to discuss this very matter of direct elections, when I was the Irish Parliamentary representative, I did a few calculations in the train on the back of an envelope and I think we can devise suitable, multi-seat constituencies here broadly related to the regional pattern of this country, that is if we get enough members in this European Parliament, if we get the kind of representation which the small countries have there today. I am sure the Minister for Local Government has started to give some consideration to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should give consideration to it before he gets his teeth too far into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are all matters that we should be considering.  Really, when I hear the Taoiseach and the Minister say that it is premature to produce a White Paper, that there is not enough information, <Col N="2161" /> that we will have to wait until the negotiations are all over, that we might give away our negotiating case, I am forced to think they have not really considered this matter fully. Of course, there are matters which should not be spelled out in a White Paper because they would involve our bargaining position.  If they represent five per cent of the total area of information involved that is about the height of it.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are also some problems in assessing the effects of EEC membership, and of course any such assessments have to be speculative. But this does not have to wait until the negotiations are over because the impact on our economy would be influenced by things which are now fairly fixed, such as the prospect of free trade in five or six years, and we know something of what the effects of that would be on agriculture from the studies already carried out of the common agricultural policy.  I admit that some of the prices, perhaps of milk, in that policy may be changed in the years ahead.  But can we not have an assessment which will perhaps be based on a number of alternative milk price levels.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister very hard on this.  I think it is wrong that we should be moving into a negotiation with our people ill-informed, having had no opportunity to consider it or to discuss it.  While we have had White Papers in the past I do not think they were adequate at that time and they are certainly completely out of date now.</P>
    <P>We need really two White Papers, one which would set out the various issues which we face, including the issues I have been talking about now about the Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers, setting out the issues and opening them up for discussion, putting them down for debate in this House, and we need a second White Paper which would make as sophisticated as possible an analysis of the likely economic consequences of EEC membership on the basis of what we now know of the likely terms of membership.  Everybody would accept that negotiations <Col N="2162" /> would modify those terms marginally one way or the other, but the basic facts are known, the structure of the agricultural policy, the likely level of prices, with the possible exception of the milk price, and the kind of terms industry will get.  The changes we can look forward to in the negotiations are unlikely to affect the economic consequences of this country by more than five per cent and perhaps by not more than two or three per cent.  So, to suggest that such an assessment cannot be carried out now because we do not know the terms, is unrealistic and I think the Minister knows that.</P>
    <P>He probably is aware that such an assessment would be technically difficult but this country now has an Economic and Social Research Institute, an Agricultural Institute, it has university economists and others who could do the kind of work involved. I am not suggesting that his Department should produce this unaided.  I do not think his or any other Government Department has the time that this exercise would require and it would require a wide range of expertise. This exists in the country.  Could the people we have available not be put to work on this task?  Could we not commission a study of this kind?  This decision we are going to take will be of vital importance to this country.  It must not be taken in the dark.  We must be as well informed as possible. I have my view of the likely consequences but others may have different views.  We need an expert, impartial assessment and I think we have a right to look for it.</P>
    <P>We need in the meantime a good deal more information than we are getting through the Minister's Department on other matters also.  I had some questions down in July on one particular small issue, the question of the regulations, directives or whatever they may be, of the Commission and the Council with regard to professional qualifications.  I found in reply to the questions that information was coming very slowly.  Information which I had obtained in Brussels as a private individual two or three years ago was apparently only coming to this country this year.  I think we need to be clear the European Commission works in a <Col N="2163" /> different way from other governments. If I march in to a Government office here and even if I were not an Opposition Deputy but were an impartial economist and that alone&mdash;I am not suggesting I am not an impartial economist but if I were merely an impartial economist and not an Opposition Deputy&mdash;I would be unlikely to be handed documents of what policies are being put up to the Government.  That is not true in Brussels.  The European Commission works in a different way. While, of course, they have their confidential documents too, very little is confidential there and anybody who is interested in a particular topic can go in there, talk to the people concerned and find out a good deal of what is going on.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on the part of our Government to treat documents which Brussels does not regard as so particularly confidential as if they were Irish Government documents subject to the Official Secrets Act.  I think in the case I have mentioned, which I chose simply as an example just to see what kind of reaction I got, some of the information I got years ago consisted of stencilled copies of speeches made by officials of the European Community, about the policy work they were engaged on, with full details of what they were proposing, to various seminars and groups in France or Belgium.  Most of the information I got was not by any standard confidential and yet it does not seem to have reached this country until several years afterwards.</P>
    <P>We need to be more active in this matter.  The Irish professions should have been kept up to date with regard to the question of professional qualifications. It is a bit absurd that the pharmaceutical profession depended on the fact that I brought home some documents and passed them on to them and that only several years later our Government came up with what was being proposed for pharmacy.  Remember these proposals are very detailed. In the case of pharmacy they involved laying down that if the professional qualification for pharmacy is to be recognised throughout Europe then <Col N="2164" /> the course must contain not less than 20 hours practical and 20 hours theoretical in this little subject, that little subject, not just broad subjects, but parts of subjects.  It is very important that our professions should know those proposals, proposals which will affect the acceptability of Irish professional qualifications throughout Europe in the years ahead and it seems to me that our Government have not been as active as they should have been in this matter, have been over-sensitive to the question of confidentiality, not fully appreciating the different way in which this question of confidentiality is treated in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough on the European Economic Community at this time.  I dwelt on it for a long time, because of its enormous importance to us and because it has not had the discussion it should have had here. We have tended to ignore it completely when nothing is happening and to discuss it inadequately when something is happening.  In the next 18 months, if negotiations are to take place, we will need to debate it more fully in this House than we have in the past.  While the Minister can be assured that on this side of the House there will be no pressure on him to disclose anything that might damage our negotiating position I will equally assure him we will not be merciful if he hides behind that to prevent us from finding out things we are entitled to know and which will not affect our bargaining position.  It is very important that our people should be as fully informed as possible about anything which is not going to affect the progress of the negotiations.  On our side we will press for the fullest possible information while being responsible, as we have always been, and as we have shown ourselves recently in another context in regard to Northern Ireland, by not pressing the Minister on anything which would embarrass him.</P>
    <P>I turn now to other issues of foreign policy before concluding because there are other issues to which we need to give our attention too.  I mentioned earlier the importance of our playing a role in the détente between east and <Col N="2165" /> west.  The fact that we are not a member of NATO puts us in a good position to do that.  In this context I would like to raise the question whether we do not need, in order to fulfil that role, which I think is potentially an important role for this country, some more direct contact with the countries of eastern Europe.  I am aware, as the previous Minister assured the Dáil, that at the UN we have close diplomatic contact with many countries including the countries of Eastern Europe and that we use our good offices as best we can to help improve relations and lower tensions both in regard to East-West relations and to other problems in the world.</P>
    <P>However, I am not convinced that this is enough.  We ought to consider whether the time has not come to have some kind of direct diplomatic contact with eastern Europe so that our Department of External Affairs will have more direct access to the thinking of these countries of eastern Europe and so, also, that we might be closer to some of the centres of diplomatic activity such as Warsaw where for many years the Americans and the Chinese have had the only direct contact that has occurred between these two countries.</P>
    <P>A diplomatic listening post in one of these countries would bring us into more direct contact with them and would make our representations to them more acceptable when we need to press them to be reasonable.  These countries are sensitive of this issue. There is a resentment on their part because we do not have diplomatic relations with any of them.  They are not inclined to take us seriously if we are not prepared to recognise them although, of course, we do recognise them in the sense that we do not say that they are not the legal governments of these countries.  But the way in which we, together with Portugal, which is, I think, the only other country involved at this stage, refuse to have any diplomatic contact with them is not conducive to our having the kind of influence that we would like to have. If Spain and the Vatican can have such diplomatic relations, this holy island could have them also.</P>
    <P>Looking at it from another angle, <Col N="2166" /> there is the question of trade.  Our trade balance with eastern Europe is even worse than our trade balance with western Europe and that is saying a lot.  A ratio of 5 to 1 between imports and exports is not uncommon.  This is something that can only be rectified by hard bargaining with tough customers and this is not easily done if we keep these people at arm's length.  The Minister should consider our position in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Turning to another area, it is only fair to say that we have not played our full part in the past in the struggle in Vietnam.  We are in a favourable position to do so because of our close and friendly relations with the United States for historic reasons.  Those relations place a duty on us with regard to our friends by trying to help them when they make mistakes.  I do not think it is in any way being unfairly critical of American policy to say that the Americans have made a mistake in Vietnam because they themselves are now openly admitting that they are trying to get themselves out of the position into which they have got themselves.  It was a mistake for our Government to wash their hands of this and to feel that by trying to persuade the Americans of their mistakes we would, in some way, damage our relations with them.</P>
    <P>We failed to help the Americans when it was our duty to do so.  I say this because we could have exercised influence there.  We have no influence whatever with the North Vietnamese but it is quite different with the United States.  It is now clear that the pressure kept up by certain friendly European countries who are allies of the United States contributed to the realisation by America that they were almost in complete isolation on this matter and that they were, perhaps, following the wrong tactics.  We let the Americans work this out for themselves without any help from us.  It was, perhaps, a policy pursued for wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>It was particularly notable with regard to one particular aspect of American policy that evoked universal concern that we had nothing to say. When U Thant on behalf of the United Nations called on the Americans to <Col N="2167" /> stop the bombing of North Vietnam our voice was silent.  It was one occasion on which our United Nations presence was not very noticeable.  When the Pope added his voice and also called on America to stop the bombing our devotion to the Holy See was even less evident.  This is not good foreign policy; it indicates an absence of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>There has been a discussion here on another related issue, namely, China.  I found that part of the discussion that I heard obscure to the point of absurdity.  I listened intently to the remarks made by the former Minister for External Affairs but I was left in a state of confusion as to what exactly his objective was and even as to what he thought the position in Formosa was.  He seemed to be pressing for the presence at the United Nations of a representative not only of Red China but also of Formosa, that island off the coast of China occupied by the Chiang Kai-Shek regime since 1949.</P>
    <P>Having inferred that there should be this dual representation, Deputy Aiken proceeded to tell us, if I understood him correctly, that what, in fact, he was pressing for, was the representation of the Formosans and he then told us that the Formosans had been massacred in their thousands by the Chiang Kai-Shek régime.  Is Deputy Aiken leading a Formosan independence movement against Chiang Kai-Shek?  Is he asking for recognition for some Formosan government in exile or is he asking us to continue recognition of the Chiang Kai-Shek régime because of what he described as its massacre of tens of thousands of Formosans?  I was left completely confused as to what is exactly Deputy Aiken's policy.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that confusion is not conducive to a clear consideration of the real issue which is that a country which represents a great threat to the people of the world is excluded from any normal contact with the rest of the world.  This is a mistake and endorsement of the Formosans or Chiang Kai-Shek does not help clarify the issue.  The world is facing a very real danger because of the military <Col N="2168" /> power of China which is developing at a faster pace than the liberalisation of Chinese policy.  The processes of education which the Soviet Union has been subjected to down through the years and which have led it now to a position where it can be a stabilising force in world affairs and no longer the kind of threat it posed in the past, are ones which are not occurring very rapidly in China.  If the Chinese are not brought into the world community, accepting some kind of rules of the game, with a view to preventing a world conflict, they will be a great danger because they have developed atomic weapons on a scale that will threaten the rest of the world.  The greatest danger to the existence of the world today is this race that exists between Chinese military power and the liberalisation of Chinese policy, which does not appear to be proceeding at any pace at all.</P>
    <P>I believe that success in this race would be facilitated rather by bringing China into the councils of the United Nations than by keeping her excluded. We need to consider this without confusing it too much with the question of Formosa.</P>
    <P>There are other régimes in the world, many of which are undemocratic and there is nothing we can do about it, but there are cases where we can take a stand and have not always done so.  I do not think from what I understand of it that the Irish attitude to the Greek régime in the Council of Europe has reflected very much credit on us.  The Scandinavian countries have pressed for action on this matter which could put the Greek military régime under considerable pressure.  We did not support that pressure.  I may be unfair on this.  Perhaps, I do not fully understand the complicated diplomatic developments at the Council of Europe in recent years.  Perhaps, the Minister would clarify this for me when he is replying.  It is important that we as a member of the Council of Europe, as one of the members who are dedicated to democratic principles, should stand as firmly as the Scandinavian countries on this issue and be unwilling to accept that any member of the council should find themselves in the position of operating an undemocratic régime against <Col N="2169" /> the wishes of the Parliament of that country, and of locking up the Parliamentarians of that country.  We have shown ourselves surprisingly insensitive to the imprisonment of Greek Parliamentarians. I should have thought we would all feel a certain concern on this issue.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have spoken with greater knowledge than I have about Biafra.  I shall not dwell on it.  I share the sentiments expressed on this side of the House and, indeed, on all sides of the House.  We are all glad the Minister has taken such a personal concern in this matter.  He was very modest in telling us about the efforts he has been making and I personally hope his efforts will be successful.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the question which I did not hear adverted to sufficiently in the speeches I heard.  I may have missed it because I was not in the House all the time&mdash;I was not here for all the speeches in this debate.  I am referring to the question of the British role in this affair.  The British policy of supplying arms to Nigeria, which is with a view to a &ldquo;quick kill&rdquo; as Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien said, is one which is the cause of great controversy in Britain itself and which I do not think would survive in a free vote of the British Parliament.  This policy has not enhanced Britain's reputation in the eyes of the world.  I am not clear what we have done about it.  We have a duty in a case like this, just as we had a duty with regard to Vietnam with the Americans, to make our views known to the British in no uncertain terms.  I am not clear what we have done about it and I would like the Minister to tell us what steps he has taken to prevent the supply of arms to Nigeria by the British.  The Minister may tell us that others, like the Russians, are supplying arms to Nigeria or Biafra and that he does not think we have much influence with the Russians. The Portuguese and the French have supplied arms to the Biafrans&mdash;Deputy Aiken has told us this.  If we have influence with the French or Portuguese we should exercise it.  But we have closer contacts with the British than with some of these other countries&mdash; not always to our benefit&mdash;and we <Col N="2170" /> should use these contacts to make our views clear.  I am not clear whether we have played the kind of role we should in this affair.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what has been done in regard to this particular aspect of the Biafran affair.</P>
    <P>Our inaction in regard to Greece and our lack of action, as it appears, in regard to the British position in Biafra worry people and make them wonder whether our foreign policy is informed by the kind of moral considerations that should inform it.  Indeed, the Minister spoke about things that make young people revolt.  We should try to avoid the kind of omissions as well as sins of commission in our foreign policy that will have the effect of making people feel that our foreign policy does not express the moral judgments and attitudes of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken referred in his speech to the 23 resolutions on which we had voted differently from Britain and the USA.  I have been unable since last night to trace the publication that contained these resolutions.  I recall that the list was published some months ago.  When I examined it I found that our different vote in the majority of instances consisted of abstaining when Britain or America voted one way or the other.  I speak from memory on this and I am open to correction on it. This is not a very strong mark of differentiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and this is probably true in several of the instances.  But my recollection suggests that in many instances we simply abstained on issues because they <Col N="2171" /> were issues where voting against Britain or America might have been diplomatically embarrassing but where we thought we should have voted against them and, therefore, we abstained as a half-way measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it can be so sometimes.  I am saying that in reading the list of votes I did not get the impression, as Deputy Aiken was telling us, that we were taking a stand against Britain and America in virtually everything.  It seems to me that we were taking a stand against them in nothing and we were mostly abstaining on issues in which they were involved. I do not want to press the matter further because I have not got the list of votes in front of me.  It would be necessary to analyse them one by one.  I doubt if the House would appreciate that at this hour of the night.  I merely want to put on record that Deputy Aiken's account of our stand against Britain and America in nearly everything is an oversimplification, from my recollection of the information published by the Department of External Affairs some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate we are engaged on is one which groups two votes.  This is a necessary and common practice if we are to get through the business.  It is a pity, however, because in cases like this the second or subsidiary vote tends to get very little attention.  In <Col N="2172" /> this case the second vote relates among other things to aspects of development aid.  We should give serious consideration to this question of development aid.  Few countries in Europe contribute from public funds so little in relation to their national wealth as we do.  Few countries in Europe contribute so much from their private resources as we do through our missionary activity.  I do not think the scale of our missionary efforts should exempt the Government from playing their full part in this matter.  The United Nations set a target of one per cent of the GNP as the contribution which developed countries should make to the existence of this third world.  We are a long way away from that in terms of our public contributions.  While it is difficult to assess the scale of our missionary contributions, I have the impression that even if they were included, and a generous figure put on them, our contribution to the developing countries falls short of the target set for us.  We ought to take this obligation seriously. It has been the subject of one of the most impressive Papal documents of this century, <i>Populorum Progressio.</i> Anybody who has read that document and seen how it appeals to the peoples of the world, not merely to Christians or to members of the Roman Catholic Church but to the states of the world to wake up to the realisation of the problem that is there and to their moral duty will realise that we in this country should be taking this more seriously than we are.  In that document the Pope puts to us that the duty of redistributing our goods, which we have accepted within the past half century as applying between people within one country, applies, too, between countries.</P>
