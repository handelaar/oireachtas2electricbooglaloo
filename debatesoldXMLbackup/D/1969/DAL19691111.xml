      <P>Waterford Health Authority have had under consideration the development of paediatric hospital services in their area.  As I mentioned in reply to a question by the Deputy last week, joint discussions on the development of the hospital services in Waterford are being undertaken by the authorities concerned.  I hope that, at an early stage, recommendations will emerge about the development of paediatrics which I consider is a high priority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="518" /> Health what steps he is taking to have residential schools provided for moderately mentally handicapped children in this country; and the reason for the delay in having a residential school erected in Bohola, County Mayo, where a person (name supplied) has offered six acres of land and a house and has also collected a considerable amount of money for such a school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for the mentally handicapped is not provided on a county basis and the special residential centres accept children from all areas.</P>
      <P>There are at present schemes under construction or in planning which will provide about 1,500 places in the special residential centres for the mentally handicapped over the next few years.  I propose, again, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a table showing where these places will be provided.  It will be seen from the table that 360 places will be provided at Galway and Sligo.</P>
      <P>This programme when completed will meet the target set by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap for residential accommodation for severely and moderately handicapped children in need of such care.</P>
      <P>The suggested establishment of a residential centre at Bohola, County Mayo, is a matter primarily for the sponsors of the project at this stage. In August last my Department requested information on certain aspects of the proposals and a reply is awaited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that some developers of building sites have delayed unduly in arranging for the taking in charge by the local authority of the estates developed by them because roads and services are not up to standard; and whether he will introduce proposals for legislation to give local authorities positive powers in such cases to compel the observance of proper standards and the execution by such developers of necessary improvements within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, gave planning authorities strong powers to enable them to ensure that housing estates and other forms of development are completed in conformity with the relevant planning <Col N="529" /> permission and within a reasonable time.  Use of the enforcement powers conferred on planning authorities under the Act should provide an effective solution in the type of case the Deputy has in mind.  Planning authorities can invoke these powers irrespective of whether or not they have been requested to take the particular estate concerned in charge.</P>
      <P>In addition to their enforcement powers, planning authorities are specifically empowered under the 1963 Act to attach a condition on the grant of a planning permission requiring the developer to lodge security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development.  Insistence on the giving of such security in appropriate cases would provide a valuable lever to enable planning authorities to bring pressure to bear on defaulting developers.  I may add that I am not satisfied that all planning authorities are making adequate use of their enforcement powers and I am having the matter examined.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that the Minister's reply relates absolutely to the powers granted under the 1963 Act and that the whole trouble in the Dublin region is with estates built before that date and is it not obvious that this is what the question is really about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is, because the question relates to the powers under the Planning Act.  It is not true that the whole trouble in the Dublin area relates to estates completed before the passing of the Planning Act; quite a considerable amount of trouble exists also since the date of the passing of the Planning Act, but it is true that there is quite a considerable residual amount of trouble in connection with estates completed before the Planning Act.</P>

      <P>With your permission, <Col N="531" /> a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 21, 22, and 23 together.  I will be able to assess the position in the county as soon as I receive the report mentioned in my reply to Questions Nos. 55, 56, and 57 on 23rd October last, for which I asked the local authority over a month ago.</P>
      <P>As to subsidising housing loans from sources other than local authorities, I should make it clear that the interest rate charged on most of these loans is about the same as that charged by local authorities generally.  While the longer loan period of 35 years applicable to local authority loans means that the annual repayments are lower, the aggregate of these repayments is much higher.</P>
      <P>As I announced in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> published last June, I intend to increase the rate of State grant for smaller houses commenced on or after 1st October, 1969, by £50, or more, depending on size.  A local authority may pay increases of a like amount in their supplementary grants.  These changes are in addition to the stamp duty concession, worth about £40 on a house costing £4,000, which was implemented in the Finance Act, 1969.  I do not propose to add to these concessions, which apply to borrowers from local authorities as well as to other borrowers.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the deficiencies and overall needs of the national and regional roads in Mayo I could not agree to the diversion to the county roads of all the Road Fund moneys allocated to Mayo.  Indeed, if there were a question of diverting the arterial and main road grants allocated to Mayo they would fall to be diverted to national and regional routes in other parts of the country urgently requiring attention in the interests of road safety. I may add that the total grant available to Mayo County Council for county road improvement this year amounts to £204,140, a sum which takes generous account of the nature of the problem of county road improvement in County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be misinformed about the institution at Shanganagh. It is not an institution catering solely for first offenders, nor is it under the care of the prison authorities.  It has its own governor and its own staff. Young offenders sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's Institution are transferred to Shanganagh when it appears that they will benefit from the regime in operation there.  The welfare officer in St. Patrick's is at present responsible for the welfare service at Shanganagh.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matters, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on 30th October, when I indicated that a comprehensive report submitted to me on the probation and after-care service is under consideration.

      <P>This is pretty cavalier treatment of this matter.  Is there not an old complaint against the Minister's Department that this service has been neglected for a very long time? Is it not a fact that there was an illiberal tradition in his Department for a very long time?  Since a liberal attitude has come into the Department we would expect it to apply to this service in the sense that something would be done about it.  Things are being done about many other matters in the Minister's Department and for a long period of years nothing at all was done about this service.  The reports were pigeon-holed, and so on.  Is it not time, now that the State is 50 years in existence, for his Department to do something about this service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister does not accept that the situation is as serious as I represent, does the Minister consider that the situation is growing serious and that, if the serious situation which I have represented is not to occur, some early steps will have to be taken to prevent a greater backlog of untaxed bills arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is abundantly clear to me that each year there is a buildup of business in that office in July and that during long periods of the rest of the year it is very slack.  This may be due to the dilatoriness of solicitors in having their bills prepared and presented. At all events, the work load is obviously in the month of July, whereas the place is comparatively quiet for several months of the year. As I have told the Deputy, I am keeping it under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that there is always a waiting list in the Taxing Office and that if there is a build-up of work in July it is in anticipation of the long vacation and that it is not due to the reasons which the Minister has unfairly suggested?</P>

      <P>Before an application or instrument, in respect of registered property, may be received for registration in the Land Registry it must be, among other things, <i>prima facie</i> in order for registration.  This can be established only by consulting the relevant folio.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the on-the-spot consultation of the folio is in the best interests of a person who calls at the Land Registry to lodge an application or instrument and, accordingly, I see no reason for a change in the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and others here in Dublin are in a very privileged position because the vast majority of solicitors throughout the country have to do this business through the post. It is essential, to deal with the matter properly, that the folio should be produced. Questions of priorities of registration of charges, for instance, can arise.  I should mention that 20 per cent of the applications in this city are refused because they are not in order. They are given back.  It is necessary to have the folio produced so that they can see that the application is in order.  A question of priority may well have to be determined as to which application is in order first in certain instances, as the Deputy is well aware.</P>

      <P>Extradition to the North is provided for in Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.  Sections 44 and 50 of that Act contain provisions the gist of which is that political, military and revenue offences are not extraditable. A person who is being extradited and claims that his offence falls into these categories may have the matter determined by the High Court. The same applies if a person is being extradited for an ordinary criminal offence and he claims that, if he is extradited for the offence specified in <Col N="551" /> the warrant, he is likely to be prosecuted for a political offence, not specified in the warrant.  In effect, therefore, the law applies only to people wanted for what might be described as ordinary crime and the release of information as to whether or not there is at present any warrant from the North awaiting execution here could serve only to give useful information to such people.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy has in mind as the only income tax deductions made by the Revenue Commissioners are those made from salary payments to the commissioners' staff.  In this case, as in the case of the staff of other Government Departments and other persons remunerated from public funds, income tax deductions are based on the tax charged in assessments made by the inspector of taxes for public departments.</P>
      <P>Deductions in excess of a taxpayer's final tax liability do not normally occur except where the taxpayer has not submitted a completed form of return of income and claim for allowances for the particular year.  Where, however, the return is received before the end of the year the deductions for the remainder of the year are adjusted accordingly.  If the return is not received until after the end of the year of assessment, any tax over-deducted is repaid or is set-off against current liability.</P>
      <P>The number of claims for repayment of tax in the hands of the inspector of taxes for public departments is 118; and in 103 of these the inspector is awaiting further information before they can be settled.  All will be dealt with within 14 days from the receipt of the required information.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not a healthy situation, to say the least, that, for instance, in 1967 the annual rental charge for Government offices in the city of <Col N="556" /> Dublin was in the region of £250,194, that in 1968 it had risen to £343,260, and that in the current year it is £347,506?  Does the Minister not think that the Government should purchase these blocks rather than be involved in an annually increasing rental charge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that if we purchase them we still have to finance every year the capital involved in the purchase. It does not matter a great deal whether we pay interest on capital for purchase or rent.  This is something to which we have given a great deal of thought. Capital is scarce and in view of all the demands for capital for housing, sanitary services, education and so on, it probably suits us to avoid a heavy outlay of capital for buildings and to rent them instead.  However, it is something we review from time to time.</P>

      <P>On an eight-year purchase calculation, to be conservative, the capital value of what developers now possess in the city of Dublin would be in the region of £3 million a year, and we are involved in financing that operation by our annual rental. Would the Minister say whether the property owning interests who have these office blocks have a seven-year lease operation or a longer lease operation in each case?  In other words, can these rents be changed after seven years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already brought to the Minister's attention the urgent need to accelerate our industrial training programme and the need to develop a comprehensive placement, manpower and forecasting service.  I approve of the transfer of the Irish Management Institute subventions from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Labour.  I would also suggest that the transfer of the INPC grant is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have further suggested to the Minister that the criticism which one hears <Col N="576" /> from time to time about the Labour Court is likely to diminish public regard for this vital institution.  I think unions and employers should try to resolve between themselves that which they frequently request the court to do. I have been critical of the public relations and procedures of some of the parties involved in industrial disputes and have suggested liaison between representatives of the media and the parties involved.  I have suggested the development of a national port authority and the decasualisation of the work of dock workers.  I have opposed the concepts of compulsory conciliation pauses in industrial disputes and compulsory secret ballot.  I have opposed legal enforcement between employers and workers of industrial agreements, and as an alternative I have suggested the need for comprehensive voluntary written agreements between the parties concerned.  I have suggested there should be a long overdue review of the Educational Company Judgment case as well as needed legislation for the extension of the Holiday Employees Act and amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act.  This afternoon I propose to deal with the remaining aspects of the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>My first comment relates to vocational rehabilitation and the role of the Department of Labour in what I consider to be a very much neglected area on our industrial scene.  The Labour Party Deputies are very much concerned&mdash;as was the late Deputy Dunne &mdash;that there seems to be little real concern within the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour about the problems relating to vocational rehabilitation.  We, on this side of the House, have pointed out that so far there has been very little recruitment of the specialist staffs required to promote this aspect of policy.  There is unfair national dependence on the magnificent, but still inadequate, work done by the voluntary rehabilitation organisations in this field who are attempting to undertake this sophisticated function of a manpower policy.</P>
    <P>There remains a great deal of work to be done by the Department of Labour in the introduction of satisfactory settlement arrangements for <Col N="577" /> disabled persons, and in the skilled identification, registration and general advice which ought to be given to the disabled.</P>
    <P>In his last Estimate speech the Minister said he had appointed a representative committee to make recommendations on the possibility of improving employment opportunities for the disabled in the public service and the semi-State bodies.  He said he had received a preliminary report and expected to see a final report within the next few months and that An Chomhairle Oiliúna had a statutory responsibility in this matter.  I appreciate that An Chomhairle Oiliúna has had a difficult and busy year but I would stress the urgency of dealing with work for vocational rehabilitation because this is something which has been so long neglected that I am afraid it may slip further into oblivion within the Department.  There should be more Departmental concern in encouraging and developing selected placement because the number of openings for such persons is frequently quite limited. In any event, it may be necessary for the Department to give much greater assistance to sheltered employment, and within the training concept of An Chomhairle Oiliúna, to undertake initiatives themselves.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna is sadly lacking in staff to do this work and the Minister should consider some provision, by statute, for special allocation of employment or specific occupational designation for persons who are disabled, the main aim being&mdash;if I can sum up the Labour Party's attitude on this question&mdash;to ensure that we demonstrate to the deprived sections of our community that their working qualities, their abilities and their capacities have a greater opportunity for development in this country.  We have got to promote working opportunities for them and seek out the jobs they are capable of performing.  We can in that way overcome the employment prejudices and discrimination which exist in many areas against disabled persons.  Above all, we will get rid of the myth that a handicapped person cannot do a full day's work.  In fact, such a person is quite capable of doing <Col N="578" /> a full day's work under normal conditions in an enlightened community. Those are some of the points I should like to make initially on that aspect.</P>
    <P>As regards the somewhat cursory references in the Minister's Estimate speech to industrial relations and particularly to industrial disputes I would have though he might have highlighted certain characteristics which are a matter of serious concern to the Government, to employer organisations, to this House and, of course, to the trade unions.  In the first instance, as has been remarked by the NIEC and by many of the commentators on industrial affairs and industrial disputes, the outstanding characteristic seems to be the extremely long duration of many of our industrial disputes once they occur.</P>
    <P>One constantly gets the overriding impression that in many instances real negotiations only begin after the strike notice has, in fact, expired.  Secondly, I think a disturbing feature is, despite the efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish procedures concerning disputes, and particularly prior notification by trade unions to the congress of impending strikes in industries and major places, there does not seem to be, as yet, any development which would hinder and prevent a major tendency to drift into strikes without I would submit the necessary planning on the part of employers and unions concerned, if that is the appropriate expression to use.  I think planning in an industrial dispute is often very important.</P>
    <P>One often gets the impression that many workers and employers in negotiations drift into disputes without clearly knowing exactly who is to be involved, to what extent direct and indirect workers are to be involved and who precisely will be responsible for a settlement.  At times, indeed, it seems to me that some executive committees and some branch committees of some trade unions, particularly some of our smaller craft unions, drift into a situation in which they know that developments are on occasions likely to become rapidly quite confused and in which they, perhaps, may sit back and then yell to the Congress of Trade <Col N="579" /> Unions, or to the larger general unions, to the Minister or, indeed, to the Labour Court to go in and do a rescue act.  Therefore, I would submit that on many occasions we have seen disputes in recent years which have occurred without a great deal of background thought and without a great deal of the necessary prior notification, particularly in respect of picketing.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the aspect of picketing, which I consider to be of major importance.  I do not accept for one minute that a legislative bar of prohibition against picketing will solve anything.  I do not think one can do it by statute or by withdrawing a legal privilege to either trade unions or workers in the event of picketing taking place.  It is a rather futile legislative exercise.  I have already been critical of secret ballots and so on.  However &mdash;and this is of major importance&mdash; the unions must bear in mind certain things in relation to picketing which have to be said to their members, whether their members like it or not.  Nobody in the trade union movement can possibly operate alone, whether he is an individual worker in a trade union or an individual union or whether that union is a small union, a craft union, say, enjoying great economic power in an industry or, indeed, whether a union is the largest one in the country.  I have repeatedly said at many union meetings that the strength of the trade union movement is in the movement as a whole, particularly lies in the political climate we have built up in this country in terms of industrial relations and it does not rest particularly with individual actions of individual members or individual trade unions.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, have a major problem in the Republic in respect of picketing for the very simple reason that picketing in Ireland is at its most effective position at this point of time as against Britain, where pickets are frequently passed, as against America, where scab labour is frequently imported to break strikes, as against the Continent where trade unions operate on a political one-day strike stoppage general basis. <Col N="580" /> Indeed, it is quite a long time since we have had major strike breaking activities in Ireland.  Generally, the picket is observed in the Republic. Therefore, because that is the position, our trade unions must make sure this right is preserved in an effective manner and preserved in the context of the right to strike.  While we can all declare and reiterate in this House that the unions propose to maintain and reserve the right of strike we should point out &mdash;and union officers have a basic responsibility in this&mdash;to members that strikes can be won, that they must be won with the minimum of disruption and sacrifice to their fellow workers directly involved and with the least possible damage to industry or to the national economy.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental, sane principle in every dispute.  It is, therefore, important to recall and remember that the fact one serves a claim in Irish industry does not automatically mean that one goes on strike.  The fact that one goes on strike should not, and need not, necessarily mean that one must automatically on every given occasion place pickets in front of an employer's premises.  The trade unions, therefore, have the obligation to negotiate, to manoeuvre, to use tactics and strategy and to fall back if necessary on the full brunt of the strike weapon with picketing.  We should have this sane understanding about it.</P>
    <P>Some people, unfortunately, seem to be of the impression in the trade union movement that serving a strike notice automatically means placing a picket in front of a place of employment Indeed, if one wants to embarrass one's fellow members in a trade union and sometimes, indeed, if one wants to blackmail them, one can put a picket on but a picket is not always necessary, I would repeat, for a successful outcome of a dispute.  Indeed, during the war trade unions were successful in solving many industrial disputes when during that particular emergency powers period picketing was illegal and unions and members used their feet instead of placards on a given occasion.</P>
    <P>We should, therefore, exercise understanding as to the purpose of pickets <Col N="581" /> internally in trade unions.  This applies to all unions, whether general or craft unions.  Craft unions have tremendous power in some sectors of industry and they can only use that power so long as the general trade unions are prepared to hold the ring for them in an industrial dispute and so long as the trade union movement as a whole are prepared to make sure that neither employers nor the Government interfere in a particular dispute.  Even when it comes to the point of the strongest craft union having to fight completely on their own very often they are not strong enough to face the full vigour of an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must not just stand up and condemn some aspects of picketing. Also we have got to try in this House and in the trade union movement to understand what kind of trade union movement we are trying to build up.  It is fashionable for everyone here to condemn unofficial disputes and to denounce them in the strongest terms but what is equally important is that where union officials and Deputies condemn them they do so for the right reasons.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to a show of industrial militancy in a dispute: militancy is in many respects the very life-blood of trade union action and of its involvement in a strike situation, but where militancy is not organised and directed by the members involved in a dispute&mdash;and militancy itself does not win strikes as such on every given occasion&mdash;disputes have got to be supported and paid for by trade unions, and workers have to get strike pay.  If all we need is periodic displays of industrial militancy as some people in the extreme left-wing may advocate, there is no need for trade unions.  You can have a straightforward situation of a one-man show.</P>
    <P>Neither is the desire to condemn unofficial strikes a denial of the democratic rights of members, internally in a union.  Once a strike is declared in a union it is no longer the sole responsibility or the decision involvement of the members directly concerned; it then becomes the problem of the particular union as a whole.  This is very often misunderstood internally in unions.  It is the trade <Col N="582" /> union as an organisation which bears the full responsibility for resolving the dispute on behalf of individual members, and the general body of members have laid down democratically certain rules and regulations in relation to strikes which must be carried out, even when they pinch the toes of some of the members involved.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the maintenance dispute where we had a classic example of confusion, and in many respects, of internal trade union incompetence, of sheer bumbling on the part of some trade unions, displaying a classic case study of internal power politics on the employers' side and on the trade union side.  At times it seemed that the settlement of the claim involved was very much a secondary issue.  It may seem repetitive to go back on this but there were sharp lessons to be learned from it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, there was a loss of 630,000 man days, it cost £13 million in gross production, £3½ million in exports, £1½ million in wages.  It cost the trade union movement £400,000 in strike pay.  The question can be asked, was it necessary that such losses should have occurred in order to bring about a settlement of the claim which was finally conceded by the employers.  I think the answer, in many respects, is that it was not entirely necessary that it should have escalated to a crisis situation.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the settlement involved&mdash;people are inclined to judge the ultimate settlement rather than the other aspects of the dispute&mdash;I suggest there were very serious aspects which require public examination on our part. I do not propose to speak at length on the dispute but I feel it necessary to draw the attention of the House to the very important, comprehensive, critical and necessary report of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions relating to this dispute.  What I shall say may be grist to the mill of those who are anti-trade union, but a public examination of conscience will not do any harm in this particular case.  At paragraph 19 of this Report, Congress stated:</P>
    <P>For whatever reason, the Group was grossly negligent in that it failed to supply either Congress or <Col N="583" /> other unions with an accurate list of these firms.  This failure was inexcusable. It created an atmosphere from the beginning that was not conducive to co-operation between unions and solidarity in pursuit of the claim.  To put it bluntly, there was a strong impression abroad that the Group (or unions in the Group) selected the firms to be picketed on a basis that would involve few firms employing any large number of members of these unions.  Certainly the failure of the Group to indicate the basis for the selection of the firms lent support to the assumption made at the time that circumstances unconnected with the pursuit of the Group's claim determined the inclusion of certain firms and the exclusion of others.  The general unions, in particular, had a well justified grievance on this score and the almost casual attitude adopted on the picketing of firms rightly gave rise to considerable criticism. The Group and the unions involved cannot avoid responsibility for having allowed such a situation to arise.</P>
    <P>Congress were extremely critical and this is an illustration of the kind of report which was presented and which was accepted in June of this year.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which I would bring to the attention of the House.  It is&mdash;and I do not think the Minister for Labour can improve on it; neither can any exhortation from any branch of the Department&mdash;that there is procedure within congress in respect of industrial disputes and it devolves on the trade union movement to make sure that this procedure is carried out.  In 1968 the annual conference of congress adopted a motion of major importance to the trade union movement.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Congress is concerned with the failure of some unions in certain cases to give adequate consideration to the rights and interests of other workers when deciding the action to be taken in pursuit of claims on behalf of their members.  Congress considers that in all cases where the <Col N="584" /> conduct of a dispute on behalf of workers in any employment may involve a stoppage of work involving substantially greater numbers of other workers not directly concerned with the dispute, it should be normal and good trade union practice for the union prosecuting the claim to consult with the unions representing all the other workers affected by the dispute prior to any stoppage of work.</P>
    <P>In respect of the maintenance dispute, that resolution was violated repeatedly and in quite a disgraceful manner. Indeed, the terms of the resolution as adopted by the conference were completely flouted.  Therefore, having got that report from congress, one can hope that there will be built up a climate in the trade union movement which will not again permit the kind of messing&mdash;I think that is the only appropriate description&mdash;that developed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having used such strictures as were necessary in relation to that dispute, I do not think my words can be classified as being grist to the mill of anti-union elements in our society.  It is important to point out that Ireland is not generally a strike-prone country &mdash; that we are not the most strike plagued country in Europe, as some of the commentators have announced.  One has only to look at the Continental press to see the rash of wild-cat strikes in Europe, some of them very violent, many of them politically motivated, in many areas, in Germany, France and Italy.  If one looks at these disputes one can put the situation in Ireland in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>I shall pass to another aspect.  The Minister spoke about <i>ad hoc</i> inquiries made during the year, referring to the EI Company at Shannon.  He said that the report of the inquiry had not been published but that the dispute had been settled to the satisfaction of the parties.  I submit to the Minister quite strongly that although he said these reports have thrown a good deal of light on industrial relations in Ireland in the industries concerned, as far as we are concerned they did not throw <Col N="585" /> any light at all in respect of EI.  The EI report was not published.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of embarrassment to the company concerned, or, indeed, to the trade union concerned for that matter, irrespective of the concern which might be shown by the Industrial Development Authority regarding foreign firms making inquiries in Ireland and being handed that report as a case study, there is an obligation to publish this report and I refer the Minister to a speech made last year by his predecessor, Deputy Dr. Hillery, when he stated bluntly that the dispute at Shannon involved a face-to-face confrontation between a large externally financed concern and our largest and most powerful trade union and when he stated further that the rigid attitude of the firm in refusing to accept the Labour Court recommendation had been matched by the determined stand of the trade union which had brought the full battery of union weapons to bear on this dispute.</P>
    <P>That was a rather serious statement by the then Minister for Labour, yet, the report commissioned by him was not published and it is strange that the annual report of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which was circulated to members of the House did not contain one reference to that particular dispute.  I know that there are embarrassments involved but we should not be as sensitive as that in relation to reports of that nature.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the other reports&mdash;the ESB report which was compiled under Professor Fogarty and which is an extremely perceptive report; the report by Mr. Charles Mulvey on behalf of Bord na Móna was also exceptionally well done with the co-operation of the trade unions and these are reports that will be of major importance in the years ahead. However, the procedure for such reports should be regularised rather than their being compiled <i>ad hoc</i> by individuals outside of the Department as each crisis tends to develop.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister is in relation to the groups of trade unions. I have already dealt with the national maintenance craft group of trade <Col N="586" /> unions&mdash;that particular <i>ad hoc</i> group that was set up after the first maintenance agreement between the FUE and the trade unions.  The outstanding feature of that particular group was that it had no constitution, no rules and no voting procedures so that it was a miracle that they were able to stay together.  I urge that the trade union movement undertake a very extensive and searching review of the various <i>ad hoc</i> groups of trade unions which are currently in existence in the country.  In all, there are about 18 different groups of trade unions in such major concerns as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, RTE, Dublin Port and Docks, the Dublin printing industry and there are three groups in CIE, one in the road passenger section, one in the freight department and one in rail. The trade union movement should make up their minds as to whether they want to keep the groups as I think they should, and operate them on an executive constitutional basis or whether they want to allow them develop on a casual basis.</P>
    <P>This is one area within which there could be co-ordinated very effectively the loose amalgam of trade unions so that they could work on a more constitutional basis affecting the 60,000 workers who are now covered by these various groups.  That brings me to an aspect which the Minister should further consider as being very much within his province and that is the proposition that has emerged in Ireland and which has received a rather confused reception and has been the cause of a great deal of confusion within the trade union movement, namely, that there should be some statutory negotiating licence given to some groups of trade unions quite distinct from the <i>ad hoc</i> development within congress itself.  I urge the Minister to consider this aspect which I am putting forward as my own personal viewpoint.  This would be a very practical contribution to the betterment of industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, the Minister and his departmental officers underestimate the extent to which there is opposition in the trade union movement in regard to this and if it is advanced in future legislation <Col N="587" /> before this House it could well be that the growth of the voluntary group system which exists at the moment might be hindered and generally emasculated. In any event, the idea of group negotiating licences is very much a voluntary proposition whereby groups could apply for licences if they so wished.  In view of the fact that many unions would not be likely to apply in any case, the real need for introduction should be seriously reconsidered and not on any dogmatic grounds or trade union law basis.  We must consider whether the proposition is a serious development with many long-term benefits.  I shall leave the matter there as I expect it is outside the scope of a discussion on the Minister's Estimate.</P>
    <P>As regards education and training within the trade union movement, it is my experience as a former education officer within the movement that there is organisation by general exhortation, communication with members through the media of newspapers and television and decision making by <i>ad hoc</i> conferences. Shop stewards who are very often the only link between the workers on a shop floor and the union are working in an atmosphere of confusion and half-baked ideas largely because the trade union movement has failed in many areas to expand education as it should expand.  There should be more effective trade union information and training procedures.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the failure of the trade union movement in that respect. Shop stewards are very often unaware of what exactly their union policy is.  The shop steward is responsible for union organisation in the company, for recruitment of new members in an organisation, for the collection of union dues and for dealing with grievances as they arise within the particular company in which he is working.  There are several thousand shop stewards throughout the country and it is not to the credit of the trade union movement &mdash; admittedly they have limited financial resources and limited resources in terms of trained personnel&mdash;that they have failed to ensure that members are supplied with adequate information on social legislation, on industrial legislation, on <Col N="588" /> health safety and welfare legislation, on the position of claims or procedures or on the handling of grievances and the preparation of submissions to the executive committees of their unions.</P>
    <P>However, I am not one of those who believe that because one trains somebody and gives him essential information that person is automatically a better and more desirable individual. We have known sufficient educated chancers in both trade union and political life to have reservations on that matter.  I submit that the basic integrity and the militancy of a shop steward is his most important attribute but I also submit there is a strong need, on an educational and training basis, for more effective trade union organisation than heretofore in this country.  I would point out to the House in view of the fact that I am being critical of the trade union movement&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Dowling would agree with me in this&mdash;that there is a fairly strong reservoir of anti-trade union attitudes in certain areas of public life.  One meets that attitude in some sections of upper-middle-class life in Ireland.  One meets it among certain sections of employer organisations who regard trade unions as being a regrettable but necessary evil with which they have to come to grips when someone &ldquo;blows his top&rdquo; in a factory, and when they have to meet unions every two years to discuss trade union claims.</P>
    <P>Very often there is no appreciation of the need for such a trade union organisation.  I stress this point by asserting that any person, whether a white-collar worker, a clerical, professional, or technical worker, whether employed in the public service or by private enterprise, whether employed in local government or any other form of employment, when he has problems of a social, legal or disciplinary nature, when he is under a contract of employment, he has a basic need of trade union organisation.  This must be pointed out repeatedly to the public at large as an essential aspect of the real situation of industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern on the wage/price/costs situation in this country.  The Minister has pointed out <Col N="589" /> that employees' incomes increased by 10.5 per cent in 1968 and are expected to increase by over 10 per cent in 1969. This is the greatest increase ever known in the history of our country in any two-year period.  The Minister had pointed out that national production grew by over 5 per cent in 1968 and is expected to grow by about 4 per cent this year.  Industrial earnings went up by 30 per cent between June, 1968 and June, 1969.  This is certainly a massive general increase, together with the increase of 8.5 per cent in the consumer price index between August, 1968 and August, 1969.  I share the general concern which has developed in the country about the magnitude of these developments.</P>
    <P>The more perceptive Members on our side of the House would be prepared to accept the vital importance of having an effective prices and incomes policy developed in the country which would ensure that our industrial costs are maintained on a competitive basis and that there would be more equitable distribution of incomes in the country.  Neither the Government nor the trade unions can abdicate their responsibility in this matter.  Neither the other political parties nor the Labour Party itself can deny responsibility.  We have a direct responsibility here.  The Government have a very special responsibility for ensuring that prices of key commodities in this community and the pay, particularly of lower-income groups, are not relegated solely to the market place of competition and the general exploitation of consumers by commercial interests.  That would be folly of the first order.  Great initiative is required on the part of the Government in respect of an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are particularly conscious that wage and salary earners are the first to suffer when the economic situation tends to worsen. We have had rather sharp and bitter experience of that aspect of the matter. It is an outstanding feature now that while trade unions chase wage increases we have parallel rocketing of price increases in the community with very little deliberate, conscious effort on the part of the Government to try to develop an incomes and prices policy <Col N="590" /> in a situation in which there could be some element of general price stability brought into the economic situation. This is a matter of profound regret and one which is likely to give rise to very considerable difficulties in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister and to his colleagues in the Cabinet that they have failed &mdash; I do not use a word such as &ldquo;failure&rdquo; lightly &mdash; because they have not accepted with the alacrity one might have expected the recommendations of the National Industrial Economic Council regarding incomes policy which would have mitigated the current wage/price spiral development which has given us a great deal of concern in recent months.  In Ireland we are rather unique, I would stress, because we have a tremendously high proportion of our manufactured goods placed on the export market. I am sure that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald will correct my figures when I give a tentative estimate of some 50,000 Irish workers involved in the export industries of this country.  There are a small number of firms employing these 50,000 workers to manufacture goods for export.  We are conscious of the fact that the importers of Great Britain, the Continent or America do not owe us a living, much as we may have felt on many occasions that they did in our criticisms of capitalism and its operations internationally.</P>
    <P>At this point in time they do not feel that they owe our workers a living.  Unless the incomes policy situation in Ireland is rectified as a matter of urgency these 50,000 jobs could be in jeopardy.  This would halt the slow but sure economic advance that has developed in the country in recent years.  Likewise, it would be completely unrealistic for the trade union movement to advocate that there should be price control and more economic forecasting and planning on the one hand and, at the same time, refuse to recognise that such activity requires that wage and salary developments should be integrated in a general overall policy in the country.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is concerned with the distribution of all money incomes <Col N="591" /> and not with just wages and salaries. It is concerned with professional earnings, many of which should be sharply scrutinised in some areas in Irish public life.  It is also concerned with rents which should also be scrutinised.  It is concerned with profits in the community and with capital gains and with the incomes from some sections of the farming community and with the incomes of many other self-employed persons.  One cannot preach to the trade union movement that there should be an incomes policy which would be purely a wages policy and which would ignore all other incomes.  If the incomes policy is to be genuine, effective and acceptable to the trade union movement it is essential that it should be all-encompassing.  It will require a tremendous efforts on our part to ensure that that kind of policy develops.</P>
    <P>I would commend the Minister for making a suggestion regarding wage increases and I would come down firmly on his side in respect of the two aspects he advocates&mdash;first of all that such increases should be, as he suggests, on a phased two-year basis.  In fact, I do not favour a three-year basis. I consider that a three-year period is too long in terms of rapid economic developments.  I would accept his proposition that negotiations should be on a general industry by industry basis or, indeed, on a firm by firm basis.  I would submit that that kind of negotiation, even though it does impose a much greater strain on the trade union movement, and on individual unions, does ensure that proper cognisance is taken of the general economic conditions of the particular industries and of particular firms. I would submit that this is broadly in line with the recommendations of NIEC and as such it is a useful, sane and generally acceptable proposition coming before the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to low paid workers I know that the Minister has a litany or annual ritual in respect of his Estimate on the problem of lower paid workers.  In fact the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, at the beginning of this year, suggested that we were now having in 1969 the year of the lower paid worker.  We <Col N="592" /> were all impressed.  Then we got what certainly was a useful innovation and something which was a significant advance.  We got the public services agreement between the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance and the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. That was a significant advance in ensuring an uplifting of the position of the lower paid worker but much more remains to be done.  There are in our community, among the three-quarters of a million insured workers of the country&mdash;those employed in the Government service, in local government employment, in the public services, for example in the Post Office, in CIE, in hotels, in distribution, in guest houses, in the personnel services industries such as supermarkets, hairdressing, dry cleaning and many other such industries&mdash;a large number of very low paid workers.  In current negotiations there should be some special consideration by the trade union movement and particularly by the Government in respect of its own employees to ensure that the level of earnings of such workers is substantially increased.  Low paid workers are not just confined to specific categories of workers.  Very often individuals who are physically handicapped, individuals who are in poor health, individuals who suffer from mental disabilities, persons of low capacity, of general low ability or, indeed, persons who are handicapped or inadequate in terms of coping with industrial environmental facilities are low income workers and require special consideration on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the problem is not just a question of low income.  It is a question of low income employment and we must look at it on a much broader basis.  We should not be under any illusions that we in Ireland are alone with this problem.  In England the new earnings survey of September of last year showed that ten per cent of men in full time manual employment aged 21 and over were earning less than £15 a week in Britain.  It also showed that 20 per cent of British manual male workers had earnings of less than £17 10s.  Nobody can therefore, claim that Britain has not got a <Col N="593" /> major low income problem too.  We should certainly consider how we are going to develop our approaches to this matter.  There is a danger, of course, that we may come to superficial solutions and that we may minimise the tremendous complexities that exist in the problem of low paid workers.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made repeatedly to the Minister here that a statutory minimum wage should be introduced.  There are major difficulties in that field.  If such a wage, for example, was introduced in the country and supposing we set up a statutory tribunal we would have to pick a particular minimum wage as at this point of time.  I would rather imagine the Government probably picking the wages paid to workers under the Agricultural Wages Board, to farm workers, which would, indeed, be so low as to be of little or no value in raising the general level of wages of low paid workers throughout industry.</P>
    <P>In the trade union movement we would be inclined to the general idea that a living wage as we would call it should be based on what it might cost to maintain a man and wife and, say, two or three children.  Although it would be very difficult to work out this kind of figure there should be an effort made by the Government and the Department of Labour to work out a figure which would represent the cost of feeding, clothing and housing such a family with another allowance for expenditure on what we could classify as normal modest comforts.  I do not think any great work has been done in this field.  I submit that no research whatsoever has gone into the field either within the Department or, for example, by the Economic and Social Research Institute which could usefully help us in that regard.  Unfortunately, even if all the research were done a great deal of subjective judgment would still be required in deciding what comforts should be given to the average citizen.</P>
    <P>One can only guess at such a figure but a large number of workers would fall substantially below the figure we might, in fact, reach.  Indeed, even if we were to raise the level of lower paid <Col N="594" /> workers by, say, £3 or £4 a week to bring them up to a level which we would regard as an acceptable living wage we would still be faced with the whole question of differentials above the minimum rate.  For example, if we set a minimum rate of, say, £16 a week as an absolute minimum and if we brought low paid workers up to that figure, what would happen to those workers who traditionally enjoy a differential above other workers? Would their differential be maintained or would we be involved nationally in a further round of increases to raise those on a differential basis above the minimum rate or if the differentials were reduced or virtually eliminated what would be the economic consequences of it in industry?</P>
    <P>These are problems to which scant attention has been paid.  Now the Minister, in the valley period before a national minimum wage becomes a political football coming up to the next general election, has a golden opportunity to consult with the employer organisations and the trade union organisations on the basis of a family minimum wage in the country and try to devise a general minimum which would be acceptable and which could be implemented in the context of a national incomes policy.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which I should like to refer.  Something which is very often understressed in this House and in the country is the importance of the contribution now being made by wage and salary earners in terms of PAYE.  PAYE contributions in 1964-65 amounted to £19 million, a very considerable sum.  Today in 1968-69 they amount to something like £40 million, a tremendous increase in contributions under PAYE made by the workers to the national exchequer, a contribution made from wage increases, from increases gained through higher productivity.  This is something which the Minister should certainly be conscious of in the context of an incomes policy more particularly as there are quite a number of sectors of workers in the country and some self-employed and professional groups who are making no contribution from their earnings towards national resources to <Col N="595" /> meet the essential social and capital requirements of the State.</P>
    <P>So far I have refrained deliberately from mentioning the responsibility of management.  I do not propose to launch into any general admonition of management but I do point out that there has been in this country a considerable improvement in management expertise in the past decade. This is to be generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would point out, furthermore, to such management groups that the basic requirements for higher output in Ireland at this point of time, even with the tremendous adaptation which is still necessary in Irish industry, are not just more sweat and longer hours and more exertion on the part of trade union members on the factory floor; the basic requirements are still related to more effective management production techniques on the factory floor, to a more effective utilisation of capital equipment, to more capital investment in employment and, for example, to better marketing techniques in companies.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this is any excuse for the trade union movement.  The trade unions, perhaps, could be much more critical of management in these spheres, for example, where management fail to make better use of raw materials in factories.  Unions could be much more critical of managements who fail to improve industrial processes, of managements who fail to have better plant layout or who fail to have better equipment utilisation.  Very often the unions stand back and allow such things inside firms.  They should be much more critical and more forthcoming and more involved in criticising materials-handling, the design of work places, the selection of supervisors, and so on.  All these areas are areas of management responsibility and I submit that management in Ireland in many companies may be found to be very short and very marginal in many of the contributions they have made in these areas.</P>
    <P>In the social and environmental aspects we could express a great deal of criticism of Irish management in regard <Col N="596" /> to such things, for example, as class divided, segregated industrial canteens&mdash;things which are a rarity in many areas of the United States&mdash;not that we welcome or support or, indeed, admire some of the industrial practices of management or trade unions in America but I certainly think that we could be critical of the segregation of canteen facilities in Ireland, the artificial educational distinctions brought into the industrial setting, the distinctions which the educational system has built into the industrial life of the Irish community. I am afraid that we in this House have a serious responsibility in respect of many of these developments and, in fact, in many areas, are directly responsible for them.</P>
    <P>Equally, I would submit that the managements of many firms can be held to be at fault for failing to have elementarily decent working conditions introduced in their firms.  The poor lighting in many factories, the very bad ventilation that one frequently comes across, the half observance of safety regulations in firms, ineffective heating, poorly equipped cloakrooms, and so on, may appear rather trivial to some Members of this House now that we have some of the exotic building developments within the House but, certainly within many Irish industrial undertakings we can be quite critical of what is available to the Irish workers and a great deal of their complaints and disputes in these matters are quite justified.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that I would refer to and would capsule some of my remaining points is that of women workers in Irish industry.  The Minister was rather scrappy in his analysis of the growing shortage of female labour and the difficulties posed for some industries in Ireland.  He pointed out to the House that the participation rate for women in our labour force, now running at 35 per cent, is a good deal lower than in most other western European countries and indicated that the possibility of an increase in the number of women at work raises many issues and that he was in consultation with the Economic and Social Research Institute about a research project into <Col N="597" /> the various factors affecting female employment.</P>
    <P>We had the same report last year.  If I recall, the then Minister, Deputy Dr. Hillery, pointed out last year that he had suggested the need for research into the factors affecting female employment in Ireland and indicated that his Department was in touch with the Economic and Social Research Institute as to how research in these matters could be best organised.</P>
    <P>Twelve months have gone by.  In many areas I cannot exonerate the Minister's Department.  I submit that this kind of research has not been done in the past 12 months, that it should be done and that there is great urgency, particularly as there are now some 230,000 women &ldquo;employees&rdquo; working in Ireland&mdash;a major classification of industrial employment.  There are 55,000 women employed in offices throughout the country; 63,000 women working in manufacturing industry; 44,000 women in professional employment; in the health services alone, 25,000 women directly employed; in distribution some 50,000 women and in public administration 9,000 women.  What are the opportunities and the prospects open to such women?  We are here tonight, 51 years after women got the franchise, we pay a great deal of lip service to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value and it is not yet on our statute book nor, indeed, has it been accepted by the Government in respect of the ILO Convention.  We are developing an annual ritual in this House in respect of equal pay.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out to the women of this country that once a girl has chosen a particular career she may find the principles of equality between men and women, so often lauded in our Christian concept of morality, are not fully respected, especially in the matter of employment promotion and in respect of pay itself, notwithstanding the fact that these principles have been repeatedly enshrined in the United Nations Conventions on the political rights of women, in the International Labour conventions 100 and 111 on equal pay and on discrimination in jobs and professions and in the European Convention on human rights and fundamental <Col N="598" /> freedoms in Article 14 and in the European Social Charter, Article 4 and in the Common Market Treaty, Article 119.  There is a litter of general anti-discriminatory provisions written into European and world legislation. Yet, we have a situation in Ireland where women earn £9 a week in industrial employment and men get twice as much for work of equal value and for work of appropriate skill.</P>
    <P>While I very much welcome&mdash;it is not inappropriate that I should mention it here&mdash;the Taoiseach's intention to recommend to his Cabinet that there should be a commission on the status of women in Ireland, the Minister for Labour has still a major responsibility in this area.  There is the question of equal pay in the relatively limited number of occupations where men and women are clearly doing the same work and work of actual equal value.  There is the question of coming to grips with that problem first of all.  I do not think that anybody rejects the idea of that approach even though it might apply to only a small range of occupations but I am afraid there is a yawning gap between acceptance of the principle and its practical application.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and probably as important as the concept of equal pay for equal work, there is the whole question of the remuneration of women relative to men.  It is quite clear that on the Continent of Europe, particularly since the signing of the Rome Treaty&mdash;and it is one of the few attractions I find in relation to the Common Market as Deputy FitzGerald would certainly acknowledge&mdash;the concept of equal pay has gone far beyond the idea that men and women who are simply doing the same work should get the same pay.  It has gone away beyond that approach.</P>
    <P>It is now universally accepted that there is need for equalisation of pay between men and women and the complete rejection of the idea of so-called &ldquo;women's work&rdquo;.  Female employment is the worst paid employment in this State.  Even over the past 20 years we have made very little progress here. Male earnings in industry and elsewhere are more than double the average earnings of female labour.  This is not because all men who work in industry are skilled or because all women <Col N="599" /> are unskilled; it is very far from being that.  On the Continent the difference in take home pay as between men and women engaged in industry is at the very most 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The third area I would urge the Minister and the proposed commission to examine is that of women's employment, their numbers, their prospects of promotion and the existence of unacceptable marriage bars in certain employment. It is meaningless to consider an approach to equal pay within the narrow limits of equal pay for equal work while excluding consideration of the overall position of women in our society, particularly from the point of view of work.  I submit to the Minister that if we take some urgent action on this matter of equal pay we will transform Irish society and profoundly affect the pattern of that society in the future.  Even in the short-term we could bring about a considerable transformation.</P>
    <P>There are two solutions.  It can be done by legislation or it can be done by trade union action.  Judging by Government reaction the prospect of legislation would appear to be rather remote. The Taoiseach gave no indication that he would be prepared to introduce such legislation.  The trade unions will have to rely on promoting equal pay by trade union action, but there are still prejudices in some areas in respect of women and a great many perverted social attitudes.  That reflects the male dominated concept of society which abounds in most strata.  We must consider equal pay in that setting.  The difficulty is a major one.  There will have to be a campaign of social education because some men, as we know, are unable to face the reality of women earning equal pay.  It might also be said that some women have not yet been fully persuaded about the need for equality.  These are aspects I would stress.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Minister's comments on women's employment, I would point out to him that, apart from equal pay and related aspects, there are other aspects requiring urgent attention if we are to build up a pool of women workers.  For instance, the <Col N="600" /> present facilities for child care are grossly inadequate.  In many areas they are non-existent.  I am well aware of some of the more emotional reactions to this.  But one must approach a matter of this importance calmly and logically.  The need for child care facilities will become more marked with increasing numbers of mothers going out to work.  Indeed, the pattern of child care is likely to change very considerably.  At the moment working mothers rely on relatives&mdash;possibly grandmothers&mdash;to look after young children but, today, great numbers of women in the fifties and sixties are going out to work themselves and they are no longer available to look after young children.  We shall have to plan our approach on that basis.  We will have to plan for mothers with children under five years of age.  No consultation is needed with Deputy Dowling in regard to industrial Dublin where one finds an increasing number of mothers, with children under five years of age, going out to work.  In some cases they have to work.  In other cases they just want to work.  I suggest that the average child of three to five years of age can benefit considerably from nursery education.  A rapid expansion in such education could play a very important part in building up a pool of women workers.  There is a grave shortage of women workers in industry. Nurseries will be absolutely essential.  The hours of work will have to be made extremely flexible so that all possible benefit can be derived from the system and so that the benefits may be spread as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>Again, special provision will have to be made by the Government, by our employment services and by the Department for the large body of women workers who must work irrespective of the ages of their children.  There are the widows, the unmarried, the divorced, the separated and the deserted wives.  Not only are nursery facilities essential but there is a basic obligation on the State to provide such facilities.  If we do not provide such facilities then the children will be reared in unhealthy environments, mentally and physically, and without the stimulation every child craves.  All <Col N="601" /> these aspects must be borne in mind. I have chosen my words as carefully as possible knowing that what I say may be open to misinterpretation by the less enlightened amongst us.</P>
    <P>I submit there is a tremendous waste of potential skill and that if this skill were channelled into its proper use it could make a major economic contribution to our industrial life.  I was speaking recently to some British and Russian medical personnel.  In Britain 5 per cent of doctors are women.  In Russia the figure is 75 per cent.  I do not suggest we should draw any particular analogy, but I do suggest that the general assumption that women are incapable of obtaining a tremendously high degree of skill in both social and public services is a hideous fallacy.  The figures I have given illustrate the magnitude of the contribution women can make.  It has been admitted in Sweden that an increase of something like 55 per cent in national income could be effected by making a more intelligent use of available female labour.  If Irish women are properly trained there is no reason why their skill should not make as great an impact and it is, therefore, imperative that we should have industrial training for women workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister refrained from comment on the trade unions, possibly out of circumspection.  I should like to comment briefly on the need for rationalisation. On the whole, the congress has been somewhat uninspiring.  The trade union structure here is not as irrational as it is in Britain.  I think that all the efforts have been overshadowed by the spasmodic efforts during the mid-1960's on the part of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Ireland to come to grips with the second-last remaining leg of the disunity that faced the trade union movement in the earlier part of trade union development in this country.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I welcome the 1966-1968 discussions between these two general unions.  The transport union has 140,000 members in the Republic: the Workers' Union of Ireland has some 30,000 workers in the Republic with some 25,000 of these in the greater <Col N="602" /> Dublin area.  Most certainly, I think that, conscious of the collective negotiating strength of both unions, and the ramifications of the organisational bases of these two unions, all other efforts at rationalisation tend to pale into insignificance in the Republic. I would hope that the tentative talks which took place between these two organisations will be resumed at an early date.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret, in the first instance, that the final talks towards unity, merger&mdash;call it what you will&mdash; did not come about.  I trust they will soon come about.  Such a development would have a major impact on the Irish trade union movement.  It would be in accord with the work done in the mid-1960's by the late Jim Larkin, who took many initiatives in this field in respect of relations between the Workers' Union of Ireland and the transport union and, indeed, it would be in accord with the wishes of the late John Conroy.  I would hope that the overlapping of membership and duplication of services between these two unions&mdash;with the quite inevitable and quite human competition which inevitably exists between large general unions&mdash;could be harnessed, with the common intelligence of the executives of these two unions and bring about a larger trade union structure.  That does not preclude the need for further rationalisation in many other sectors of the Irish trade union movement affecting the other trade unions directly concerned who might usefully join in that kind of exercise.  I think that congress could at the moment do with a new shot in the arm in that general sphere of development.  That is all I propose to say on that aspect at this point of time.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude my comments by making a few very brief random points. I would refer the House to one of the difficulties facing the trade union movement, a difficulty which the trade union movement itself must face internally, namely, that we have trade unionism in this country on the cheap.  We have quite a disgraceful state of affairs whereby Irish industrial workers&mdash;very often because they have not been asked to pay more&mdash;now contribute the <Col N="603" /> equivalent of a packet of ten cigarettes a week to their trade union.  We expect to receive, from that, in respect of a national organisation representing half a million people, an effective, national trade union structure.  It is a matter of regret that trade union contributions are so terribly low.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain there is sufficient idealism, sufficient sense of need in trade unions, that members will willingly contribute&mdash;I would suggest the equivalent of one hour's pay per week.  I think that would be a normal contribution from a trade unionist to his trade union.  It would give to a rationalised trade union movement much-needed funds.  It is quite preposterous to suggest that, for example, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions can subsist, or barely exist, on, for example, a total income of something like £25,000 a year.  One would find it impossible to run a more effective national organisation purely on affiliation fees of that kind.  The trade unions must face up and explain to members more coherently why they want the money.  No doubt trade union members will respond to that: particularly some of the smaller unions will get out of some of the difficulties they are wont to get into from time to time.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to the existence, within the trade union movement, of something which we very much failed to consider in any of the Estimates to date of this Department, namely, that the trade union movement in Ireland is the only organisation in the world which has got an internal appeals board machinery. This might be stressed by Deputies when they meet disgruntled trade union members.  The appeals board was set up in 1963 following the endorsement by the then annual delegate conference of a recommendation by the committee on trade union organisation.  It differs from all other boards of the congress in that the members are selected directly by the annual delegate conference of congress itself.  I think members of the trade union movement should show no compunction whatsoever, if they have disputes with their executives, in availing of the exceptionally fine <Col N="604" /> and useful appeals board machinery which exists within the trade union movement.  The British TUC has not got it.  The Swedes, despite their sophistication, have not got it.  Neither has the German trade union movement got it.  There is no doubt that this appeals board, elected of members of the movement itself could very usefully have an effective role to play in future.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial safety, I shall be very brief on this point.  I welcome the comments of the Minister.  He should do his utmost to try to ensure that as well as the competitions to be arranged by the Civil Service Commissioners for the filling of vacancies and so on, and for the expansion of the inspectorate of this Department&mdash;as, indeed, he has repeatedly been urged since the setting-up of the Department &mdash;a review of the factory inspectorate will be undertaken immediately.  There is constant harping on this.  I am aware of some of the internal difficulties in this matter.  However, there is a big gap at the moment in respect of industrial safety which needs to be closed.</P>
    <P>As a former officer of the National Industrial Safety Organisation, I would suggest that the £10,000 which the Minister is now giving to that body should be spent mostly on industrial training courses.  We over-estimate the value of leaflets, of quarterly journals, of conference reports, and so on; we over-estimate the value of posters and of a whole range of written propaganda. One decent industrial training course would be far better for the advancement of industrial safety in this country.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Members of this House have every much underestimated the tremendous loss of human life, the waste of mental and physical abilities, the loss to the economy as a whole and the general human misery and suffering caused by industrial accidents. Only those of us in the trade union movement can appreciate, as trade union officers, the catastrophic effects which industrial accidents have on family life.  I strongly endorse the work of the Minister on that matter.  Indeed, if I may say so to the Press Gallery, if only half of the passion and detailed examination that is exercised <Col N="605" /> on industrial disputes were directed for a few weeks on the prevention of industrial accidents then I think we could have an even greater benefit to the economy as a whole.  These are aspects which are well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also produce, as a matter of urgency, a new Factories Act handbook.  We have been promised this for the past three or four years; so far it has not emerged. In Northern Ireland and Britain there is readily available to shop stewards, to trade union members and employers, a very useful and effective safety handbook outlining the principal provisions of the Factories Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>I would also recommend that the Minister should consider the question of occupational pensions.  One of the most significant and welcome developments in recent years has been the growth of occupational pensions of the superannuation or death kind.  One of the major disadvantages of such schemes, however, is the absence of transferability with all its accompanying frustrations for workers when they change employment.  The Minister should have further consultations with the Minister for Finance to ensure that the legislative prohibitions in respect of transferability are removed.  This aspect is something that will merit increasing attention in the future.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make a comment on the role of the trade union movement in respect of industrial and economic planning.  It would be inappropriate that an Estimate like this should pass without placing on record the tremendous efforts made by the trade union executives, particularly those in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in regard to the work of the NIEC over the past four or five years. Men like the late Jim Larkin and the late John Conroy, Senator Murphy, Mr. Donal Nevin and Mr. Charles McCarthy, despite being caught up in their own day-to-day work, found time to make a major contribution towards ensuring that the trade union movement lived up to its principles and policies in respect of national economic planning.  The work done by the trade unions in this sphere has frequently <Col N="606" /> gone unrecognised and, indeed, we have not explained to our own members what precisely we were doing at national level.</P>
    <P>These are my comments on the Estimate.  I regret that I availed of the opportunity to speak for so long but it is one of the few privileges in a democratic country that one can talk in this House for as long as one likes, as long as one is not unduly repetitive.  The matters to which I have referred should have the immediate attention of the Minister.  I had hoped to have sufficient time to expand on such topics as industrial democracy.  I suggest that the Minister should set up a working party to deal with this matter, a working party which would be representative of employers, trade unions and the Department and which would review in depth the necessity for introducing the democratisation of industrial life in various spheres.  Many people are bemused by the jargon which has developed in regard to economic and political control and, therefore, such a working party should be appointed. Such a working party would in time bring about a more rational, and less of a party political, interpretation of this vital aspect of social and economic development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister well in his new office and congratulate him on the manner in which he has covered a very wide range of matters in his speech.  I should also like, as a trade unionist, to compliment Deputy Desmond on his speech.  Certainly it was a breath of fresh air coming from that side of the House compared with speeches which we have heard over the last four or five years.  I am in agreement with most of what he has said but there are a few points about which I disagree.  However, I should like to congratulate him on the realistic manner in which he has put the various points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all problems confronting the Department that of industrial relations is possibly the one to which the greatest attention should be given at the earliest possible moment.  In the field of industrial relations we have four elements, the Government, the trade unions, the employers, and the workers.  To some <Col N="607" /> degree all four are responsible for the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the industrial relations which we have had over the past four years.  Individually or collectively they have had some responsibility. The first point on which we must agree is that all four elements must move towards agreed social and economic standards, and once we have agreed that we are going to move forward, then we can set about placing our own house in order and then we can move towards these standards in a way which will lessen tension and we will then arrive at our destination on time. There is much to be done in the various sections.</P>
    <P>From the Government's point of view much has been done through their aids to conditions of employment and through the various Acts which they have introduced to shelter workers from unfair labour conditions, in order to protect workers and to give them the rights they now enjoy.  Much more needs to be done and I am glad to see that the Minister is actively working on the question of bringing up-to-date the various conditions of employment that have been brought into operation over the years.  It is not before its time that many of the Acts which gave workers shelter and which covered conditions of employment were brought up to date.</P>
    <P>Only a day or so ago I had a case brought to my attention which indicates the necessity for bringing these Acts up to date.  Recently a worker who was entitled to eight days holidays died and I understand that the interpretation of Dublin Corporation in regard to the Act which covers holidays with pay was that the holidays died with the worker.  This is a situation in which the Dublin Corporation are putting their hands into a widow's purse and taking out eight days' pay to which her husband was entitled.  I understand that this is the interpretation which the corporation have applied for a considerable time in regard to holidays and many widows have been affected in the past.  Legislation can no longer be delayed to ensure that widows of people who are entitled to holidays with pay receive that pay.  This is just <Col N="608" /> one aspect of the matter which I mention to illustrate where conditions of employment should be improved to protect people in industry.  The Minister must introduce changes which will be acceptable to and operated by the parties mainly concerned.  I hope that the legislation which is being prepared will not be branded, when it is being discussed here, as being repressive legislation as happened on a previous occasion.  People should not be prejudiced in regard to legislation coming before the House.</P>
    <P>We have here enough common sense to examine, analyse and rectify any sections that may be unjust.  This can be done realistically and the legislation should not, as has happened in the past, be condemned in the first instance as being opposed to workers' interests. I believe the trade unionists on both sides of the House are very concerned about legislation being introduced here and will become more concerned as time goes on, to ensure that justice is done to the workers.  Throughout the years the Fianna Fáil Government by the many Acts they have brought in to protect the worker have shown their desire to assist and shelter workers.</P>
    <P>We see from the figures which the Minister gave, and which have already been quoted, the number of man-days lost as a result of industrial disputes, the gross production lost, the exports of £3½ million also lost&mdash;this is of vital importance&mdash;together with the wages of £1½ million and the £500,000 lost to trade union funds.  These figures must give food for thought to all parties to this agreement which can bring about better industrial relations.  We cannot delay for a single day any rectification we can bring about to ensure that the system in future will not be as disastrous as it has been in the not-too-distant past.  It must not be a matter of purchasing peace at any price.  We must sit down and work out a settlement that is just not only to the worker but to the country as a whole.  Cash settlements are important but they are not the only ones that can be considered.  There are many other bases for settlement and some of these have been overlooked for a long time.  I suggest the employers and the <Col N="609" /> trade unions should examine the present system and make an effort immediately to remedy defects that undoubtedly exist.  There should be no delay in trying to bring about the relations in industry that we hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is room for improvement in regard to achieving the contentment of the workers, the provision of jobs with more meaning and freedom of expression for workers.  This is often denied to people who are the grassroots of Irish industry, the workers who have been there for a long time.  If it were granted, no doubt it would bring about betterment of industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Many dictatorial elements in management, in the inefficient section of management, deny this freedom of expression.  There are many enlightened and efficient managers but we also have the few who are, to some extent, responsible for retarding progress.  I believe it is important that workers who desire to become decision-makers in regard to their own industry, or industry as a whole, should be given freedom of expression and should become in fact decision-makers.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when we should consider the position of adaptation grants and other State grants in the development of industry. These grants have been paid to expand industry and share capital.  It is public money that has been pumped into this sector of our economy.  It results in greater production but an examination should be made of the situation and employers should consider making available to workers some of the reinvested profits in the industry.  These workers have built up the industry by their sweat and toil and some of the reinvested profits resulting from State aid should come back to Irish workers by way of share capital.  The workers would then have a very desirable stake and interest in the further development of the industry.  We should get away from the idea that nothing but a wage increase will increase the workers' interest in industry. It is one way, but there are possibly many other ways by which this can be done.  Possibly also, there are other <Col N="610" /> ways by which workers can be assisted by recognising the results of their efforts as shown in the profit factor when it exists to a substantial degree.</P>
    <P>The worker coming to the end of his employment now demands that special attention be paid to the amount he will have when he retires on pension. The employer or the State or both, should endeavour to solve the problem that exists when a worker drops from an income of £30 to £6 per week.  The difference makes readjustment difficult. People who have put many years of effort into an industry are entitled to far more consideration than they have got in the past.  The contributory old age pensions and, in some cases, employers' pension schemes, have eased this burden to some extent but these retired people, over the years, have entered into various commitments and we have now reached the stage when workers expect to be much better off on retirement than they are at present.  Whatever may be our contribution to development we all rightly expect a share of the results and the prosperity that follows.  In that connection I think we should have new thoughts on the question of allocating share capital to Irish workers and also on the matter of retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are hampered by strikes, as pointed out by the Minister and Deputy Desmond.  Sometimes these strikes are developed not by the trade unionists but by the banner headlines in some of the evening newspapers especially.  This type of sensationalism in which some papers specialise has brought about a worsening of the situation in connection with some strikes in our city.  On many occasions the television cameras and some of the evening newspapers have built up tension in workers' minds and developed many a strike from a small beginning into a considerable upheaval.  The indiscriminate calling by a reporter on people who are possibly in no way, or only in a small way, connected with a strike for a &ldquo;quote&rdquo; often means that those who are party to the strike first hear or see this quote in the newspaper or on TV and feel they are committed to it.  The people seeking these quotes <Col N="611" /> are not very selective.  Very often they go to the person they think will be of the greatest news value to them and who will make the most extraordinary or outlandish statement.  This is undesirable.</P>
    <P>The newspapers and television should assist in conveying the truth about a situation to the public by showing the two sides and not giving just a one-sided account, as has happened on many occasions.  This, again, is undesirable and should be rectified in the future.  There should be a better balance in their quotations, and their coverage of industrial disputes.  On most occasions just one side is presented and tension is built up.  When that tension is built up, neither the newspapers, nor television, nor the trade union movement, can be of any assistance.  It must then take its course in the normal way.  It is my feeling, and the feeling of very many people, that both of these news media have been responsible in some way for some of the developments here in the past.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by the Irish Management Institute and the College of Industrial Relations and other bodies, the employers leave much to be desired in their outlook on industrial development.  The question of personnel management is of great importance, and little attention is paid to it by the vast majority of Irish industrialists. It is put at the end of the queue, if it is ever let into the queue, in the minds of some Irish industrialists.  During the debate on last year's Estimate, Deputy Belton stressed the need for more personnel management work and a greater development of this aspect. When we find that about 2 per cent only of Irish industries have people engaged exclusively in personnel work, it gives us some idea of the amount of leeway we have to make up to catch up with people who are better equipped elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and desirable for management in industry to take another look at this question of personnel management.  Staff selection is now becoming more specialised day by day.  Few firms use these agencies. It would appear that most Irish <Col N="612" /> workers are selected on the basis of an interview only.  With the training and knowledge in industry today, not only do we need more highly specialised technicians but we also need highly specialised personnel managers to ensure that industry gets an inflow of the best fitted personnel so that it can function in the most effective and realistic way possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to applaud many of the industrialists who are now paying attention to their supervisory staff.  In the past, supervisors were appointed or selected for one reason or another and they had little duty other than to convey the managers' decision to the men.  The supervisor has a very important part to play in the industrial life of this country.  He is a very important person.  He is the contact between management and men.  He is the man who can, by his example and his fact and his approach, further the efficient development of his firm by relieving stresses and strains.  Where we have specialised management, time study experts and specialists of all types it is necessary that we should also have specialised supervisors.  The supervisor is probably one of the most important cogs in this great wheel. To those people who have paid attention to the supervisor I would say that they are in some way meeting their commitment to the efficient development of industry and lessening the tensions that sometimes cause bad industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Many managers have been pushed into industry because they were misfits elsewhere.  It is unfortunate that industry has to carry these particular misfits.  They often seem to find themselves in managerial positions.  I have known many firms with people who were pushed in because of the share capital held by members of their families, or because of their influence over some of the directors, and they have got into a position in which they can really jam up the works and rule out efficient management in some sectors.  Very often they are diverted into sectors in which they carry out very small functions.  Nevertheless, they are part of management which <Col N="613" /> dictates to efficient technical personnel, and they can cause an undesirable disruption within industry.</P>
    <P>The employers have a lot to do to put their house in order apart altogether from having some unity within their own organisations for dealing with the various problems they meet on a day to day basis with the trade unions.  The variety of organisations, the variety of groups acting on behalf of the employers, is undesirable and must lead to a worsening of positions.  This lack of co-ordination could be fully and clearly seen during the recent maintenance strike.  If there were one or two organisations catering exclusively for all members the trade unions and workers would know exactly where to go to have their grievances rectified.  At the moment these organisations are used as a threat against the workers and as a means to divert them from the path they intend to pursue to have their grievances rectified.  On occasions it is difficult for the workers to reach the top management or the people who represent the top management.  To my mind that has been one of the causes of some of the problems: putting off, diverting attention, impeding progress, sending the worker or the trade union official from one individual to another and before he reaches the top, before he reaches the person who is really in command, the position has sometimes got so far out of hand that it leads to a strike, or strife of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Changes are necessary on the employers' side just as they are necessary on the trade union side.  Whatever legislation is necessary to bring about mergers and amalgamations of trade unions&mdash;whatever legislation the Minister and the Congress of Trade Unions think is necessary&mdash;should be brought in at the earliest possible moment in order to ensure that the trade unions can put their house in order and bring their organisation up to date.  Their organisation, too, has become antiquated and out-of-date as is the case in relation to many of the other organisations with which we will be dealing as we go through this debate.  The trade union organisation <Col N="614" /> is going through an important period of development.  There is a new outlook, and we have heard that new outlook expressed here today and on the last day by Deputy Desmond.  A new outlook is both necessary and desirable and I would ask the Minister to ensure that whatever legislation is necessary will be brought in so that the finger will not be pointed at him at a later stage as being the one who will be impeding progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with the minimum period for which potable spirits, whether home-made or imported, must be kept in warehouse before being released for home consumption.  At present, the law requires spirits, with some exceptions, to be matured in warehouse for at least five years.  The Bill proposes to reduce this general age requirement from five years to three years and it also provides a special lower age requirement of one year for rum.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not in any way affect the position of those descriptions of spirits which have always been exempt from the age restrictions.  Examples of these classes of spirits are gin and liqueurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed change in the law is being introduced at the request of the Irish distillers in order to provide them with greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of export markets.  Whilst the law we are discussing applies only to spirits sold on the home market it has an indirect effect on exports.  This happens because in an important export market like the USA imported spirits cannot be released for consumption unless they are eligible for sale in their country of origin.  In the United Kingdom the general minimum age limit is three years.  The result is that Scotch whisky and indeed Irish whiskey produced in Northern Ireland may be sold in the USA at three years <Col N="615" /> whilst our whiskey must be five years old.</P>
    <P>In considering this subject we must also bear in mind the trend of developments in Europe.  The Council of Europe, of which Ireland is a member, has produced a draft Convention which defines various types of spirituous beverages and the definitions include a reference to the minimum age at which the spirits may be marketed.  The minimum age proposed for whiskey is three years and that for rum is one year.  It is to be expected that the European Economic Community may also decide to adopt similar definitions of various types of alcoholic beverages.</P>
    <P>It can be said, therefore, that the amendments proposed in this Bill will do no more than bring our law into line with international thinking on the subject.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the Bill is not designed to alter the character or reputation of Irish whiskey. All the law does is to specify minimum age requirements.  The Irish distillers have always taken great care to safeguard the quality and reputation of Irish whiskey and they can be relied upon to continue to do so.  In this respect, the interests of the consumers and the distillers coincide.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not alter the duties on spirits in any way.  As a corollary to the enactment of the Bill, however, it will be necessary to provide that spirits which have been warehoused for three years or more but less than five years will be exempted from the small additional duty of 2s 6d a proof gallon which is chargeable on immature spirits.  In order to achieve this, the Government propose to make an appropriate Order under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  Neither the Bill nor the proposed Order will have any effect on the revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill certainly has one great merit in it: it is one of the simplest draft Bills we have ever seen.  We in this party are satisfied with the proposal put forward by the Minister. As far as I can find out the original term for which spirits had to be kept was laid down in 1915 by a <Col N="616" /> British Act, and that Act provided that the minimum period was to be three years.  That was changed to the present level of five years by the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>I find it rather odd to note in looking back over the Dáil Debates of that time that the period was increased from three to five years without any explanatory statement by the then Minister for Finance, without any speech from the other side of the House, without any speech from the Minister's side of the House, and that it went through the First, the Second, the Third, the Fourth and the Fifth Stages in this House without any comment. In the Seanad they apparently appreciated their palates slightly more and they did introduce two drafting amendments which came back to the Dáil, and again the Dáil offered no comment.  We are therefore completely in the dark as to why the period was changed from three to five years in 1926, and of course the 1947 Act merely repeated the 1926 Act.</P>
      <P>It cannot be stressed too much, however, apart from the facetious angle to which I have referred, that this will not in any way affect the taste or the quality or the maturity of the whiskey here at home, be it Jameson or Gold Label, which the Minister and I drink. I do not know whether, when he is down south, he goes to Paddy Flaherty, but I must confess I do not.  However, the whiskey we drink here at home will be exactly the same, thank goodness, as that which we have been drinking before.</P>
      <P>It also stands to reason that, in relation to export markets, particularly in these days of high interest rates, we cannot possibly hope to sell five-year-old whiskey in America in competition with a three-year-old; the price differential, with rates at about 10 per cent per annum, would be something of the order of one-fifth.  If our distillers are to be able to compete effectively in America they must be able to compete on the basis of equality in the price of their wares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I think, largely to enable a broader base to tackle the export market that the United Distillers of Ireland was formed, and it was formed <Col N="617" /> following suggestions right down through the years that the distillers themselves should do something to tackle exports.  We are helping them to do that in this case because&mdash;and I am aware of this from my own personal knowledge&mdash;the law in the United States is that one cannot sell spirits from any country at any lesser maturity than is permissible under the law of that country, and hence without this Irish whiskey would have to compete at approximately a 20 per cent price disadvantage.  The distillers have gone a long way to try to break into the American market by the adaptation for that market of blends and tastes, and it would be very wrong if we were not to help them to do this by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know, perhaps the Minister does, anything about rum.  I thought, until I sat down to think about this particular Bill, that I knew most things about most beverages but I am afraid I know very little about rum.  In relation to the change in the maturity period for rum envisaged here I shall have to take the Minister's word that it is a beneficial change.  I should be prepared to accept either the corporate word or, on this particular subject, the individual word.</P>

The 1947 Act was brought in because the distillers were running into difficulties at the time and they wanted the period of maturity changed.  Deputy Sweetman said that the 1947 Act repealed the 1926 Act.</P>

The Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1926.  Both were cited as being repealed in the Schedule to the 1947 Act.</P>

      <P>That is correct, they were both repealed, but the 1947 Act did not re-enact what was in the earlier Acts.  The point was made at the time that Scotch whisky could be sold at only three years whereas Irish whiskey had to be much older.  I am quite certain about this, although I do not have the records here as I have not sufficient interest in the subject to bother about it.  The fact is that the law was changed at the time because of conditions brought about by the war.</P>

In the West Indies, where rum comes from, there are as many different varieties and qualities of rum as there are of French wine.  It is possible to become a connoisseur of rum.</P>
      <P>I would correct Deputy Dr. O'Donovan by saying that the 1947 Act was brought in because rum was very scarce after the war and the maturation period was temporarily reduced from five years to three.  That was the simple reason for the 1947 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1969.</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the order before the House for approval is to add the shares of Allied Irish Banks Limited to the list of trustee authorised investments. That Bank has requested that trustee status be accorded to its shares.</P>
    <P>The investments in which trustees may invest trust funds, unless expressly forbidden by the instrument creating the trust, are set out in the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958.  The Minister for Finance may very the list of investments by order subject to the approval of the Oireachtas. The primary qualification for trustee investments is that they should be secure, and subject to this, that they should give a reasonable income to the beneficiary.  I am satisfied that the shares of Allied Irish Banks meet these criteria and that they are a suitable security to be added to the list of authorised investments.</P>
    <P>Allied Irish Banks Limited was incorporated as a public company in 1966.  It is the holding company of the Munster and Leinster Bank Limited, the Provincial Bank of Ireland Limited, the Royal Bank of Ireland Limited and their subsidiaries.  The authorised share capital is 12 million shares of £1 each, of which 7,700,000 shares have been issued and are fully paid-up.  The shares are quoted on the Belfast and London Stock Exchanges as well as on the Dublin and Cork Exchanges.  Total assets of the company on 31st December, 1968, amounted to £386 million. Balances on current, deposit and other accounts amounted to £364 million, an increase of 20 per cent on 1967.  Total dividend for last year was 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The stocks and shares of the two major banking groups in this country&mdash; that is the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks' groups&mdash;are the only Irish bank stocks and shares available for purchase by the public.  The capital stock of the Bank of Ireland has been a trustee security since 1889 and a loan stock issued by that bank in 1966 was given trustee status by means of an order similar to that now proposed. <Col N="621" /> In the normal way I would be reluctant to very further the list of authorised investments pending the completion of a general review of the existing legislation. The position in relation to the shares of Allied Irish Banks is, however, anomalous.  There are no good grounds for differentiating between the two main banking groups and I am satisfied that the request of Allied Irish Banks to have trustee status given to its shares is reasonable and should be acceded to.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged under the Act to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make varying the list of authorised investments&mdash;a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Public Trustee, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Presidents of the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges.  I have consulted each of these persons and they have no objections to the proposed order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the proposed order but I think it is a pity that this order is coming into force before the amalgamation is complete, as was provided in Part III of the Central Bank Bill, which was introduced before the dissolution.  I was also disappointed to hear from the Minister earlier today that it is not proposed to take the Bill at an early stage or even to re-introduce and re-circulate it.</P>

      <P>Squeeze it out.  I do not believe the Minister was squeezed out.  I believe the Minister did not wish to put the Bill in.  I understood that that amalgamation part was to become operative originally before the 31st December of this year.  Of course, <Col N="622" /> the amalgamation is a necessary part of the strengthening of the institutions, one of which we are now discussing. Subject to that, we certainly have no objection to the Bill.  The position is anomalous but it is a pity that the other changes could not have been brought in before.  Indeed, they might have been brought in if the Minister for Local Government had not wasted the time of this House for so long in 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, no objection at all to this order but the Minister provided me with a piece of ammunition in the course of his brief.  He need not necessarily have done so but since he did I cannot avoid taking advantage of the occasion.  He said:</P>
      <P>Total assets of the company on 31st December, 1968, amounted to £386 million.  Balances on current, deposit and other accounts amounted to £364 million, an increase of 20 per cent on 1967.</P>
      <P>That increase of 20 per cent is, of course, a direct reflection of the failure of the Minister to carry out his work. A 20 per cent increase in current deposit and other accounts in a period of 12 months is a direct reflection of the inflation which occurred in the year 1968.</P>
      <P>We have the Central Statistics Office telling us the cost of living only went up by 5 per cent.  This is the kind of nonsense in Government figures which makes a person like myself really wonder whether he is ga-ga or the Government are ga-ga.  You can have your choice but you cannot have both. It is obvious, having made the point, that every loan creates a deposit and the vast increase in the advances of the banks was what created this huge increase in current and other deposit accounts.  As I say, it proves the Minister failed to do his work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported I was pointing out the necessity for the groups concerned in our industrial set up here, the Government, the workers, trade unions and the employers, to put their house in order at the earliest possible moment in order to ensure that we move towards a situation that will lead to agreed standards and agreed targets with a lessening tension within industry. As I pointed out, industrial relations is probably the most important matter in the Minister's brief.</P>
      <P>We have in this country very many highly respected trade union officials but, nevertheless, we have some that I would like to comment on.  During the recent maintenance dispute we had a full-time and a part-time official who were not concerned about the development of the nation, who were not concerned about the workers' problems but who stated they were concerned about bringing down Governments and that it was their intention to bring down the Government.  This was the stated opinion of irresponsible trade union officials of a skilled union in this city, a full-time official and a part-time official.  If the intention is to disregard the standards of the workers, to disregard the problems of the workers and to set their sights on causing industrial disruption in an endeavour to bring down the Government of the day, then I think they are mistaken.  I hope the union concerned will take the necessary action against such irresponsible tactics which have come to light in the not too distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great bulk of officials are <Col N="624" /> responsible men who are doing a very good job in a responsible way.  I hope this group, whose stated aim, as I said, was to overthrow the Government in power and by a manipulation of strikes cause disruption in various sectors of our industrial life which would bring about the downfall of the Government, will not get any support. It is as well to let those people know we are aware of their outlook and of their stated intention.  This is certainly not the intention of the vast majority of the responsible officials whose only concern is to ensure that the workers get a fair slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of strikes.   A strike is often a vote of no confidence in union officials.  One of the factors worrying those irresponsible officials may be that strikes did take place for which they could be held responsible and that those strikes were a vote of no confidence in their capacity as officials.  It is a warning to other people who feel they can dictate or decide the trend of industrial disruption. The unions will very soon disregard those people.  I hope the day is not very far distant when this full-time official and this part-time official will get the answers they deserve.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is a complex one and is one which is getting more and more involved.  A more through understanding of the problems of the unions is necessary for the ordinary members of the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The question of communication between trade unions and their members should be tackled in a realistic and honest fashion.  Too many unions have not got a publication of any description through which they can acquaint members of up to date situations. Far too many union members depend on the flash on television or the banner headline in the newspaper for news of union activities.  Many union members in this way hear quotations from irresponsible officials or irresponsible members who endeavour to inflame a situation.  If trade unions had a better system of communication with their members there would be better industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Very often we have vague expressions and naive statements by unions <Col N="625" /> officials which are not alone not understood by the union members but by the people who make them.  Some of these people tell the workers that they can become owners of the industries in which they work.  I could give many instances of this.  There was the suggestion of taking over the firm of Guinness, of Aer Lingus and of the Irish Sugar Company.  I hope that in the future if these people interfere with Irish industry it will be with more success than in the past when they endeavoured to destroy Aer Lingus.  If they had their way we would have Aer Lingus without planes and we would have pubs without beer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard them talking like this in the House.  We heard one of them on this Estimate a few days ago.  One of these gentlemen, Deputy O'Leary, spoke about the lower paid workers.  He ignored the fact that the Government are greatly concerned with the lower paid workers. In his speech the Minister expressed the Government's grave anxiety and he spoke of the positive action being taken by the Government to assist lower paid workers.  In spite of that, we had the Labour spokesman, Deputy O'Leary, saying that social services are the answer.  This problem is one which must be tackled with courage and understanding.  Deputy Desmond, when referring to differentials, made a good contribution and we hope we will hear more of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of the lower paid workers must be faced in a realistic manner by the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.  I can recall two occasions when Members of the Labour Party, including Deputy O'Leary, voted against the financial provisions necessary, in supplementary budgets, to ensure that the lot of the lower paid workers was improved. Deputy O'Leary spoke of growth centres.  We all realise now that the Labour Party do not constitute a growth centre because this was proved by the workers in the last general election. At any rate, a responsible member <Col N="626" /> of the Labour Party spoke today, Deputy Desmond.  He tackled the problems in a responsible manner and we hope we will hear more from him and less from Deputy O'Leary with all his groans and moans.  Listening to Deputy O'Leary, one would be inclined to ask the Board of Works to build a wailing wall outside Leinster House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for what we have done.  Greater things remain to be done in the future which the Minister has outlined&mdash;many of them not before their time&mdash;such as revision of the various Acts in relation to conditions of employment and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which is causing concern to all responsible people is the question of the accident rate within industry.  Members on all sides of the House have spoken with a great degree of anxiety and responsibility of this. Last year we had 20 fatal accidents in industry.  This is far too many.  It shows that we have still in industry&mdash;not withstanding all our legislation&mdash;a minority of employers who do not measure up to their duties in relation to safety factors.  I would hope that not only the factory inspectors but every member of the Department of Labour would have the power to inspect factories with a view to examining the safety factors involved and have the offending party prosecuted so as to ensure fewer fatal <Col N="627" /> accidents.  It is deplorable that 20 breadwinners should have lost their lives last year because of the neglect of irresponsible management.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take deliberate action as quickly as possible in order to ensure that safety committees, for which successive Ministers for Labour have asked, will be set up. It appears that up to the present the trade unions have disregarded this aspect.  They have a responsibility equal to that of the factory inspector in this instance.  In all factories and workshops there are trade unions and it is up to them to see that their members are protected from the irresponsibility of employers who will not implement the desire of the Department of Labour or of the Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of private employment agencies.  I was glad to hear from the Minister what he proposes to do in this respect.  These agencies operate successfully in this city and all the problems are not connected with those who emigrate to England because there are also problems concerning those who emigrate to the United States and elsewhere. When I was in the United States recently I was informed that a centre city agency sent a young girl from here to a family in Virginia.  Under the terms of her employment, this girl was to have been allowed to practise her religion and she was to have time off each week.</P>
    <P>However, after the first few weeks she was prevented from going to Mass on Sundays.  A short time later she was not given any time off and subsequently her clothes were taken from her.  Later she became pregnant.  In fact, she paid a fee to an agency in Dublin that she might become pregnant in Virginia.  The fact that this happened indicates that the situation with regard to certain agencies is deplorable. Young girls leaving home should be given a phone number or an address where they could contact somebody who would help them or advise them in time of distress.  These young people are very often lured to undesirable places.  I am thinking, in particular, of a place in Washington which I shall not mention but which <Col N="628" /> has an attractive Irish name.  This place is a real dive and is certainly not a fit place for any respectable person to go.</P>
    <P>While I know there would be problems involved in subsidising the provision of proper amenities for those young people, especially in the larger cities, I know also that large sums of money are made available to our embassies, to trade delegations and to other people leaving here.  A small amount of money, properly controlled, would mean a lot to people who have fallen into traps such as the one I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Ignorance and fear play a large part in the downfall of many of our young people.  Regarding the girl concerned in the case I mentioned, two young Irishmen happened to hear of the situation and went to the house where they warned the owner that if he did not release the girl with her clothes, his shack would be burned down. There should be some measure of control exercised in relation to these private employment agencies.</P>
    <P>On emigration, the Minister stated that the best way to help is to provide those leaving our shores with adequate information and advice before they leave.  I agree.  Such advice would be very important to the many people who will leave this country in the future for the United States and elsewhere. If the Minister takes the action that he proposes to take, much good will be done and it will be done not a moment too soon.</P>
    <P>Regarding employment, the Minister spoke of desirable and encouraging trends.  In June 1969, the estimated number of workers in the transportable goods industry was 201,000, 11,000 more than in June 1968.  This shows clearly that the trend within the transportable goods industry is to provide, as recommended by the NIEC report. an extra 11,000 new jobs each year by 1980.  A statement made recently informed us that for the six months ending June 1969, 41 projects were commenced with an estimated employment potential of 1,935 at the end of the first year and 4,138 when in full production.  The statement said that 53 projects were under construction with <Col N="629" /> an estimated potential of 2,944 at the end of the first year and 6,051 when in full production.  For the same period grants were approved for 78 projects which will have a full employment potential of 4,589 at the end of the first year and 7,667 when in full production. Therefore, the total number of projects was 172 with an employment potential of 9,468 at the end of the first year and 17,856 when in full production.  During the same six months approval for grants was given for 119 small industrial projects with an employment potential of 700.  This is a healthy sign and prospects for the future are exceedingly good.  This is just as we would expect it to be and the various Departments must be congratulated for their approval of the grants in question.</P>
    <P>The question of compiling the register of unemployed is one that is causing concern.  The unrealistic manner in which it is at present compiled and the way the figures are used by people who do not understand them is very unjust.  The compilation of a register to give realistic figures would be good for industry as a whole.  Such a register would give a true indication of the availability of personnel fully equipped to meet the situation, of the people who are unemployable and of the people who are available for part-time employment. It should also give some indication of the numbers who are only attending the labour exchange for the purpose of keeping their benefits intact. I hope that the Minister will give immediate consideration to this question so as to silence some of the people who are trying in a very unjust way to twist these figures to suit themselves. The unrealistic nature of this register needs to be explained.  I hope that the Minister will, in a short time, compile a more realistic register giving us clear insight into the true position.  This would assist Irish industries and Irish industrialists who would then have a proper assessment of the labour position.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that a site at Ballyfermot has been procured by AnCO for apprentice training.  This Ballyfermot centre will be very important. The training centre will be welcomed <Col N="630" /> by all and the personnel can be assured that every effort will be made to help them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke about the changing pattern of industrial skills in Ireland.  He spoke of the changes necessary and desirable in industrial training. He also mentioned the question of the multi-skills and the need for training for them.  I agree with Deputy Desmond's views in relation to the development of new systems in order to get away from the present apprenticeship system.  The present system will be with us for a long time as the main source of supply to the skilled trades.  It has possibly outlived its usefulness in many ways.  The changes in outlooks and attitudes in both trade unions and among workers will have to be treated with caution and respect in order to ensure that the change-over will be effected with the minimum amount of harm.</P>
    <P>On a visit to Verolme Dockyard I saw that a system of multi-skills has been evolved.  It has been evolved by the breaking down of demarcation barriers.  I was very impressed by the manner in which that concern overcame the various difficulties and problems in relation to demarcation.  If we are to survive in the future some of these barriers must be broken down. They have already been broken down in certain sections of industry today by a system of allowances given to tradesmen in order to bring about the flexibility which is so desirable.  We are reaching the stage of the modular system described by Deputy Desmond. which involves a break-away from the traditional concept of craft training This must be examined at the earliest possible moment.  I can see a large number of objections.  We must start now to educate the tradesmen of today. and the young men who will be entering the various crafts in the near future, in regard to the changing pattern of skills which has come to the fore in the last few years and which will be even more important in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour should look at educational qualifications in relation to apprenticeship training They should look at the intermediate <Col N="631" /> and group certificates in this regard. Certain subjects are both necessary and desirable in certain trades.  The question of anyone qualifying in these particular subjects at intermediate level and then finding himself debarred because of not attaining a high level of qualification is something that should be further examined.  I wonder how far the educational qualifications of the personnel at the Galway and Limerick training centres have been examined.  Have the educational qualifications of personnel for retraining been examined?  Have some of the people got only a primary certificate? When it comes to the training of personnel for skilled work certain essential factors should be considered important and all others ruled out.</P>
    <P>I should like to have an opportunity of visiting the AnCO centres at Galway and Waterford in order to get some insight into the working and development of AnCO as it exists.  Some other Members of the House would probably like to visit them also in order to see at firsthand the methods employed in training the workers.  Other Members of the House have expressed to me their wish to see these centres.  Would the Minister consider that Members of the House who would feel it desirable to visit these centres should be given an opportunity to do so?  It would increase the constructiveness of the debates in relation to training and industry when the Minister's Estimate is under consideration in the future. I understand that it will be some years before the training centre at Dublin will be in operation but the Dublin Deputies will be expected to know a considerable amount about the problems of training centres and the methods being employed in them.  A large number of skilled workers in the city will be affected by the new developments in the Dublin centre.  It is desirable that Deputies in such a position should have an opportunity of seeing at firsthand what has happened so that they would be able to convey in a factual way the information of how the system will work when it is fully in operation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the future belongs to skilled workers.  Some people are unaware that this is the <Col N="632" /> position.  Greater skills will be required in the future.  People who feel that the present system is good enough must be educated to the necessity for having skilled workers.  If we examine the situation in the US we will find that in industrial development the emphasis on skilled labour has been very great indeed.  In the food industry employment rose by one per cent, but the skilled labour content rose by 40 per cent.  In the steel ingot industry the number of skilled personnel increased by 91 per cent.  The chemical industry production workers increased by six per cent but the number of skilled workers in the industry increased by 67 per cent.  We are still a long way behind and we need to educate out people to the necessity of expediting consideration of the question of the production of skilled workers.  The question of changes in the present apprenticeship system is one that will have to be tackled with caution and understanding.  We are all aware that the mental capacity of workers in industry and of apprentices varies very much.  One worker may become efficient in three years while another may take four or even five years to become efficient.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Department of Labour on the manner in which they have produced and circulated the career guidance leaflets. These leaflets are impressive and have done much to rectify an unsatisfactory situation which existed.  I get correspondence from constituents seeking information about trades covered by these leaflets and it would be a great help if there was a complete set of the leaflets available here in this House. I looked for them one day but I was told that I would have to get them from the Department of Labour.  It is desirable that they should be available here so that we could examine them and be able to answer queries without having to write many letters and take up the time of other people.  Eleven thousand letters have been received in relation to these leaflets and we could do a little of our own homework if they were available here.  I want to congratulate the Department on their design and presentation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> With regard to stands and exhibitions, some are effective and some could be improved.  We should pay a little more attention to the number and type of stands.  The question of exhibitions is an important one, particularly exhibitions attended by young people. Stands should be made freely available to any organisation seeking them. Leaflets have been supplied to quite a numbers of youth clubs and it might be a useful exercise if some type of small portable stand were made available and supplied to youth clubs for two, three or even one week during the year to bring them the information that we have at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The conditions of employment and the review of the protective legislation for workers is long overdue and is necessary and desirable.  The fair rules for employment and the other measures which have been mentioned are all very desirable and the sooner the reviews and the implementations are set out the better it will be for everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism by certain Deputies here of office block development in Dublin city.  For too long clerical workers were condemned to work in dark, dismal, damp and dangerous dungeons.  Some people seem to think they should still be condemned to work in them.  It is necessary to erect office blocks in order to ensure that our workers have a decent place in which to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that there were many houses then but no people to go into them because, as the <Col N="635" /> Minister pointed out, they were in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. As a result of their return and of the continuous increase in employment here and the betterment of conditions, I am glad to say that Irish workers now have and will continue to have decent places of employment and I would ask the Minister to ensure that they will not be condemned to work longer than is necessary in inferior accommodation.</P>
      <P>I want to applaud the measures that have in the past been introduced. The workers' party, that is, the Fianna Fáil Party, have over the years expressed in no uncertain manner their desire to ensure that the workers were sheltered against the winds.  They did this by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, the Industrial Relations Act, the Shops Act, the Wet-Time Act, the Office (Premises) Act, the Redundancy Act, the Apprenticeship Act and holiday pay.  I could go on reciting such legislation for a long time. I know it will be a problem to co-ordinate all the aids that have been made available to Irish workers of which we are proud and we will continue to press for the betterment of conditions even of Irish clerical workers, something which has been neglected and frowned on by certain gentlemen in this House and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is removing the problems that irritate workers I would ask him to have a look at the political levy with a view to its abolition.  The political levy is an irritant to responsible Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If Irish workers want to contribute to a political party they are free to do so and there is another way in which political parties can obtain money from workers.  Unfortunately, there are many Irish workers who have been blackmailed into paying the political levy, who have been terrified into paying it, and who do not want to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="636" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Even two shillings a year is a high price to pay.  Blackmail is clear at any price.  It may not be in the mind of the Deputy but I have a deep feeling about this.  I have consulted many Irish workers.  I have in this House indicated cases where people suffered as a result of their failure to opt out when they wished to do so.  I would ask the Minister to pay attention to this matter and to take into consideration the desire of the great bulk of Irish workers who support us, who do not want to pay a political levy to any party, who want the trade union movement to be a free movement, free from any type of political pressure.  There is a political levy and it tends to create a situation in which pressures are applied at a cost to Irish workers.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say a word about redundancy.  The Redundancy Act has been in operation and is a wonderful aid.  That Act represents constructive thought and endeavour on the part, again, of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I should like to see one or two amendments to the Act.  I mentioned them before.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that a reduction in the period of four weeks is now desirable and necessary and I would ask the Minister to consider this suggestion and to see if it would be possible to implement it without endangering the fund.  If it is possible and realistic, I know the Minister will endeavour to have this amendment made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of resettlement allowances.  When such generous and so wide a variety of allowances were made available, it is difficult to understand why they have been availed of to such a small extent.  There may be some reason for this.  It is a matter which should be investigated because I am quite sure that there are many workers who could and would avail of these allowances if they knew of their existence.  It may be that workers are unaware of this aspect of the redundancy scheme.  Workers got explanatory booklets in regard to redundancy payments but the arrangements <Col N="637" /> in respect of resettlement allowances should be further publicised having regard to the fact that the fund is in such a healthy condition.</P>
    <P>Once again, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his extensive coverage of all the problems.  This extensive coverage shows me as a trade unionist that the Minister is concerned and has been examining all these matters in a realistic way.  I trust that his period in the Department will be a fruitful one.  He can be assured of the wholehearted co-operation of trade unionists if he implements the suggestions outlined in his speech.</P>
    <P>From my point of view as a trade unionist I am perfectly satisfied with the comprehensive manner in which the Minister has dealt with the matters that concern his Department and I want to assure him of whatever co-operation may be necessary and desirable in ensuring that the workers are fully protected.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter that I should like to mention; it is one that I raised earlier.  It concerns holidays with pay and the suggestion made by Dublin Corporation to a widow that she would be deprived of the holiday pay to which her late husband was entitled prior to his death.  This is a matter that should be investigated at the earliest possible moment and if amending legislation is required that should be introduced as soon as possible. It is diabolical that Dublin Corporation, in other words, should have stolen eight days pay out of a widow's purse.  Their legalistic interpretation of the Act requires to be rectified as soon as possible.  I am quite sure that the Minister will get the co-operation of Labour and Fine Gael if it is necessary to introduce amending legislation in order to ensure that the widow would get what she is entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the Minister's opening speech.  It is extensive and comprehensive. It reviewed what has become a very wide field and did so fully and contained much of interest.  I just thought in reading it and seeing how extensive it is and how extensive and complex are the problems that he <Col N="638" /> faces, how necessary his Department is and how fortunate it is that the initial reaction of the Government to the suggestion that there should be such a Department was not maintained but was reconsidered in the light of some discussion and debate that occurred around that time.</P>
      <P>I should also like to compliment particularly Deputy Desmond on his remarkable speech, constructive in tone throughout, comprehensive, indeed, like the Minister's speech, and a speech which showed, of course, so much of the special knowledge that he has acquired during his career.  I, perhaps, had a personal reason for being pleased with his speech because he has spoken even longer than I have so far done in the House by an extra half hour and made me feel somewhat less guilty for having kept the House for three hours on the External Affairs Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the Minister's speech, there are a number of points that I should like to comment on first.  The development of the training side of AnCo's activities is very much to be welcomed.  I have had an opportunity of seeing one of these training centres at work and it certainly is impressive and encouraging to see the work that is being done.  At the same time, as Deputy Desmond said, the scale of its activities is still very, very small compared to our needs.  The economy of this part of the country employs roughly twice the number of people employed in Northern Ireland.  Admittedly, there is a higher proportion here in agriculture but if one excludes agriculture then one could think broadly in terms of our non-agricultural employment being, perhaps, one-and-a-half times that of Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland there are, I think, 2,500 places in training centres.  For us to reach the same stage as they have reached would require, therefore, very broadly, 4,000 places.  We have, if I understand the Minister aright, 450.  It is good to know that we have started but we have gone not much more than ten per cent of the way towards what would be needed to match the admittedly remarkably fine training facilities in Northern Ireland.  Industrial training <Col N="639" /> is one of the areas in which Northern Ireland has particularly shone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  I should like, also, to join Deputy Desmond in welcoming the transfer of CERT to the Minister's field of responsibility and to say on my account what good work this organisation does and how worthy it is of the support and the now extensive financial support which the Minister's Department is giving it. If other of our industries and trades had training organisations doing the kind of work that CERT does and as well as CERT does it, the whole industrial sector would be performing a good deal better than it is able to do at the moment in the absence of training facilities.  The idea of the industry organising its own facilities with State assistance in this way is one which is to be particularly commended.</P>
      <P>That industry, the hotel and catering industry, has done a good deal of work, incidentally, in a field where the Minister is having, I think, some trouble.  While their work is, I am sure, necessarily at a relatively amateurish level compared with the kind of professional work in manpower forecasting which we can expect from the Minister's Department when it eventually gets to grips with that problem, the fact that they have carried out surveys or joined in carrying out surveys in the hotel and catering industry and have tried to use these surveys, even if necessarily at this point of development in a slightly amateurish way, as the basis for forecasting future needs in this sphere, is encouraging.  It is something industry should be trying to do in its own way pending the development of a full-scale manpower forecasting service.  I shall come back to this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Deputy Desmond also suggested that the Irish National Productivity Committee should be transferred to the Minister's Department.  I had not thought of this until Deputy Desmond mentioned it but, thinking it over now, it seems to me it might be a good idea.  The Minister will be aware that the Irish National Productivity Committee has had a somewhat chequered history.  It is now ten years in existence, but it has never fully settled down and become accepted by the other organisations working in related fields.  Indeed, continuing doubts exist on both sides of industry as to the functions it is performing and as to whether the money spent on it might not be better deployed by a reorganisation of its activities or by using it, in some instances, in other areas.  There is something to be said for bringing the committee's work within the scope of the Minister's responsibility because the Minister could then examine the work of the committee; the work of the committee has not come under sufficient scrutiny by the Department which is at present responsible for it and, because much of its work is in this particular field covered by the Department of Labour&mdash;most of its work, one way or the other&mdash;it might be possible for the Minister to integrate it and its activities more closely into the general life of Irish industry. There may be difficulties about that It may be that its functions are more related to industrial output and labour problems.  This can be argued.  There is, of course, a difficulty about the borderline between the Minister's Department and other Departments, and particularly the Department of Industry and Commerce, but Deputy Desmond's suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the manpower services.  What he said was rather disappointing because here, as in so many other aspects of our national life, the slowness of the pace of action by the Government is disastrous. Six years have elapsed since the question of a manpower policy was first raised.  I shall not detain the House with a full account of the tortuous history of that proposal.  I detained <Col N="641" /> the other House on that subject several years ago and it is now past history, but I shall refer briefly to it to press the Minister for urgent action in this sphere.  After the seminar we had the statement of the NIEC in April, 1964; then we had the report of 1964; then the matter was referred to an interdepartmental committee, whose report was described by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy S. Flanagan, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, as stupid and illogically argued; rather, he thought that was how I was describing it and he said that, if it was, he agreed with me, which is the same thing as saying it himself.  The report was negative and, though initially accepted by the Government, it was subsequently rejected after the Seanad debate on manpower policy.  We then had the NIEC report condemning it.  That was, perhaps, the main contributory factor in having the interdepartmental report considered&mdash;the Seanad debate in 1966 and, finally, the decision in July, 1966, after two and a quarter years from the time when the proposal was first made to establish the Department of Labour and the announcement to set up a manpower service.</P>
    <P>July, 1966, on my reckoning, is 3? years ago and we were told then that one of the first things would be the setting up of a manpower service once the decision was taken to overturn the proposal that the placement service should remain in the Department of Social Welfare.  Now, 3? years later, the Minister tells us that he has a head for the manpower service and this head is now preparing to recruit personnel and is looking for premises around the country.  This simply is not good enough, I think.  I have a great respect for the Minister's Department.  It is one of the best Departments of State. It benefits from being a new Department without any of the traditions which, in some cases, tie down some of the other Departments.  It is open-minded and has been in many ways energetic.</P>
    <P>What is disappointing is that, when we get a Government Department which is, by any standard, above average in its performance, it moves at a pace which involves taking 3? years to appoint a head of a manpower <Col N="642" /> service, a head who is now preparing to recruit personnel and looking for premises.  It is not possible to justify that slow pace of activity in any Department.  I think the House will have no difficulty in imagining the pace in other Departments when this is the speed at which the Department of Labour works.  But I am glad something has happened.  I am glad that someone has been appointed and I am glad that he is looking for personnel and premises around the country. The effort is belated and I urge the Minister to speed up this process. There can be no justification for this slow pace of activity.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister imagine what would happen in the private sector if that were the pace of operation? Suppose a large company decided to set up a department to handle a problem and 3? years later it was announced, with apparent pride, that they had actually appointed a man to undertake this activity and he was preparing to recruit personnel.  Such a pace would be totally unacceptable and commercially disastrous.  But it is apparently accepted in the public service as normal and here is one of our better Departments moving at this pace.  This is something that must cause all serious concern.  It is something to which we shall have to return when we come to debate the Devlin Report.  I hope we will have an extensive debate on that vitally important document.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his proposal to regulate the activities of employment agencies.  I welcome this. I am glad he and his Department have been open to the suggestion that something should be done in this sphere.  One of the oddest features of the present Government is its reluctance to act or to introduce regulatory activities where they are clearly needed. I have never understood this.  I can understand our differing.  We have different ideologies and different viewpoints. The Government is entitled to its different viewpoints and its different ideology but I have never been able to understand what philosophy or ideology underlies the attitude of Government Departments who advise Ministers <Col N="643" /> that it would be a dreadful thing to inspect nursing homes, for instance, or adoption societies, that these are areas of the private sector where, no matter what evidence there may be, they are in a minority of cases.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a minority and, in this country, a very small minority, in which there are malpractices, but the Minister, on the advice of his officials, persistently refuses to do anything.  I am glad the Minister has been open-minded in this particular case and I am sure the advice he received from his officials was advice to introduce this change.  I hope he will have a word with his colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Justice in particular, where smaller problems have arisen, problems in relation to which certain people have taken up entrenched positions; I hope the Minister will have a little chat before or after Cabinet meetings to try to dislodge these people from these positions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the assessment of unemployment and the carrying out of manpower surveys.  He referred to the Drogheda survey and the value of it because of the information given and the insight as to the true nature of unemployment and the invalidity of so many of the statistics, if one attempts to use them thinking they may be an indication of the people actually looking for work.  The Drogheda survey was a very important development in Irish social research and also in the public service because the Irish public service has shown itself &mdash;again, I exempt the Minister's Department&mdash;quite extraordinarily averse to commissioning research projects or using the assistance it might get from people with research ability, in fact, looking for any assistance outside its own ranks.</P>
    <P>There are certain Departments in the public service which have absolutely resisted the offers of assistance from, for example, the Institute of Public Administration and its consultancy service; which have excluded any help from the service; which have forbidden local government agencies, county councils, health authorities and so on, to use <Col N="644" /> the services of this body and which have refused to provide grants for this purpose.  This entrenched attitude of resistance to any help from outside, this feeling that they know it all and do not need any help, is one of the biggest obstacles to progress in this country.  This attitude is to be found in certain Departments of the public service but by no means in all.</P>
    <P>For instance, it is not found in the Department of Finance nor has it been for many years past.  Neither is it found in the Department of Labour.  I am not in a sense complimenting the present Minister on the fact&mdash;it originated before his time&mdash;but, through him, I am complimenting his Department on their open-minded attitude to social research, on their willingness to provide funds for it and to get in competent people from outside when they see the necessity for a detailed professional examination of the kind that can best be provided by such people.  It is a totally different attitude from that of other Departments. I am sure that, under the present Minister, this enlightened practice, initiated by the former Minister, Deputy Hillery, will continue.</P>
    <P>The Drogheda survey had a rather complex history in its initiation.  I must say that initial reaction to it within the Department of Industry and Commerce was far from encouraging.  The attitude in the Department of Industry and Commerce at that time seemed to be: &ldquo;There is no problem here to be studied and, if there is, we are studying it and, if there is to be a survey, we want to run it and we do not want anybody from outside to run it in a professional manner&rdquo;&mdash;apparently lest it should disclose something the Department would not want disclosed.  It took very considerable pressure to overcome that type of outlook.  The NIEC played a professional role.  It was overcome. The survey was instituted and taken over by the Minister's Department and, as the Minister said, it was enormously useful.</P>
    <P>If the advice in the Department of Industry and Commerce had been taken, that survey would never have taken place.  The attitude was that there was no problem, that they had the <Col N="645" /> employment statistics and that all they had to do was simply to pick out the figures from their files.  They could not understand that their unemployment statistics, devised for administrative purposes, did not reflect the true character of unemployment here.  It was only because their advice was disregarded and the matter was pressed through, through the agency of NIEC, that the survey was carried through with the assistance of the Central Statistics Office.  As a result, we have this enormously important document which has given to us a fresh insight into unemployment.  The Minister's predecessor was far from content to rely on this single document.  He immediately commissioned similar studies on Waterford and Galway in order to establish some kind of basis for assessing the general countrywide validity of unemployment statistics&mdash; rightly feeling that we should not base conclusions on what happens in one town.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that these further extensive and expensive surveys will not, perhaps, be continued in that form: I agree.  These are pilot surveys to establish the nature of the problem.  On the one hand, the Minister will use them as a basis of guidance to set up a proper system of recording the actual availability of people for work and at the same time continue to use social research methods on a smaller scale to examine particular aspects of the problem.  This is an entirely proper approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling also made reference to unemployment.  He is right in saying that we in this House bandy about unemployment statistics which often do not reflect the number of people looking for work.  We do this because there are no other statistics.  If the Government publishers call something &ldquo;unemployment statistics&rdquo; which are not anything of the kind, Deputies cannot be condemned for using the figures if they have no other relevant statistics available to them.  Nearly half the women in Drogheda registered as unemployed so that they would qualify for maternity benefit.  The whole point <Col N="646" /> of registering was that they did not intend to work but to have babies instead.  If the Dáil is given figures which are called &ldquo;unemployment figures&rdquo; and which purport to be a record of the number of people looking for work, I do not think the Government can blame Deputies for using those figures.  If the total is something less than that, it is the fault of the Government for not having initiated a study.  It is because they accepted the advice given to them that there was no problem that they find themselves in this position.  Deputy Dowling commented only on the fact that these figures include some people who are not looking for work.  He did not, as the Minister did, refer to the fact that they exclude young people leaving school and looking for work who should be included in the figures. I think it is fair to make these comments on what Deputy Dowling said in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Moreover&mdash;and this is a comment I frequently have to make when talking about unemployment both politically and in academic circles&mdash;unemployment in Ireland is not a measure, in any true sense, of how the economy is going.  The unemployed in Ireland represent a tiny minority of our labour surplus who do not emigrate.  The real measure of our failure is not a figure of 60,000 or 45,000, which is only a drop in the ocean, but, rather, the flow of people from the country every year, a flow which is still running in the region of 15,000 to 20,000.  A measure of our failure still to master our problem is that the equivalent of one-quarter of each age group has to emigrate even today.  It is a great improvement on the position as it used to be.</P>
    <P>We can all recall the time in the period 1954 to 1961&mdash;a period which bridges the period of office of more than one Government and, therefore, I am not making a political point&mdash; when the average level of emigration was 46,000 which was equivalent to 85 per cent of the school-leavers in this country not that 85 per cent of each year's school-leavers emigrated immediately. We were losing something over half of each generation of school-leavers in that period.  Other people <Col N="647" /> who had not emigrated when they left school upped and left because they saw no prospect of employment or a decent life in this country.  Now, we have &ldquo;improved&rdquo; the position.  There is a genuine improvement.  Instead of 46,000, it is between 15,000 and 20,000 today.  However, we should not be mesmerised by the scale of the improvement.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the past are for the record and, no doubt, some of us on either of these benches will get credit from history for improvements which were effected.  Our job is not to be complacent about what has been done in the past by either side of this House.  The fact is that the level of emigration is still the equivalent of one-quarter of each year's batch of school-leavers.  Beside that, unemployment is a drop in the ocean.  It is three years' supply of emigrants accumulated here over the past 20, 30 or 40 years.  To concentrate unduly on unemployment misses the point.  The continuing outflow of emigration is the problem which faces the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to speak about manpower forecasting.  What he had to say is disappointing but not surprising to anyone who already knew the difficulties the Minister's Department faces in this regard.  Many of us&mdash;I, myself, particularly&mdash;were, perhaps, naïve in our expectations of the kind of result that could be achieved from the application of professional expertise in this field.</P>
    <P>I certainly felt it would be possible to get meaningful results, which would be of some practical value, relatively quickly and by setting up a manpower forecasting unit, as advocated by the NIEC since 1964, we would be doing something which would begin to yield results in a measureable space of time, in a year or 18 months.  However, this has not been the case.  The Minister has explained very fully the difficulties involved.  He told us how his professional staff have been in contact with other countries which are finding similar problems and similar difficulties. Clearly this is a more complex problem than I or many others realised. I would suggest that in this instance <Col N="648" /> we should not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good.  I am very slow to suggest that we should apply anything other than the highest standards; but when you are concerned with matters of practical administration there are times when by waiting until you get perfect or near perfect systems you can fail to achieve the results which could be achieved from something a little less than perfect.  I may be wrong and I may still be naive in this but I feel it would be possible to produce some useful data with regard to manpower forecasting of a necessarily crude character without waiting for the perfect system which will take a long time, because if no other country has a perfect system and they are scratching their heads about it we are going to take a few years to produce it.</P>
    <P>I wonder, therefore, if we could not cut a few corners and produce something useful.  The Minister's Department is concerned with practical administration and practical results and it is right that they should have professional people looking ahead to try to build up a first-class system for the future.  Indeed, I have been advocating that for a long time.  I would hope that it would be possible, even if a few corners have to be cut, and even if the information that emerges is a little bit crude, to produce something useful. From my own practical experience in relation to the particular problem of the catering industry, which may in some ways be an easier problem than an industrial problem, it seems to me that you can get useful data for forecasting purposes from a fairly simplified form of analysis.  I wonder if we are not being a little too perfectionist in this and whether we could not begin to produce something useful.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the Regional Technical College's Study and said that a model was being produced which might be useful.  I look forward to this.  I wonder if the Minister would have this published as it emerges.  The Minister's Departments has an open-minded view on these things but there are some Department which feel they should lock up everything in case anybody might ever use it against them.  Data of this kind could <Col N="649" /> be useful and it should be made available so that the people concerned with the relevant kind of research could examine it and comment on it.  It is, perhaps, something that might be presented in a paper to the Statistical Society and from that the Minister might get useful views on the development of this kind of model.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a preliminary labour replacement and labour expansion project.  I did not understand what this meant and perhaps it is the very thing I was talking about, perhaps it is a slightly crude version of manpower forecasting produced by cutting corners.  I would like the Minister to develop this and tell us a little more about it and to say if it also will be made available publicly. It is important that this kind of work should be open to public scrutiny and the opportunity taken to get the views of the experts and people interested in and concerned with these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned employment classification&mdash;a perennial problem in anything to do with manpower forecasting and statistics.  I am very glad that we are moving over to an international classification.  Our attitude to the question of the classification of jobs has been very haphazard hitherto and most of the information we have comes from the census of population. There is, of course, a serious problem here.  In the census of population we do not hand people an international classification of 4,892 jobs and ask them which they are doing.  That is not feasible.  The people are not necessarily interviewed by anybody with any expertise and they may not be interviewed at all.</P>
    <P>The man who writes down &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; for example, cannot have that claim checked and the people in the Statistical Office may be left in doubt as to whether he is a graduate engineer of UCD or a chap who knows how to turn a nut with a spanner.  The problem of any classification of employment based on a voluntary return by people describing their jobs in their own words is a very considerable problem and clearly anything we can do to get a more accurate description than we have in the census of population would be <Col N="650" /> useful.  The Minister has a big job on hands in trying to get this information.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that the redundancy fund has yielded such a handsome surplus to date and that redundancy was less than expected.  In a way I am slightly amused because on several occasions I pressed for information about what the expectations were, how many redundant jobs were allowed for, and I failed to get any answer.  I thought this was strange because when the Minister fixed the contribution he knew what money that would bring in&mdash;knowing how many workers there are it was simple to calculate&mdash;and he knew that he was going to get a certain sum of money.  Somebody at some stage must have made an estimate in order to arrive at the conclusion that that amount of money would be needed.  The persistent refusal to state the expectations of redundancy was impossible to justify. The Minister and his predecessors and others involved should have come clean.  Clearly they expected more redundancy than there has been.  They were very cautious and made ample financial provision in case things would be worse than seemed likely.  It was a relief for the Minister to discover that the volume of redundancy was not as great as had been allowed for.</P>
    <P>However, it is not quite as insignificant as the Minister says.  He gives a figure of .34 per cent of the working population but that is a slightly misleading figure because the redundancy scheme applies only to part of the population and therefore I do not think he can relate the figures of redundancy to the whole population.  However, that is splitting hairs to some extent and the important thing is that at the moment the figure is relatively small. The Minister expressed some optimism that it would remain small but at another point he seemed to be saying that it might not.  I hope his optimism is right.  I never believed that the freeing of trade would yield the large scale redundancy so frequently forecast by the conservatively minded, cautious, fearful people who want to keep this country cocooned&mdash;some of them, rather surprisingly, to be found on the left wing of our politics.  Nonetheless, <Col N="651" /> it is a fact that with the freeing of trade, when it becomes effective and it has not yet begun to become effective, as I endeavoured to show recently in an article on the subject, we are going to have more redundancy than we have had.  I do not think the Minister would be wise to think that it will remain at its present level.  It is fairly constant because the freeing of trade has not begun to have any significant effect, but from next year on, or certainly from 1971 onwards, for the following three or four years, there will be significant redundancy and the fund should be built up to provide some reserves for this purpose.  At the same time the scale of the surplus is such that I would not suggest that the whole of it should be kept back for that purpose.  I am glad that the Minister is going to introduce some improvements to the scheme and use some of the surplus for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, although I fear he will refuse this, that he should use some of the surplus to extend the area covered by the scheme to the agricultural sector.  It is quite unacceptable that in this country where we talk a lot about agriculture and spend a lot of money on agriculture we regard it as completely alien and separate territory. If a man losses a job and he is an employee then he is entitled to redundancy compensation but if a man finds himself surplus in agriculture, because he happens to be self-employed, he is not entitled to anything. I never understood the reason for these clear-cut distinctions which are made in some areas and not in others.  This self-employed man who cannot get redundancy compensation probably draws unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There is something very illogical about this.  If a man's self-employment is not sufficient to preclude him from drawing unemployment assistance, if he is given this extra subsidy, rather peculiarly, because he owns property&mdash; a thing I have never quite understood: because he happens to own a farm, he gets unemployment assistance: if he did not own a farm but engaged in some other kind of activity and did not own <Col N="652" /> property he would not be entitled to it; I have never understood the logic of that: the principle of giving to those who have&mdash;it should not preclude him from other benefits.  Given that we have that system of income-supplementation confined to that area of society I believe it should be general: that income-supplementation to bring people up to the minimum income should not be confined to the agricultural sector.  Given that we have that system, and do decide that these people, though self-employed need, and are entitled to that assistance such as unemployment assistance, for example, I do not understand why they should be excluded from the operation of the redundancy scheme.</P>
    <P>I see many difficulties about bringing them into the redundancy scheme and providing for retraining but I do not think the difficulties are such that we should exclude them.  We must accept that the big area of redundancy in this country is not today and will not be in the future&mdash;even perhaps in the difficult years of the early 'seventies&mdash;in industry but in agriculture.  The decline in the agricultural population is as to about half, probably, attributable to deaths of people who never require retraining, at least not in our sense; they may have to undergo a certain period of preparation after leaving this world.  As well as those who leave agriculture through deaths there are others who leave agriculture on their two feet and they generally leave agriculture to go outside this country to Britain, because we do nothing about providing alternative employment for them here.  Our placement service is inadequate for this purpose; there is no means of training and there is no redundancy compensation applicable to them.  There are great difficulties about extending the scheme in this way but they are difficulties we must face.  We cannot in this respect discriminate against the agricultural population. When we discriminate in their favour in other respects, it is completely illogical to discriminate against them in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister was able to tell us that he is encouraging research into the question of lack of internal mobility here.  It is a remarkable fact, <Col N="653" /> as he has already established from the operation of the redundancy scheme, that people are not mobile from Dublin outwards.  Certainly, they are mobile into Dublin from the country but Dublin people are very reluctant to move out into the country.  If they move out of Dublin it is usually to Britain they go and not to other jobs in Ireland.  Hitherto, this has not been a very major problem because there have not been many jobs for them to move to in Ireland but, as we develop our industrialisation outside Dublin, and if the Government finally plucks up its courage and decides to implement the Buchanan Report and really develop outside Dublin as it ought to do, we shall have many more employment opportunities outside Dublin than there are today.</P>
    <P>The problem of the unwillingness of Dublin people to move out to the country is one we shall have to tackle. I think it would require study at a fairly deep level to discover the root cause of it.  It seems to me, and it is something over which I have been thinking quite a lot in the past few days, that there is a very deep gap between Dublin and the rest of Ireland, the nature of which we have not understood and, perhaps, do not even think about.  A paper which has been published by the Economic and Social Research Institute throws interesting light on this.  It shows how in Dublin, while Dubliners born in Dublin provide 80 per cent of the unskilled workers and 75 per cent of all manual workers, they have less than half the higher-paid jobs.  In fact, over 60 per cent of managerial and executive jobs are held by people who were not born in Dublin and over 50 per cent of professional and administrative jobs, including the Civil Service, are held by people who were not born in Dublin.  The influx to Dublin is an influx of people coming in to take the top jobs to which the native Dubliners do not seem to have access.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to interpret these figures.  The explanation may lie partly in the fact that Dublin <Col N="654" /> people emigrate and there is evidence, I believe, that emigration from Dublin, gross emigration, the proportion of people growing up in Dublin who leave it, is much the same as in the rest of the country, rather surprisingly.  Is it the case that we have such a division in this country that the ordinary working people of Dublin are excluded from opportunities for self-advancement which are open only to people in the rest of the country and that they feel the need to leave and go elsewhere when they want to get on in life? There are a number of possible reasons and we should think about them very seriously.  I recommend the Minister to read this paper which has just come out.  Although it is on the question of social mobility rather than geographical mobility if one examines and thinks about it one begins to see a possible close relationship between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A possible reason for this mobility, this high emigration of Dublin people and failure to take up higher posts in Dublin, could be that everywhere people in the less well-off social groups who have had less opportunity for education find it difficult to rise to the top in their own environment.  It is not easy, I think, for the children of an agricultural labourer in rural Ireland to improve their position to the point where, perhaps, a farmer would allow his daughter to marry them.  There are very severe social distinctions in many parts of our country.  I believe that part of rural emigration, particularly of agricultural labourers and their families, and, perhaps, also small farmers is because people see no prospect of improving themselves in their own environment and they move elsewhere. Perhaps Dubliners feel the same thing, and even more acutely, but certainly the average Dublin working man cannot feel that it is easy for him to rise in his environment.  On the contrary, social differences are more marked in the city than in the country, more clear-cut.  At least, in the country people attend the same primary schools; in the cities, largely, they do not.  There is a much greater social division.  There is, perhaps, a force operating here which will have to be tackled at a very fundamental level, a <Col N="655" /> feeling among ordinary Dublin workers that if they want to get on they will not do so in Dublin and the rest of the country being to them <i>terra incognito</i> or alien territory, much less familiar than Coventry, say, or Birmingham, which they know about and in many cases have been to because there is a lot of traffic to and fro, they do not even think of looking for a job in the rest of Ireland and up to now there have not been any jobs there anyway, and they go to Britain.  This seems to be a very unsatisfactory and disturbing position.  It is, in fact, the position in which we are.</P>
    <P>This may also be reinforced by other factors.  Speaking as somebody who has grown up in Dublin&mdash; although, like most other Dubliners or at least half of the Dubliners according to the figures, my parents were from outside Dublin&mdash;I think that since the foundation of the State the cultural environment we have created is one to which the people of rural Ireland adapt fairly readily but to which the ordinary working people of Dublin do not.  It is much easier, in my opinion, for children in rural Ireland to accept and absorb the Irish language, which may have been part of their heritage and may, in some cases, have been their home tongue and in other cases the home tongue of parents and relatives, and the traditions and historical and cultural attitudes which they are taught.</P>
    <P>When the Dublin child reads history he is told that Dublin is the Pale, the alien part of Ireland which has always dominated the rest and whose people are always unwilling to participate in national movements, and so on.  He is taught to believe that he belongs to something that is not really a part of Ireland at all and that the real Irish people live somewhere else and he sees them running his country.  He sees them there because his ability to acquire the Irish language is much less, clearly, than that of children in rural areas.  He cannot, as a result, as easily get posts in the public service.  He cannot become a teacher.  We all know how dominantly our teaching force has been drawn from outside Dublin.  Until recently 85 <Col N="656" /> per cent of primary teachers came from seven counties in the west.  That means that the children of Dublin have been taught almost exclusively by teachers from quite a different social environment. That must have tended to alienate them from their environment. We may have a very fundamental problem here.  We have, in fact, got a community in Dublin who do not feel that they really belong to this country in some ways, who have not been treated as if they belong to this country, who have been treated as aliens and who, in a sense, have been colonised from outside Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are aliens. Were they not imported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There we are! I thought the feeling existed and Deputy Lenehan has, as usual, confirmed my view.  The attitude he expresses, if widely held, clearly must not encourage Dubliners to remain here if they want to get on in life and the fact that they would have problems in the Civil Service and in becoming teachers because of the language test imposed on them aggravates this position.  This is something we should look at.  The whole question of mobility within the country will be very difficult to achieve, if the people in Dublin whom you want to be mobile&mdash;because you do not want them to feel that they can get on only by leaving the country&mdash;are simply not prepared to go anywhere else because they feel they are aliens when they move anywhere else.</P>
      <P>These are just some thoughts provoked by this paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I would be very interested to see the results of the research which the Minister is trying to organise into the internal geographical mobility.  I would hope that this study will be carried out in sufficient depth to test out whether the kind of hypothesis which I have been outlining here has any validity.  This survey, if it is carried out, must necessarily be one concerning people's attitudes. I would hope that it will not simply be a study carried out at a very superficial level: &ldquo;Are you prepared to go to a job in Shannon?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Answer: &ldquo;No&rdquo;,&mdash;and then pass on to the next person, but that it will probe beneath the surface and look not only at the obvious and superficial reasons there might be for this unwillingness to move elsewhere and that it will try to see whether there are underlying cultural attitudes of the kind I have mentioned which may be dividing our country much more fundamentally than we have, perhaps, realised.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the Factories Act and the work of his Department which now covers this area.  I have been worried about these for a good while.  Some years ago an American company starting up here asked me to look at the factories Acts and to give them a memorandum stating what obligations they would incur if they started a factory and just what would they have to do.  I took on this task, with the assistance of someone else, fairly gaily.  It seemed very straightforward.  It was simply a matter of getting together the Factories Acts and orders made under them laying down what has to be done, making a list and sending it off.  I was sadly disillusioned.</P>
    <P>I discovered that there is an area of jurisprudence unknown to the law here and that the Factories Acts consist of two kinds of provisions, those which are enforced and those which are not.  As they are both supposed to be legally enforced, no lawyer can tell you what the law is.  You have to talk to trade union officials, to factory managers, to supervisors, to discover from the folklore what are the regulations which are enforced and what are not.  In fact, the report turned out to be extremely difficult.  There were things like having to hang a notice on the wall in English and Irish.  I discovered some evidence that there was a factory in Donegal where such a notice existed. No one had heard of one anywhere else.  Yet, the absence of such a notice involves a heavy fine, which has never been imposed.  I cannot recall the other instances but I found numerous instances of various aspects of these Acts which are not enforced.</P>
    <P>The justification given for this by those responsible was that in this kind of Acts what you try to do is to set a <Col N="658" /> high standard in the Act and then gradually press people to live up to it. I am not sure that we are right in this.  The law should be the law.  I do not think we should introduce a whole range of provisions which we do not enforce and leave it then to some kind of queer folklore to establish what is enforced and what is not.  It is certainly not my idea of how the law operates in other areas.  It is a mistake to operate it to such an extent in this particular area.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the Factories Acts again and to decide whether the provisions in them should be enforced. If they are not to be enforced, let us suspend them for the time being until we reach the point where we are sufficiently progressive to enforce them. If they should be enforced let us enforce them rigidly where the safety of people is concerned.  The whole thing is much too lackadaisical.  I would urge on the Minister to tighten it up and to carry out a special review of the Factories Acts to establish how far they are enforced and what action should be taken in regard to the aspects of these Acts which are not enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Educational Company case.  I am moving now to another and different sphere but an important one.  Deputy Desmond referred to it also and, I think, other speakers from the Labour benches. There was talk of the Government having agreed to bring in a Bill that would overturn the Educational Company decision.  I should like to be told more about this.  Where can I find out details of the agreement between the Government and the trade union movement?  Where is it published? The public interest is involved.  If any Government seek to enter into an agreement with any interest&mdash;even an interest as respectable, important and valuable as the trade union interest&mdash; to overturn a constitutional decision without amending the Constitution, the public interest requires that we should know about it.</P>
    <P>Can we be told what was proposed? By whom?  What is being done about it?  An issue of freedom is involved here, an issue of freedom which I regard as being of great importance. <Col N="659" /> While I have the greatest regard for the Labour Party and agree with them on many aspects of their policy, there is one area in which it seems to me they are in danger of betraying their trust, that is, when the interests of the trade unions&mdash;I would even say the vested interests of the trade unions&mdash; conflicts with principles of liberty and freedom.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have a vested interest in the closed shop.  It saves them a lot of trouble in getting their membership signed up.  Moreover, the employers very often feel that they have an interest in the closed shop.  It is so much easier to deal with one union rather than many unions.  It is so much easier to deal with an all-unionised labour force than with many unions.  Very often there is an identity of interest between employers and workers which is not necessarily in the public interest.  When one sees the Government getting in on the act also one begins to fear for individual freedom.  This is a real threat.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago I was an employee of a State company.  In my final year with that State company a wage round was conceded.  The trade unions asked that that wage round be withheld from anyone who was in arrears with union dues.  The management of that company conceded this without a second thought.  They did not seem to realise what they were doing.  They were, in fact, infringing the individual freedom of people and their right if they did not wish to be in an association of that kind to remain outside it.  There was a conspiracy between the company and the unions in that respect.  I will not suggest for a moment that that was why I left that company.  I left the company for quite different reasons.  Nevertheless, I protested strongly against it and I have always felt it a very dangerous principle.</P>
    <P>The Educational Company case was concerned with this closed shop matter. I would be most concerned that there should not be any conspiracy between any groups&mdash;Government, trade unions or anyone else&mdash;to undermine the Constitution on this point.  We are in a very unusual position in this country <Col N="660" /> because, where other countries have not got guarantees of individual liberty we have, in our Constitution. One of those guarantees is the right of free association and the right of non-association.  There may be circumstances of such gravity for the nation that those rights, like other rights, have to be taken away temporarily.  We all accept that in time of emergency many of our normal rights have to be removed.  We accept the Emergency Powers Acts and orders but, in the normal running of a country, there can be no excuse for taking away that type of Constitutional right.</P>
    <P>For my part I should like to know what is planned and plotted here.  I should like to go on record as being against it unless it can be shown that whatever action is proposed, does not undermine the Constitutional rights of individuals.  I would urge on the Labour Party to reconsider their position. If the Labour Party are ever to achieve anything&mdash;which many people doubt&mdash;they should not be simply the political arm of the trade unions.  They should stand for certain principles such as freedom and democracy and if even the trade unions offend against them the Labour Party should be prepared to stand up and be counted.  Maybe they will not do so.  Maybe we will be the only party in this House willing to stand up and be counted on this issue.  It would be a sad day if that were so and if we were deserted on this issue by the Labour Party simply because of the fortuitous fact of their trade union links.  In saying that, I hardly need to assure the House that I am not hostile to the trade union movement for which I have the highest regard and to which I think at all times great deference should be paid because they represent effectively virtually half our people.  Perhaps, we do not have enough regard for the trade union movement on many issues but when the issue of freedom arises, we have to look twice at what they propose.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the present economic situation which the Minister has raised in his speech.  I am not sure that the tone of his speech sufficiently reflected <Col N="661" /> what seems to me to be the gravity of our position, particularly in relation to the question of incomes.  I noted that when talking about incomes he spoke about an increase of over ten per cent this year in employee income. Of course, lots of figures are over ten per cent.  I think the figure is likely to be 13 per cent.  Some people suggest 12 per cent.  I should like to hear the Minister saying 13 per cent if it is 13 per cent and not hedging on the issue with &ldquo;over ten&rdquo;.  I may seem to be carping but there is too much playing down of our problems.</P>
    <P>We have had the Minister for Finance trying to persuade us here at Question Time that our external deficit this year will be only £55 million.  I have asked questions to which he has given certain incomplete answers, but those answers show that even if the whole of the improvement in net external receipts of the year was concentrated in the first nine months and there is no more to come, the deficit was between £54 million and £57 million, on his figure for the 12 months ended September.  That means he is assuming there will be no further deterioration in the position, that this rapid deterioration in our external balance will suddenly halt in the last three months of the year.  I do not think he has any grounds for making that assumption.  I may be wrong, but I am sticking my neck out and saying he is underestimating the gravity of our position. I think also that the Minister in talking vaguely about an increase in employees' income of over ten per cent is also playing the thing down too much. The situation has been building up for some time and it is now very critical.</P>
    <P>One of our problems is that people have cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; too often.  I remember back in 1959 when we had a perfectly reasonable wage round&mdash;I think it was the seventh or eighth&mdash;of seven or eight per cent, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, spoke in the gravest terms in this House about how serious the situation was, that the economy was being rocked to its foundations by this increase.  This was an increase, by the way, to cover a two-year period, following on a two-year period of relative stability.  He was <Col N="662" /> talking utter nonsense.  At the time he spoke we were at the beginning of a period of quite exceptional stability in prices.  For six successive years the average price increase was only two per cent per annum and that wage increase was not only in no way damaging but was necessary in order to spread incomes around, in order to increase spending and generate economic growth.  These warnings we have had in the past and which have so often turned out to be futile warnings, that things are going to become terribly bad and then they do not, have deadened our reactions, so that today when we face a real crisis and when we have the kind of situation we are facing with increases of 20 per cent over an 18-month period people have begun to feel the worst will never happen: &ldquo;We have been told for ten years it was going to happen and it has not happened, and there is nothing to worry about.&rdquo;  I fear that in the Government there is complacency, perhaps, a certain fatalism or a certain nervelessness, a feeling that if the situation is that bad it is out of control, anyway, so let us wait and see what happens, certainly no disposition to face the realities. There is both in the trade union movement and in industry deep concern at the failure of the Government, a failure apparent to them in discussions with the Government, to grasp the gravity of the situation and to show any signs of being prepared to take the kind of action needed to remedy it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say that, because if the Government do not face up to these problems on the income side particularly within a very short time, our position could become graver than anything we have known and our ability to sustain the value of the Irish pound in relation to sterling and other currencies could be undermined.  We are now near to that point and evidence for that can be found in the rapidity of the growth of imports in the last couple of years.  I have studied this recently and published the results of what I found.  What I found was that the increase in imports does not to any significant degree reflect the operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement that is yet to come.  What we are facing is the failure on our part to be competitive. <Col N="663" /> Either Irish industry is producing to capacity to such an extent that it cannot supply home demand and goods are being imported because we are not able to produce them ourselves, or we are producing goods which are uncompetitive and cannot be sold in competition with foreign goods even before the effects of free trade are felt.  The increase in the import content of Irish home consumption in the last 21 months has been of terrifying proportions and I see no sign that the Government are facing this reality.  Nothing like this has happened before in my recollection of the trends of trade in this country.</P>
    <P>The warning is there.  Our ability to survive in competition is now at risk. There seems to be a suggestion&mdash;either in the Minister's speech or Deputy Desmond's speech; they echoed one another in some of these points&mdash;that: &ldquo;Oh well, this round anyway will work out all right.  It is the one after this that will cause the trouble.&rdquo;  If one simply takes the view that this round will work out and requires no action, there will be a next round of such magnitude that we shall very soon find ourselves in an impossible position.</P>
    <P>Remember how the rounds have gone.  We had the seven to eight per cent rounds of the 1950s.  Then in the 1960s, starting in 1961, sparked off by one of the most irresponsible actions of an Irish Government in relation to the ESB strike in September, 1961, before the general election of that year, we had a jump to 12 per cent. Funnily enough, this 12 per cent figure has always been attached to the 1964 round, and there has been a general failure to appreciate that 12 per cent was the figure to which the rounds were jacked up not in 1964, but in 1961, as a direct consequence of the repeated interventions of the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in this dispute, forcing the ESB to raise the figure again and again to satisfy a demand that should not have been met at that time without some guarantee that it would not become applicable to the rest of industry as it did.  Therefore, it has been 12 <Col N="664" /> per cent since then in each round, but in between there is no stability; in between wages and salaries drift up so that this 12 per cent over two years becomes 16 per cent or 18 per cent over two years.  Rates of eight and nine per cent per annum are what we have been experiencing.</P>
    <P>Now we get a 20 per cent increase spread over 18 months or, perhaps, with luck, over two years, and as a result, when you take in the drift between rounds, the rate of increase of incomes is running at 12 to 13 per cent per annum.  That, as the Minister did point out, is about three times the rate at which output is growing, and that rate of inflation is something we cannot sustain.</P>
    <P>Over a period since 1961 people have been encouraged to jack up their claims, encouraged to feel that seven or eight per cent is not enough: &ldquo;go for 12 per cent; it will be all right,&rdquo; and when they go for 12 for a few years, it is then all right to go for 20 per cent.  Nobody does anything about it or seems to regard it as very serious. People who have been so conditioned, partly by Government action and partly by Government inaction&mdash;and partly by other factors, too; the Government are by no means alone to blame in this, but they are the responsible people&mdash;people who have been led to believe in this way that this can be accepted and will not do any harm, will not easily be brought back to reason.</P>
    <P>The discrepancy now between the increases being given and what we can afford is so great that I do not see how this can be bridged without a total change of attitude which would require a quality of leadership from the Government and a degree of credibility on the part of the Government which it has not got with the trade union movement, which it has lost over the years by its irresponsibility and inertia.  I am very worried as to how we can get out of this difficulty.  In a crisis like this there has to be somebody somewhere who will be believed and accepted, somebody whose views will carry weight, somebody who when he speaks ordinary people will say: &ldquo;Yes, this man is talking sense.  We have allowed <Col N="665" /> things to go too far,&rdquo; and who will in the next round not look for 20 per cent but will accept something like seven, eight or ten per cent over a two year period.  Who is going to carry that kind of conviction today?</P>
    <P>The authority of the Government has been undermined by inaction.  It is going to be very hard to bring people back to reason on this point.  I do not think anybody has the authority to do so; the Government have the power, but is it a power which the Government are prepared to exercise?  The trade union movement, although it may not say so publicly, has reached a point where it is terrified of what has been created by the divisions in its ranks and the failure of the Government to give a lead.  I think we have reached a point where the trade union movement, will be glad if the Government could get it off the hook.  It is not going to welcome, encourage, seek or even openly accept Government action, but behind the scenes trade unionists, who in reality know more about this problem than anybody else, have reached the point where their leaders would welcome some kind of Government action&mdash;action which they might formally protest against but which they would accept in the knowledge that if something is not done the living standards of our workers would be threatened and that large-scale unemployment would ensue in the deflation and devaluation which would follow if the present trend continues.  I do not think it is possible to emphasise too much the gravity of the situation.  The Minister will know I am not saying this for any political reasons.  What I am saying here is what I feel to be the case and I would urge on the Minister and the Government to grapple with the situation and not let it drift any longer.</P>
    <P>The Government have been re-elected with a clear majority, they have four years of power ahead of them.  If there was ever a time when a Government should act with courage and conviction it is now.  One can almost sympathise with a Government being a little reluctant to act before an election, but with four years of political &ldquo;stability&rdquo; ahead the Government <Col N="666" /> have a special duty and a special opportunity to tackle this problem in order that it will not go down in history as the Government which allowed our economy to founder and which allowed the stability of our currency to be undermined.</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead there is the whole problem of an incomes policy. It will take time to introduce an incomes policy.  An incomes policy cannot be produced to save the immediate situation, the Government are going to have to do something more drastic on their own account about this in order to prevent a further escalation and to get things under control, but beyond that they must look forward to some kind of incomes policy and they must show more understanding of what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the NIEC published its Report No. 11 setting out the principles of an incomes policy. <Col N="667" /> That document has the signatures and the support not merely of the Civil Service members but of the trade union members and the industrialist members of the council.  The document was in advance of its time in the sense that, although it secured their signatures and their support, it did not carry with it the moral support of industrialists and trade unionists as a whole. The industrialists and trade unionists who signed it were moving too far ahead of their colleagues.  It was a courageous if, perhaps, a foolhardy thing to do, but it did set a headline and, while those in industry and in the trade union movement stepped back from that because they were not ready for it, as time has passed and as the dangers of a situation in which there is no policy of this kind have become clear, opinion on both sides of industry has come around to the position adopted by the signatories to that report.</P>
      <P>There is now a climate of opinion on both sides of industry which would accept a step forward.  It is a pity the Government have not given more of a lead.  They have been pressed on a number of proposals contained in Report No. 11, particularly the proposals which affected non-wage incomes in respect of which an indication of intention to act would be required before one could reasonably expect the trade unions on behalf of the relatively weaker sections of the community&mdash;the wage-earners&mdash;to go along with an incomes policy, but the Government's action has been totally negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial thing about Report No. 11 was not that it expressed a number of what might be described as pious attitudes but that industrialists and trade unionists signed a document with a number of statements in it which committed them very far indeed on a number of points.  The industrialists accepted that we could not have a wages policy and that any policy must be extended to include incomes as a whole.  They accepted that there must be some method of controlling the incomes received by people after tax from dividends and investments and <Col N="668" /> that a restraint applied solely to wage incomes would be unacceptable&mdash;and, properly unacceptable, the document said&mdash;to wage-earners.  To get acceptance of that principle from industrialists was a great breakthrough.  The document also said that profit control was undesirable and unworkable and that was a great step forward, by the trade unions.  In fact, both sides went far enough in that document to provide the basis for a workable incomes policy if the matter had been followed up.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Government were right in not following it up straight away because both industrialists and trade unionists stepped back from the position which their leaders had adopted but, I think, the Government, having waited for a certain time for that reaction to subside, could then have taken action.  They did not.  On the contrary, they adopted a policy of the most negative character and when pressed refused to indicate any intention of taking any action whatever, or even of examining the possibility of taking action, in regard to non-wage incomes; as a result cynicism on the subject of an incomes policy by the trade unions was encouraged to develop and suspicion by the industrialists was also encouraged to develop. There was a real failure of leadership on the part of the Government here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the NIEC is examining this matter further with a view to producing more detailed and practical recommendations and that their Report will be before the Government in the near future. I hope this report&mdash;one which I think will carry much more solid support from both sides of industry because it has been drawn up by the NIEC whose members are now much more closely in contact, particularly on the industrial side, and much more responsive to the feelings of their members than the NIEC of four years ago &mdash;particularly in view of the dangerous situation the country now faces, will be given attention and action of the kind which Report No. 11 never received either at the time it was produced or since by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The combination of the present economic situation, on the one hand, and the appearance of this new document, on the other, provided the Government with a unique opportunity to do something constructive.  The Government will have to be prepared to take initiatives, something they are unaccustomed to.  This whole area of non-wage incomes must be tackled and the recommendations in that report about the publication of information on non-wage incomes and on profits will have to be dealt with, as well as recommendations about some form of taxation to ensure that non-wage incomes and the incomes received by people from non-wage sources after tax do not rise faster than wages.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a simple question.  Have the Government, in fact, studied this proposal? I can quite see the Government, having read Report No. 11, may have decided it was not opportune to act at that time but what I would like to know is, faced with a technical recommendation of great potential importance of a practical character, because, although much of Report No. 11 is in generalities, this was a practical, specific proposal, did they establish any working group or interdepartmental committee or ask any expert to examine it?  Have they got a document before them which says whether or not such a system of taxing non-wage incomes in a fluctuating manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to maintain a greater growth in non-wage incomes similar to the greater growth in wage incomes?  Have the Government carried out such a study?  We are entitled to know that.  Indeed, the answer to it will tell us a good deal about the seriousness of the Government and about their ability to tackle this kind of situation.  It would be rather terrifying if four years after this recommendation were produced the Government had to come into this House and say that in starting now to <Col N="670" /> do something about an incomes policy, it would have to look at the question of whether this proposal is practical when there have been four years in which to examine it and test its workability. I hope I am wrong in my suspicion that such a study has not been carried out.  I hope the Minister can assure me it has been carried out, and when the NIEC Report is received the Government will not be inhibited from proceeding to try to bring the parties concerned together to work out an incomes policy by the fact that it had not done its own homework and did not know whether control of non-wage incomes through this mechanism was practical.</P>
      <P>The dividends equalisation tax proposed, I may point out, by Fine Gael first in the <i>Just Society</i> policy in 1965 and subsequently adopted by the NIEC later that year is something which may not be easy to work but the future of this country may largely depend on it.  I do not think you are going to get the trade union movement accepting control of wages unless other incomes are controlled and I do not think that any control of other incomes by controlling prices or profits is workable or anything other than damaging and dangerous for this country</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister's recollection when he uses those words is correct but, nevertheless, I will check and see what the context is.  I shall read the relevant paragraph of the NIEC Report No. 11.  The previous two paragraphs dealt with the question of profit control and price control.  It is pointed out that the level of profits cannot be pre-determined and even if the control of profits were desirable, and this is not the case where they are earned competitively, for example, for exporting, such control could be operated in advance but only in arrears after the profits had been earned.  It goes on to talk of price surveillance but not price control and, having done so, it goes on to say at paragraph 60:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since profits are by their nature a residual, the measures outlined in <Col N="672" /> the previous paragraph may not suffice to bring about an acceptable distribution of purchasing power between those whose incomes come from profits and other groups within the community.  If this occurs, then these measures must be supplemented by tax or other measures to ensure that the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax purchasing power derived from investment is no higher than the rate of increase in aggregate post-tax wages, salaries and other incomes.  A number of measures which might be effective for this purpose already exist in other countries and their application in Irish conditions should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  It says the methods adopted elsewhere should be considered but those measures must be supplemented by tax or other measures.  If the measures outlined in the previous paragraph are not sufficient to bring about an acceptable future purchasing power&mdash;and it is quite evident that those measures are not&mdash;in those circumstances the Government have failed to investigate the proposals put here in such extraordinarily strong terms and have been very negligent in their duty.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy now as I will deal with it again but it is not put in strong terms.  It is being investigated right now.  You can see the difficulties immediately. Where they say you cannot or should not control profits and ask you to control incomes arising out of profits, it is not just so easy.  There are a thousand and one other factors and the Deputy knows them all.</P>

Of course, it is not easy but the whole point&mdash;it is made clear here&mdash;is that you will be faced with a position in which the trade <Col N="673" /> unions will not accept any kind of wage control which is not supplemented and accompanied by control of other kinds of incomes.  It is made clear that the alternatives of profit control are undesirable and ineffective.</P>

      <P>It was a positive attitude for an incomes policy and it does not behove the Minister to try to play it down or water it down or in any way to throw cold water on it.  This was a great step forward and one which could make it possible for this Government to solve our economic problems, the problems of this time.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is a negative one; it is a continuation of the negative attitude which the Government have shown, the lack of any lead they might have given and it may leave us in a serious position within 12 months.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the question of equal pay for equal work, and here I support Deputy Desmond.  I should like to add another dimension.  Equal pay is justified in its own right as a matter of social justice but here there has been a strong case for this.  The reason is that this country and Britain have large differentials between male and female pay compared to other countries in Europe.  Secondly, in Ireland the labour balance is such that we have something approaching full employment for women but far from full employment for men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment between 10,000 and 15,000 men emigrate each year because they cannot get jobs.  They are accompanied or followed by an equivalent proportion of women.  It is quite clear to anyone who looks at the emigration statistics that the emigration of women balances with the emigration of men. They will not remain in this country when the men have left.  There is a sub-conscious realisation by the single women that their marriage prospects are not good&mdash;they become readily aware that the social conditions in <Col N="675" /> which they live are such that they are unlikely to get married.  Therefore, there is a corresponding number of single women leaving the country a short period after the men have emigrated.</P>
    <P>In the present situation there is not equal pay.  As a result, women displace men in jobs, and then we have the position that some time afterwards the women emigrate and we find we have not one person leaving the country but two people.  If it were possible, by having equal pay, to restore the balance, to eliminate this artificially cheap cost of female labour so that employers would employ men in certain cases rather than women, with the realisation that with the employment of men there would be a longer turnover of labour because men would be prepared to stay in their jobs for longer periods, we might be able to end this lunatic state where men have to emigrate, where they are followed by single women, and married women have to take their jobs.</P>
    <P>We have created an artificial wage structure which is not only unjust but is economically undesirable&mdash;the situation in which we encourage men and single women to emigrate, and whose jobs are taken by married women.  We have been too hostile to the idea of married women at work.  I am not proposing it, but we should not create an artificial situation in which ultimately men and single women are replaced by married women.  For economic and social reasons, running far beyond the question of social justice, the movement towards equal pay for equal work is desirable.  That principle has been endorsed by Fine Gael.  We do not ask for a move towards equal pay in one sudden dash but over a certain period of years.  This we will have to do if we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>On the question of married women working, although I do not see any advantage in their replacing men, which is the net product of our policy so far, there will be a greater demand in the future for married women to work to supplement incomes.  We have gone far from the policy of not allowing married women to teach, for instance.  I agree <Col N="676" /> with Deputy Desmond on this matter. We should reconsider public policies which, for example, prevented married women from leaving their children in crèches.  These stringent policies to prevent married women working involve too much interference with people's wishes and rights.  We adopted negative policies.  I shall not develop the question of married women and taxation but I should like to add my support to what others have said in regard to a reform in this respect.</P>
    <P>I referred to the EEC in this context. EEC membership would affect the policies we adopt in the Department of Labour.  There are other aspects, too, which will affect us because although it is only in respect of equal pay for equal work that the EEC have mandatory provisions, there is a tendency there towards an upward movement in social benefits, towards bringing different schemes in line one with the other.  I know that work will have been done in this matter within the Government services here, but I hope that we will be completely ready for its adoption.  In the EEC their systems are very different from ours.  For instance, their social welfare systems demand that much more be paid by the employers than by the State and the workers.  If we are to follow this and impose more of the cost on the employer rather than the State it will increase labour costs and it will provide a still further argument in favour of working towards an incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the question of annual holidays.  It has always struck me that we have made little progress towards longer annual holidays, although this is one of the chief social benefits as compared with shorter working hours.  The addition of one week of extra holidays would add only two per cent to labour costs.  On the other hand, the shortening of the working week from 42½ hours to 40 hours would add five per cent to labour costs if there is no extra increase because of people working overtime&mdash;say 2½ hours at time and a half.</P>

      <P>Did I say &ldquo;working day&rdquo;?  I am sorry if I misled Deputies. I was referring to the working week. An hour off the working week is almost equivalent to an extra week's holidays and it seems that if given the choice most people would choose the extra week's holidays.  Therefore, we should not assume top priority for the shorter working week.  Too much priority is being given to that.  Shorter hours are not of such vital importance, and when we get the 40-hour week I hope that we will not start pressing immediately for a 37-hour week or something like that but that we will seek generous holidays&mdash;holidays of four weeks or so.  The length of holidays is very important.  We are completely out of line on this and we have no idea of what holidays workers in other parts of the world enjoy.  The trade unions have been much too conservative in seeking longer holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an alternative, I suppose.  I should like to make one final point on a broad issue&mdash;the question of participation in industrial democracy.  It is appropriate to this debate that some reference should be made to it.  The Government should begin to direct their attention to this matter.  It is a matter to which my party have given a good deal of consideration. Earlier this year, we produced a policy of importance on industrial relations.  A lot of thought <Col N="678" /> was given to the policy and it received very careful debate within the party to ensure that anything proposed would be practicable and broadly acceptable not only to workers but to management.</P>
      <P>We found it possible to propose and to secure unanimity in our party for a proposal which involved a number of important developments, each of them small in its own way because they are only beginnings but developments that would add up to an important experiment.</P>
      <P>Firstly, we said that we would make provision in public enterprise and large firms for worker councils elected by the workers to meet management periodically to discuss matters of mutual interest.  We said that this reform should be introduced in the first place in State sponsored bodies so that a study of these innovations could prove their effectiveness and suitability in large companies in the private sector.  We said we would encourage this in the private sector by way of grants to meet expenses for such an innovation.  That would be an important step.  We also endorsed completely the proposals in paragraphs 57 to 61 of the NIEC report, No. 11, with regard to the publication of information on profits and salaries which we consider to be a must in order to gain and hold the confidence of workers because if this information is not disclosed it will be impossible to gain this confidence.</P>
      <P>We also said that we would make immediate provision for the representation of workers on the boards of State enterprises, representatives who would be democratically elected by the workers and we said that the trade unions with the help of employers should train youths in the schools in the responsibilities of directorship.  I know this would present a problem but I am sure it is a problem that could be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said that workers' representation in State companies should be extended gradually to the private sector.  We said that in State companies there is an alternative to do what is done, for example, in Germany where there are supervisory boards of part-time directors having the right to review a <Col N="679" /> report of working directors.  We also reiterated the policy we announced in 1965 of encouraging profit sharing by introducing tax incentives for any profit sharing schemes.  None of these proposals are panaceas.  Each one is a small step only but they are proposals that were taken with regard and caution because we must bring the whole people, including industry, with us.  The four together would mean a significant break through in four important areas the end of which we cannot easily see because I am convinced that by the end of this century there will have been a revolution in the whole system of ownership and control of industry&mdash;a revolution which will be accomplished peacefully and which will have the support and enthusiasm of management of companies; a revolution which will eventually have the acceptance of those who own the shares.</P>
    <P>We are about to start not only in Ireland but in the world generally on a general movement to a completely new kind of independent society.  These are not new revolutionary ideas although they may seem so in the conservative Irish context.  Workers' representation boards have existed in Germany since 1920 and Germany is often regarded as an extremely conservative country.  Last year, in France, that not exactly left-wing gentleman, General de Gaulle, announced changes of this kind.</P>
    <P>I commend the proposals of my party on this matter to the Minister because these proposals can lead to a transformation of the entire area of worker co-operation in the years ahead. The present situation in industry is really one which was brought about by an historical accident because as companies grew a situation developed whereby the ownership of companies is vested in the hands of people who, in fact, have no power, except in very extreme cases, to influence the running of the company of which they are shareholders.</P>
    <P>We all know that company shareholders have virtually no power unless the company is being liquidated.  Technically and legally they are the owners of the company but they cannot exercise <Col N="680" /> the responsibilities of ownership. When I was at school I was taught the responsibilities and duties of ownership as well as being taught the rights of ownership.  The social encyclicals of the various Popes had reached that stage &mdash;they have gone a lot further since&mdash; but as the years have gone by it seems to me that there is no moral justification for a form of ownership in which one cannot exercise the responsibilities of ownership.  I find it difficult to justify in conscience as a Christian a situation in which the owners of shares in a firm have no way of knowing if the workers are being properly paid or if the duties that they as shareholders should be carrying out are being carried out.</P>
    <P>If it is not possible any longer because of the size of ownership in large firms to exercise the responsibilities of ownership then the rights of ownership must be diminished correspondingly. These shareholders, while lending money to the firm, are not allowed exercise their rights as owners but are paid the whole of the surplus income, whereas the workers who do not lend money to the firm but who lend to it by giving their labour have no right to any part of the surplus income.</P>
    <P>If we were to start again from scratch we would never set up a structure in which all the rights of ownership are vested in those who lend money to the firm.  A balance must be restored.  We must create a situation in which the workers, including managers and supervisors who are responsible for results achieved by a company, have a corresponding share in the ownership of the company which is now exercised theoretically by the shareholders only.  In fact, what we have at the moment is a power vacuum. The shareholders no longer have power, the workers have not secured their rights in the industry and there is left a management in the middle which is not subject to any kind of proper control.  That sort of situation is one which, as any democratic parliamentarian can see, is wrong.  Anything we do in this direction must be done with the consent of workers on the one hand and with the consent of managements and shareholders of firms on the other hand.  It must be a <Col N="681" /> gradual process.  It is no good trying to change radically or drastically in a manner which will disturb confidence and destroy all that has been built up. It is easy to destroy but it is not so easy to build.  We must make a start along the lines set out in the Fine Gael policy.  Our eyes must be on the future, and it may be a fairly distant future, when the capital structure which has been so frequently condemned&mdash;a thing we like to forget&mdash;by successive Popes will have been replaced by a system in which capital and labour both share in the rights, duties and fruits of ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most of the speakers who have risen on this Vote I want to compliment the Minister, although it is not a duty which devolves on me, on the very fine brief he prepared for us.  I should like also to compliment his Department on the thorough fashion in which they have told us about what they have been doing and of the hopes of the Department for the future.  This does not mean that I approve of all the Minister has said.  It does mean it is a considerable pleasure to read through a job of work so thoroughly done.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention one other matter about the Department. People concerned with this Department have taken their time before deciding on their present line of action. This is something I also approve of. I am tired of people barging ahead with schemes, acting first and thinking afterwards, and then finding themselves in grave trouble because their plans will not work.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dr. Hillery, deserves a good deal of credit for this, because the Minister is relatively new to this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to go systematically through the brief in the order, roughly speaking, in which the Minister read it out to me.  I am extremely doubtful as to the real value for money which we get from the IMI.  If the present Government have one fault more than another it is their feeling that by establishing institutes they deal with problems.  Certain of these organisations which have been established are quite all right, for example, <Col N="682" /> AnCO and CERT to name two the Minister mentioned.  I also agree very heartily with the expenditure in relation to the service for intending emigrants. I regret that previous Governments did not show more guts in relation to such expenditure.  The amount of money provided for that service is not adequate.  It would require a good deal more money to do an efficient job.</P>
    <P>I agree with the industrial training provision.  I think that the huge increase of half a million pounds this year is, perhaps, going a bit too fast and that the Department may fall into this trap of going too fast, which has been so manifest on occasions in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the maintenance settlement was the cause of much trouble and was the end of something.  Personally, I do not think it was the end of anything.  It is a fact that the great bulk of ordinary manual workers have still to receive their status increases.  All they have got so far in that direction is the increase in family allowances, which they got this year.  Perhaps I might give myself a mild pat on the back because I was responsible for the first group of lowly-paid workers getting a status increase in this country.  These were the ESB station workers who got an increase in May of last year.  These lowly-paid workers are as much entitled to a status increase as any other group in the community.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about the cost-of-living index and in the brief there is the statement that wage increases have followed the cost-of-living index.  A representative of employers told me some months ago that it is no use mentioning the cost-of-living index in wage and salary negotiations now.  He said that in negotiations on behalf of the workers, whether wage or salary workers, they do not bother with it at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. FitzGerald seems to think that everything stems from income which, being translated, means wages.  Personally, I think an obvious blunder was made this time 12-months ago when the so-called mini-Budget was introduced.  If the figures of the <Col N="683" /> Central Statistics Office be correct, and I do not think they were correct, the cost of living went up by only five per cent between November, 1967, when sterling was devalued and November, 1968.  It is obvious that the mini-Budget was a grave error because the new index prepared by the Central Statistics Office showed that the cost of living went up by 1.1 per cent a month between November, 1968, and February, 1969, and that was before there was any effect of the maintenance strike, if there was any effect of the maintenance strike on the economy at all.  The Central Bank <i>Quarterly Journal</i> for November, 1968, stated that the effects of devalution were over by the spring of 1968.  The devaluation of 14 per cent occurred in November, 1967, and it is said that the effects of it were over by the spring of 1968.  That is also a piece of nonsense. The Taoiseach answered a Parliamentary Question and referred to the belated effects of devaluation.</P>
    <P>I think this jargon is all wrong.  If there is 14 per cent devaluation it takes at least a couple of years for the effects of such devaluation to go through the economy in any country. This whole jargon, with somebody writing nice phrases about it, has nothing to do with the realities of the situation.  I was extremely interested recently to read in a serious journal in Britain that figures produced as a result of research showed that since 1934 all the workers in Britain have got in real increases in their wages is exactly equivalent to the increase in the economy generally.  One would gather that they have got a good deal more.  The year 1934 was not a particularly prosperous period for England.  The devaluation of sterling occurred in September, 1931.  By 1934 Britain was more on her feet than most of the countries of the world. She had got over the famous world economic crisis of 1929-1932 quicker and better than most other countries in the world, and certainly much faster than the United States.  It is remarkable that these figures should come out of a serious survey.</P>
    <P>I come now to what the Minister <Col N="684" /> calls the manpower service.  This is a very tricky business and not nearly as simple as Deputy Dr. FitzGerald thinks.  It is a difficult and awkward business.  I was glad to see the Minister's statement at the bottom of page nine of his brief.  I agree with him on this where he says:</P>
    <P>Later on I will be dealing with the question of manpower surveys. These, while useful in certain ways, do not meet the needs of manpower policy, for the reason that they deal with the situation at a point of time, while the labour supply and demand position is changing from month to month.</P>
    <P>I saw a programme on television one night on which somebody very like Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was talking about how he would plan our manpower and how many carpenters, blacksmiths and so on we would want. The interviewer turned to the head of Bolton Street technical school who was one of the team and said: &ldquo;How many pupils have you leaving Bolton Street in June?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;300.&rdquo; The interviewer then said: &ldquo;What are they going to do?&rdquo; The reply was: &ldquo;I have not got the foggiest idea.&rdquo;  If he could not tell a few months beforehand what they were going to do, how can one possibly plan manpower for years ahead?  One knows when it is short. We hear now that qualified technical workers are in short supply but if you start planning it you might find yourself with many more than were required for the market.</P>
    <P>I have learned two interesting things about this problem.  One came from Dr. van der Ley who used to look after our alcohol factories.  He told me that Irishmen came back each year for the comparatively short period that these factories worked.  Again, when the Verolme Dockyard was started in Cork it was extraordinary how Irishmen came for nearly every job that was in that shipyard.  They came not just from Belfast but from all over the world.</P>
    <P>I consider the Minister's proposals on page 10 extremely sensible.  He says:</P>
    <P>What I am planning to establish is a manpower service which can provide, <Col N="685" /> on the local, regional and national levels, up to the minute information about labour availabilities....</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing that can be done and not a great deal more.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the employment exchanges will be improved and the Minister shows excellent judgment in his attitude towards manpower surveys. What is really wanted in this country today is not manpower management but money management.  When the Government have fixed up their monetary policy properly if they ever do get around to doing that it will then be possible to fix up a manpower policy but not until then.</P>
    <P>Everybody who spoke welcomed the establishment of a register of private employment agencies and everybody spoke in favour of equal pay for men and women doing the same work.  In this connection I always think of 1967 when the women workers in the garment industry in this city got an increase of 7/- a week, twopence an hour. That might be considered good or bad but what happened to it?  1/10d of it went on income tax for the average woman, there was an increase of 10d on the insurance stamp and bus fares went up by about 3d or 4d a day, leaving the unfortunate women workers with an increase of about 2/6d to 3/- to meet a very substantial rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the NIEC Report and here I have to tell a story.  I used this report with my graduating class, the honours class in UCD when it first came out.  I used it in a seminar.  The students came to me in groups of five or six and there were about 35 students altogether.  Out of these six groups&mdash; and everybody knows how students can disagree and differ&mdash;only one student said, after they had read and studied it, that a national incomes policy as set out in Report No. 11 of the NIEC was feasible or possible here.  Yet we had Deputy Dr. FitzGerald talking about it for 20 minutes and the more he was harried in the House the more verbose he became about it.  It is just complete nonsense.  How can you have an incomes policy here?  They are <Col N="686" /> giving it up in Britain where 85 per cent of the people are on wages and salaries.  How can we have it here where 40 per cent of our people are farmers and probably another five per cent small shopkeepers?  I mean no reflection on farmers in what I am about to say.  My people were always farmers and I was in charge of a farm for a while.  The farmers will agree with you so long as you are subsidising them, so long as you have price supports, so long as you are pushing them up, but come the day when you want to put a levy on exports of cattle and you know what the farmers will tell you.  Supposing the price of cattle goes very high and the Government want to levy an export tax on cattle&mdash;and this is the kind of thing an incomes policy means&mdash;every Deputy knows what the farmers will say.  That is the practical application of an incomes policy, the reality of the blooming situation.  The whole thing is nonsense and apart from anything else it is extremely doubtful if some of the people who signed that report ever read it.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of full employment.  The Minister was gentle about the subject.  Deputy Seán Moore was not quite so wise.  I do not think I will be in this House when that famous year 1980 comes along.</P>
    <P>I see one great objection to the operations of NIEC.  There are roughly 30 people on it and they have now produced about 25 unanimous reports. There is no such reality as that.  If men are in earnest and if they sit down and do their work they cannot possibly agree on 25 reports.  It could not possibly happen.</P>
    <P>There was one subject to which I was sorry the Minister did not devote even a little attention.  That is the question of the minimum wage.  The largest trade union in the country is very interested in this subject.  The late John Conroy started talking about it two or three years ago.  At that time he was talking about a minimum wage of £12 10s a week.  It sounded excellent then but the figure mentioned now is of a different order&mdash;£15 a week. Many people would say that this is the absolute minimum that should be paid to anybody in this city today having <Col N="687" /> regard to the cost of living here.  Food, clothing and transport are as dear in this city as they are in New York city and wages in New York are in the region of £60 a week.  There are still people in Deputy Dowling's constituency, which is also the constituency I have the honour to represent, on £11 to £13 a week, male adult workers, men with families.  I agree with the Minister about a cooling-off period for disputes but if the dispute is about wages I do not think it is any good because I did learn something during my five difficult years as chairman of the ESB tribunal.  I did learn that it takes a long time for a wages situation to boil up into a strike but that once it has boiled up to that extent no power on earth can stop the strike.  But, generally speaking, I would agree with the Minister that in other disputes a cooling-off period would be extremely useful.  I was glad to see the reference to the ILO.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  It is certainly a good idea. About the ILO, there is no doubt that men from this country did play a part in the ILO but I was rather disappointed when the Minister mentioned Mr. E.J. Phelan and did not mention Mr. P.J. Mortished.  I hope it was not because Mr. Mortished had a close connection with the Labour Party that he was left out.  I do not think it was but he was left out and he was a very senior official in the International Labour Office.</P>
      <P>The question is asked, why have we ratified so few of the conventions? The obvious reason is that we keep in step with Britain.  If this is so, we will shortly be ratifying the 21-year-old convention of equal pay for men and women doing the same work because the British are going to ratify it very shortly.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Government really think that it is a progressive step on our part to endow these fellowships at Turin.  We have heard in this country a great deal about General de Gaulle, the long-nosed Frenchman, mostly through the English newspapers, and were inclined to see him through the English newspapers but France was the country which treated foreign students best of all.  All you had to do once you had a BA or BSc degree&mdash;it did not matter whether pass or honours&mdash;was to take it over to any university in France except the Sorbonne and there was an office in each of these universities and you immediately got a grant.  It was not very much but it was enough to live on very abstemiously.  This is a very good reason for offering these fellowships at Turin.</P>
      <P>As regards page 31 of the Minister's speech, I could not quite follow what is the meaning of &ldquo;each of the main aspects of employment conditions&rdquo; which the Minister says that he proposes to deal with in a separate Act. Is the proposed Hours of Work Act one of them and is the &ldquo;Notice of Permanent Employment Act&rdquo;, if there be such an Act, another?  This is the only explanation I can see of it.</P>
      <P>Here is where I really disagree with the Minister: I believe that the settlement of the maintenance dispute did not become a pivotal factor in the growth of incomes.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the lowest paid workers were going to get their status increase the same as all the better paid workers had got.  The cost of living had been rising at the rate of 1.1 per month in the previous three months.  How about that as the compulsive factor in the growth of incomes?</P>
      <P>There is an inference in the rest of that page 37 of the Minister's brief, that the losses which were incurred, and so on, arising from the strike put up prices.  Surely, that is contrary to good economic theory, unlike the economic theory we heard from Dr. FitzGerald during the last 1½ hours? Surely, it is the case that that kind of loss would cause prices to go down?</P>

      <P>I now want to say a few words about the Labour Court.  I think that some of its activities have not been too helpful on occasions.  Increasing membership and the numbers of public service matters and the centralisation of all these matters in one place&mdash;I have never been convinced that this improves things, that there is a great improvement by having a vast organisation with a big number of people in it, but I was glad to see that the Minister says that it will probably be some time before these appointments are necessary.  He did also say later on in his brief that unless things improve with relation to the rejection of recommendations the Labour Court would end up by being comparatively useless.  Certainly, its present position does not compare with what its position was in the period from 1946 to 1952 or 1953.  I do not know whether it is that the particular men who were there at the time, men like Mr. John Ingram and the late Dan Sullivan, were better or had longer experience, or what.  It may be just a gradual erosion of its position in relation to an awkward situation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour is certainly showing a very good example to other Departments by its continuing consultation with employers' and employees' organisations.  I have noticed that it seldom gets tangled up with them.  Its interest in trade union amalgamation is also commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the objective of setting up institutions and procedures to enable the parties concerned in industrial disputes to reach their own decisions. <Col N="690" /> This is much better than any court or any tribunal of any sort.  I have no great faith in the industrial relations service that was formerly called a conciliation service.  I had some experience of watching it operate for long periods in certain cases and it seemed to take a long time to get anywhere.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked very sensibly about it being possible that the court would become a stage in the bargaining process.  If, in fact, it does become a stage in the bargaining process, the court can blame itself in part.  This particular chicken did not take long in coming home to roost on the shoulders of the court itself but the Minister all the time shows his goodwill by his remarks on how improvement might be secured.</P>
      <P>On the question of the status increase for lower paid workers, what has interested me continuously in this is that the minute you get any suggestion that the lowest paid workers should as a whole be paid an equivalent increase to other people the whole establishment starts squawking and everybody knows whom I mean by the establishment&mdash;I mean the bankers, the Ministers who speak for any Government, generally, the whole set-up, the chief industrialists, and so on.</P>

      <P>On the question of wages and salaries the Government have, I think, shown an extremely bad example.  I went to the trouble some months ago of calculating what the increase in their own expenditure has been during the past three years and I found that their expenditure over the past three years has risen at the rate of 16? per cent per year.  That is to say it has risen by 50 per cent in three years.  The best that was claimed for the growth in the economy was four to five per cent.  I do not know where Deputy Dr. FitzGerald got his figures; he talked about incomes rising at three times the rate of growth in the economy&mdash;he said 12 per cent&mdash;but I have no difficulty in finding the Government's figures.  They are published in the Estimates volume and one can be quite certain about them.  Government income has, of course, to be got from somewhere&mdash;by taxation, by borrowing, or by inflating the currency, writing it up in the banks' books as was done recently.  These are the three ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the way the Government's own expenditure is going.  If I build myself too big a house it will be known as &ldquo;John O'Donovan's Folly&rdquo; because I may reach the stage at which I will be unable to put a roof on it.  Because things were husbanded as carefully as they were for a long period, the State has immense financial strength compared with John O'Donovan but, if the State increase expenditure at the rate of 16? per cent per year, then it will be caught up on within a measurable period.  That is why Deputy Dr. FitzGerald had some justification for the point he put; if this continues our currency will be devalued in terms of sterling.  I am aware that this was a matter for serious discussion inside the Department of Finance at the beginning of this year.  That was, I suppose, before they cut the £40 million off the Estimates, the £40 million about which we heard so much.  I did not <Col N="692" /> hear this from any contact I have with the Department of Finance.  I have had no contact with anybody in the Department for years, but I was told it. The reason for that discussion was something which had been boasted about&mdash;the Department had gone in for development, and so on.  I saw that as an abandonment of its true function.  The true function of the Department of Finance is to keep Government expenditure within limits.  That is its true function and, unless it gets back and unless it is given the power to perform that function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me put it this way: I would not give that function to people without good judgment.  I would have as Minister for Finance the man with the best judgment.  There is a serious error in the figures that are so frequently put before us.  A growth rate of 16 per cent in Government expenditure should mean a growth rate in the community of six per cent.  At the moment Government expenditure is 40 per cent of GNP.  Now I do not think much of GNP as an idea but, if we want to make the calculation, then let us make it.  Government expenditure is now 40 per cent of GNP.  If it goes up by 16 per cent per year then GNP should go up by six per cent per year.  If, in fact, it goes up by only four per cent the country is going backwards.</P>

      <P>Part of the Minister's brief&mdash;this is not a personal criticism now&mdash;seemed to me to be an attempt to put the blame on the workers who are, in fact, much more highly taxed in real terms than they were ten years ago.  I admit that the particular line of argument I have been pursuing is not easy to follow. In this business of wandering from <Col N="693" /> arithmetical terms to real terms I constantly find myself wanting to kick myself to make me remember which real terms are real terms.  Real terms are there but very often they have not got much to do with arithmetic.</P>
      <P>The Minister paid a well deserved tribute to the trade unions for not allowing their political allegiance to interfere with their economic duty last spring prior to the general election. Mark you, there is no reason to expect the trade unions to be so self-denying in the coming months as the agreements run out.  Trade unions are responsible to their members just as Deputies, who run around as messenger boys, are responsible to their constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard a good deal in the High Court about how much the Deputy does in the west for his constituents.  One notable omission in the Minister's speech is the complete absence of any reference to this minimum wage legislation.  One method of dealing with a situation in a period of almost galloping inflation would be to say: &ldquo;Right.  We will have a minimum wage.&rdquo;  The reason why there was no reference is that inflation in this country still has many friends.  In recent times a powerful group of new friends has appeared with interest rates at nine to ten per cent.  The commercial banks have at long last come down strongly in favour of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about the agreement, as if it were a great achievement; public servants were to get three to four per cent this year.  There is an important difference between public servants and those in other organisations. In the first year of an increase public servants do not pay any income tax on it.  They have the benefit of the full increase for the first year.  The rest of the community are subject to PAYE.  If the increase is nine per cent public servants get the full nine per cent; the others get 6½ per cent.  We are all expected to be guided by the public service.  At least we are told so in the universities by those who <Col N="694" /> run them.  This agreement, which the Minister claims as some kind of achievement, runs until 31st March next.  If the rest of the community get three to four per cent&mdash;I am talking about the salaried sections and it is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;the increase will be of the order of two to three per cent only.  The rest of us will be very lucky, indeed, if we get that increase by the time the four per cent runs out for the public servants.</P>
    <P>Let me come back for a moment to the general question of the balance of payments.  I repeat what I said that the cost of living was stated by the Central Statistics Office to go up from November, 1967, to November, 1968, be of the order of two to three per on this&mdash;I do not know by what instinct &mdash;during the summer of 1968.  I had a friend a grocer and I constantly called in to see him during that summer.  He regularly went around his shop and pointed out &ldquo;This went up&rdquo;, &ldquo;That went up&rdquo;, and so on.  Yet, the Central Statistics Office came out with this ludicrous figure.  Why?</P>
    <P>There was a devaluation of 14 per cent in November, 1967.  According to the Central Statistics Office, import prices went up by 11 per cent in the year 1968 and export prices went up by ten per cent.  I should like to know how any sensible man could reconcile these figures.  As it happened, the Central Statistics Office wrote to me about another matter and I wrote them a very serious letter about this but I got no reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they had no answer that would hold water. That is why I got no reply.  How much of the balance of payments difficulties is due to expenditure by manual workers? I use the evidence of my eyes on this.  The evidence of my eyes tells me that it is next to nothing: it is the only evidence I can use.  Yet, these are the men who are preached at, as if they alone were responsible for it.</P>

      <P>One final point, if I may pinprick the Minister.  I want to <Col N="695" /> take some words from the Old Testament&mdash;not, I understand, the new version, but the old version, in reference to this part of the Minister's speech: &ldquo;The voice is the voice of Jacob but the hands are the hands of Esau&rdquo;. If I might be allowed to say this: the brief is the brief of Joseph but the voice is the voice of Charles.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald talked with two voices about redundancy arising from free trade.  I am convinced that both the Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain and any question of our entry into the Common Market are deleterious in the extreme to this country. If, by any accident, we should enter into the Common Market and there are not serious results for our light industries in this country, then I know nothing about economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy FitzGerald, I am now 60 years of age and I have been studying them since I was 18 and, I may say, I studied serious economics, not arithmetical economics.  I might say this about warnings. The Minister made a serious point about our exports&mdash;that we might be priced out of foreign markets. Again, this is not reality because, on the whole, our exports have no wage content.  I do not say they have not a labour content.  If the Minister himself examines our exports with care&mdash; let him not mind what Department of Finance officials tell the Government&mdash; he will notice with surprise when live cattle, live animals and meat are taken out of them, how many other products are secondhand motor cars, oddments of petrol, and so on.  The Minister will find that the great bulk of our exports has little or no wage content.  Therefore there is no use in preaching to us that we shall stand ourselves upside down if wages are raised to meet the cost of living in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald talked about the effects of incomes.  What brought about one of the most remarkable periods of prosperity in the United States?  It was <Col N="696" /> Walter Reuter's agreement for his automobile workers with the Ford Motor Company.  The United States kept inflation to one per cent until it was taken over by the efforts to reach the moon and the war in Vietnam, one worse than the other, I suppose.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald asked the question. I shall answer it for him.  He asked: &ldquo;To whom will the people listen?&rdquo; The man they will listen to will not be a garrulous person.  He will not be getting up in this House and talking on every subject that comes before it.  Whoever the person will be who will be listened to by the people&mdash;if this matter becomes so serious that it has to be attended to&mdash; I guarantee that he will not be a garrulous person.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald got mixed up also in a piece of pure economics.  It does not matter a fiddle-de-dee whether the increased insurance stamp contribution is paid by the State or by the employer.  Ricardo is one of the greatest economists of all time.  If one reads him, it will become clear that it always comes out of the efforts of the workers.  Therefore, it does not matter a fig whether it is paid by the employer or by the State. We heard Deputy FitzGerald talk at length about it.  He spoke about four weeks' holidays.  I can tell a story on that.  I was personally responsible for the three weeks' holidays which were given by the ESB Manual Workers' Tribunal some years ago.  I never heard so much about any subject in my golf club and anywhere else&mdash;the horror this three weeks' holidays was. I was pilloried in a jocose way, half jocose but real in earnest.</P>

I would urge <Col N="697" /> them just to watch this tremendous upsurge in their expenditure in a particular way this year.

      <P>It has been a pleasure to listen to Deputy O'Donovan.  More than half of his speech was devoted to the Estimate and the remainder to Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;garrulous Garret: I can hardly call him his colleague; his pupil, I should say.  It is difficult at this late stage of the debate to add anything that is new.  So much has been said and many valuable points have been contributed.  I should like to pay a particular tribute to Deputy Desmond's objective and far-reaching contribution. It was very restrained.  Certainly, it took the middle of the road.  It was an education and a pleasure to listen to it.</P>
      <P>Let me turn first to AnCO.  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan that it is better to hasten slowly in this matter. Deputy Desmond was inclined to criticise it for not making enough speed. He said it should hurry up because by 1972 we shall be in competition with Britain and then there will be the Common Market and we shall not be ready.  Let us take it easy.  AnCO has a frightfully important job to do. Nevertheless, I look forward with interest to their next report to see how many designated employments have reached what we call the levy grant stage, the annual output of trainees and all those other objectives which they are setting themselves.  I feel we will get that result from AnCO's efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers in this debate have referred to the growth of skilled workers.  There is no doubt that the ordinary average worker is fast disappearing, and indeed, even the craftsman as we know him will disappear and his place will be taken by technicians and skilled workers.  These will require training and a new range of skills and I am sure that AnCO are very much alive to this.  However, we will have to be very careful here.  Take our present apprenticeship schemes. <Col N="698" /> They are very outmoded and they need quite a lot of updating.  I do not think we can afford the luxury of old type apprenticeship schemes.  The Minister did say that he was going to look into this.  In Britain and in the United States industry has been taken over to an increasing degree by skilled technicians. AnCO comes in here and people should be trained for any job because the whole pattern is being changed.  That is why AnCO's resposibility is so great.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, system building in the building industry.  This system is growing; the units are made in a factory and then brought to the site where they are assembled.  There is practically no plastering and no painting or respraying and the carpentry work is done in the factory.  The assembly job is carried out by skilled workers.  I have witnessed the system in Athlone on one of the regional colleges.  There is no doubt that our ordinary worker is a skilled worker but there were very few trade differentials in that job.  You had all rthe same type of men, foremen, skilled technicians and skilled workers on the job.  Of course, it does take skilled workers to assemble the units. I was glad to read about the close liaison AnCO has with the vocational committees and the Irish Management Institute.  The establishment of these regional colleges will be a considerable help in speeding up the flow of trainees.  It would be a good idea if each regional college had two or three of these industrial trainers and, of course, each important industry should have them also.  In that way you could speed up the work of industrial training.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he was planning to establish a manpower service which would provide, on local, regional and national levels, up-to-the-minute information about labour availability.  This is most important but I will leave this question of a forecasting unit out because it is too theoretical and too far away.  However, we can at least have up-to-date information about labour availability. It is very important that AnCO should have this information on local, regional and national levels on a <Col N="699" /> continuing basis because this information has a habit of going out of date very quickly.  I remember a survey which we carried out in Athlone and we found that we had 300 or 350 workers available for work and we were very proud of that but when we finally got an industry we found that the number had reduced to 150.  It is strange how these things happen. Up-to-date information on a continuing basis is very important.  I am glad that the Department is thinking of carrying out limited labour availability surveys and that they will help local development associations.  We will be very glad to avail of this in Athlone and I will be in touch with the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Two points which were mentioned frequently in the debate were the question of female labour and that of labour immobility.  In regard to the first, the Minister talks about going to the Economic and Social Research Institute but he need go no further than to his colleague, the Minister for Finance. It is disgraceful that the allowance for married women is around £60. In England the first £180 or £200 of a married woman's earnings is tax free. There is a vast and untapped source of skilled labour available because these women who have married are now free to go to work again but they are not prepared to do that when they are taxed at the rate of 5s 3d or more in the £.  The Minister should endeavour to have changes made in the next budget and then this female labour will be available.  It is scarce at the moment.</P>
    <P>The other point was in regard to geographical mobility.  Normally our workers are immobile unless they go to England or go to Dublin.  We can make for more mobility if we develop growth centres in various towns such as Mullingar, Tullamore, Athlone and other places.  If industries are set up the labour will come from ten or 20 miles around and will return that distance because transport is very much available now.  One sure method of ensuring labour mobility is to foster industries in the centres named in the Buchanan Report.  That report may not <Col N="700" /> be the last word and it cannot be taken literally but, nevertheless, the principle of growth centres is well laid out in it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Labour Court, I would say that the simple way to put it is that it is being misused.  People are too lazy to use it only as a court of last resort and trying to reach a settlement between themselves before they go to it.  If one reads the report of Mr. Con Murphy and reads his recommendations then you have there all that there is to be said about industrial relations.  He said that the maintenance dispute was a clear demonstration of the irrational state of industrial relations.  There is plenty of goodwill on the workers side and on the employers side and in the Department of Labour but the thing is utterly irrational.  The maintenance dispute was an example of a group of unions&mdash;I am not blaming the unions only&mdash; abrogating to themselves powers they did not have.  They constituted themselves a group without any constitution whatever.  One union had about ten people and they had one vote and another union had 80 people and they had one vote.  That was irrational. Those men led the maintenance strike. However, there is a darker side to the picture for the report said that the list of firms directly affected appeared to have been grouped in some instances haphazardly and subsequently was so modified that the exclusion or inclusion of certain concerns gave the appearance of it having been discriminatory.  That is the darker side of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy has many recommendations but there are two which I think worthy of comment.  He speaks about the various defects that have been shown up by the dispute and says that &ldquo;proposals from Congress and employers' organisations may require action by the Government but the initiative should come first from themselves.&rdquo; I must pay particular tribute to Deputy Desmond: he did point out many of the defects and deficiencies on the union side and he is an experienced trade unionist himself.  The important thing here is: &ldquo;Congress&rdquo;. he says, &ldquo;must in future monitor&rdquo;&mdash;I would say the Department of Labour should also monitor&mdash;&ldquo;the progress of <Col N="701" /> all major trade union negotiations and install an early-warning system for impending troubles&rdquo;.  It is all right to come to Mr. Con Murphy who did a magnificent job and get this support from him in an <i>ad hoc</i> report about a particular situation.  We have a few others already, one in Bord na Móna and another which I do not remember. That is fine, but the door is open and the horse is gone.  What you must have is an early warning system and an ability to monitor disputes as they come up.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan spoke about a waiting period being no use where wages were involved.  I agree with him, but only about one-third of all disputes arise out of wage negotiations.  The bulk of them arise on matters of working conditions or simple incidents, disciplinary measures, getting rid of workers or something like that.  All these can be easily monitored.  If we did that we could possibly improve labour relations enormously.  They need improvements, as Mr. Con Murphy says in the report.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the economic effects are as bad as we think for our workers. What really worries me is that people talk glibly about the 11th round, the 12th round and the 13th round, as if these were inevitable.  Where you have gradual erosion of money values and rising cost of living you must have these things, but people are beginning to think now in terms that these things must happen: Next June we shall have the 12th round and in 1971 the 13th round.  It is a dangerous habit to think in that way.  These national across-the-board increases of five and ten per cent I think are not ideal.  I should prefer negotiations concluded and settlements made on an industry level, or, if there is only one industry involved, on a factory level.  The workers themselves should be able to know the state of the industry; management should be crystal clear about it so that the workers would know.  As it is today, it results in a great deal of leap-frogging which is dangerous and so we shall have the 11th and 12th rounds and so on.  I am slightly afraid that 1970 may be a dangerous year.  Some settlements expire in March and some in June, 1970.  Deputy O'Leary spoke <Col N="702" /> the other day about an incomes policy. I agree that you cannot have an incomes policy.  The only incomes policy is the voluntary one.  Can one imagine a voluntary incomes policy?  Who would decide to refrain voluntarily from taking an increase?  It is impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government reduced their incomes by 15 per cent&mdash;was that not voluntary?</P>

      <P>Yes, that was a measure of good intent but you cannot operate a voluntary policy.  Yet, you can arrive at some form of incomes policy even though 40 per cent of our people, as Deputy O'Donovan said, are farmers. However, I shall not go into this incomes policy business; it does not really arise on this Estimate.  I shall conclude by thanking the Minister for this exhaustive report which shows us how fortunate we are in having a Department of Labour formed when it was formed for a purpose which had been taken as one facet of the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I compliment the Minister and his staff on this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister looking at the clock.  I shall spare him the trouble of replying tonight.  I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Labour.  Having had quite a lot to do with him in the Department of Social Welfare previously, I believe he will be successful in his job. With others, it is only fair to say that the previous Minister did appear to be prepared to go a long way in trying to make the new Department of Labour work well and, with his very efficient officials, he was successful in many things.  It would be foolish, however, to try to give the impression that everything was rosy because that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of things in his opening speech and avoided mentioning a number of things, one or two of which I shall refer to later.  He said he is looking for sites for placement offices but to suggest that this is something that is about to take place almost immediately is drawing the long bow because I know that the Post Office in many <Col N="703" /> cases has been looking for sites for years where post offices are badly needed and they have not succeeded. If the Minister thinks that he can get sites in the present financial situation and build new offices before the next Estimate I fear he is daydreaming. When eventually these offices are built I think &ldquo;employment exchange&rdquo; will not be the name which should be given to what is left.  That is the official term but &ldquo;unemployment exchange&rdquo; is the one used by the people who frequent them.  Unfortunately, the only reason they go there is that they are unemployed and, being unemployed, they sign for some small amount of money which they get.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister should say when replying what is the exact position about those exchanges that were promised last year and have been promised again this year.  I refer particularly to Drogheda because the Drogheda exchange, despite what the report on manpower in that district produced some time ago, is one that is kept very busy.  Despite the fact that Drogheda is a good business town, quite a number of people are unemployed and the conditions in that exchange could not be worse.  If there is a punishment for being unemployed it is there, both for the staff and those who must go there once or twice a week.  It is time something was done about it and referring to it in Estimate after Estimate is not good enough; some definite action must be taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister produced something for which half-truth is not the correct description but it partly describes it.  He says that in June, 1969, employment in transportable goods industries was up by 11,000.  That figure, given on its own, might be misunderstood to mean that employment in the country had increased by 11,000.  That was very far from the truth.  Since that is the only figure of this type mentioned in the Minister's speech I do not know what was the relevancy if it was not intended to give a wrong impression.  It is true that in transportable goods this improvement of 11,000 occurred but the Minister must know that it does <Col N="704" /> not mean that there has been an increase of 11,000 over all.  The number leaving agricultural employment continues to be large.  If the Minister wants one reason why they are leaving&mdash;there are a number of reasons&mdash;the main reason is that the Government still intend to deal with these people as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to measures he proposes to introduce concerning hours of work, conditions of employment and so on for workers other than agricultural workers.  He referred to the 1961 Holiday Act in which a special arrangement was made about holidays for workers other than agricultural workers. Subsequently one dealing with agricultural workers had to be introduced Why cannot the Government decide that an agricultural worker is a human being and is entitled to conditions of employment, wages and holidays just like any other worker in the country? Why try to downgrade them?  This has been the general attitude.  Do not say that there is a special Minister dealing with agriculture.  That has nothing at all to do with it.</P>
    <P>The main reason is that agricultural workers are paid less and work longer hours, and the Minister and his Government would like to keep it that way. If they are included with other workers they must automatically get a reduction from the average 48-hour week which they have now&mdash;50 hours in the summer and 44 in the winter&mdash;to a 40 to 42½-hour week, the same as everybody else.  That is the only reason I know of why agricultural workers are dealt with separately.  Cannot the Government be honest about it and say they will include all workers?  If they do, I think the situation in agriculture will change because people will realise that working in agriculture is not a kind of lowering in status.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of women generally in employment.  It is sometimes overlooked that it has not been the tradition in this country for women to work after they are married The tradition is now growing up for two reasons.  One is that a number of women having worked in England have come home and carried on that tradition, and the other is that because of <Col N="705" /> the low pay which is given to male workers the women have to work in order to have enough to keep the family.  Deputy Lenihan is correct when he refers to the fact that the income tax allowance is so low that married women who could work feel it is not good enough that when they get their wages the only allowance they get is 30/- per week tax free.  For that reason many of them who could work are very slow to take up jobs.</P>
    <P>There is the other side of it where unfortunate women have to go out to work although they have families. When the children come home from school there is no one at home and they are rambling about with no one to get a meal for them.  This is not healthy.  This is a matter which will have to be looked at with great care. Social workers know a lot about it. It is something which will have to be examined very carefully because a lot of juvenile delinquency is started when a child comes home from school at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and has no one to look after him until 6 o'clock or 6.30.  Perhaps he has got no food except a piece of bread and butter since 7.30 or 8 o'clock in the morning before he went to school.  These things are a tragedy and they will have to be dealt with.  Possibly another Department will deal with them.</P>
    <P>If women are working they should be paid the same rate as men if they are doing equal work.  We talk about the ILO and, while it is a great thing to compliment the ILO this year, the greatest compliment we could pay them would be to ratify all their 134 conventions. The Minister is not correct when he says that the 45 conventions ratified by this country are more than were ratified by most countries.  I was at a conference which ended last week at which this matter was referred to and the average is something like about 68 per country.  We have ratified 45. There is no use in putting in incorrect figures.</P>
    <P>The question of equal pay for equal work for women should be and must be dealt with, and dealt with fairly quickly.  Is there any point at all in having even in the employment of this House women and men who do the <Col N="706" /> same work, the women doing as much and perhaps more than the men, and yet they are paid as much as £7 per week less than the men, not because they are not doing the job properly but just because they are women?  We hear about things that happen in other parts of this country where there is a bias against certain people.  In other countries there is a bias because of the colour of people's skin or because of their faith.  It is a bit of a cod that we should hold up our hands in horror about this and then proceed to do even worse, because the people who are doing this work must feel that they are being relegated to being second-class citizens, like the other class of workers to whom I referred earlier.  I would ask the Government to deal with it now. It is not a question of equal pay for men and women, as some people think. It is a question of equal pay for work of equal value.  There is no reason why this should be deferred any longer.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been referred to by other speakers and I should like to refer to it briefly.  It is something which has occurred and the Department of Social Welfare have been dealing with it, but it affects this Department in a certain way, that is, the question of married women who are unemployed and who appeal against a refusal to pay them unemployment benefit.  The Minister refers to it at column 136, volume 242, of the Official Report when he says:</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country, a large percentage of those registered as unemployed have been found to be not available for full-time employment under present conditions.  I do not think that this will come as a surprise to Deputies.  We all know that this is particularly true of most married women who register as unemployed to keep their social insurance alive.</P>
    <P>This is a bit of cod which the Minister has been told by someone else and which should not be included in a speech by a Minister who knows, or should know, better.  In order to qualify for unemployment benefit they must have been in full employment for a considerable period.  Having been in full employment they are then out of a <Col N="707" /> job, and they are refused unemployment benefit on the grounds that because they are married it must follow that they require only part-time work.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to go to an employment exchange with a woman who had been refused unemployment benefit.  I went there because she had an appeal in.  Six married women came before that appeals officer and the six were refused.  Despite the fact that the workers' representative on that appeals board protested strongly against the action of the officer, the officer just said: &ldquo;I am making the decision&rdquo;&mdash; and that was it.  In the case of the woman about whom I was concerned I have no doubt at all of the fact that she was genuinely seeking employment. She had worked for many many years and was then laid off for a few weeks.  She went back seeking her job and was told that it had been filled. She applied for unemployment benefit while she was looking for another job and she was refused, obviously, from the Minister's statement, on Government instructions.  I have written to the Minister twice about this.  I mentioned to him the last time that I proposed to raise it in the House.  I propose to do so at greater length on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare.  If instructions are issued to the deciding officers, or to the people responsible for certifying for unemployment benefit, that married women are not to be paid unemployment benefit, stop stamping their cards.  You cannot have it both ways.  It is wrong that this thing should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the leaflets on careers which are available and to the fact that so many people have written in asking for them.  That is a great thing, but would the Minister say if those leaflets are supplied to all the schools for school-leavers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that all school-leavers are supplied?  Is there an instruction to the schools that all school-leavers should be issued with those leaflets?  If not, why can it not be done?  We are all familiar with the fact that many schools and, indeed, many organisations too, receive certain documents and feel it is not their job to distribute them.  It is quite possible that there may be supplies of these leaflets in someone's press or someone's desk and they will not come out of that.  Perhaps, the Minister would not mind making an inquiry from his colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the schools may distribute them but I am afraid many others do not bother.  In regard to the question of redundancy pay, I agree with the Minister it is being reasonably well looked after.  Any cases coming before the appeal board and dealt with normally by his Department are disposed of pretty quickly, but I am surprised that after 21 months the fund has a surplus of approximately £1 million.  This should be evidence enough to the Minister that the time has come for an improvement.  What that improvement should be I would hate to hazard a guess, but it should be possible to increase the amount of redundancy payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that what the Minister thinks is possible and what is actually possible might not be the same thing.  Anyway, I urge him to deal with it fairly quickly.  The Minister has referred to the introduction of new legislation for the protection of workers, except agricultural workers.  Agricultural workers are again out.  Why this bias against agricultural workers?  They are human beings and can be affected and are affected, particularly by insecticides, the same as anybody else.  There was a case 12 months ago of a worker who had been injured while using insecticide. By the time the case came to court the type of insecticide he was using had been changed to one which would not cause the injury which had been caused 12 months previously. The man lost his case and also lost his job because he could not continue at the work he was doing because he had developed a disease to his hands and skin.  I would ask the Minister to include agricultural workers in whatever legislation he proposes to introduce.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies in regard to hours of work.  It is not good enough in 1969 to see certain categories of employees working 50 hours per week while others are down to 40.  I have great respect for Deputy Garret FitzGerald, he is a very intense man and deals with matters in great detail, but on this point I do not think he knew what he was talking about.  I deal with workers day in, day out, and it is nonsense to suggest that people would prefer to get an extra weeks holidays&mdash;and apparently he does not know that the general rule now is there weeks holidays, not two&mdash;rather than have a reduction in working hours from, say, 50 down to 42½ or 40.  I am quite sure most workers want a reduced working week to get down to whatever hours are worked in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the improvement <Col N="710" /> in the factory inspectorate. The Minister must still be aware that it is entirely inadequate.  I have heard of factories being inspected where, despite the fact that there was a dust in which, if I walked into the factory myself, not being used to it, I could not breathe for five minutes, men and women are required to work in that dust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have notified our inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's inspector had been there and the employer said the factory inspector was satisfied that there was no harm done, and to prove his case he took the healthiest man in the factory and sent him off for an inspection once every two months to show it was doing no harm to his lungs.  Whether that man was working where the dust was is another question, but the employer was able to produce a certificate to me to show this man was very healthy, and he looked healthy.</P>
      <P>I am not blaming the factory inspectorate. The number of inspectors employed could not do the jobs they are required to do all over the country. No worker wants to complain about his employers.  He does not want to write to me or to the Department and say: &ldquo;Our factory has unhygienic conditions&rdquo;, because the complaint may eventually be traced to that worker, and if he does not lose his job things could be made fairly unpleasant for him.  Some effort should be made to step up the number employed on factory inspections.</P>

      <P>Obviously the Minister has never worked in a furniture factory or even in a doll factory; on one occasion I had to go down to his constituency to ensure that there were dust extractors installed in the factory without which some of the employees would have died from pneumoconiosis or something like it.</P>
      <P>The Minister complains&mdash;I think that is the correct word&mdash;that the number of safety committees have not been increased very much, and he wonders why that is so.  My comment this year is just the same as it was last year: you cannot expect people who have been working all day to spend some of their time in the evening on a factory safety committee.  If the Minister wants to have these committees set up, first of all, he should send down an inspector to the factory and arrange that he would set up a committee during working hours.  Secondly, the matter should be dealt with by the trade union and the employer rather than by the employer picking a fellow he thinks would be his way of thinking to constitute a factory safety committee, because the factory would be much better off with no committee at all than with a committee which has been set up just to try to prove that they are carrying out suggestions which were made by the factory safety committee.</P>
      <P>On the question of the placement of employees, one Deputy referred to the case of a girl who had been training to be a teacher and who when she came to her finals did not pass because she could not sing.  There is something wrong here.  Either girls who cannot sing should not be allowed to train as teachers at all because they will not be passed when it comes to the finals, or, alternatively&mdash;and I think this is the better suggestion&mdash;the regulation should be removed altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On Wednesday, 5th November, I had the following question on the Order Paper directed to the Minister for Local Government:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that there is a large accumulation of schemes awaiting attention under the rural improvement schemes in County Cavan; and if he will sufficiently increase the grant for these schemes for the current year to enable the county council to clear the arrears during the coming financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to say that the local improvement scheme operated under the Local Government Roads and Drainage Act is a scheme under which rural people may have lanes or boreens serving a number of houses repaired with the assistance of a grant from the Department plus a local contribution and minor drainage works may also be carried out.  It is a very worthwhile scheme if it is properly operated.  Some hundreds of schemes involving repairs to lanes, each serving a number of houses entitled to attention under the scheme, cannot even be considered in my constituency because a backlog of applications which were handed over to the County Council by the Department on 1st April, 1968, and which <Col N="713" /> have not yet been cleared.  For that reason I put down the question.  In his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The sum already allocated this year to Cavan County Council under the local improvements scheme represents that county's full proportionate share of the available funds, and it is not proposed to increase them.</P>
    <P>It will be noted in his reply that the Minister, very fairly, did not deny that there was a large accumulation of schemes awaiting attention in my constituency, but he refused to increase the grant of £30,000.  I consider this question sufficiently important to each of my constituents to warrant my bringing the Minister here at this late hour and doing my utmost to impress on him the hardship that is being endured by many lane dwellers in County Cavan in an attempt to persuade the Minister to increase the grant substantially over £30,000 so that these hardships may be relieved and the long list of applications be attended to.</P>
    <P>I do not consider this is a political issue.  I hope, whatever I have to say, will be said in a constructive way in an effort to convince the Minister that there is a genuine grievance involved here and one which deserves top priority.  The Minister has said on a previous occasion that the total sum allocated to this scheme last year&mdash;and, presumably, this year&mdash;was £469,000, less than £½ a million, to cover the entire country.  I would submit that that is a very insignificant sum when one considers the way that money can freely be found for other less deserving and less pressing purposes.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at the recent history of this scheme.  Up to the 1st April, 1968, it was operated by the Department of Finance and for a short time by the Department of Local Government.  As from 1st April, 1968, the scheme was handed over to the various county councils under the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act.  As far as Cavan County Council is concerned this scheme did not come to it with a clean slate, so to speak.  Cavan County Council inherited with the scheme 112 projects <Col N="714" /> which had not been attended to by the Department of Local Government or its predecessor, the Department of Finance.  My information is that the cost of doing these 112 schemes amounts to approximately £70,000, or considerably more than the total grants allocated to Cavan County Council for the years 1968-69 and 1969-70.  It is important to realise, and to point out, that this legacy of 112 applications did not accumulate in the Department of Local Government.  Practically all these applications&mdash;if not all of them&mdash;were in the Department of Local Government or the Department of Finance much earlier than the 1st April, 1968, when the scheme was passed to Cavan County Council.  In fact, they had been received by those Departments a considerable time before the 1st January, 1966, because as from 1st January, 1966, the Department of Local Government refused to issue any further forms as it was not in funds to do the work and it was candid enough not to hold out false hope to these people. The fact of the matter therefore is that people who filled up application forms to have their lanes repaired under this scheme long before the 1st January, 1966, have not had there lanes attended to yet.</P>
    <P>What has been the position since 1st January, 1966?  Requests for application forms to Cavan County Council have accumulated and the best information I can get is that the grand total of such applications with the county councils at the present time is 500.  It is true that the county council, following the precedent set by the Department of Local Government, are not issuing application forms because they see no hope of doing the work in the immediate future.  I know from the best information I can get that at the present rate it will take ten years to clear the 500 applications that are awaiting attention.  The enormity of the problem will, therefore, be seen and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I have been talking here about lanes only in relation to the scheme but let us not forget that this scheme is supposed to and is intended to deal with minor drainage problems as well as boreens or lanes.  Of course, Cavan County Council cannot consider the <Col N="715" /> question of drainage having regard to the backlog of lanes.  I also wish to put on record that over the last two years Cavan County Council have not even been allowed spend £30,000 per year. The total amount spent by the council in the two years in round figures is probably £50,000.  Admittedly £10,000 was not spent because of a dispute or a controversy which went on between the Minister and his Department on the one hand and the manager for County Cavan and his technical advisers on the other.  It took some time to iron that out but I think I am not being unresponsible if I say the lane dwellers in County Cavan should not be held responsible and should not have to suffer for the teething troubles in this new scheme.  At any rate, the result of the matter is that the lane dwellers in County Cavan are suffering intolerable hardship.  Women and children have literally to wade through slush and mud to get to their homes.  The cars which bring creamery cans to creameries refuse to traverse the lanes to collect the cans.  The result is that the cans have to be wheeled or carried to the roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that the many amenities which are now enjoyed in rural life have to be brought by motor vehicles but the owners of those vehicles will not come up those lanes.  The net result of all this is that the people living in the lanes are being treated as second or third class citizens and I do not think that is good enough.  To add to their frustration those people see what appears to be vast sums of money spent on arterial roads and main roads in their immediate vicinity.  I am not against better arterial roads but I say that, when such large sums of money can be spent on arterial roads, much more than £500,000, which is the amount allocated for this scheme in the whole country, should be allocated.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in all sincerity to say whether I am being unreasonable in appealing to him to use his influence to get this grant increased this year so that this backlog can be cleared up.  I earnestly appeal to him not to treat this as a political stunt <Col N="716" /> because I can assure him that the people in County Cavan who are concerned with it treat it as no such thing.  They treat it as a very serious matter and if they have ten years to wait many of those elderly people will have passed on and will not be living when their turn comes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us exactly the amount of the grant that will be made available.  If he approaches this as a Minister for Local Government concerned with truly local problems at their lowest level, surely he will see that this money should be increased and he will have no trouble in convincing his colleagues in the Cabinet, and especially the Minister for Finance, that this grant should be stepped up in order to make life for the people living in those lanes more bearable.  I feel very strongly on this as I represent a rural constituency and I have been associated with rural Ireland all my life.  I did not come in here to throw mud and I hope the Minister will accept that.  I made my case for those people and I trust the Minister will accept that I have made a good case for them and that he will do something to alleviate the trouble I have spoken of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This apparently is becoming an annual event by Deputy Fitzpatrick, or, perhaps, I should say an annual performance.  It is almost a year ago to the day since he last raised this question here on the Adjournment. The difference, I think, between his contribution today and this time last year is that last year he spent practically the full 20 minutes giving reasons why in his opinion the £30,000 allocation to Cavan County Council for this purpose should not be spent.  Probably as a result of that only half the amount of money was, in fact, spent last year. The allocation to Cavan County Council last year was, as it is this year, £30,000 and of that £14,995 was not spent.  I cannot agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the alleviation for this purpose of £469,000 is an insignificant sum.  It is part of the annual budget which has to be raised by taxation, and I think with all the conflicting demands and the very important demands <Col N="717" /> there are on available resources this is quite a substantial amount to be allocated in one year for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Needless to say I am well aware of the importance of those schemes and the contribution they make towards providing better living conditions for the people and I will lose no opportunity to have this amount increased whenever it shall be possible.  I fully appreciate the importance of the work that is done and the necessity to maximise the amount made available for the purpose.  I think, however, it is quite clear from the figures that in the allocation of this amount of money Cavan County Council have been treated quite well.  With £30,000 they are the sixth highest allocation, being exceeded only by Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Leitrim.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the present local improvements scheme is a new scheme which has followed on from the previous schemes which were administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office&mdash;the minor employment, bog development and rural improvements schemes.</P>
      <P>Being a new scheme, we had to devise some manner of allocating moneys to the different county councils because it was being dealt with for the first time by local authorities. I think the method decided on was a fair one.  We based it on the average amount spent on those other schemes during the previous five years. On that basis, Cavan County Council came out quite well, the figures for the previous five years for Cavan being: 1963-64, £17,206; 1964-65, £23,192; 1965-66, £28,023; 1966-67, £19,430 and 1967-68, £30,024, an average annual allocation of £23,575.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was an average of 6.06 per cent of the total allocation for these schemes during the five years.  This year we have allocated to County Cavan, despite the fact that only half of the amount allocated was spent last year, £30,000 which is 6.39 per cent of the total allocation on that scheme. I think that was a fair way to allocate the money.  After this year we shall have had two years experience of the new scheme and it is the intention to <Col N="718" /> review its operation.  There may, as a result, be adjustments in the percentage allocation in future years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am quite satisfied that the method we adopted for allocating the money was the fairest that could be devised in the circumstances. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that money can be freely found for less meritorious projects but of course he did not specify what the less meritorious projects were which, he said, could be scrapped.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to take advantage of this scheme because a few years ago County Cavan was not taking advantage of it.  As the Deputy well knows, a lot of promotional work has been done in Cavan with the result that during the past few years the amount of work done under these schemes, which preceded the local improvement schemes, has been increasing and the result is that now that the new scheme has been instituted, Cavan County Council, on the basis of their performances during the preceding five years, were entitled to this increased allocation. It clearly indicates that a major effort was made by bodies whom Deputy Fitzpatrick knows to promote this scheme in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing to see that people <Col N="719" /> are now rushing to take advantage of the scheme.  I hope the result this year in County Cavan will not be the same as last year when, possibly partly due to Deputy Fitzpatrick's exposition of the reasons why schemes should not be carried out at all in County Cavan, only half of the money was spent. On 29th October last year Deputy Fitzpatrick spent 20 minutes explaining why County Cavan should not operate the scheme at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently, only half of the £30,000 was spent.  We should all hope that this year, unlike last year, the full £30,000 allocated will <Col N="720" /> be spent.  It will enable schemes to the total value of £39,088 to be carried out in Cavan this year and this will confer corresponding benefits on a number of people living in these lanes at present. If this happens this year I have no doubt that in future years the position will be similar and that we will have a general improvement in conditions for these people in County Cavan.  I ask Deputy Fitzpatrick to co-operate with those who have been promoting the use of this scheme in Cavan in the future and I urge him to make every effort to see that this year the full allocation of £30,000, the sixth highest in the country, will be spent.</P>
