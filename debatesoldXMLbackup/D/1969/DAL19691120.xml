      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not intend to take up the time of the House very long on this Estimate. There are just a few points I should like to deal with although they have already been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  The first is the question of payment for land by the Land <Col N="1410" /> Commission in land bonds.  I know that this question has been raised in the House and, indeed, it has been raised by many interests with the Minister and with the Land Commission. It is generally accepted that this method of paying for land by the Land Commission is unfair and that it makes the position more difficult.  It is unfair to the vendors of land and it makes it more difficult for the Land Commission to acquire land by agreement.  It has been pointed out that the value of land bonds very often falls considerably between the date on which the land is purchased by the Land Commission and the date on which the land bonds are allocated to the vendor and the date on which the bonds are finally released.  In other words, there can be a difference in the value of the land bonds between these dates.  I consider this is unfair because the people who sell land to the Land Commission are supposed to get market value for the land.  In fact, they are not getting market value for it.  Very often they are getting considerably less than market value.  The result of this is often, as I am sure the Minister himself understands from his professional experience as well as from his ministerial experience, that people are very slow to sell land to the Land Commission by agreement.</P>
      <P>The question frequently asked is &ldquo;Will I be paid in cash or will I get the wretched land bonds?&rdquo; Most Government securities issued in recent years are acceptable by the Revenue Commissioners in payment of estate or death duties but this does not apply to land bonds.  Further, in the case of other Government securities like the national loan. <i>et cetera,</i> the interest on them is paid to holders without deduction of income tax.  Smallholders have not to go to the trouble of applying for a refund of income tax.  Land bonds, however, have income tax deducted from the interest due on them.  This is another aspect of the matter which renders them less attractive than a national loan.  I appeal to the Minister to tackle this matter which has given trouble to landowners for so long.  The Minister knows that professional men also receive remuneration for dealings in land in the</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> form of land bonds.  Their fees may be measured in £X but they are really getting less than £X by the time the land bonds reach them.  This may not be as important as the loss suffered by the vendors of land, but it is an important point.  I did not feel it would be right to let this Estimate be passed without adding my voice to those of other Deputies who have spoken on this particular topic.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Division of the Department of Lands could perhaps pay more for land for afforestation in order to expedite their business.  They do not invoke their compulsory acquisition powers very often.  That is the position in my constituency.  They offer so little for land they are finding it very difficult to get the quantity of land they want for planting.  The difference between the amount of money involved would not be very considerable.  They expect to get land for as little as £10 an acre.  If they give £30 an acre in some parts of the country they think they are being very generous to the vendors.  They will not get land for such sums of money.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this aspect of the matter with a view to encouraging this section of his Department to approach the purchase of land in a more realistic way and to make it more attractive for the owners to dispose of land to his Department for forestry planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return now to the Land Commission, I would like to deal with the question of the delay in dividing land which comes into the possession of the Land Commission.  One hears many complaints about the Land Commission holding land for long periods before dividing it.  This is a cause of considerable frustration to people who are waiting to have their holdings brought up to an economic standard.  It is frustrating for a small farmer to see the Land Commission in possession of a substantial farm in his area for anything from two to five years before the farm is divided.  It is frustrating to see the land being let for some years to large farmers in the area.  This is also bad for the land because it is a period when such farmer takes all he can out of the land but does not put in fertilisers <Col N="1412" /> or look after the land properly. An appeal like this has been made to the Minister on many occasions.  It is often dealt with in specific cases in this House by way of Parliamentary Question. We should continue to urge the Minister to do something about this situation and to see that there is no unnecessary or avoidable delay in the division of land.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission acquire land and divide it they should be very careful about rights of way.  They should provide proper rights of way. They should not do anything which could be a source of trouble between neighbours after the land is divided and the Land Commission have moved out. I have known of cases where, because the Land Commission left rights of way in a state of uncertainty, bad feeling developed between neighbours and litigation followed.  This is something which is to be deplored and something which should certainly be avoided, if at all possible.  These are really the only points I wanted to deal with.  I particularly wanted to deal with the land bonds and the delays in the division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think the level of the debate over the past two or three days on this Estimate has been extremely high and I should like to express to the many Deputies who contributed my thanks for the dispassionate way in which they discussed the important problems involved for both the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division.  I would go so far as to say that, of the 19 Estimates debates I have listened to or taken part in since I came to this House, this debate has been far and away the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid it would be impossible for me to deal in detail with the many points that were raised but I do undertake to examine all the suggestions made by Deputies and to communicate with them if I do not deal with them here.  I am more interested in dealing with policy and the future prospects in regard to both lands and afforestation problems.  If I may deal very briefly with forestry, I think I can say <Col N="1413" /> that it is an accurate reflection of the feelings of the House that the Forestry Division not merely proves that a State body can be successful and efficient but can in fact do an altogether excellent job.  The only criticism offered here by any Deputy was that the afforestation programme should be increased and that the target of 25,000 acres should be restored as soon as possible, some Deputies suggesting that this target is itself not set high enough.</P>
    <P>Changes were made in the acquisition procedure and, as a result of these, the reserve of plantable land is now rapidly improving.  I do not think I need to tell the House what these changes were because I assume most Deputies are aware of them.  Suffice it to say that this drive will be continued because no target can be achieved in forestry unless there is a sufficient reserve of land on which to operate.  This year, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, it will again not be possible to achieve the 25,000 acre target.  I sincerely hope that, as a result of the success of the acquisition drive throughout the country, next year the 25,000 acre target will be realised and that in the future for every subsequent year the same position will obtain.</P>
    <P>I have plans for certain areas which I regard as being particularly suitable for forestry.  I refer in particular to County Leitrim and I should like to inform the House that I have directed the Forestry Division to make an all out drive to acquire land in County Leitrim, to plant it and thereby give employment to as many people as possible in that area.  This perhaps involves acceptance of the fact that most of the land in Leitrim is not suitable for development in agriculture.  It is as well to face realities in regard to matters like this and to abandon the effort to make a living where a living is not to be got.  There are other questions in regard to forestry to which I shall return later.  I want to thank Deputies for accepting the fact that the Forestry Division is doing good work and to assure them, in return, that the target of 25,000 acres will be achieved next year and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole vexed question <Col N="1414" /> of the Department of Lands and of the Land Commission there has been in this and in previous debates universal disapproval of the land bond system.  It is no part of my function to defend the indefensible and I do not regard the land bond system as being defensible.  I therefore do not propose to defend it.  If in ordinary commerce one enters into a contract to buy or sell and one does not pay the price one can be brought into court and forced to do so.  I have always considered that any system whereby a person ultimately does not receive what is purported to be paid to him is not fair.  All I can add is that I will do my best to put an end to this system altogether and to say that in regard to any land that may have been acquired from the time I took over there will be no discrepancy between the amount agreed to be paid by the State and the actual amount of cash received by the person concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are difficulties involved in this and that it may be easier to talk about than to do.  I have already pointed out to the House that for the Land Commission to pay exclusively in cash would at the present rate of Land Commission activity involve the finding of an extra £2 million or more out of the Capital Budget which itself is under pressure from all sides because of the mounting cost of our capital development programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde and others were, some of them amusingly and others in an irate way, critical of the Land Commission.  I should like to distinguish here between the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands and to point out to the House that the Land Commission merely executes the policy which is laid down for them by the Oireachtas and by successive Governments.  I interjected at one stage to say that I would not answer for the Land Commission.  Neither will I, because they are a commission and once they are given a policy they have the responsibility for executing that policy, and there are reserved to them many powers which they alone can exercise. I would therefore not pretend to answer for the decisions that they make from time to time in regard to <Col N="1415" /> acquisition, division and so on.  I would, of course, and do accept responsibility for the policy which is handed to them to operate.  It has been suggested by many Deputies, notably Deputy Desmond in his excellent contribution, that the time has come to reassess the policy we give the Land Commission to operate.  I agree with him.  Over the last few months I have given a great deal of thought to what the future role of the Land Commission should be, whether the present policy is the right one, whether the social consequences of the implementation of that policy have been good or otherwise.  The other side to this, that because of the recent enormous increase in the value of land the ultimate cost of land to the person who receives it, raises the question in his mind as to whether or not he should accept. I do not have to tell the House that in the eastern part of Ireland at present the value of land is such that it would make it impossible for any commission to acquire it and give it to farmers at an economic rent.  In the other parts of the country, where land can still be acquired at an economic price, the questions asked by Deputy Desmond still remain to be answered&mdash;you give land, for what purpose and to be put to what use?</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the thinking of the Members of this House at this stage should be coloured by the fact that we are now very likely to become members of the European Economic Community by, say, 1975.  This House is aware of the agricultural policy being implemented and intended to be implemented in the future in the EEC. Therefore, we must examine our policy, not merely in relation to our own problems but also in relation to the problems which will arise on our entry into the Common Market.  In this regard I consider Deputy L'Estrange went a long way towards articulating my feelings in regard to this country when that situation occurs. It took him a while to come around to the logic of his own argument but I think he accepts, as I do, that it is unthinkable that we should develop in this country anything on the lines of <Col N="1416" /> a Mansholt Plan.  We should rethink the question as to what is and what is not an economic or viable holding of land and in the process answer the questions asked by Deputy Desmond and others: &ldquo;For what purpose, and for what use, is land being given to our people?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider it is largely irrelevant what an economic holding of land is.  It may be 60 acres or 70 acres or it may be more.  Candidly I do not think it has any relevance to the west of Ireland in particular, and instead of setting out to give economic holdings to people we should, instead, try to set up a system of part-time farming through which we would have a rapid increase in industrial employment and in employment in forestry and we should leave as many of our people as possible on their small 20-acre farms. I realise that this represents a radical change in view and I take responsibility for that.  I would prefer that we would have more people rather than fewer in the west of Ireland.  I was extremely interested indeed when Deputy O'Hara from my own county expressed this view as well.  He freely conceded that 20 years ago he had argued in the opposite direction.  It is very much to his credit that he should come into this House and say he has changed his mind.</P>
    <P>I believe he is right in what he says now and that however well-intentioned the policy in the old days was it should now be reversed.  Indeed, it is interesting to observe that part-time farming has been proved in other countries to be more productive than full-time farming. I cannot give the references now but I will do so again.  There are many reasons why this should be so.  One is that a person who has employment off the land is obviously in a better position to capitalise his farming activities than if he were dependent on farming alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that so far as the western areas of this country are concerned this is what I would like to see done in the future, <Col N="1417" /> because I believe the activity of farming as such in the future will be what is called agribusiness, that most of it will be done in co-ops and in that way answer the question of how you get a five-day cow.</P>
      <P>If you have three people operating a farm then they do not have to work more than so many days a week.  However, that is going off the subject I was dealing with just now, which is that in my opinion, in order to restore the vitality that is needed to be restored in certain parts of the west of Ireland we should change our policy from one of trying to give everybody an economic holding to one of trying to provide suitable employment in industry or forestry and leave our people with their small farms.</P>
      <P>Now that Deputy O'Donovan has arrived I should like to assure him that even though there have been a number of Ministers for Lands from Mayo, some of us are capable of thinking in terms other than in terms of the west only.  I agree with him in anything he said in praise of Seán Moylan.  Seán Moylan was not merely the best Minister for Lands, he was one of the best men who ever entered this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not to say that I agree with those who favour the idea that the Land Commission should be abolished.  I categorically state that I do not so agree because I believe there will always be a function for the Land Commission, if only in matters like those raised by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that is to say the question of the acquisition of land by aliens, or, as they are more often called, non-nationals. I cannot say I share the xenophobic attitude of my namesake because I do not consider that there are not any circumstances in which foreigners should be allowed to acquire land here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, our international obligations in future years will to some extent affect that situation anyway. All I have to add is that since the 1965 Act there has been a strict account kept by the Land Commission of all land acquired by aliens, and it is only <Col N="1418" /> in special circumstances that the land commissioners have agreed to the sale of land to foreigners in that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it may have been on the seashore but, curiously enough, most of the land that is in the possession of people other than Irish was acquired in the years prior to 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be able to say how much land is involved because much of it was acquired prior to 1961 when the first sort of semi-check on acquisition by foreigners was brought in through the operation of the 25 per cent stamp duty.  Prior to that there was nothing to prevent anybody from acquiring all the land he wished on the open market and in respect of which he became the registered owner.  Since 1965, however, I am satisfied that the commissioners have been very careful and have given consent to the sale of land to foreigners only when they were satisfied that doing so was not inimical to the interests of our own people.  I have no doubt whatever that they will continue to operate that policy and I have also no doubt that the views expressed by many Members of the House, from all parties, in this debate and on other occasions will not go unnoticed by them.</P>

      <P>I do not know of any sale that has been sanctioned by the commissioners in recent years involving foreshore, but I will certainly bring the Deputy's views to their notice. As I have said, these are the views of most Members of the House.  I do not agree with Deputy Tully that during <Col N="1419" /> the discussion on the relevant section of the Land Bill four years ago it became clear the intention was that non-nationals should not be allowed in any circumstances to purchase agricultural land.  For instance, it is possible that a foreigner might be able to come along here to establish a farming system which might be of help to our own people and it has happened that where foreigners were prepared to experiment in that way the commissioners agreed to their purchasing the land.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahey and many others raised the question of subsidisation by the Land Commission of the annuity.  I accept that where the person concerned is in a non-congested area and has to pay the economic rent, this can represent a severe burden on him, and I also acknowledge the fact that to give certain people in the country, namely those in the congested areas, land at half annuity is favouring them as against the others.  I will say no more than that I am prepared to consider this whole question as to whether such a distinction should continue, but I will be very slow indeed to recommend that general subsidisation of the annuity should be practised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this would be good.  I should much <Col N="1420" /> prefer that the people concerned would go out into the open market and buy the land themselves and that my function would be to give them interest-free loans or loans at a slightly subsidised rate rather than that the machinery of the Land Commission should be put into operation and that the end product would involve subsidisation of the rent.  I think that this is an absurd proposition.  I do not say this in any critical sense in regard to what Deputy Fahey said: I take his point because it has already happened that people allotted land have refused to accept it because the economics of the enterprise did not appear to them to be favourable. I, therefore, accept as valid the suggestion by Deputy Fahey and others that some form of subsidisation should be provided at that level but I am totally against it and would much prefer that these people would not be involved with the Land Commission at all but would go on the open market and, perhaps, be assisted to do so and thereafter be helped in the capitalisation of their work to get them under way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan and many others complained about delays.  I fear this is something that is inherent in the system.  I do not mean those delays which occur and about which Deputy Fitzpatrick and others spoke because, as the House knows, I have strong views about delays that occur between the time a person hands over possession and is ultimately paid in bonds. I undertook in the House to take every possible step to have that period reduced to the minimum.  So far I have not been successful although I have had consultations with the Incorporated Law Society and others with a view to minimising the delay.  I am taking other steps, some of them possibly not too democratic, but my interest is in reducing that delay to such a point that the statutory obligation of keeping the bonds at par will, as far as possible, be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other delays, those inherent in the system, are the delays in the division of holdings and in the preparation of rearrangement schemes and so on. I agree that land which is let is likely to deteriorate.  There is no question <Col N="1421" /> about it, a person who has land on letting or on conacre takes all he can out of it while he has it and then hands it back in whatever condition it may then be.  But under present policy, where it is the intention of the Land Commission to try to resettle a whole area to solve the problems of all the people within that area, it is desirable that they should get enough land to do so.  As the House knows, they may not be able to get all the land required at the time they want it and very often they must wait anything from two or three up to five or ten years before the final piece of the jig-saw falls into place and enables them then to go ahead with resettlement or rearrangement programmes for the entire area.</P>
    <P>I fear, therefore, that so far as these delays are concerned there is not much I can say to the House other than they are inevitable under the system as it operates.</P>

      <P>At least two or three Deputies mentioned that it was more economic for people in congested areas to refuse land than to accept it and this applies even where the 50 per cent annuity operates.  This point is valid and reinforces my view that we would be adopting a sounder policy if we were to provide employment for as many people as possible and leave them with their 15 or 20 acre farms as a sideline.  That represents a very considerable change in the system, particularly for the West of Ireland, and I shall await with interest public reaction to this statement.</P>
      <P>Questions were asked about the reasons for the deficiency in the income from lands on the hands of the Land Commission.  It would appear that for the past two years gross outgoings and gross receipts have been roughly comparable.  In 1968-9 gross outgoings were £406,604 while gross receipts were £437,145.  In the previous year the figures were £345,000 outgoings and £342,000 receipts.  In fact, over the last two years receipts and outgoings roughly balanced.</P>

      <P>I will return now, if I may for a moment, to some of the points raised on the Forestry Vote. Many Deputies urged that a suitable superannuation or pension scheme should be introduced for forestry workers.  Deputies also raised the question of a travelling allowance for <Col N="1423" /> forestry workers who have to travel considerable distances.  I must say I have every sympathy with the point of view that forestry workers, like others, should have a proper superannuation or pension scheme.  Obviously, because of the nature of the work, not all forestry workers are permanent.  Therefore, some special scheme might be devised.  There is a scheme in existence but, in my opinion, it is not adequate. I hope that, in the near future, a more satisfactory pension scheme will be hammered out and put into operation. I agree that the present one is inadequate and should be replaced by a better one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a pension scheme.  It is only a grautity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a gratuity only in operation at the moment and I do not regard it as being adequate.  I would hope that in the near future I will be able to bring in a scheme which will look after these people properly. Unfortunately, people who draw up schemes like this are usually sitting at desks and they think more about people sitting at desks than about people who get up on snowy mornings and have to get on a bicycle and go ten or 15 miles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the opening up of forests I was asked why this has not been done, but I should like to point out that it is being done. In the next 12 months, under the plans for European conservation year, there will be special projects designed to interest our young people in forests which will enable them to adopt a section of a forest in their locality, visit it and be responsible, to some extent, for its development.  In that way we hope to make our young people aware of the advantages and the beauty <Col N="1424" /> of forests, developed and developing.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned European conservation year and, perhaps, I should draw the attention of certain newspaper writers, who talk about a lack of interest on the part of Ministers in the question of conservation, to the statements I made both inside the House and outside it in regard to this very important matter, and particularly in regard to European conservation year. During European conservation year I hope to put an idea into operation, which is, to provide play centres in forests for younger children coming out on day trips from the cities.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be a pleasant change for children going to school in urban areas to be able to go to a local forest on a day trip.  I have already mentioned visits to forests by children in primary schools and the adopting by the schools of a local forest so that in that way our children may learn the value of our programme and become interested in trees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the natural regeneration of our forests. Many other countries, including Sweden, are swinging away from natural regeneration to what is called artificial regeneration, in other words, using plants raised in nurseries for regeneration purposes.  This method enables the service to select the species which are considered most suitable for the area involved, and to use plants grown from selected and better strains of seed.  In the long run I believe this produces a better result and is, therefore, in the last analysis, a better approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan mentioned the failure to plant trees along our coasts and cited the Bay of Biscay as a comparable area.  I am advised that there are quite a number of factors involved here and, in particular, that the storms in the Bay of Biscay do not compare in intensity with the storms that occur along our western seaboard and, also, that the area adjoining the Bay of Biscay is flat and exposure, therefore, is more easily dealt with than on rising ground facing the sea.  The area also benefits from the fact that the trees grown are indigenous and, therefore, particularly suited to the soil.  At <Col N="1425" /> the same time, advances are being made all the time in regard to the utilisation of land along the sea for planting purposes and every possible effort will continue to be made to plant where possible, especially in areas where employment is scarce.</P>
    <P>Again in reply to Deputy Desmond, there has been no change whatever in the policy in relation to fencing.  The forestry service fences for its own protection and the practice has always been and still is to fence young plantations for their own protection.  When they are matured this protection is no longer necessary and fencing is not renewed because, like others, the forestry service has no legal obligation to fence its land, nor would it be reasonable to expect it to undertake the cost throughout the country of fencing merely for the benefit of adjoining owners.  It is the obligation of the owners themselves to do fencing so as to protect their own stock.</P>
    <P>There were many other points raised but, as I said at the beginning, I am more concerned with general policy and will deal with the individual, minor items mentioned, some of them of a local character, by getting in touch direct with the Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>In my view we should rethink the whole question of Land Commission policy in the light of recent trends of the cost of land, in the light of the fact that we are likely to be in the EEC in a short number of years, and in the light of the experience we have had down the years of the operation of our various Acts.  Where the western areas, from which I come myself, are concerned, I would prefer to see the abandonment of the effort to provide an economic holding for our farmers, for I believe this would have socially undesirable effects.  I believe it would be much better to keep as many as possible on the land as part-time farmers and, therefore, that the drive should not be to provide an economic holding on the land but to provide a job which would enable the householder to become and to remain a part-time farmer on a small holding.  Those who are not interested in being part-time farmers and who instead wish to make their <Col N="1426" /> living in farming should be encouraged to do so.  I should like to make that clear as well, so that if a young man says: &ldquo;I am not interested in working in a forest or in a factory; I want to be a full-time farmer and nothing else,&rdquo; he should be encouraged to remain on the land but not encouraged to the point of being allowed to acquire a disproportionate amount of the land anywhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eastern areas of the country, the price of land has now made the activities of the Land Commission impossible and, therefore, redundant. A special policy in respect of those areas will have to be worked out independent of the Land Commission and, therefore, independent of my responsibility and under some other aegis.</P>
    <P>Then I come to the question raised as to whether the Department of Lands as such should be a separate ministry or should be amalagamated, as suggested in the Devlin Report, with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the other question as to whether the forestry service should be reconstituted as a semi-State body.  My view is that the forestry service as it is is extremely successful and that, if the Department of Lands were to be abolished and the amended functions of the Department put under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, this should not include the Forestry Division.  In those circumstances it would possibly be preferable to set up a commercial, semi-State body, say, on the lines of Bord na Móna, and that that body would be responsible not merely for the implementation of our forestry programme but also for all aspects of timber and all the allied industrial undertakings associated with the by-products of trees.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis it is obvious that anything to do with the land should be under the control of one Minister.  When all is said and done, the land is the most precious asset of this country and, in my opinion, it will remain the most precious asset for a long time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or not, one body should be responsible for all aspects of land, and it is not sensible that there should be two Departments going conceivably in different directions at the same time. Everything to do with the land affects not merely the land and the people but every other aspect of their activity, so that one could say that every other ministry should be brought in under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I would be the last to suggest that, I assure the House, but I say that it is sensible that the activities of the Department of Lands should be amalgamated in a reorganised Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Therefore, I am suggesting my own abolition.  I do not know if it is a record to come into the House and suggest that you are yourself redundant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but it has been suggested by the Devlin Report and, subject to certain minor reservations, I agree in general with the report.  If that eventually turns out to be the Government's view&mdash;which I do not know, because that has not been decided&mdash;I would, in those circumstances, recommend the establishment of a semi-State body on the lines of Bord na Móna to carry on the very successful work which the House has agreed the Forestry Division is doing over the years, and, as I say, not merely confine it to the implementing of the forestry planting programme but also to deal with every other aspect of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that many points have been raised which I have not dealt with but it would obviously take me too long to do so as I have agreed to finish not later than 12 o'clock in order that the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works be continued. I must say again what I said at the beginning of my remarks: that I do not recall a debate in this House of such a high standard as this one.  I am grateful to all speakers, from Deputy L'Estrange who led off on behalf <Col N="1428" /> of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy O'Donovan who led off on behalf of the Labour Party and the many members of my own party for their thoughtful, helpful contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>I would assure Deputies that if we are all alive this time next year I hope we will have made considerable progress in achieving the more or less agreed goals.  It appeared to me that there was basically very little difference in policies so far as the Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil approaches to the problems are concerned; I think it is only a question of emphasis.  I should hope, therefore, by the time we come along in 12 months time that I will have managed to put into operation the things I have myself promised and the things which I know reflect the agreed wishes of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Minister would make an excellent Minister for Agriculture.  Could the Minister answer two short questions for me?  When the Minister talks about the part-time farmer in Mayo, does he apply the same criteria to the part-time farmer in Meath because this will change completely the whole attitude of land division?  At the present time a person in Meath who is a part-time farmer will not get land, and I believe he should.  The second point is that, if there is to be a scaling down on the purchase of land in the eastern portion of the country, does the Minister consider that the loans to young farmers to buy lands should be extended to the eastern portion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give consideration to that because, as I mentioned in my reply, I am attracted more to the idea of helping young people, either by giving them interest-free loans or by some other method, because sometimes&mdash;and it is not the fault of the Land Commission&mdash;land is given to people not basically interested in it.  I am interested in helping the person who is dedicated to the idea of farming.  With regard to the other part of the question, obviously there will be many side effects to a change of policy on this matter.  I see no reason why a person should be debarred from getting land <Col N="1429" /> merely because he is in employment. In my part of the country it has been the practice that a person who has six to eight acres of land and who works in a factory is virtually debarred from getting an increase in land, even though he proves himself by his activity on his few acres to be very successful. In the circumstances land is given to people merely because they are congests and not because they are really interested in it.</P>

      <P>I reminded the Minister this morning of what I regard as a serious question and that is the huge increase in the staff of the secretariat of the commission.  Estimates are supposed to be matters of detail. There is an increase in the total staff of the Land Commission of ten this year.  There is a very big decrease&mdash;and a very good thing&mdash;in the purchase branch because obviously their work has been completed, but that has been more than made up by what I regard as a colossal increase in the staff of the secretariat of the Land Commission. I appreciate that the present Minister was not the Minister for Lands when this was done but I would like to know what these people are doing?</P>

    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary seriously to consider the acquisition of Innisfallen Island for the nation.  This island is steeped in <Col N="1431" /> folklore and history.  It is at present owned by an American.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would initiate discussions between his office, Bord Fáilte and Mr. McShane, the American owner, with a view to acquiring the monastery and island for the nation.  This is too valuable a property to be foreign-owned.  Mr. McShane has been more than reasonable in the past whenever the Killarney Urban Council asked him for lands for various purposes and I am quite sure that he will co-operate again if discussions are initiated.</P>
    <P>I would not want to see a repetition of what happened in Kerry last year when the Office of Public Works closed a gate to the jarvies and kept it closed for several months.  There is no need to close gates in Ireland.  If there was a local dispute, that was not the way to settle it.  The Office of Public Works should have been big enough to meet the people there and to iron out the difficulties and the points of difference that had arisen.  It is imperative that the bolts should be removed and the gates opened.  To close gates is not the answer to any problem.  It is too dictatorial.  Our people always take care of dictators.  I do not know how the gate that was closed by the Office of Public Works survived and was not blasted out of existence.  In future, if a problem arises the Office of Public Works should meet the people.  The people are not too bad when you have a chat with them.  I thank the Parliamentary Secretary and compliment him on his appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must bear in mind that the Office of Public Works is one of the most important departments of Government because of its close relation to our tourist industry.  It is anything but gratifying to find a reduction of £400,000 in the Estimate this year.  While we congratulate the Minister for Finance as being a super financial expert, in this case he has gone to astronomical heights to deceive us by the non-introduction of the mini-budget. He has gone another way about it&mdash;curtailing expenditure&mdash; rather than telling us straight and fair that he has to introduce a budget.  The <Col N="1432" /> reduction of £400,000 in the Estimate is brutal having regard to the demands for development.  The Minister for Finance is hiding the fact that he requires a mini-budget.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that there is a provision of £3 million for the erection and maintenance of schools in the current year. Even in the face of the demands for education, particularly secondary and vocational education, the overcrowding in schools and the fact that this year children leaving primary schools could not be accommodated in secondary or vocational schools, the Parliamentary Secretary has not provided for an increase in the amount in this subhead. In Limerick city this year there were almost 100 boys who could not obtain accommodation in secondary schools and we had to tackle the problem as best we could.  Some of them were diverted to schools not of their own denomination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I want to say.  I come now to garda stations. The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that new stations are in progress at Kilrush and Ennistymon in Clare, Dungloe, Portroe and Aclare, and tenders are under examination for new stations at Kiltyclogher and Birr. There is not one word about the provision of a central garda station in Limerick city.  This has been under discussion for nearly 20 years.  We <Col N="1434" /> have been pressing for something to be done for the past four or five years. Some action has been taken within the last five or six months.  There has been a survey of the building.  When work will begin is another matter.  If the present structure were under the control of a local authority it would have been condemned out of hand as a dangerous building ten or 15 years ago.  Unfortunately, we have no say in these matters.  It is a sad state of affairs to see a city like Limerick left with a shambles of a garda station. The men were forced to leave the station some three or four years ago and take lodgings in private houses around the city because the building was dangerous.  It was let fall into rack and ruin.  No money was spent on its upkeep.  I want an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that something will be done immediately to ensure that the gardaí in Limerick are properly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about the Shannon navigation.  I am glad he has taken upon himself responsibility for the development of the Shannon.  This should have been regarded as a matter of priority years ago in his office.  I seem to remember the Parliamentary Secretary being reported in the press as not agreeing to the closure of the Grand Canal in Dublin.  As the years go by, we find more and more people taking to the waterways.  Those of us connected with the Shannon know what a big attraction the waterways are.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will be generous in the development of our waterways.  On any day from the 17th March to the middle of October the Shannon is peppered with all kinds of craft.  Tourists come there from all over Europe because on the waterways they are safe; they avoid the dangers of the roads.  We can give them this amenity in ample supply.  I trust nothing will deter the Parliamentary Secretary in his approach to this important development. Jetties are urgently needed all along the Shannon.  From personal experience I know that the same people are coming back year after year and, every time they return, they bring newcomers with them.  That is proof of <Col N="1435" /> the demand there is for this type of holiday.</P>
    <P>There is a more or less hit-and-run approach to our parks, monuments and castles.  In the area I come from the approach is quite different.  We know the value of these attractions and what has been done in my area is a headline for the rest of the country.  The castles are booked out.  There is a waiting list.  Tourists come from as far away as the United States.  Nearly all tourists try to include in their itinerary a visit to our castles in Limerick and Clare.  This type of development should not be restricted.  At the moment, we are applying ourselves to the development of a further castle in the Limerick city area but, unfortunately, some years ago some 20 houses were erected in the courtyard of this historic castle. Both the Limerick City Council and the Shannon Development Authority have requested the Department of Local Government to have these houses demolished.  The houses were erected about 30 years ago but they are substandard houses.  If the Department of Local Government would allow us to do so we could replace these houses with new houses on a site 50 or 100 yards away.  We could then go ahead with the development of the famous King John's Castle in Nicholas Street, Limerick.  Plans have been made for the development of the banqueting hall and for a car park.  This castle would be comparable to the other castles in Clare and it would be a great boost to the tourist attractions of the area. Tourists would be given the historical background of the area, so that this castle would probably be even more attractive than those already developed. We would be very grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would take steps to get the work started.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary complains of being understaffed and he complains in particular of the lack of adequate professional staff.  There is only one answer to that and that is to pay them properly.  I know many of the men who are employed by the Board of Works but they are grossly underpaid.  Professional men can get more lucrative employment elsewhere. <Col N="1436" /> As for the unskilled and semi-skilled workers, I know many men in these categories who have been employed by the Board of Works for five, ten or 15 years but who are still on a temporary basis.  It is difficult to believe that, but it is true.  These men have no superannuation or pension facilities. What do we think we are doing in 1969 when we ask men to work under these conditions?  Their work is no kidglove stuff.  They work in all types of weather.  At this very moment there are 15 or 20 men up to their knees in muck along the banks of the Shannon, working hard all day long.  Engineers and overseers are in much the same position.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Lands has just said, it is all very well for fellows in offices to make plans.  It is indeed.  They are great fellows.  But the unfortunate man down on the banks of the Shannon at this moment has nothing to look forward to.  If he becomes ill, there is no more about him.  Some of these men find it difficult to even get protective clothing.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that he will get adequate staff if he is prepared to pay them properly for the work they are doing and to compensate them for the conditions under which they have to work.</P>
    <P>Changes should be made in the Board of Works.  Those gentlemen sitting on their plush chairs and with their carpeted floors should go down and see for themselves the conditions under which these men have to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing about Limerick is that she knows her people. Limerick has not been fooled by a lot of the fly-by-nights who chanced to come along.  However, I wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the grave need for construction on the banks of the Barrington.  It is constantly subject to flooding and breakage in the banks.  While the machines are down there and the men are working, it would be simple to take it over. They have everything ready there and all the appliances.  They will gladly move in and continue the job if the Parliamentary Secretary gives them the go ahead.</P>
      <P>There is, then, the question of the legality of the action taken by the Office of Public Works with regard to the drainage of the Maigue.  An injunction has been sought and general opinion has it that it will be granted. The matter will come up very shortly. In the meantime, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to divert his attentions to the Mulcaire.  Legal matters can drag out and work can be held up. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to concentrate his efforts now on much-needed improvement works on the adjacent Mulcaire and Groody Rivers.  One of the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessors, God be good to him, promised us some years ago that that would get his immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reduction of £400,000 in this Estimate compared with last year. That in itself is a sort of mini-budget. Bear in mind that salaries and wages have gone up as well as the cost of up-to-date machinery.  Some of these machines cost thousands of pounds but, if we are to get ahead with this allimportant job of drainage, more machines must be purchased.  The labour force is available to work them. The reduction of £400,000, compared with last year, indicates that there will be a curtailment of the amount of work to be done.  Let us get our priorities right.  If we curtail progress, every-body will lose.  A greater sum of money <Col N="1438" />&mdash;not less&mdash;is necessary if the work which requires to be done is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is young in the job.  I hope he will take his courage in his hands and do the right thing.  I trust the position in regard to conditions of employment will be rectified and brought up to date.  The tourist industry should not be allowed to suffer any loss as a result of the reduction of £400,000 in the Vote this year.  I hope this very necessary drainage work will be done without any more waste of time.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I wish the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, well in his new office.  I look forward to seeing the results of his management of that important Department in the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment to the Office of Public Works.  From what I know of him, he will make a tremendous impression on this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down my way, there is a very old song: &ldquo;She lived beside the Anner at the foot of Slievenamon.&rdquo;  If the lady referred to in the song were living there today she would be up to her neck in water from flooding by the River Suir and the River Anner. Twenty-two years ago, the late Deputy Michael Donnellan promised to have the River Suir drained, and so also did Deputy James Ryan.  They said it would be done &ldquo;in the near future.&rdquo; I fail to see how a period of 22 years could be regarded as &ldquo;in the near future.&rdquo;  There are 138 farms, amounting to thousands of acres, flooded in this district each winter.  Last winter, we had the most severe flooding of all.  A number of villages were isolated for a number of weeks; roads were cut off; bridges were severely damaged. All that was due to the fact that the river needs more drainage from one end to the other.  It is absolutely essential that the work be undertaken immediately.  We are now promised 1972 but, on the other hand, we were already promised 1965.  The land reclamation scheme is useless in that area.  Even if a man drains his farm, his land is flooded again.  A veterinary <Col N="1439" /> surgeon was driving along the road when the river burst its banks.  His car was not found for three weeks.  That will indicate how serious the flooding there is.  Many shops in Ardfinnan, Golden, Cahir, and so on, had to close down their businesses during the flooding season.  I fear this matter has not sufficiently been stressed by various deputations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  He should now insist that this critical work will be carried out without further delay.</P>
    <P>With regard to primary schools, I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works on the recent Ballylooby private scheme.  I would criticise RTE on this matter.  They came down to our area and used photographs which showed the regional scheme passing down beside the Office of Public Works private pump which had been built in Ballylooby National School.  This was a faked photograph and was shown publicly in the press. This was done to discredit the Office of Public Works.  The producer of that programme was approached before-hand. It was pointed out to him that this was a falsification but nevertheless he ignored this completely.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the full support of the many decent people in that area who realise that both he and the parish priest have worked for a long time to have water put into the local school there.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the people in the Office of Public Works in my area on the fantastic job of work they have been doing.  There have been complaints of rats in the classrooms at Knockavilla school.  I should like to see the Department clearing up this matter properly.  I should like also to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the architecture of the school for mentally handicapped children outside Cashel, Scoil Cormac.  More imagination could be used in the building of the ordinary primary schools. The plans for them have been the same over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>I disagree with many of the things which the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works have been doing.  They have continued their <Col N="1440" /> attitude of &ldquo;hands off, let us do it&rdquo; but they have not done sufficient. There have been 29,000 visitors to the Rock of Cashel this summer.  The Office of Public Works provided four guides who have proved to be a tremendous asset.  Guides have been needed there for many years.  The guides were not local people as they should have been.  They have not the natural attachment to this marvellous monument.  The positions were not advertised in the ordinary public advertising circles as they should have been. The floodlighting of this castle is done by a commercial firm.  They were given the contract without any strings attached.  The local committee would like to see a small plaque erected stating that the lighting is sponsored by Messrs.  Guinness.  I fail to see how there could be any objection to a six-inch plaque under the existing notice of the Office of Public Works.  I cannot see that such a plaque would distract visitors from the natural background of the Rock of Cashel.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>There are no accessible pathways around the Castle.  I would like to see an interest taken also in the graves which are now just grassy mounds, heaped with broken headstones.  These should be cleaned up because of the large number of summer visitors each year.  Another point is that cars should not be allowed to proceed to the top of the steep hill.  There should be a gateway and a barrier across it.  There is a danger of cars slipping down the hill and colliding with people coming up it.  The hill is too steep for elderly people and some sort of suitable, gradual pathway should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should take the initiative in restoring some of our old castles to their original state. Possibly their interior decoration could be restored to what it was originally. We would like to see the restoration and re-roofing of the castle on the Rock of Cashel and a museum there as a centrepiece.  This has not been agreed to yet, although it may be agreed to sometime in the future.  There are no toilet facilities adjacent to many of the national monuments.  The toilets <Col N="1441" /> which are in existence near monuments are disgusting.  The keeper of one such toilet gets £15 a year to clean it.  No member of the Office of Public Works staff would come to clean it for that sum of money.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the garda station at Ballinure.  In this station a garda was expected to move from a house he had built to a village with a population of 40 or 50 people. He was expected to bring his wife to where there were no water or toilet facilities.  This was due to a tenancy problem.  The house he was being given belonged to the local squire in the area who was not prepared to grant a long lease of it.  This matter could be dealt with in the Parliamentary's Secretary's office in conjunction with the Department of Justice.  Gardaí have been asked to go into one-man stations but have not been given the comfort of ordinary decent homes with water and toilet facilities.  The Office of Public Works have not provided proper amenities in such cases.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention Clogheen station.  There are very few garda stations which are actually owned by the Government.  The majority of them are leased.  In the case of the Lismore station in County Waterford, the lease has expired but the new station has not even been planned yet.  I would like to see the present garda stations being renovated.  They are more like mausoleums in which the gardaí in occupation are more like morticians. Their accommodation is dull and dreary, the floors and walls are in bad condition and the bedding is monastic-like. I know the Parliamentary Secretary will do a good job.  I am just pointing out to him some of the things which should have been done by the Office of Public Works over the past few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and to thank him for the interest he has shown in Kilkenny since his appointment.  He has shown interest in the public park and in the design centre.  I wish him every success in his new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Estimate <Col N="1442" /> for the Parliamentary Secretary's office has been reduced by £500,000.  I consider arterial drainage the main aspect of the work of the Office of Public Works.  This is generally accepted.  I hope that none of this cut will be applied to arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>We in Kilkenny have a big flooding problem.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be conversant with this because he was concerned with an industry in Kilkenny for some time which depended on the River Nore for some of its power.  We have had talk of drainage of the Nore since 1947, when we had disastrous flooding in Kilkenny city and people were taken in boats from the top windows of their houses.  We have had agitation from the local authorities, from local traders and from the tenants of houses for drainage of the Nore for a quarter of a century.  I am glad to see that a survey is to be started on the Nore but I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how long this survey is likely to take?  When can we expect that drainage of the Nore will commence? When the people of Kilkenny hear that a survey is being undertaken they will expect that drainage is just around the corner, that we will have drainage this year or next year.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give us an inkling of when the Nore might be drained?  If drainage will take some time, some interim work should be carried out for the relief of Kilkenny city.  There are weirs along the River Nore.  Fortunately, some years ago one of these weirs was blown up by an unknown person.  This was a wonderful job and relieved a lot of flooding in the area.  However, there is also a weir on the downstream side of the city and it is felt locally by engineers and other people qualified to give an opinion that if this weir were removed it would also relieve flooding to a great extent.  A problem would then arise in regard to what we call the town pond in Kilkenny which would go dry in the summer months, but perhaps a sluice gate could be erected on this to keep water there during the dry period.</P>
    <P>We also have severe flooding in Thomastown.  I heard last week of a house in Thomastown which is still <Col N="1443" /> damp, with water still coming up through the floor, since the last flooding. These unfortunate people have nowhere else to go.  I do not think there was a house built in Thomastown for many years.  It is a terrible state of affairs that people with young families must live in these conditions.  It would be only justice to them to hurry up drainage of the Nore.  Last year, in common with everywhere else, we had a flood something like that of 1947.  It went up to the first storeys again.  The people are very annoyed about this and I feel it my duty to point it out in Dáil Éireann to the Parliamentary Secretary and to bring home to him the need for immediate action on the Nore flooding problem.</P>
    <P>Related to this flooding we also have a small river, the Breagagh, in Kilkenny which floods three or four times each year.  If we have a half day's heavy rain the people of Kilkenny say: &ldquo;The Breagagh is out.&rdquo;  They do not even have to look.  We had initial drainage this year of the Breagagh. The local authority got a 50 per cent grant for part drainage of this river. However, unless the Nore drainage is carried out, this is a useless scheme because when the Nore rises the water cannot get away from the Breagagh. An unfortunate part of the Breagagh problem is that it floods one of the oldest abbeys in use in Ireland&mdash;it is still used three or four times a year. This is the Black Abbey run by the Dominican monks.  It has been renovated and put in order by them, even though they are not in great financial circumstances.  They did a very good job on the abbey.  It is highly regarded by antiquarians and is one of the places to see when one comes to Kilkenny&mdash;and that is saying something because we have Roth House and many other interesting buildings. This is another reason why the Parliamentary Secretary should give urgent consideration to the drainage of the Nore and bring it forward.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works for their work on Kilkenny Castle and the national park which <Col N="1444" /> they have taken over and are working on at present.  This is a wonderful job and the thanks of the people of Kilkenny are due to the Board of Works for the interest they have shown and the work they are carrying out there.  I should also like to thank Lord Ormonde for his kind donation of the Castle and gardens to the people of Kilkenny.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary is drawing up plans for the future use of the castle.  I would ask him to bring the local authorities into this scheme.  The committee which was set up initially is a private one.  I must also thank Mr. Lytle who gave a very welcome subscription to this committee and really started restoration of the castle.  However, this is a private committee and I do not think the local authority know what is going on in the development of the gardens and castle.  They were never brought in or consulted.  They are the representatives of the people and this is public property which is being developed with public money. These people should be consulted and should be brought on to the committee or into consultation somewhere.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the amount of money for schools in the Estimate. I know the figure of £3½ million seems very large but a big problem has been created by the new system of closing down the smaller schools and making larger and more comprehensive ones. This is a very commendable job.  We all agree with it.  Consideration must be given to the children's education and so on.  However, this has created the problem of providing places in schools. In our area we have solved this problem to some extent with prefabricated buildings.  While I do not think this is the solution, I know it is fulfilling a need.  However, we should be giving better education to our children and the Parliamentary Secretary should provide more money for the building of schools.  Last year, as I said, £3½ million was given but nobody would expect that that figure would build the same number of schools this year.  If we go back to the early 1960's when we had an expenditure of almost that figure on schools, we can see that this is really a step backwards in the provision <Col N="1445" /> of proper schooling for our children.</P>
    <P>When the classrooms are overcrowded it creates a problem for the children as well as the teachers.  There is no doubt that children cannot get proper teaching in overcrowded classrooms. The teachers have great difficulty trying to teach them and they are only doing the most essential things with them.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter and see that much more money is given towards the provision of suitable schools for our children.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to housing for married gardaí.  I have met some of those people in my area who are living 30 and 40 miles and, in some instances, even greater distances from their families.  Those men are transferred to new posts but there is no consideration given to their housing needs.  This is wrong both socially and morally.  Those gardaí are obliged to live far away from their wives and children for long periods.  I know a certain amount of housing is provided for gardaí through the Board of Works and the National Building Agency, but when there is need to transfer those gardaí the Garda commissioner should not transfer married gardaí to areas where there is not proper housing for them.  Those men should be given some consideration in this matter.  I do not know what amount of housing the Board of Works provide for gardaí but I would urge them to put it in a fairly high order of priority.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to stress again to the Parliamentary Secretary the need for drainage of the Nore. This is one of the biggest topics in our area.  In the Kilkenny area we have a vast amount of drained land now in use and this is very commendable. You can see large areas of land which were flooded for many years and now they have become fertile.  It is wonderful to see the change which can come over flooded land after a scheme of this nature.  You would not think it was the same place.  You can see plenty of grass there for cattle and crops growing as well.  However, when this water is brought off the land it is drained into rivers which are already working <Col N="1446" /> to capacity to get the water away and now they are overloaded.  This can be seen in every area where one of those schemes is completed.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we have our priorities right in the matter of drainage?  First of all we drain the land and this water flows into the rivers nearby.  In the Nore Valley we have real good farming land, but it is flooded for six months every year.  Those people are getting impatient because, with the extra water pouring into the river from this drainage scheme, the flooding in the nearby area becomes more acute and water remains on the land for a longer period. This land has been reduced almost to waste land.  It is bad enough for those people to lose their land but, in addition, they find it very difficult to get any abatement of rates.  The whole matter of land and river drainage should be investigated and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other speakers in welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary's statement this year.  It contains in many areas attitudes which are quite progressive and some very sensible innovations. We should also consider the fact that this morning the Minister for Lands showed rare political and Cabinet courage when he strongly expressed his desire to see his own Department amalgamated, particularly in respect of land functions, with a revitalised Department of Agriculture.  That was the first confession on the part of a Cabinet Minister of this Dáil to ensure and accept the validity of a great many of the proposals and suggestions made in the Devlin Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands' objective reassessment of the role of his Department in the changing 1970s should be followed with even greater alacrity by Deputy Noel Lemass, notwithstanding his very new appointment to the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  We must ask why it is necessary that this urgent transition of functions should take place.  I feel a basic and a fundamental restructuring of the Office of Public Works is very necessary because over the years the <Col N="1447" /> Office of Public Works has had a reputation, which nobody particularly envies, of being incapable, because of the role in which it was cast, of effectively co-ordinating its functions on behalf of various Government Departments. As a result, they have inherited allegations of bureaucracy, of complete ineffectiveness and of a lack of a sense of purpose in the formulation of policy in relation to public works.</P>
    <P>I do not think these major criticisms are of the staff, of the senior officers, they are criticisms of the structure and of the emasculated setting in which the Office of Public Works are expected to operate.  These criticisms have been quoted in the Devlin Report which points out that there have been criticisms time and again in relation to the Office of Public Works to the effect that long term programmes are subject to extremely short term budgetary allocations, that starts are very often delayed, that projects with set completion dates are very often extended, that the overheads are increased substantially during the operation of the programmes and that completion dates are held back or put back.</P>
    <P>We must come to the basic recommendation in the Devlin Report, which I heartily endorse, and it is that the Department of Finance should now relinquish their responsibility for the Office of Public Works which should assume a new role under, as is proposed, a new Department, a Department of Public Services.  This is a concept which is close to the heart of socialists who believe in the practical reality of public services for the people of the nation.</P>
    <P>We must ask, therefore, how would this transition come about.  I do not think I could make any better approach to that than the one in the Devlin Report, which I shall summarise.  The proposal is that the Office of Public Works should shed arterial drainage completely.  The main benefit of this is, of course, in respect of improvements to agricultural land.  This has been supported, in effect, by the Minister for Lands when this morning he abolished himself and expressed the wish that the Cabinet would agree with <Col N="1448" /> him.  The main services should be linked with land improvement through the Department of Agriculture and therefore arterial drainage should naturally be an effective division of the Department of Agriculture and Lands.  That division should be completely responsible within that Department for the designing of arterial drainage and for the procurement of facilities for the execution and subsequent management of drainage. Accordingly, the necessary equipment for that work, now under the auspices of the Office of Public Works, should be transferred to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Coming from a coastline constituency like Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, I find it incomprehensible that marine work, work in relation to Shannon navigation, in relation to harbour boards and so on, should continue to be under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.  It is only logical, reasonable and rational that we should have marine work, harbour work and Shannon navigation transferred to the Department of Transport and, I would add, of Communications, as advocated by the Devlin Report&mdash;a logical evolution of State responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is preposterous that the Office of Public Works should be responsible for schools.  We suggest strongly, without in any way going outside the scope of the Estimate, that one of the major inhibitions in having effective school development in a physical sense is that the Office of Public Works must act as only a part-agency on behalf of the Department of Education.  It is only logical therefore, that this sector of the Office of Public Works should become the direct responsibility of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Office of Public Works have any great function in relation to parks and national monuments. There is a suggestion in the Devlin Report, which could invigorate the cultural environment of the country, to the effect that there should be a Department of National Culture. Mr. Seán MacEntee used to say, when it was mentioned, that he used to reach for his two guns in order to shoot the idea down.  I strongly urge <Col N="1449" /> that there is need for the setting up of this Department and that parks and national monuments should be under the auspices of such a Department. Naturally, public buildings should remain under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>These, in brief, are the kind of transitional arrangements which are very necessary and which must be brought in in the new technological era facing the country.  A by-product of that approach would be that the mobility and expertise of the staffs currently engaged in public works, particularly the professional staffs such as engineers and architects&mdash;there are 104 professional officers in that office&mdash; would be considerably broadened and their career prospects considerably opened up.  They would no longer look to their own internal structure if this development were brought about.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who criticise public servants, who have no oportunity of answering back, merely for the sake of glib criticism.  There is sufficient intelligence in the staff in that office to see the basic merits of these proposals. Many of the engineers and architects related to and associated with that office whom I have met all over the country suffer from frustrations in regard to the need for these changes. Therefore, the Government and the the Parliamentary Secretary should seriously consider them.</P>
    <P>In relation to schools, I appreciate that we have no direct opportunity on this Estimate to criticise the provision of schools as such, but if the changes I have advocated were to come about the situation in relation to school construction could be changed dramatically. It is an appalling fact that in Ireland at the moment&mdash;the Board of Works are not authorised to do anything about it&mdash;there are 1,200 schools not even equipped with electric current. There are 2,000 schools which this winter are heated by open fires.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I do not propose to develop the point <Col N="1450" /> further.  The work of the Office of Public Works in relation to that elementary aspect could be considerably enhanced if there were developments on the lines I have been advocating. I can develop that point on another occasion.  In regard to the Government renting office blocks, there has been a justifiable degree of public concern and criticism over many aspects of the renting by Government Departments of privately erected office blocks in Dublin city.  I do not entirely accept repeated assertions by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance that the net balance of advantage lies in the renting of such premises.  I accept that capital resources are scarce but I suggest that we need much more information on the costing basis on which the Government arrive at their decisions, particularly long-term cost benefit analysis which is not given to the House to enable it to arrive at a rational and objective assessment of whether it would be better for a State Department to rent a privately-constructed office block or for the State itself to erect such an office block and use it for its own purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not particularly accuse the Parliamentary Secretary, as he is new to this post, but the Government themselves have been less than frank with the House about some of the arrangements&mdash;putting it politely&mdash;that they have entered into with various private agencies, firms and private construction consortia in the erection of office blocks.  For the benefit of the House therefore, I demand considerably more information than we have been given today.  This is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary in respect of harbour works that, now that the permanent terminal in Dún Laoghaire is working satisfactorily, he is making arrangements to have the work of restoration of the East Pier put in hand next spring.  This is generally welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards ports generally, I want again to make the comment that all the piecemeal work done in various harbours and ports in selected areas where the Board of Works have responsibility, <Col N="1451" /> pales into bureaucratic farce when there should be in the country&mdash;and admittedly the staffs of the Office of Public Works and the various boards could be integrated into it&mdash;a national ports authority of a State character which would have direct responsibility for harbour construction work rather than the current mad situation of a bureaucratic, inefficient Dublin Port and Docks Board, responsible for a particular sector and various harbour boards and harbour commissioners throughout the country&mdash;laws unto themselves in some respects and responsible in others&mdash;and then the Office of Public Works trying to develop areas such as Dún Laoghaire port.</P>
    <P>There is a valid case for the exercise of imagination internally in the Department to ensure that we get a national ports authority responsible for construction, for the work of the labour force in these areas and, of course, for decasualising dockers in this process.  Therefore, I strongly recommend that to the Minister as a development well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome and endorse the comments of the previous speaker in respect of Kilkenny Castle and the giving of it to the nation by Lord Ormonde, who sold the castle to a local committee for a nominal sum.  As one who has visited the picture gallery in the west wing of this castle I believe that when it is opened to the public at the end of 1970 we shall have acquired yet another aspect of our national heritage for the Irish people as a whole.  While in Kilkenny a local committee purchased the castle for a nominal sum I recommend that in these areas generally there should be greater involvement of the local community. I am rather nervous that where monuments of this nature are taken over by the Office of Public Works and responsibility assumed by them they are put into operation almost on a faceless basis for the benefit of the public with very little local involvement in the form of local committees being consulted.  While this might involve the Office of Public Works in long arguments with local people as to <Col N="1452" /> the best form of development, you would be fostering local pride in monuments and historic institutions and acting in the overall interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>Equally, I endorse Deputy Begley's request to take Innisfallen Island into public ownership.  There should be urgent negotiations between the American, Mr. McShane, and Bord Fáilte and the Department to bring this magnificent piece of our heritage into public ownership.  Likewise, the Office of Public Works should assume from the State in the event of its structure not changing, much greater authority and responsibility for bringing into public ownership various public amenities, more public amenity areas and more monument areas for the general benefit.  Many of these areas are still closed to the people, to the children of the country.  Many river and foreshore areas, many monument areas are closed and this is quite scandalous.  I, therefore, urge the Government to take much greater initiative in this matter even though they may, in some respects, impinge on the so-called sacred right of private property when, in fact, national community trust for such land and such areas is of far greater importance for future development.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note the examination by the Office of the feasibility of a blind people's centre in one of the Dublin parks.  This will be welcomed very strongly by the House and I am also pleased to note that an area would be set aside where blind people could move at ease and where there would be special seats provided and special amenities such as flowers identified by smell and other flowers identified by name plates in braille.  I congratulate the Office of Public Works on that development and I strongly recommend that the results of the feasibility study and investigations should be forwarded to other local authorities in the country to enable them to consider the introduction of similar centres.  I suggest Cork and Kilkenny, for example, as two areas where this work could begin almost immediately.</P>
    <P>I must now become somewhat critical in dealing with a matter which has <Col N="1453" /> obtained certain publicity of late, namely, the Hume Street-St. Stephen's Green development.  I am appalled by the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary in the matter.  While I appreciate that he himself has no direct responsibility for it and is merely speaking in the light of decisions already taken by the Government prior to his taking office, nevertheless I suggest to him and the Government that, in the year of European conservation in which the Government proposes to take special action this very anticonservation decision of the Government is to be greatly deplored.  It is blatantly anticonservation and quite contrary to the stated desire of the planning officers of Dublin Corporation who were over-ridden by the Minister for Local Government on &mdash; I suggest &mdash; spurious grounds and, on this basis, I think the Government should now reconsider their approach and realise that this area is well worthy of preservation.</P>
    <P>There is little point in disputing that, notwithstanding the very careful statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, all the indications are that the principal beneficiary of this disgraceful decision of the Government will be the Green Property Company Limited as they are obviously in a clear position to make a far superior offer since they now own the rest of the adjoining cleared sites in the area.  Therefore, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary's speech has been much less than frank and very much open to criticism.  I suggest also that the figure of £40,000 given for essential restoration work on these two buildings represents the absolute total maximum in terms of development.</P>

      <P>In respect of these two buildings, the alleged elimination of dry rot and the bringing into the building of new lighting and heating and the total re-wiring might all add up to £40,000 but I suggest that for <Col N="1454" /> £10,000 dry rot could be got rid of in both buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt of that whatever, but the preservation of our national heritage, and more particularly the preservation of one of the most important elements of our inheritance of 18th century architecture in Dublin city is important, in my opinion.  I suggest that the cost of the re-wiring, redecorating and the introduction of new heating of other aspects could quite easily be spread over a period of two, three or four years, and I have no doubt whatever that on that basis these two buildings could be preserved.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the Government's decision on this matter. He now has a proposal before him from the chairman of An Taisce that the Government should agree to give these two properties by special sale or by long lease to this national organisation which has flourished in the past 12 months in terms of development and which, by and large, is a responsible body.  That proposal which is now before the Government is most worthy of serious consideration.  The decision to sell these two houses is to be deplored and I would strongly suggest that in this year of conservation it is an elementary aspect and worthy of consideration by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay Deputy Tunney who has been waiting patiently for the past two or three weeks to get in on this Estimate.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Office of Public Works in, I would hope, close consultation with the Department of Local Government, should ensure that the environmental heritage of our people, as represented by ancient monuments and by scenic areas, should not be desecrated any further by the rash of advertising hoardings of a gross commercial nature which disfigure many of our national parks and areas close to them, and many of our national <Col N="1455" /> monuments and, indeed, many of our foreshores and river banks.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that the elementary aesthetic values of the country in respect of these areas are preserved.  I would urge that whether they are petrol station signs, or commercial hoardings with advertising signs, or neon signs of any kind, the most stringent of controls should be put into operation.  I would commend to the Minister what has happened in many European countries in respect of the conservation of public areas for recreational or cultural development. All this must certainly merit everincreasing attention from the Government. It is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point now in relation to Leinster House and it is a point which I consider to be of some importance now that one has become, for a short time at any rate, a member of this elevated club.  The areas surrounding Leinster House should, perhaps, be reconsidered by the Government. I would strongly suggest that there is no valid reason why Members of this House should perpetually have to come in through the back door.  The main entrance to Leinster House should be the entrance which was originally designed as the main entrance, namely, the extremely fine entrance to this building, which members of the public do not see and which Members of the House know is in an area of very heavy traffic in Dublin city.  The whole building would be much more attractive if we had the entrance in Merrion Square as the official entrance to Leinster House. Indeed, I may say that this was the case when the late President Kennedy was in Dublin.  It was through that entrance that he visited this House.  It would mean much more work for the Office of Public Works but it would make this building much more attractive.</P>
    <P>To develop, if I may say so with no sense of sarcasm, the aesthetic cultural sense of Deputies and of the public visiting this House, we should obtain some paintings on loan from the National Gallery&mdash;which no one <Col N="1456" /> in this House ever seems to visit, with due respect to my colleagues.  The bare bureaucratic rooms of the three parties could be brightened and certainly made more attractive if we had some of our heritage of paintings on display on loan from the National Gallery.  These are two suggestions which I think are worthy of consideration by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat the plea which I made in respect of the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division for a national pension and mortality scheme.  This should be introduced as a matter of urgency for workers in the Office of Public Works rather than the miserly and sparse gratuity scheme which is in operation in that sector. There is a great deal of internal cynicism amongst the staffs of the Office of Public Works because they see the different levels of treatment on the different levels of staff by the Government. Therefore, I would commend very strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary that elementary social parity of conditions of employment should be brought into that sector as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would hope that when we assemble this time next year to consider this Estimate and the sub-estimate related to it, the Parliamentary Secretary will have been given a new role in the Government.  I should like to see him involved in a department of public services together with his colleagues now representing him in this House.  We should have a completely new department of public services here with a realignment and a reinvigoration of the Office of Public Works. Those are my comments on the Estimate. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on a very comprehensive and competent report.  Indeed, I congratulate him on his general approach to the whole range of matters affecting members of this House.  He has certainly been very helpful in those matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> I intend to confine myself exclusively, with one short exception to which I will refer later on, to one matter in this Estimate.  It has been said by earlier speakers that on occasions like this one should avoid the attraction of speaking on something which might be purely local.  In so far as we do not all honour that, I do not feel all that concerned.  However, while the matter about which I intend to speak may appear local, it certainly has a metropolitan and, indeed, national significance.  I speak about the Phoenix Park or, as Dublin people correctly call it, &ldquo;the park.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would avail of the opportunity to compliment the Board of Works, the officials, the staff and the superintendent of the Phoenix Park for the manner in which hitherto they have succeeded in blending with the natural beauty of the park the scientific information which they have in the matter of development.  We have there a park which is unique not in Ireland but in Europe.  I would wish the park to retain its present appearance, its present characteristics, and in so far as I see slight developments which cause me some concern.  I speak about them.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to remind the Members of the House and the people of the Board of Works of the important role, apart from aesthetic considerations, which the Phoenix Park plays in the lives of our people, particularly the people of Dublin, and when I say Dublin I mean the county, because with modern development and progress as we call it, we have now reached the extraordinary position that Dubliners can no longer go to places like Churchtown, Palmerstown, Rathcoole, shortly, and Blanchardstown, for a breath of fresh air, and now find it necessary to move back towards the city to avail of that urge which we all feel for fresh air, freedom of movement and a place to go picnicking.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned, therefore, about one or two developments which have occurred in the Phoenix Park whereby certain commercial establishments have arisen.  It may be shown that these establishments are supplying <Col N="1458" /> a very important service, that they constitute a very definite attraction for the tourist, but in so far as their activities tend to lessen the freedom hitherto enjoyed by the people who frequent the park, it is a matter that should be watched.  I am talking about riding schools.  I understand that Bord Fáilte is very anxious that these schools should exist.  In so far as they supply a need for home people and for visitors, they might be encouraged but in so far as they cut across the natural right of the person in Dublin&mdash;I do not talk about the ordinary person in Dublin; we are all ordinary people&mdash;to enjoy the park, it is a matter which should be watched; and in so far as it savours of the Phoenix Park being used for commercial purposes, it is a matter which should be watched.</P>
    <P>I speak in those terms while, at the same time, I am friendly with some of the people who are engaged in this activity.  I do not say they should be stopped but that a section of the park should be set aside for these people and that certain restrictions should be put on them, especially on a Sunday morning when parents are out with their young children walking in the park, as is their entitlement, when they may see advancing towards them ten or 12 horses, in some cases ridden by inexperienced riders.  This impinges on the right of the person using the park and should be controlled or curtailed, but it certainly should not be allowed to develop any more than it has to date.</P>
    <P>Again, in this connection I speak on another matter to which I cannot offer any solution.  In this age of concrete and tarmacadam, in this age of the superstructure, in this age when we talk about retaining our Georgian houses, I share with all the Members of this House, I am sure, the satisfaction of viewing the serenest and most tranquil scene of a beast browsing and a horse moving through the Phoenix Park. Nevertheless, the matter of the cattle in the park is something to which the Board of Works must look.  I do not know exactly how many cattle they cater for during the six months' grazing, but in the last year especially there have been at least 20 accidents arising from the fact that people from the <Col N="1459" /> country, or maybe Dubliners, are not expecting in the dark of the night or on roads that are not all that well lighted, a beast to jump out suddenly.  This will present a new problem to the park superintendent, an excellent man, in the matter of what he can do with the grass in the event of its not being grazed.  I am not suggesting that we should discontinue the facilities afforded to farmers or other people to put cattle in the park, but I am concerned that it endangers the lives of the people who normally use the park, especially at night time.  In a place like the park I am always reluctant to suggest any change, and having seen the type of lampstandard which we have had the misfortune to get in the city of Dublin, I would be slow to suggest that we should have new lamp-standards in the Phoenix Park, but I do suggest that the lighting should be improved.</P>
    <P>Would it be feasible, in this connection for the board to widen the roads, especially the by-roads in the park? The by-laws do not permit a person to park a car on the greenery and he has no option but to park on the road.  Some of the roads are quite narrow and I think without affecting the general pattern in the park, we could afford to knock a yard off these by-roads on either side making the park a very pleasant place for all of us who enjoy it so much.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the park superintendent and his staff for the work they are doing.  They are people about whom we hear very little and as they are employees of the Board of Works we are often very ready to criticise them.  I do not know whether it was a local or central decision to reduce the staff on the gates.  It is vital that the park gates be manned because of the usage which the park is getting. The Board of Works policy is that the number of men engaged in manning the gates must be reduced.  We have a situation in the park at the moment where some gates are not manned at all.  These gatemen were able to watch and report on any doubtful person who might enter the park and on the entry of commercial vehicles not normally allowed in the park.  I am at a loss to <Col N="1460" /> know the reasons for the decision not to man the gates and the Parliamentary Secretary might explain the reasons behind it.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Board on the manner in which the park has been managed.  I hope, as custodians of the park, they will continue to look upon it as a place where young and old, rich and poor may go and enjoy themselves for half an hour or half a day without being charged anything.  If they continue to watch the park as they have been doing it will continue to grow in wonder and beauty and will be a centre to which people, not only from this country, but from Europe will be attracted.</P>
    <P>I end on what I hope will not be taken as a political note.  References have already been made to staff.  I admire Deputy Coughlan's references. He reminded us of how difficult it was for people sitting on carpets to appreciate the hardship, trials and labours of those who may be outdoors. I share Deputy Coughlan's concern and because of that I feel compelled to refer to the references made by Deputy Keating about the staff of this House.  I am not saying he made an attack on them but he referred to the dust which had not been removed from the venetian blinds and to the dust and papers which had not been removed from his room and from the lift.  In an effort to suggest aesthetical refinements, Deputy Keating overlooked a very important point, as far as I am concerned, he forgot that he was reflecting on the quality of the work done by the lady workers in this building.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Keating and I are happy, snug and comfortable in our own beds in our own homes, the ladies who perform these duties are already on their buses or on foot making for this establishment.  In a contribution where he castigated the Board of Works because of the type of furniture provided in an office where he worked, because in Abbotstown as against Moore Park they did not have paintings and flowers, it was remiss of him to reflect on the character of the ladies looking after this establishment.  Perhaps I am being mean towards Deputy <Col N="1461" /> Keating, I would have preferred him to be here to hear what I am saying but I hope, if he gets an opportunity, he will withdraw this remark.  I do feel that there should be a certain <i>esprit de corps</i> when making complaints about workers in front of their boss.</P>

    <P>We have got to get our priorities right in relation to the expenditure of this money.  We should consider the most urgent demands and where expenditure would bring the greatest benefit.  I would like to know if we are making proper efforts to have a survey made in the areas where the demand is greatest.  We notice that the sum of £50,000 has been allocated for arterial drainage.  I can see practically nothing allocated for arterial drainage in County Clare which would embrace the catchment area of the River Fergus. Over the past few years it has been forcibly stressed that this area is one that has been neglected.  The local authority and the elected Deputies have met on various occasions to try to impress on the Board of Works the necessity to reduce the flooding which has occurred there over a period of years and which has caused considerable damage.  Out of £50,000 set aside for arterial drainage survey there is only a token sum of £100 included for the Fergus this year, for this purpose, a reduction of £1,100 from last year, and I do not think we can expect much activity from that.  It seems that the efforts we made to impress on the Board of Works the necessity to give priority to a scheme where a town and its people have been flooded, have failed.  There is something drastically wrong here.  At every high tide and during a continuous period of rain, say over 24 hours, the merchants of Ennis and the householders in the town <Col N="1462" /> have to walk about in flooded shops and houses, remove damaged goods and get on to the streets.  Can we allow such a state of affairs to continue?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate when he intends to take action.  I realise that there is a priority list and I know the position of the Fergus catchment area on that list.  When there is an emergency, emergency measures must be taken.  In 1954, emergency measures were taken in regard to the flooding of the North Strand.  The then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Pa O'Donnell, immediately provided for proper liaison between the Departments concerned and charitable organisations and injected a sum of £70,000 to £100,000 for the recoupment of persons whose homes and furniture had been damaged.  Similar action should be taken in any town where damage is caused as a result of flooding.  That should have been considered in the case of Ennis in view of the fact that no provision has yet been made for a survey there.</P>
    <P>A substantial sum has been allocated for the preservation and maintenance of embankments One emergency has occurred in part of west Clare adjacent to the town of Kilkee &mdash;a tourist area.  Owing to the breaking down of embankments on the estuary of the Shannon west of Blackweir bridge, small farmers have experienced constant flooding of their land at very high tide.  Their incomes have been reduced as a result.  Production has been reduced and they are impeded from taking part in schemes within that pilot area designed to increase production. The Parliamentary Secretary should now divert a small sum to that area for the carrying out of a survey, as a start.  Later, if not this year, an adequate amount of the £220,000 provided for small schemes could be allocated to set in motion the necessary work for the prevention of flooding.</P>
    <P>We would probably be described as iconoclasts if we were to compare the necessity to preserve national monuments with the necessity to carry out drainage and other such work.  There is an increase this year of £25,000 in the provision for the preservation of national monuments.  That sum, of <Col N="1463" /> course, is necessary as monuments have been neglected.  However, having regard to the reduction of £400,000 in the Estimate one wonders if it is wise to spend the amount provided on national monuments within the present year in view of the emergencies such as I have cited that have arisen in certain areas.  We all admire beauty. We all would like to see cultural development.  However, these matters must compete with other matters that require urgent attention.  I would prefer to see a small part of the amount allocated for national monuments diverted towards the relief of persons in distress.  I do not know if that can be done but I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should give it some consideration.</P>
    <P>We notice a marked improvement within the past few years in bringing schools up to standard.  The fact cannot be ignored that a very powerful organisation, the INTO, in 1967, put pressure on the Minister for Education to have schools brought up to proper standard.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the question of providing schools for mentally handicapped children.  The necessity for such schools has been overlooked.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not want to interrupt the Deputy but would point out that the Office of Public Works has no responsibility for determining where schools should be built.  It is merely a building agency.  It is the Department of Education that is responsible for that determination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The Vote includes a provision for the maintenance of this House.  There are many and varied views as to how expenditure should be incurred.  If one takes the attitude that this House is not to be the showpiece of the nation, that money that might be available should be spent elsewhere in preference to being spent on this House, that is fair enough but, if one accepts that the Parliament House is the showpiece of the nation, where people send their representatives, where constituents visit Deputies, where tourists <Col N="1464" /> come daily, one would expect that much greater attention should be given to the cultural background, furnishings, <i>et cetera</i>, of the House.  I understand that from time to time we have to accept &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; for this House, that carpets, furnishings and so on, have come from Áras an Uachtaráin to this House.  Our manufacturers deserve better from us.  If we are to be proud of Irish manufacturers, this is the place where Irish-made furnishings and carpets should be displayed. This House should not be regarded as a place to which to issue &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; as they are called in the trade.  When it comes to decoration we should, I think, seek the advice of the College of Art in this and in the hanging of any pictures.  That advice should be of great benefit.  These are just a few suggestions.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of the activities of the Office of Public Works have different meanings for people in different counties, but I think drainage captures the attention of all.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give immediate attention to remedial action, particularly in those areas to which I have specifically referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take this opportunity of congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment?  Since his accession he has put a great deal of vigour into the work he is called upon to do.  He has been most willing to see me whenever I have any problem for his attention and he has dealt with any problem I have brought him with commendable speed.  I appreciate that.  His staff are always accessible and, having gained access, one appreciates the courtesy one receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate could be described as a local debate, on one hand, and a national debate on the other.  The Board of Works operates in practically all constituencies.  There is then the cultural arm, as it were, which deals with national monuments, national parks, and so on.  I want now to deal with a national problem.  It relates to Leinster House.  There have been many criticisms of what has been and what has not been done here. Quite frankly, when I came here in <Col N="1465" /> 1965 I was overawed.  I had never been in an environment like this before.  I was not used to the spaciousness and to the beauty of the place.  I have seen nothing to change my mind since. Many of us were brought up in houses far less glamorous than Leinster House and I think we should be glad to come in here, on any account, instead of throwing out criticisms willy-nilly.</P>
    <P>Many people have praised the work done in the foyer, particularly the paintwork.  It is a really beautiful blue. From the point of view of a Deputy, I think the effect is psychologically good.  The chandeliers were made in this country.  In Room 106, in which many committees sit, we have one of the most beautiful Waterford glass chandeliers I have ever seen.  It is a magnificent example of Irish craft.  We should be proud of it.  There is another equally good in the ante-chamber to the Seanad.  These are the things we want the public to see when they visit Leinster House.  The Seanad chamber is one of the most beautiful in this or any other country.  The ceiling is awe-inspiring aesthetically.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticisms made by Deputy Keating about dust and papers, and so on, Deputy Tully dealt at some length with how this kind of criticism reflects on those whom he and his party allege they represent, the workers.  If Deputy Keating were getting his own house decorated would there not be dust and papers around the place?  That is not unusual when work is being carried out around a house.  I think the dust here was kept to a minimum.  I was in and out during the summer and I certainly did not notice a great deal of dust about.  This kind of criticism is unfair.  It reflects on the workers, on the electricians putting in the badly needed installations, and on the cleaning personnel who come in here at all hours in the morning to make the place more comfortable for us.  We should keep these in mind when we are tempted to throw out criticisms willy-nilly.  It is neither fair nor reasonable to criticise knowing the kind of work that has to be done to improve the amenities for us.  There are still areas which remain undone. I imagine they will not be done until <Col N="1466" /> we go home for the Christmas vacation.</P>
    <P>The personnel of this House receive very little praise from us.  The ushers could be described as the &ldquo;unsung heroes&rdquo; of this Chamber.  They do a tremendous amount of work for Deputies.  They go to a great deal of trouble to find out where Deputies are when constituents come looking for them.  It would be very difficult to be critical of people who spend most of their working day on their feet, as these men do, and I should like now to pay special tribute to the ushers, the superintendent, and the Captain of the Guard for the manner in which they deal with people coming in here and the manner in which they deal with us.</P>

      <P>I have, perhaps, digressed a little but this seemed to be an opportune time to introduce a little good news to leaven all the bad news we hear from time to time.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy who said that perhaps we could bring some of these beautiful pictures from the various galleries and put them on display at Leinster House.  This is one of the showpieces of the nation and it is only right that we should make as much use of our heritage as we possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area in which there is room for criticism is with regard to the central heating in this House.  It is far from central heating that many of us, myself in particular, were reared, but now <Col N="1467" /> that it is a way of life we must live with it.  I bring up this subject by way of constructive criticism rather than by destructive criticism.  I do not know how the system is regulated, whether it is regulated with regard to weather conditions or if it is regulated according to some statute within the Board of Works which demands that it is switched on and off at a particular time.  If the latter is correct, it does not take into account the health of the Deputies.</P>
    <P>For instance, I find it very warm today.  Maybe I am a thick-blooded young man but, nevertheless, the central heating should be adjusted.  I find it rather oppressive and other Deputies also have complained of finding it oppressive, so I ask the Board of Works, through the Chair, to do something about regulating the temperature. Those of us who must be here need to have the correct temperature in the place if we are to continue to survive.  Several Deputies have complained of headaches that have been brought on by the heat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, some of the younger Members complained of this particular malady that has been brought about by the central heating system.  Maybe we are becoming soft and that people of, for instance, Deputy Tully's generation were of a hardier type but I do not think that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not.  I shall deal now with a few problems relating to my own constituency and, in particular, to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. However, first of all I wish to mention the bird sanctuary in Booterstown in relation to which I put down a question some time ago.  This sanctuary is being gradually eroded by buildings and so on and by the gradual progression of car parking facilities.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that this bird sanctuary of ours is maintained as a conservatory for wild fowl.  It may seem a little strange <Col N="1468" /> for me to bring up that matter but it is my desire that the sanctuary that has existed in Booterstown for some time will continue to exist there.</P>
      <P>The next matter on which I should like to comment is in relation to Garda stations in Blackrock and other areas in my constituency.  We complain about the conditions in which we operate at Leinster House but other people have to work in conditions that are not always as they should be.  I am bringing up this subject of Garda stations on my own initiative because in my capacity as a public representative it is necessary for me to call to the Garda stations in my constituency, some of which are only second-rate stations, particularly those at Blackrock, Deansgrange, Shankill and Cabinteely.  The one in Shankill is, in my opinion, a traffic hazard.  This station is situate on the main Stillorgan-Foxrock-Bray road but there are no parking facilities whatsoever outside the station.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary is having renovated the station at Dundrum, my own home village.  On behalf of the gardaí at Dundrum, I thank him for that, and if he could relate that type of progress to three or four other stations in my constituency, it would be greatly appreciated.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with the Garda stations, I now wish to comment on Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  This is one of the best man-made harbours in Europe.  It is second to none.  A lot of money has been vested in the development of the harbour.  There is an excellent esplanade along the East Pier and we now have the car-ferry terminal for which the Board of Works must take a lot of credit.  A first-class job was done in this respect.  We also have what we call the Coal Quay and to the left of that there are facilities for speed boating and so on.  There is also an esplanade for young couples who may be wheeling prams and, indeed, for many other people who walk along there to take the air, which is very invigorating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the East Pier, the Parliamentary Secretary deserves credit for making it clear that the temporary car-ferry terminal is to be removed <Col N="1469" /> and that the East Pier is to be returned to its original form.  This was the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy James Gibbons, Minister for Defence, at the time that the temporary ferry was being erected.  We are grateful to him and to the present Parliamentary Secretary for bringing about that undertaking.</P>
    <P>The new car ferry terminal is one of the biggest success stories of this country or, for that matter, of Britain.  It has brought tremendous importance to the area.  One can take one's family there at a week-end and see the boats coming in and going out with absolute safety. This is a wonderful structure that was put up in a very short space of time and there is no doubt but that it has been a great boost to the constituency.</P>
    <P>I want to make just one final point about Dún Laoghaire harbour which, indeed, can be described as the gateway to the east coast or one of the gateways to the east coast of this country.  It is only now becoming recognised as one of the premier tourist centres on the east coast.  It is in this context that I have been dealing with the harbour.  Moving then, from the car ferry terminal to what is called locally the &ldquo;Coal Quay&rdquo;, there are 15 trawlers there run by young men who saw what can be done in terms of fishing and fisheries generally.  In the past five or six years, the fleet has grown from seven boats to one of 15 boats at the present day.</P>

    <P>* The method of compiling the statistics relating to hire purchase and credit sale agreements shown above was revised in 1966 in order to provide a more comprehensive and detailed coverage.  Separate figures for hire purchase and credit sale activity are not available for years prior to 1966 but the overall figures for total debt covering both types of agreement, for 1964 and 1965, are roughly comparable with those for later years.</P>

      <P>I understand that the members of the Dublin Health Authority decided at a recent meeting not to proceed with the purchase of a site for a health centre in Butterfield-Ballyroan, having regard to the price sought for a suitable site, and the fact that they had already decided on a major extension to the Rathfarnham Health Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Rathfarnham Health Centre is only a mile and a half from the most distant part of the Butterfield-Ballyroan district, the health authority's <Col N="1475" /> decision appears reasonable to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to residential centres.  Nearly all such centres are under the control of voluntary organisations, mostly religious orders, who make their own arrangements for employment of all necessary staff.  Running costs are met by capitation rates paid by health authorities, in respect of children admitted.  The capitation rate in relation to each centre is determined by me in the light of the operational costs, as revealed in the audited accounts.  I see no justification for my assuming direct responsibility for the salaries and conditions of employment of particular classes of staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the maintenance allowance payable for each child in a residential school (a) for the mildly mentally handicapped, (b) for the moderately mentally handicapped and (c) for the deaf; if he will state the precise Departmental responsibility for each category of child; and if he will indicate what other grants are available towards the maintenance and education of each category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The capitation rate payable by health authorities for services under the Health Acts provided in residential homes catering for mentally handicapped patients is not in most cases related solely to expenditure in an individual home but rather to the aggregate costs in all homes for mentally handicapped persons operated by the particular religious order or voluntary organisation.  Further, particular homes cater for patients suffering from different degrees of mental handicap. In these circumstances it is not possible to furnish information in the precise <Col N="1476" /> form requested at (a) and (b) but the range of payments for such children may be taken to be from £6 to £9 9s. a week.</P>
      <P>The capitation rate payable by health authoríties for the maintenance of children eligible for health services in a residential school for the deaf is £4 a week for one such school and £5 a week for the two other schools in this category.</P>
      <P>The responsibilities of the Minister for Health in regard to these homes relate to the cost of maintenance and treatment and the capitation rates payable by health authorities are based on costs under these headings.  Where special schools are provided the Minister for Education provides grants towards the teachers' salaries, the costs of heating and cleaning classrooms and the provision of teaching aids and materials.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to allow mildly handicapped children to travel to and from the residential centres by public transport must depend on the degree of independence attained by the children and their capacity for socialisation and management of interpersonal relationships.  I accept that the use of public transport can be helpful in the development of the ability of the handicapped child.  I understand that children whose abilities have developed are permitted to travel to and from the special centres by public transport.  The authorities of the special centres are in the best position to advise on when permission to use public transport will be in the best interest of a child.  I understand that this advice is given whenever it is considered advisable to do so.</P>

The Deputy knows the question arose in relation to a demand for a paid sick leave substitute.  It was discussed with county managers and they said they were unable to comply with the wishes of the Medical Union.  I do not want to prejudice the negotiations by going into any further detail except to say what is being discussed now is some possible compromise in regard to the main demand which is within the capacity of the county managers to pay and within my capacity to agree to, which will bring relief to certain medical practitioners in advance of the coming into operation of the &ldquo;fee for service&rdquo; principle of payment under the Health Bill.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is important not just for me to have the information but for the House to know the background to the present dispute?  It may be misinterpreted because it may be implied that medical doctors are refusing to treat patients.  This can be implied from certain newspaper reports.  One instance is in Cork city where the district medical officer is ill and there is no substitute available for him under the present arrangements because of the intransigence of the County Managers' Association.  This is very important and I would ask the Minister to be more explicit about the background to this present dispute.</P>

      <P>Information as to the number of approved housing applicants who may be rehoused by the corporation by 31st December next is not available in my Department, as housing authorities are no longer required to submit to me particulars of housing applicants, or of casual vacancies, in justification of housing proposals.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the corporation's assessment of housing needs in October, 1967, as abated by families since rehoused by them, a total of about 500 new dwellings would now be required to meet estimated housing needs in the period to 31st March, 1971.  To meet this need, the corporation are building 220 dwellings.  In addition, they have development work in progress for another 200 houses, have made 70 sites available for private dwellings and have 26 houses at tender stage.  They have also received my approval in principle to plans for another 400 dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Institution and Shanganagh Castle are institutions for the accommodation of youths who have been sentenced to detention.  The aim of both institutions can perhaps be best expressed in the words of paragraph 4 of the St. Patrick's Institution Regulations, 1960, which provide that &ldquo;an inmate shall, in so far as the length of his sentence permits, be given such training and instruction and subjected to such disciplinary and moral influences as will conduce to his reformation and the prevention of crime&rdquo;.  Shanganagh is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; institution, with less rigid discipline, to which selected youths committed to St. Patrick's are transferred where it appears that the conditions there will benefit them. Youths are not committed directly by the courts to Shanganagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>When they come to St. Patrick's Institution they are assessed and if their conduct is good there and particularly if they are first offenders, they are generally segregated and sent on to Shanganagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us anything about the special training available in these institutions for after life and whether the training is accepted by the professional bodies into which these people might go when they leave to go to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last part of the Deputy's question first, he does not appear to appreciate that in most of <Col N="1486" /> these cases their stay is so short that it is not possible to train them for anything.  They are there for an average of only two months.  It is a misconception to think that they can be trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Youths committed to St. Patrick's Institution are examined by the resident medical officer, who holds a diploma of psychological medicine.  Any inmate who is mentally ill is committed to a mental hospital. In appropriate cases youths are referred to the outpatient service of mental hospitals for psychiatric assessment, and for treatment where necessary.  The possibility of extending this service is under discussion with the authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because some rudimentary psychiatric facilities are available in Mountjoy a judge had to send a child who needed such treatment to Mountjoy instead of to St. Patrick's Institution because the facilities were not adequate in St. Patrick's Institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information to back up what the Deputy has suggested. As far as I know obviously disturbed youths who come to St. Patrick's are certified and sent to a mental hospital, generally to Dundrum, and others who are not certifiable but who are disturbed get treatment as outpatients in the services of the local authorities.  I have no information that any judge had to send anybody to Mountjoy for the reasons stated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my speech on the Estimates for my Department on 28th October, the Government's policy is aimed primarily at supporting the efforts of the Organisation of African Unity and its member states to bring the parties to the conference table and to suggest ways in which negotiations may prove fruitful.  We are continuing to pursue that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of relief, the Government have already announced that, subject to the approval of the Dáil, the following sums will be made available in the current financial year: (1) a sum of up to £25,000 for Irish Red Cross teams for either side, (2) a sum of £25,000 to be paid to UNICEF to help that organisation to charter the relief ship <i>Columcille</i> from its owners Africa Concern Ltd. for the purpose of transporting relief supplies and relief equipment for the humanitarian assistance of the victims of the Nigerian civil war, (3) a sum of £10,500 approximately (25,000 dollars) for the UNICEF relief and rehabilitation programmes on both sides.  In addition, the Government have asked the Irish Red Cross to make a sum of £10,000 available to the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist that organisation's work on both sides.  The total <Col N="1489" /> pledged assistance out of public funds is accordingly £70,000.</P>
    <P>The Government's long standing policy has been to channel public funds for emergency relief through the Irish Red Cross or the various United Nations agencies concerned.  I see no reason to depart from that policy.</P>

As I indicated in reply to questions on the 28th October, the extension of the import deposit scheme was the subject of a protest to the British Government.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking manufacturers first, the position is that, as I have stated on a number of occasions, the guidelines issued by the Central Bank to the commercial banks provide that priority be given to productive projects, particularly the production of goods for export.  I am satisfied that this is being done.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has, however, asked for restraint in the provision of credit to finance consumption expenditure and as a result private traders importing or selling consumer goods may not be able to get all the credit they would like.  This is to be regretted but, given that the demand exceeds the available resources, it is inherent in the policy of priority for productive projects that other sectors may not be able to get all the credit they desire.  It is the primary aim of credit policy, as of budgetary and incomes policies, to secure the largest possible increase in production and employment compatible with a tolerable external payments position and the avoidance of excessive price increases.  I am confident that this is a sound policy.</P>

      <P>When the Minister states it will be announced in due course, does he mean it will be announced in this House or at some Fianna Fáil dinner?  Is the Minister aware that this is of the utmost importance and that this report speaks of co-operation and co-ordination between Departments?  The time has come when Fianna Fáil Ministers should take the Opposition parties into their confidence in this House so that we will have a little more co-operation and more important statements made inside this House instead of outside it.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that this statement will be made first in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is satisfied that the large increase recently in the number of foreign merchant and commercial banks opening offices in Dublin and elsewhere in the Republic is in the best interests of the people of this country; and whether there has been any corresponding development by Irish banks abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish banks have a substantial interest in the principal merchant banks set up in this country in recent years.  Other new merchant banks are subsidiaries of commercial banks which have been in business here for many years and whose record is satisfactory.  The number of commercial banks of any significant size established by foreign interests recently has not been large and each has only one office in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of new banks in which there is a foreign interest has contributed to desirable developments in Irish banking, including the introduction of new banking techniques from abroad and increase of the inflow <Col N="1503" /> of capital for use in the development of new industries and tourist facilities. I would not, however, welcome any deep penetration of Irish banking by foreign interests.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, fresh banking legislation is proposed.  If passed by the Oireachtas it will make all banks, including those fully or partly foreign-owned, subject to close supervision in the national interest as well as in the interest of depositors.  There has been no development by Irish banks abroad corresponding to the development by external interests here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;recently&rdquo; in a sense which is obvious. It is obvious that except for a couple of banks like Ansbacher, a Belgian bank and one or two others, not a single private or other bank came into the country up to about ten years ago. This is the sense in which I used the word &ldquo;recently&rdquo;.  The Minister put his own interpretation on it.  In banking terms ten years is recently and this is what I had in mind.  Could I ask the Minister whether one at least of these banks bought its way into this country? I think it did.  Have these banks come to this country to admire our Irish blue eyes or to compete with the vultures from London that we normally have operating in this country in a different way?  Could I ask the Minister further whether the amount of money he read out a while ago, in reply to a Parliamentary question, as the amount the Government have now got from the Irish commercial banks&mdash; which is completely different from what it was ten or 15 years ago&mdash;is not partly due to these banks having come in here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  First, I do not think there is any question of these foreign banks coming in here simply because they are attracted by our charm.  They come here to do business. I think it is an indication of the progress and development of the country that they now accept that there is plenty of business to be done here.  On the other hand, it is important for us to ensure that by and large Irish banking is kept in Irish hands and we intend to ensure that.  I think the Deputy <Col N="1504" /> would admit that in a sphere of activity of this sort the importation from time to time of new ideas from abroad helps to give everybody a little fillip, helps to pep us up a bit and helps to improve methods and techniques.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the short term at least the foreign banks coming in here have been helpful in so far as they have made money available which would not be made available by the Irish banks?  Does he not agree that in the short term it has been beneficial whatever about the long term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that by coming in here and competing and by bringing new banking methods and techniques, they have been helpful in bringing about an improvement generally in the Irish banking structure.  The Irish banks would probably, in any event, in their own way have improved their methods and techniques but, perhaps, the arrival of these new banks from abroad did help to accelerate the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte expect an increase of 2,300 bedrooms in 1970 as compared with a target of 1,500. The difficulty for a number of years was not too high a level of development but rather an inadequate level. For this reason it was necessary to introduce in 1967 improved financial incentives for accommodation development and these have stimulated growth.  A satisfactory rate of growth has been reached and the question of reviewing the programme with a view to preventing too much accommodation development does not arise at this stage.</P>
      <P>Difficulty has been experienced by the hotel industry in recruiting adequate numbers of trained staff, but part of the problem is the seasonal nature of the employment in some areas.  The Council for Education, Recruitment and Training for the Hotel Industry (CERT), on which the hotel industry and trade unions are represented, is arranging programmes of recruitment and training to ensure adequate staffing of accommodation. An expansion in CERT's activities is required to meet the industry's requirements and this is now being organised. I am having consultations with all the interests concerned with a view to raising the level of recruitment and training to meet the increase in accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably not aware of the fact that one farm has been in the possession of the Land Commission for a number of years and the excuse was that they were waiting to get a further portion.  It has been sold long since and the wild boys who were burning farms thought it still belonged to a non-national and burned the house.  If it had been divided when it should have been divided this would not have happened and the ratepayers of Meath would have been saved a lot of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Lands awaiting distribution in the Lispole area of County Kerry comprise three holdings, aggregating 125 acres, which were surrendered to the Land Commission by way of exchange.  It is hoped to divide one of these holdings, containing 21 acres, in the coming spring.  Composite resale proposals have been drafted for the other two properties&mdash;104 acres&mdash; together with another holding of 15 acres which the Land Commission are purchasing in the locality.  It is proposed to utilise the combined area of 119 acres in a scheme to facilitate the enlargement and rearrangement of a number of fragmented holdings.  The small property of 15 acres being purchased is an integral part of this scheme&mdash;and until such time as the Land Commission secure possession it is not feasible to indicate when the envisaged rearrangement and restructuring can be effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to divide this 42 acre holding in the coming spring.  The preparation of resale plans was deferred in the expectation that it would be possible to secure another holding for division in the locality&mdash;thus enabling a more balanced scheme of land settlement to be implemented.  This, however, has not proved feasible&mdash;and the O'Connor estate will now be allotted on its own.</P>

      <P>The trust scheme under which an area of 16½ acres at Castlewalter, Loughrea, was held for many years was revoked by the Land Commission in May, 1968.  Arrangements will be formulated as soon as possible for the disposal of the lands. In this connection an application for the provision of a sports field for the local GAA club will be fully considered. The local Land Commission inspectors have already had discussions with GAA representatives about their requirements in relation to a proposed playing pitch.</P>

      <P>There are two colleges in this country where women teachers of physical education may receive training under skilled instructors.  There are no such training facilities here for men.  To remedy this deficiency a number of men were sent for training abroad this year.  It is proposed to establish a further college so that all training can be carried out here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a similar question was answered recently.  Due to the fact that there was no college for men in this country I was given special responsibility, as the Deputy knows, to <Col N="1518" /> bring about the further development of physical education.  One of the greatest needs is to provide facilities whereby we can have trained teachers available to our schools.  We do not have colleges for men in this country and I did not propose to wait six years to turn out trained male teachers. It was therefore arranged by the Department to send boys on a scholarship to England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.  After all, boys play a lot of football and so on; at least I used to when I was young.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows quite well the question I asked was why is this confined to boys, why is not the same facility made available to girls.</P>

      <P>This is a one-room school which was erected for the purpose of holding evening classes.  Such a class in homecraft is being held in the school this year.  I understand from the County Mayo Vocational Education Committee, however, that it was necessary to discontinue the class in woodwork and building construction because the whole-time services of the teacher were required elsewhere in the county.  The position will be reviewed at the end of the year in order to see whether the class in question can be resumed.</P>

      <P>A report was received by the Naval Service on the 25th October, 1969, that a fleet of 30 Dutch fishing vessels were trawling inside the fishery limit at Mine Head, County Waterford.  A check was made with a reliable source which confirmed that there were 23 fishing vessels of a large type operating six to seven miles off shore.  About the same time the gardaí at Ardmore reported at least 17 trawlers off Mine Head.</P>
      <P>On the 27th October, 1969, a report was received that a number of Dutch trawlers were fishing inside the fishery limit off Helvick Head.  As there was not a corvette of the Naval Service in the areas in question on the dates mentioned it is not possible to say whether in fact any illegal fishing took place. The corvette L. E. &ldquo;Maev&rdquo; which had been on patrol off the Donegal coast reached the Dunmore area on 29th October, 1969.  No illegal fishing was then observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report was received on the 8th November, 1969, that 30 Dutch trawlers were fishing illegally during the previous night in the area between Mine Head and Helvick Head.  An inquiry <Col N="1538" /> made from the gardaí at Dungarvan elicited the information that seven or eight trawlers were observed in the area earlier in the evening and appeared to be anchored at a place where it would be normal for them to anchor.  The corvette L. E. &ldquo;Maev&rdquo; patrolled the same area on the 10th November, 1969, and arrested two Dutch trawlers whose skippers were subsequently convicted of illegal fishing and fined £100 each with confiscation of fish and fishing gear.  An appeal against the conviction has been made in the case of one of the trawlers.</P>

      <P>The Government decided in June, 1957 to institute a new pattern of investigation of applications for the Service (1917-1921) Medal, the old system of verification having proved unreliable in practice. The Government also decided that where a person claimed a special allowance under the Army Pensions Acts by virtue of his being the holder of a Service (1917-1921) Medal which had been issued under the old system of verification, his entitlement to the medal must be re-investigated in accordance with the revised procedure in order to establish that the medal <Col N="1541" /> had been &ldquo;duly awarded&rdquo; (the expression used in the Army Pensions Acts).</P>
      <P>Where a person applies for the free travel, etc., concessions to veterans of the War of Independence by virtue of his being the holder of a Service (1917-1921) Medal issued under the old system of verification, his entitlement to the medal must likewise be re-investigated.</P>
      <P>The decision to hold a pre-June, 1957 medal not &ldquo;duly awarded&rdquo; is taken, after a most detailed examination and assessment of all the available evidence, by one senior officer of the Department, who records his reasons.  Appeals by or on behalf of rejected applicants are submitted to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Of some 38,000 Service (1917-1921) Medals issued prior to June 1957, 972 have to date been held, on re-investigation, not to have been duly awarded, when the applicants applied for special allowances or for the free travel, etc., concessions to veterans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three stokers on watch in the boiler-room of a corvette at any one time and they work in an average temperature of 100º F. Stokers work on the basis of 4 hours on duty and 8 hours off duty like all other watchkeepers aboard.</P>
      <P>(b)  A corvette has a tank capacity for 2,912 gallons of fresh water and in addition can make 896 gallons per day from sea water.  On this basis, allowing for a normal crew of 65 and assuming that the vessel did not take on additional fresh water for a seven day period the amount of water available per man per day for that period is 20 gallons approx.  Fresh water is not used in the corvette for sanitary purposes. A corvette rarely goes more than seven days without taking on fresh water at one of the various ports where water is available for vessels around our coast.  Fresh water in any ship is always a precious commodity and economy has to be exercised in its use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to that sort of possibility.  I really wanted to find out if it would be possible to use Baldonnel in emergency conditions because very often when there is fog at Dublin Airport, planes are diverted to Shannon while there may be no fog at Baldonnel.  I know of several instances in Europe where there is both a military and a civilian airport in operation at the same time.  It seems to be a terrible waste of the amount of public money that went into the making of the runways at Baldonnel to use them so little.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that army personnel who were engaged in public transport work during the bus strike some time ago received extra remuneration, can the Minister say why it is not proposed to give extra pay to the army personnel now looking after the refugees at Gormanston camp?  These people are on duty from about eight o'clock in the morning until after 11 at night for seven days a week acting in every capacity, from babysitter to cook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the army personnel involved in this operation with the refugees from Northern Ireland deserve the highest praise. From personal knowledge, I am aware that they took on this job and have dealt with it in their usual competent way.  However, I am not aware that the duties imposed on the army personnel are excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the reason why the Minister says that is because he does not live beside the camp but I do.  Would the Minister not consider looking into the matter to see if some compensation could be given to these people who are doing a job which, to coin a phrase, is far above the call of duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion does not arise but the fact that they are doing work which, normally, they would not be called on to do, should warrant some recompense being made to them and I am surprised that the Minister has adopted this attitude.  He has expressed gratitude to them.  Gratitude is all very well but it cannot be taken to a shop because one will get nothing for it.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept that.  I know what happens to the fellows at the bottom of the ladder when money like this is being paid out by the Office of Public Works.  It is typical for men to have to wait as long as 12 months for an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if there is any reason why military hospitals could not be partly military and partly civilian.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy has in mind the admission of civilian patients to the three military hospitals at present in operation.  While such patients might be accepted in these hospitals as an emergency measure, military considerations would not permit of their being accepted in the ordinary course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any advantage or are there not some disadvantages in having hospitals set aside separately for Army personnel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that there are.  Military hospitals are a part of any military establishment just as much as army billets or army refectories. It is part of army establishment. <Col N="1550" /> Military hospitals are generally within military barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the United States, the army authorities have opened military hospitals to civilians with the result that the standard available to themselves improved as well as the overall standard.  One complements the other.  Would the Minister not consider doing the same here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any parallel at all between military hospitals in the United States and military hospitals here.  Ours is a very small establishment and our military hospitals are near or within military posts.  It would definitely be undesirable that they should become readily available to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of operations of any particular type performed in a military hospital would be so few that the people doing the work there would not have the advantage which people have who do this work every day in the week in general hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so&mdash;the suggestion that, because the through-put of military hospitals is small, the competence of the Army Medical Corps is therefore somewhat less than it ought to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it was decided that civil servants and State industrial employees who were called out with the first line reserve in August last should have their army emoluments supplemented, where necessary, to bring their total emoluments, army and civil, to the level of their civil pay.  I understand that local authorities and State and semi-State companies have made similar arrangements in regard to any of their employees who were called out.  I suggested in a speech which I made at Finner Camp on the 27th August, 1969 that employers generally <Col N="1556" /> might follow the lead given by State authorities in this matter, and I am aware that a number of employers have been good enough to do so.</P>
      <P>If any specific cases of reservists whose army emoluments are less than their civil pay are brought to my notice I will consider whether it would be appropriate to approach the employers concerned with a view to their making good the difference.</P>
      <P>I might add that it is open to any reservist who considers that he has a case for release from army service on hardship grounds to apply for such release through the commanding officer of his unit.</P>

The staff on duty was adequate to handle the volume of traffic at that time and no reports were received of any difficulty in obtaining an answer from the switchboard.  The only explanation that can be given for the failure to receive an answer during the period stated is that there was some technical fault in the exchange system which prevented the signal from registering on the switchboard.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind, in regard to collections, that users of franking machines are normally required to hand in franked correspondence at a post office.

Is he further aware that these specified offices normally close at 1 p.m. on one day per week and that there is no service on Saturday or Sunday?  If anybody puts a letter into a letter box at any hour up to 12 midnight on Sunday night with or without a stamp it will be delivered on Monday morning.

I do not expect the report of this marketing survey to be available until February.  The survey has commenced but it is not likely to be completed until early in February, 1970.  It is, in fact, a test of public reaction to the cessation of postal deliveries.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, last evening I gave notice of my intention to put down a Private Notice Question to the Minister for Justice. The question is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if as a result of discussions between the gardaí and a representative, or representatives, of RTE he is prepared to substantiate his allegations, based on <Col N="1569" /> the information of people with criminal records and without consulting with the television people involved before he made the allegation, that the Seven Days programme on moneylending was &ldquo;deliberately contrived for television&rdquo;; if he will say whether or not he proposes to call into question and test, even in a court of law, the entitlement of a journalist to protect his sources of information; if he will now say whether or not the gardaí know how many unlicensed moneylenders there are in Dublin city since they disagree with the estimate of Seven Days given at 500; if he will say whether or not the gardaí have investigated the abuse of trading cheques with a view to protecting the people from exploitation and if he will make a statement on whether or not the rackets and exploitation exposed in this programme give cause for concern sufficient for serious action by his Department.</P>
    <P>I gather from information conveyed to those of us who tabled questions on this matter, that you regarded it as not being of urgent public importance. I would like to submit, respectfully, that it is.</P>

      <P>There is no point of order.  The Chair has given careful consideration to this matter but in my opinion none of the questions submitted, even assuming they were all admissible as questions, had the degree of urgency required by the Standing Order to qualify as Private Notice Questions.  In the actual event the questions to the Minister for Justice were disallowed because they did not have the requisite degree of urgency to qualify as Private Notice Questions and the questions to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were disallowed because of lack of Ministerial responsibility in the matter.  The ruling, I might say, is in accordance with long standing practice.</P>

      <P>I respect your ruling but also, with respect, might I submit that, in my opinion and in the opinion of the members of my party who tabled similar questions, it is of urgent public importance, particularly because serious allegations were made by the Minister for Justice against certain employees of Radio Telefís Éireann.  There is also in question the reputation of Radio Telefís Éireann generally.  I submit also that those allegations made by the Minister should be either substantiated or withdrawn in this House. They should not be left hanging in the air, with suspicion in the minds of members of the public who might be influenced by what the Minister said I also think it is of urgent public importance in that the Minister in his reply appeared to put the employees of Radio Telefís Éireann in the dock rather than the people in question, the moneylenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress, having dealt with the national importance of the Board of Works, I then related my remarks to the local importance of the Board of Works and in particular to the constituency which I represent and mentioned particularly the harbour at Dún Laoghaire. The previous Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, honoured us with a visit some time before he was elevated &mdash;I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on his elevation to the position of Minister for Defence: he is a very worthy holder of that office&mdash;and I hope the incumbent Parliamentary Secretary comes out to visit his holdings in that area.  The Board of Works have vast holdings there.  I should imagine they are about the biggest holdings in the Board of Works.  Before dealing with Dún Laoghaire harbour and the responsibility which lies within the bailiwick of the Board of Works I dealt with the East Pier and the temporary car ferry which was there.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now honouring an undertaking to take down this temporary car ferry terminal and to restore the East Pier to its former glory.  We all know many people from the city and county of Dublin like to walk the length of the East Pier.  It is an invigorating experience, particularly during the hard winter days, to take a walk down the pier on Saturdays or Sundays. Many young couples do this; others take their families.  It is nice to know that the East Pier is to be restored. However, having given the Board of Works credit for that and for the new car ferry terminal, which is a tremendous boon to the area&mdash;it is one <Col N="1573" /> of the best in Europe, if not the best &mdash;I then drew attention to the Coal Quay and its effect on the area.  We have many uses for this quay but the use I want to put it to is for the trawlermen of Dún Laoghaire.  During the past two years I have had requests to have the Coal Quay reconstructed. The Board of Works put down a new surface.  They took up the cobblestones and did a good job of resurfacing the quay in concrete.</P>
      <P>There are many other problems in relation to the Coal Quay before it is a place men can walk on and from.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will use his good offices to prevail on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to have a site made available for an icing plant for the trawlermen there.  It is a great need.  Another problem which the Parliamentary Secretary might look at is the matter of the navigation lights.  There have been complaints from trawlermen about the length of time the lights have been left off.  It is necessary to have them on at critical times when trawlermen come into this magnificent harbour.</P>
      <P>Another matter, which may be mundane when discussing an Estimate of this sort but which is a real problem from the tourist point of view, is the toilet at the end of the Coal Quay.  It is one of the most frightful, antediluvian objects.  It could have been built in the era of the Napoleonic wars but I do not think it would have been accepted as a modern convenience even then.  The Parliamentary Secretary should get some of his subordinates to have it destroyed forthwith and to have a suitable modern public convenience built in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that the Coal Quay should be developed for tourists and it is too bad that the eyesore I have just mentioned should be allowed to stand there.  It is not good enough. Within Dún Laoghaire harbour there is a tremendous esplanade.  Yachtsmen are catered for, there is the ferry terminal and the fishermen are catered for at the Coal Quay.  All these amenities are needed both for the benefit of the local community and for the tourists. So that the amenities may be improved, <Col N="1574" /> I should like to prevail on the Parliamentary Secretary to have the area examined.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I wish to make.  It relates to the conditions of employment of ordinary workers in Dún Laoghaire.  I do not wish to be abrasive about it but when these men are asked to do various difficult jobs they should be enabled to work in normal conditions.</P>
    <P>A few other points have occurred to me.  There is the matter of a new hotel in the area.  There has been a lot of criticism of me for having pursued this against all the odds.  However, the people have come around to my way of thinking, and I couple Councillor Seán Byrne with this because he had been pressing for it when it was not popular to do so.  The other night the tourist element in the area said it was disastrous that we did not get the hotel at the time.  If the new hotel cannot be built at the railway station I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to make an alternate site available.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of schools for mentally handicapped children.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his well-prepared brief, adverted to the number of schools that have been built.  There have been 34 of them, with nine in the pipeline.  These schools are for moderately handicapped children but there has been criticisms about schools for the severely handicapped.  Let me assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the various organisations concerned are happy with the schools he has provided for the moderately handicapped. It is to the severely handicapped that I direct his attention.  We have the Drumcar School but we must do a lot more in this field.  This is not strictly relevant to the functions of the Parliamentary Secretary but I hope that if he is asked to build schools he will make greater proportionate provision for severely handicapped children.  Only now are we beginning to realise that they are part of our society.  That being so, we should be prepared to provide the best possible conditions for those unhappy people.</P>

      <P>It is important that I make these points before I conclude.  I told Deputy Donnellan that I would sit down ten minutes before 5.30 and I will honour that undertaking.  On the question of public buildings, many of them have been cleaned, under contract, by the Board of Works and the work is a credit to the men who did it. I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for the Custom House.  I should like to see it cleaned as a matter of urgency.  The only question is that it might collapse during the operation.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of national monuments, Deputy Tully referred to Fore Abbey in County Westmeath.  I went to see it in September last and I am sorry to say its state of maintenance is tragic. It is a beautiful national monument and it is a pity it is not looked after. I looked around for literature on it but it was not available&mdash;I believe it is out of print.  That, too, is a pity.  I gave an undertaking to the people in the Fore Abbey area that I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have it examined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred at length to the Phoenix Park.  I wonder what is the point of letting land lie idle there. Would not a municipal golf course within the confines of the Park be an excellent proposition?  I have not given the matter much thought but I think it deserves examination.  It could be provided at a low charge for the benefit of the people in the city as entrance fees to existing golf courses are becoming prohibitive.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have my suggestion examined.  There would be an income from such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary also examine the possibility of providing a public park in the south side of the city?  We have not got a municipal park there at all and there are a number of tracts of land available.  I agree that building comes first, particulary of houses and so on, but there are a number of areas available on which a public park could be laid out.  I will give the Parliamentary Secretary the areas.  I conclude, to let Deputy <Col N="1576" /> Donnellan in, by thanking Members for their patience and by congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his elevation.</P>

      <P>The one in Deputy Andrew's constituency.  The same applies to the one in Cork.  Both need improvement immediately.  In any case, I want to discuss a more important matter.  On 13th November, 1969 when the Parliamentary Secretary was intoducing this debate, at column 897 of the Official Report, he spoke at length about No. 1 Hume Street and No. 46 St Stephen's Green.  He did his best to build up a case for the sale of those houses.  I want to ask the House why? When a person has had a bad case and goes to extreme lengths about it, as the Parliamentary Secretary did in this <Col N="1577" /> case, there must be something at the back of it.  If there is the House should know.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said, that the property was going on the market and that the State had no commitment whatever to the developers concerned and that it would be open to all interested parties to compete for the premises.  He knows as well as I do that this building is worth much more to the builders concerned than to anybody else and that, in fact, it would suit nobody else but those builders.  An old French proverb states that he who excuses himself accuses himself.  In this case I charge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works with conniving with this particular firm as regards those buildings.  I do not want to see any speculators getting rich at the expense of the taxpayers.  We should be proud of and preserve our Georgian architecture which is part of our heritage.  The Minister mentioned a sum of £40,000.  I think this sum would be well spent in repairing those buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who saw last Sunday's <i>Independent</i> saw a photograph of the buildings.  Great credit is due to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> for publishing it and exposing to the people the vandalism and blackguardism that has occurred in regard to those buildings. We could see that slates were stripped off.  When the Parliamentary Secretary went into such details informing the House about the matter why did he not inform us that this vandalism had taken place?  I should like to know what action the Board of Works, or the Department of Justice, have taken to discover who the vandals and blackguards were and to find out on whose behalf they were acting.  I know that thugs, vandals and blackguards, connected with the group now trying to get Irish property at as low a price as they possibly can, were responsible for damaging property of a particular individual who had a Georgian house in this particular section.  The group bought the houses on both sides of him.  He was determined to hold on to his house.  They tried by fair means to buy the house from him and offered a colossal sum, much more than it <Col N="1578" /> was worth, and he refused to part with the house.  Thugs and vandals connected with this group&mdash;and the Department of Justice know it because they were informed at the time&mdash; stripped the lead and slates from his house and the rain poured into flats he had let.  This particular group have nothing to learn from Rachmann.  They did not succeed so far in driving this man out of his house.  Those houses are State property and we should do all we can to preserve them.  Now that this has happened, there should be no connivance with any group and especially with this particular group because it is well known that they are active members of Taca.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>My time is very limited.  I have exactly three minutes. I am mainly concerned with drainage west of the Shannon.  The Board of Works should shake itself up a good deal and copy the example of the inter-party Government as far as drainage west of the Shannon is concerned. Recently we had a meeting at Headford which the Parliamentary Secretary instructed his engineers, and so on, to attend, and which was to deal with various extensions to the Corrib-Headford drainage scheme.  I am sure that by now these extensions have been brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and I hope he will note them and give them consideration.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about the Suck drainage scheme, the completion of Lavalley drainage scheme and the Dunkellin drainage scheme.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what number on the priority list is the River Suck, when it will be done and what has been done so far. The Lavalley drainage scheme has been held up since the Corrib drainage scheme closed.  It is part of it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary as briefly as possible to give me a rundown on the Lavalley scheme and say what is the present position regarding it and when will the Board of Works complete it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Dunkellin drainage scheme, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let me know what number on the priority list this drainage scheme is, and what correspondence he has received from the committee who, at the moment, are trying to get this scheme into operation.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that &ldquo;in the current year field survey work continues on the Owenmore major catchment in Sligo and on the Dunkellin and Lavalley minor catchments in Galway&rdquo;.  I want to know how long this field survey work will continue as far as the Dunkellin <Col N="1580" /> scheme is concerned.  There are many people in this area and they cannot carry out land project schemes because the Office of Public Works will not undertake work on the Dunkellin scheme in the Athenry area of my constituency.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these questions as they mean a lot to the people living in that area.</P>
    <P>I had a question down to the Parliamentary Secretary this week about the completion of the drainage of the Kilroe River, Corrandulla, part of the Corrib-Headford scheme.  In his reply he stated that work would be completed on it next year.  I asked him in a supplementary question when communication was last made with the individual who owns the mill that is holding up the scheme and he was not able to give me a reply.  I hope he will now be able to give me that reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by thanking Deputies for their good wishes on my new appointment and I hope, if I cannot satisfy Deputies on all sides of the House, to be able to do so as far as possible.  I should like also to return the congratulations to Deputy Barry on his promotion to the Front Bench, and to Deputy Keating who led for Labour on his election to the House. I was surprised, however, that Deputy Barry should start off, in his maiden speech, as the Front Bench representative for the Office of Public Works, by advocating that he himself should be abolished.  I understand the Minister for Lands made a similar suggestion in his reply today so it seems to be a great time for people abolishing themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do not accept that the Office of Public Works should be abolished.  I think what is happening is that many Deputies are prejudging the Devlin Report.  I imagine that, with the exception possibly of Deputy Desmond, no one has really read or made any attempt to understand the full content of the Devlin Report.  I have read through it because it affects my Office but I cannot say, at the same time, that I agree with some of their conclusions.  I am quite willing to <Col N="1581" /> await the outcome of the investigation the Government are making into the report and the consideration they are giving to it and, of course, I will accept their decision in the matter.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my opening remarks the difficulties there are in getting skilled staff, especially architects, draughtsmen and engineers.  At the moment, several Departments are competing for the services of these skilled craftsmen.  I think that is daft. All these activities concerned with building which require architects and skilled people like that should be centralised in the one office.  In other words, I think the Office of Public Works should be considerably expanded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry, Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Begley expressed concern because this Estimate was down by £500,000.  This Estimate should have been disposed of before the summer recess.  As the year is running out, I am afraid we will not be able to work within the amount provided.  We will exceed it, particularly in relation to the building of schools.  The reason why the Estimate is down is not that we planned to reduce the volume of work, but that we have introduced a good management system as a result of years of study.  We are getting much greater productivity and much better value for money all down along the line.</P>
    <P>In 1959-60, the total expenditure was £4,394,996.  In 1966-67, it was £7,753,000.  This year our expenditure will exceed £10 million.  The activities of the Office of Public Works are by no means being curtailed.  In fact, they are being expanded.  The largest file in 51, St. Stephen's Green is a file of unsolicited letters of thanks and congratulations for efficient and fast work carried out by the Office of Public Works over the years.  Many prominent Deputies opposite have also sent in letters of this nature, unsolicited.  Any suggestion that the Office of Public Works is in any way inefficient is to be abhorred, because it is not true.  I am delighted with the efficiency and the co-operation I have got from the staff in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The one question which seems to <Col N="1582" /> have raised a bit of emotion is the proposed sale of 1, Hume Street and 46, St. Stephen's Green.  So far as 46, St. Stephen's Green is concerned, the State's interest in it will be up very shortly.  The State will be evicted in a matter of a few years time.</P>

The history of this is that application for outline planning permission for the redevelopment of 1, Hume Street and 46, 47, 48 and 49, St. Stephen's Green was made on 4th March, 1966.  Outline permission was granted on 8th June, 1966&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating was concerned with what he thought was a contradiction between the high standard of maintenance which has been applied to these buildings, and restoration.  There is a big difference between those two things.  The present condition of the buildings is simply a matter of structural failure through age. It is like having a motor car.  No matter how well one maintains it eventually it will wear out through age and it will no longer be economic to keep it. That is the situation in relation to 1, Hume Street.  It is absolutely coincidental that these other developments were taking place around the area.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention also the restoration figure which Deputy Desmond suggested was being inflated for some political reason.  I have no reason to believe that any of the staff of the Office of Public Works or of the consultants who were employed would give me any false information on this matter.</P>

These are not State property; they are privately owned and we have no interest in them whatsoever.  Let us consider the series of events: planning permission sought, planning permission given, houses demolished; the State puts an advertisement in the paper, and then there is a protest.  Nobody said a word until then.  I suggest certain people in An Taisce are trying to use that organisation for purely political purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it was deliberate, because there was an article run in the <i>Irish Times</i> subsequently which might have been open to misinterpretation, <Col N="1585" /> but at the conclusion of that article there was a publication of a statement made by my predecessor, Deputy James Gibbons, Minister for Defence, on 24th December, 1966, and I should like to quote the relevant paragraphs:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners, being mindful of their responsibility to a public authority, sought the advice of the appropriate planning authority, the Dublin Corporation, with regard to the further development of the area in question.  Pending receipt of this advice it was considered prudent to test the market for the property to ascertain its current value.  This information would be essential in the determination of any compensation which might fall to be awarded under the Planning Act.</P>
      <P>In the light of these facts, it should be quite clear that there has been no attempt to anticipate the Dublin Development Plan.  The market value of the properties having been ascertained, ample time will be available to all responsible parties to present their views to the planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have to accept it.  The rules of the House demand it.  As I have only a limited amount of time, I think I have dealt sufficiently with that.  Deputy Desmond was critical of the system of renting of Government office accommodation while Deputy Barry and Deputy Keating were opposed to renting at all. It would be marvellous if the Government <Col N="1586" /> could build and provide all their own office accommodation, but as against that the Government have to consider their priorities, and the priorities of housing, hospitals, schools, sanitary services, Garda barracks, all these are considered more important than spending capital money on the building of Government offices.  I am surprised to hear the representatives of the Labour Party suggesting we should take capital money away from some of these services for the purpose of putting up several millions of pounds worth of offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the quotation here.  In other words, the thinking behind renting office accommodation is to conserve capital which is required more urgently for other purposes. Deputy Barry said we were paying an average of 25/- per square foot for this. I should like to assure him&mdash;and I do not believe I am giving away any confidence&mdash;that the figure for office accommodation is well below that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to give figures of rents paid for office accommodation.  It cannot be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is making a fair assessment of the whole thing, but could he tell us what is the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is considerably less than the figure mentioned by Deputy Barry.  Deputy Barry also suggested that the space vacated by the Departments <Col N="1587" /> of Education and Lands should be used to house the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In the first instance, these houses were originally designed as private living accommodation, and they are quite unsuitable to house the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In fact, the two Departments that will be going down the country fairly soon are now housed in 30 separate buildings throughout the city, so it would only fragment the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries even more if we were to put them in there.  We believe that in the best interest of efficiency and for reasons which I shall come to later, it is better to have them all under the one roof.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Barry was here when Deputy Tully was talking about these properties in Merrion Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would have heard him say that when he goes there he cannot find his way in and when he gets in he cannot find his way out. Deputy Tully knows how unsuitable these buildings are, and I am sure Deputy Barry does, too.  These buildings will be put to the best possible use when the time comes.</P>
      <P>There was a query also about Ryan's public house in Haddington Road. That is being leased at the moment and it is part of the site.  When the site is developed the licence will go with it.  This property may be used as part of the development of the building that is proposed to go there, but, on the other hand, it could be disposed of if it is not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the licence still there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the pub is open.  Regarding the proposed office block which we are acquiring on a hire purchase basis in Kildare Place, let me say that in 1964 the then Minister for Finance heard this property was for sale, that it had been bought, that planning permission was being sought and had been obtained for the erection of an office block there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> This caused considerable concern to my Department because the new structure which is going up will overlook the complete complex of buildings between Kildare Street and Merrion Place.  In times of demonstrations, picketing Parliament and the throwing of petrol bombs it would be a dangerous thing to have a tall building like that overlooking the Government building.  A decision was made in 1964 but the discussions were only concluded quite recently.  I am satisfied that the terms we have agreed on are very reasonable and very fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating was extremely concerned about the condition of our national Parliament building.  He said it should be a national showpiece and I agree with that sentiment but I do not agree with what he went on to say after that.  In my opening statement I did say that the electrical works were completed but there are, in fact, some structural works still going on in the House and if there is some dust flying around I apologise for it.  In my 13 years in this House I have found the cleaning staff extremely efficient. Even when I left a couple of letters on my desk by mistake at night they would be picked up, dusted under and neatly put back ready for me next morning.  The responsibility for the cleaning of Leinster House is not the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  It is the responsibility of the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerk of the Dáil administered through the Captain of the Guard.  Deputy Keating complained that the Venetian blinds were not very clean.  They were cleaned by contract only a couple of weeks before the House re-assembled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating was also very critical about the design of the furniture in the public rooms and in the restaurant. This furniture was selected by the Joint Restaurant Committee.  Various designs were submitted to the all-party committee and the committee decided which furniture it though most suitable. We have given Deputies in the previous Dáil what they wanted and I am sorry if Deputies of this Dáil do not like it.</P>
    <P>On the design of furniture generally, I would like to say that the design <Col N="1589" /> centre at the central engineering workshop has proved most successful.  Both foreign and Irish designs are available to Government Departments and I am very pleased to say that the Irish design has been found to be far better and far more wanted than anything designed abroad for this purpose.  Deputy Keating seems to have a poor opinion of Irish designers in general, but I think Irish designers are very well up to, if not ahead, of many of their competitors abroad.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Tully how much this new block would cost. To date we have spent £750,000 and when the work is finished we will have spent £760,000.  Deputy Taylor came along with the idea that this was a secondhand shop taking in the carpets from Áras an Uachtaráin, but that is a ridiculous suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary for one moment?  He has been speaking here since 5.30 and he has not mentioned anything else except Dublin.  There are more important things to talk about than the furniture, carpets and Venetian blinds of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give me a chance I will deal with the other matters.</P>
      <P>The entrance to this House is at Leinster Lawn and I am investigating the possibility of having this floodlit. I am also looking into the possibility of borrowing some pictures from the National Gallery which could be hung in various parts of the House.  The new building is air-conditioned and that is why it sometimes works in reverse and blows in cold air in order to maintain an even temperature.  If the lifts do not do what you want them to do it means that somebody else has pressed the button before you.  They are worked by an electronic brain which registers the calls and answers them in the order in which they were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Coughlan, Crotty, Barry and Tully in particular were not satisfied with our rate of school building.  I will give some statistics on this which will clear the picture.  In 1952-53 the total amount provided for school building and renovation was £687,000 and <Col N="1590" /> in 1956-57 it was £1,400,000, that shows an annual increase of approximately £70,000 per annum during that period. In 1962-63 it was £1,820,000.  In 1966-67 it was £2,272,000, which shows an annual rate of increase of £260,000. In 1968-69 we spent £3,510,154, which shows an increase of £370,000 over the year before.  The Government are very firmly committed to a policy of restoring and replacing old schools as quickly as possible.  Every new schools built by the Board of Works contains a kitchen in which a hot meal can be provided for the children.  I should like to assure Deputy Tully, who I notice was at the opening of a new school and may have seen books on the floor, that shelves designed in the central engineering workshop are supplied to the schools on request.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barry, Tully, Dowling, Keating, Andrews and Crotty were concerned about the condition of some of the existing Garda stations.  I share their concern because I believe nothing but the best is good enough for the Garda Síochána.  We are awaiting the recommendation of the Conroy Commission which is due very shortly. There may be some changes in policy when this report has been published, because we will know better where we are going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan wanted to know when we were going to build the new Garda station in Limerick.  I am pleased to be able to tell him that plans are now being drawn up.  The station is going to be constructed in William Street and the work will be started within 12 months.  There was some difficulty in finding a suitable site because we did not think William Street was the best site but it was the only site available to us.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a few statistics about Garda barracks buildings.  In the nine year period from 1960-61 to 1968-69 this office built a total of 74 new stations and 100 houses at a cost of £653,000.  In the same period improvement schemes, such as the installation of bathrooms and toilets, were carried out in 399 stations at a cost of about £310,000.  In the current year about 100 improvement schemes, involving the expenditure of £55,000 <Col N="1591" /> are planned.  In the period since 1962-63 the National Building Agency erected nearly 450 homes at a total cost of £1,100,000.  However we might wish to accelerate that programme, I think our record over the last nine years is not one we need be ashamed of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry complained that three quarters of the £10 million in this Estimate is being spent in Dublin, but this is just not so.  Expenditure in Dublin in the main is on State building.  Otherwise, expenditure on drainage, schools, national monuments, Shannon navigation and coast protection are mostly to the benefit of the country areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one thing that needs to be clarified.  There is the maximum cooperation between the engineers of the Office of Public Works and the engineers of local authorities. There is no problem arising there. They cooperate fully together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the £3½ million on schools is a fair slice of £9½ million. Deputies Barry and Tully were particularly concerned about having the history of the various national monuments made available either by tape recorder or cards that could be purchased or on plaques attached to the monuments.  We are looking into these matters.  We realise that there is need for some improvement in this matter, that the old &ldquo;Protected by the Office of Public Works&rdquo; plaque is not adequate for the situation.  We have drawn up a tentative list of 20 principal national monuments&mdash;I shall not name them because they could be changed and then I would find myself in difficulty with Deputies who might find that the monuments in which they were interested had been left out.  We hope that over the next few years we will be able to put in a guide service such as we have in Newgrange and now at Cashel, at each of these 20 monuments. We think this is the best way to do it but it must be remembered that the whole question of national monuments is a long-term national programme. It is not a matter that one can rush at and do overnight.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out quite clearly that of all the provisions in the Estimate the one in which there is the biggest increase in expenditure is the provision for parks and monuments&mdash; this year increased by 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I was asked some questions about the John F. Kennedy Memorial.  All I can say about it is that contract drawings will be ready in my Department some time next year or possibly by the end of this year and the Minister for Finance has indicated to the House that he will then call a meeting of the all-party committee.  It is an all-party committee which will decide what further progress will be made with this project.  The Haddington Road site will be retained regardless of what decision is arrived at about the siting of the memorial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Joe Dowling was very concerned about the design of the Wolfe Tone and Thomas Davis monuments. I do not claim to be in a position to judge but the advice given to my Department is that they are of considerable <Col N="1593" /> artistic merit.  I should like to say, however, that the sculpture that has been designed for the memorial park will be a beautiful thing.  However, there has been some controversy because this is being mounted in Italy. The matter was raised by the man who carried out the work for us on the Wolfe Tone monument.  I should like to put on record the position regarding this.  The original design of the Garden of Remembrance envisaged a central sculptural feature.  The choice of theme was a very difficult matter.  Early in 1966 the Government announced their decision to appoint the sculptor, Oisin Kelly, on the basis of a theme which he proposed.  It depicts the transformation of men into swans.  The sculptor said his thought on the matter was largely informed by the poetry of William Butler Yeats and the idea that men at a certain moment in history are transformed utterly.  It is expected to be ready for erection in the garden in mid-1971.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of having the casting done at home or abroad, the sculptural group consists of four figures and four swans.  These together form a very large and complex structure, so that great care has to be exercised in reinforcing the casting and in assembling them in their completed form.  A firm had to be chosen which had experience of casting and of assembling large-scale monuments in bronze.  It was also necessary to engage a firm employing modellers with experience of full-scale enlargement, who would collaborate satisfactorily with the sculptor&mdash;that is most important&mdash;who, in any case, would be responsible for the finished details of the enlargement before casting.  A special technique was worked out for this collaboration and, as the result of that advice which was given to me, I decided that the course which we followed was the correct one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney told me that he would like to see more gatekeepers in the Phoenix Park.  I should like to inform the Deputy that, if I can, I shall try to man every gate in the Phoenix Park, regardless of what it costs.  I will have a lot more to say about the Phoenix Park at a later date as I am having certain things examined at the <Col N="1594" /> moment.  I think Deputy Dowling's suggestion for the provision of bowling greens there is an excellent one and I will have it examined forthwith.  I should like also to join Deputy Dowling in congratulating RTE on their very fine film on the archaeological finds at Winetavern Street.</P>
    <P>I have confirmed that the information given to us here today by Deputy Davern regarding a certain picture which RTE presented is correct information and that the Board of Works and the school manager, several years before the group water scheme was envisaged for Ballylooby, had started and had sunk a well and that the work had gone so far when the group water scheme came in that it was decided that this method that we had decided on of supplying water to the children should be proceeded with. In the circumstances, I think the manager was right in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary given any consideration to the possibility of having a municipal golf course in the Phoenix Park?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being considered in conjunction with a number of other matters.  I am not yet in a position to give any further detail on it.  Deputy Tully was very concerned to know why there was a delay in paying the increase in pay granted to the people on drainage schemes.  I am satisfied that no undue delay took place in the Office of Public Works.  He was also concerned about the number of people employed in the maintenance staffs on the Glyde and the Dee.  My information, which I got yesterday, was that in 1968 there were 44 and in 1969 there were 39&mdash;a small reduction.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the subject of parks I should like to say that I have requested the Department of Finance to make available to my Department a botanist and horticulturalist and I understand that they will be giving me a decision on this in the next week or two.  This is most desirable in regard to places like the Bourne Vincent Park, the Kilkenny Park and the many other parks and monuments that come under our jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to Newgrange. <Col N="1595" /> It will be some years before the work there is brought to completion. There is one difficulty there which I should like to explain to Deputy Tully.  It is that a number of stones were brought there in 2500 BC, some from the south of Ireland, some from the north, and they are all of different colours, of different textures and of all shapes.  They were obviously placed in some sort of design and a good deal of research will have to be done before the archaeologists down there can decide which way they should be placed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern was concerned about the recruitment of guides at the Rock of Cashel.  The method of recruitment is that we contact the universities and ask them if archaeological students would be interested in taking these appointments.  I will have a look at the matter between now and next year but I think we will have to continue this particular method of appointment. It is, in my opinion, the best way and it helps the students to get practical experience and take a live interest in their subject.</P>
    <P>With regard to Kilkenny Castle&mdash; Deputy Crotty was apparently misinformed&mdash;there is a restoration society and there is a large local committee which meet regularly.  There is complete communication between the Office of Public Works and the local people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey and Deputy Donnellan were concerned about the Corrib.  Work is proceeding, as the Deputy knows, and will continue.  The estimate for the total work is £1 million and about half that amount has been spent.  The Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme will be completed, we expect, in 1971. The Deputies were also concerned about the Suck.  The Suck has been surveyed.  It is No. 8 on the priority list.  It would have been done by now only for the problem of the Shannon, and I am afraid it will have to be left now and done in conjunction with the Shannon drainage scheme.</P>

      <P>Dunkellin is tenth on the list.  With regard to the Groody catchment drainage scheme, we wrote to Limerick Corporation and Limerick County Council asking them if they were willing to place the scheme on exhibition.

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary gave notice of his intention to raise Question No. 40 of 5th November, 1969, on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked was in relation to what I regarded as an important statement which was made by the Minister at the opening of the Norwich Union buildings here in Dublin.  I asked the Minister if, in view of his reported statement that the provision of office accommodation should be slowed down for the present, he proposed to take any effective measures to ensure <Col N="1605" /> that action in this regard be taken by insurance companies and developers. The Minister replied, as reported at column 200 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>In the course of my remarks to which the Deputy refers, I expressed the Government's belief that office building should be slowed down for the present and that developers, including insurance companies engaging in such work, should examine whether schemes for the provision of houses, flats or hostels could be substituted for new office projects they may have on hands.  I expect that in response developers will consider carefully the extent to which it will be possible for them to meet the Government's view.  It is proposed that consultations regarding their investment policies should take place from time to time with investing agencies, including insurance companies...</P>
      <P>That is a welcome departure from the attitude of the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Finance issued a note of warning suggesting that, perhaps, the time had come when insurance companies should curtail the provision of finance for such property speculation as office accommodation and turn their attention to the provision of more money for houses.</P>
      <P>The only question I ask is whether the Minister's remarks to the effect that it is proposed that consultations regarding investment policies should take place from time to time with investing companies, including insurance companies, is an adequate response at this time from the Minister for Finance?  There has been an increase in the amount of rent paid each year by Government Departments in this city for the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a supplementary to a question put down by me and answered on 11th November, I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the annual rental charge for Government offices in the city of Dublin in 1967 was in the region of £250,194; that in 1968 it had risen to £343,260 and that in the current year it is £347,506.  This means that the capital value of what property the developers now possess in the city of Dublin and to whom this Government <Col N="1606" /> are paying rent amounts to something like £3 million in capital value.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to ask the Minister whether he thought the time had come to reconsider our policy in relation to office rents in Dublin and the manner of leasing these offices.  The Minister made a point that we did not have to lock up any precious capital in offices of this kind and that we needed it more for houses.  However, I questioned whether the rental system in Dublin is on a seven years lease.  It turned out that this is so and that it is possible for developers to demand new terms at the end of seven years.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is possible for us to call off the bargain but by then the amount of rent paid would be gone down the drain.  It may be argued that the Government are right in not locking up capital in the purchase of office blocks but it happens that some of our Irish insurance companies are backing some of these developers who, in turn, lease the premises to Government Departments as is the case with the new civic offices in which Dublin Corporation was involved.  In fact, Irish Life have backed two tenders for people who have tendered for office blocks in the case of new city offices.</P>
    <P>Since Irish Life or any other Irish insurance company are backing office developers and since the developers, in turn, are leasing the premises to the Government, would it not be possible to cut out the middle man and give the loans direct to the Government? This is an argument and I am not making a big issue of it but if an Irish insurance company's capital goes into backing a developer in any office block development, could not the Government go to such a company, especially an Irish company, and get the loan direct?</P>
    <P>The real issue is&mdash;the Minister has referred to this&mdash;whether the insurance companies could pay more attention to the needs of house purchasers.  I made a statement that to my knowledge Irish Life, during the past six months did not accept any mortgage arrangements for those who wish to buy their own houses.  The Minister <Col N="1607" /> said that is not so but that is my information and in the case of the New Ireland it can be said that they have restricted or, if you like, discouraged, for many months those people who are anxious to obtain accommodation to purchase their own houses.  In any case, it can be said that there is a reluctance at the present time on the part of insurance companies to meet the demands of people who wish to purchase their own homes while there is enthusiasm for property development business if possible, with a 999-year lease.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Since the State has 95 per cent of the holdings of Irish Life one would be expect that that company would be anxious to meet the needs of home purchasers in the present serious housing shortage.  The Minister may say that they have their policyholders to consider but housing is not a bad investment for any insurance company to be involved in.  It may be necessary for them to have a certain interest in property development but not to the extent to which they are concerned now.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question the Minister said that housing loans now amount to £6 million a year but my information is that they amount to £3 million in any one year so I ask the Minister where he gets this figure of £6 million a year. However, he may be able to answer that.  The real kernel is this.  If, as is the case, the Government have been involved in renting office accommodation from developers who have been involved in the rising property prices here in Dublin, it means that the Government have been a participant in this inflationary situation which obtains in relation to property prices in Dublin. The position can now be said to be that property prices in Dublin are comparable to those in London.  This, of course, has its effect on costs for the ordinary person seeking a house.  It means that the site value of that house has kept pace with the site value of office accommodation in the centre of Dublin or certainly some relationship has been kept between the one and the other.  The site value of any house at the moment is such that one-third of <Col N="1608" /> the cost would be involved for the site value.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their policies in relation to the provision of offices, in the manner in which they have entered into financial arrangements to ensure office accommodation for Dublin, have played a part in the booming, of property prices here in Dublin.  The Government have played a deeper part than we realise.  This is my information: the Minister may deny it or otherwise.  My information is that developers have in fact, been informed, before any development work has been done on the site, that the Government would be interested in leasing office accommodation on that site and in that development. This means that the Government, in advance, assist in this spiralling development of property prices here in Dublin.  Even if the Minister were to say that property prices would go up, anyway, it means that the Government are unhappily an accessory in this troublesome and very serious rise in property prices in Dublin which vitally affects home purchasers.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there is need for good office accommodation in Dublin. I am aware that an international firm has done a survey of European capitals and has found that Dublin has a great deal of obsolescent office accommodation and that we are in need of better office accommodation.  The question we must face at this time is: Which is our greater need at present&mdash;the need for cheap houses for the many or the need for better office accommodation? Even if these are the only interests involved, even if we leave out what apparently is the real interest of those involved in this development which is not so much to provide better office accommodation as the gilt-edged possibility of a very early return on their investment, which undoubtedly exists at present in office building speculation &mdash;if there is a quick return in office building, as there is, and if it is easier to get a loan for £1 million from an insurance company for office building than to get a loan from them of £500,000 for house-building&mdash;we should demand pretty high standards of State-owned companies.  The Minister said that we pay the same price finally for <Col N="1609" /> all our office accommodation.  That may be.  However, the fact is that where a Government themselves, by open plan beforehand, assure the developer that there will be a Government interest in taking over the office accommodation, it means that the Government are themselves investing in inflation and in the most dangerous and anti-social of all inflationary developments, namely, property values.</P>
    <P>Take a man who, five years ago, could have got a house for £2,500.  Over the past five years the price of any house in Dublin has doubled in value.  Over the same period, his wage has not doubled in the amount he takes home each week.  If the Minister would make the arguments that the insurance companies have the interests of their policyholders at heart we must wonder which policyholders they seek most to suit. Take a man whose only interest is in purchasing a house, and so on&mdash;the small policyholders in the insurance company.  When he seeks to purchase a house he finds that the same policy being pursued by his insurance company in property speculation means that he has to pay double over a five-year period.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Life, one must question whether the emphasis in that company is quite right in view of the national developments we seek to bring about in our economy.  One must question their line on this blue chip insurance contract.  Irish Life are handing out policy contracts and the premiums given to Irish Life by the policy-holders are directed by them to the Shamrock Trust in London.  Irish Life is becoming merely a post office for the doing of that.  Is it desirable to find an Irish-owned insurance company doing this?  One might ask: Is there not a case for taxation here? If ready money is being made rather easily on a secure market in office development, one might ask: Are we getting sufficient in taxation back from these companies?  Ironically, Dublin Corporation gives them a rates remission.  This is given to these people who are on this absolutely certain investment.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the community <Col N="1610" /> is looking for punishment in the type of outmoded code under which Dublin Corporation actually gives a rates remission in this situation.  It is time Dublin Corporation revised the situation.  I would ask the Minister to do more than consult: I would ask him to meet these companies, especially the Irish-owned ones.  Even if the New Ireland Assurance Company Limited is not State-owned, the Minister will agree that those associated with it are sympathetically inclined towards the Government.  Many supporters of the Government have traditionally been associated with that company.  They are at least on terms of easy familiarity with the board of directors of that company and it should be possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that about the best way to put it is to say that the Government are on terms of easy familiarity with those associated with the New Ireland Assurance Company, Limited.  I would ask the Minister to see that more is done to ensure that these companies desist from their involvement in these property developments that are going on.  You need not refuse outright to accommodate a man who wants to purchase a house.  If you provide him with only 80 per cent of the price of the house by way of loan, you are asking him&mdash;an ordinary individual&mdash;to provide £1,000 deposit on the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man at the bottom of this pyramid of property inflation here in Dublin is that person who cannot qualify for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  The person who must go out on that open market and try to fend for himself and provide his own house has no protection from anybody.  He is the person in whose face the doors of Irish-owned insurance companies are being slammed. They are asking him to provide a deposit that has rocketed beyond the reach of his pocket in the past five years.  They now seek a deposit of £1,000 where possibly, a few years ago, they were looking for £500.  These unfortunate people see no remedy in their need for a house.  These are the people who are forced to seek accommodation <Col N="1611" /> in private flats where there is no control over rents and who are really at their wits' end to see what they can do.  Though it might seem a long distance from their plight to fault the Government on their participation in the property boom in Dublin, the Government and the Irish insurance companies are ignoring the plight of these ordinary people and are adding to their difficulties.  Unless the Government can get our insurance companies to develop a different policy, to arrange for lower deposit rates, to turn away from property development, unless the Government themselves take a hand at controlling the prices of property and land in Dublin&mdash;and that means getting out of the property racket&mdash;there can be no possibility of providing cheaper houses, cheaper deposit rates, for these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may surprise Deputy O'Leary by saying that I do not disagree with the general trend of his remarks.  I want to assure him that in this matter his own wishes and aims would not be a great deal different from mine or from those of the Minister for Local Government.  We may, perhaps, differ somewhat on the practicalities of the situation.  Let me say, first of all, in connection with this question of the Government renting office accommodation for their own requirements that this policy by the Government of renting rather than building for themselves began about 1965.  At that time we were faced with a very serious capital shortage.  Capital was urgently required for many Government purposes, such as the development of industry, social purposes, the erection of schools and hospitals, and so on.  The Government very consciously took a decision, rightly or wrongly, that they could not afford to be locking up capital in office accommodation. They decided to rent instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know any case where the Government have said to any developers, that they could go ahead and build something and the Government would guarantee to take it off them. My memory may be at fault but I am quite certain that has never happened. <Col N="1612" /> There may have been instances where the Government learned, through the Office of Public Works, that a building was to be built and where they entered into negotiations with the developers to take some of the accommodation in that building in order that they could have that accommodation adjusted to their own particular requirements. I want to make the distinction here between agreeing to take a building before it was started and agreeing to take a building which was to go up in any event.</P>
    <P>However, on that particular issue I want to tell the Deputy quite frankly that for some time now the Minister for Local Government and myself have been discussing the desirability of our making an announcement that the Government are no longer in the market for new office accommodation. We would very much like to say that. Unfortunately, I feel quite satisfied that as soon as we make such an announcement some particular Department or some Government agency would prove conclusively that it needed new accommodation. If the Deputy were in my position he would find these demands irresistible.  If I discussed one of these proposals with him he would agree it would be necessary that the particular Department or agency should get the accommodation it sought because it really needed it.  In fact, Deputies on all sides of the House press me from time to time to provide accommodation of one sort or another for some particular purpose.  It is not entirely an open and shut matter so far as the Government are concerned.  We have been trying to hold the scales as evenly as possible.  There is tremendous pressure for suitable adequate office accommodation for the public service.  We are now reaping the fruits of 40 years of neglect when nothing was built or provided.  We are right up against it and we must provide it.  The question is how we can meet the legitimate needs of the public service without, at the same time, making undue inroads into the funds and resources which are very much required for urgent social purposes such as those Deputy O'Leary speaks of.  I want to assure the Deputy this problem is actively under consideration <Col N="1613" /> by both the Minister for Local Government and myself.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that we put a stamp duty of ten per cent on new office blocks in the last Budget as an indication that we wanted people to think of other types of building.  We intend to follow that up and we would take any other action which appeared to be appropriate or desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely disagree that perhaps the insurance companies could do a bit more with regard to housing accommodation.  But they do very well. I have figures for investments in house purchase loans by them over the last few years.  They are:</P>

    <P>This makes a total of over £15 million in the last three years.  The bulk of that is still outstanding.  In addition to that, they subscribe very generously to all types of National Loans as they come along.  They lend money to various local authorities and invest very substantially in Irish industrial development.  Just as the Government have to conserve their capital resources and allocate them on some basis of priority, so must financial institutions like insurance companies.  They must look at the inflow of funds in order that they may give a fair return to their policy-holders and play their part in building up the country.  They must look at their portfolio to see how it should be divided.  In the course of discussions they may agree to increase their investment in housing.  I am sure if they can do so, they will.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to make in this connection.  From every point of view it is important for us to have a substantial capital inflow into the country.  In the interests of overall economic development we are prepared to tolerate a balance of payments deficit of a certain amount every year. That can only be made up, and up <Col N="1614" /> to now has been made up or financed by an inflow of capital.  I do not know what the Deputy would think of the proposition to have an office block in Dublin financed exclusively from abroad.  That, in fact, is not a bad thing so far as the economy is concerned because it would mean that the resources available inside our community, whether insurance company resources or whatever, would be available for social purposes such as the Deputy speaks of.  In so far as property development financed entirely from outside the country is concerned, I think that at the present stage of our development it is beneficial, but this has to be qualified by the remark that excessive activity in the building industry is not a good thing either.  We must try to aim at a level of building activity which is sustainable over the years, perhaps gradually rising.  We certainly do not want to do anything in the present situation&mdash;and I would ask Deputy O'Leary to try to understand this&mdash;which would bring about one of those stop-go situations in the building industry where there is a sudden clamp down and a great deal of unemployment and it takes years to get things going again and then there is excessive activity which inevitably leads to another curb.</P>
    <P>What I promise the House we will certainly try to do is to ensure that the Government's requirement for office accommodation does not contribute to a difficult situation.  We will try to ensure that the greatest possible flow of funds into housing and housing accommodation from all sources is achieved.  We will try to so arrange matters that the very important industry we have here, the building industry, is allowed to proceed in the way I have said, at a level which is hopefully rising steadily and, at the same time, sustainable.</P>
