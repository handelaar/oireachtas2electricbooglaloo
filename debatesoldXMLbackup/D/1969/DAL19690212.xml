      <P>Our Embassy in London has had for several years a special officer whose duty is to keep contact with clubs and groups run by Irish citizens resident in Great Britain.  These voluntary organisations supported by their members and friends are doing splendid work not only socially for their members but also to help Irish emigrants in need of advice and assistance.</P>
      <P>For the last few years the Embassy has operated a scheme to pay the fare back to Ireland of Irish citizens in special need of protection who should be helped to return home.  In 1967-68 fifty-seven Irish citizens and this financial year 86 were so assisted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that some applicants for ESB connection have been informed that connection to their houses cannot be made before the financial year 1972-73; and if he can do anything to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1968, authorised the increase to £50 million on the expenditure which the ESB may incur on extending electricity to rural areas.  The increase of the limit was to enable the Board to complete the rural electrification post-development scheme and also to go back over the areas already covered by the scheme.  Thus, all householders would have an opportunity of taking supply at the improved terms which came into effect last year and which involved considerable reduction in the high special service charges payable by some householders.  When introducing the Bill, I explained that, in carrying out the post-development scheme, the ESB were recanvassing the country in a planned sequence of areas. This ensures orderly development and keeps costs to a minimum.  I also indicated that the Board expected that it would take the nearly five years&mdash; until 1973&mdash;to offer supply again to all unconnected householders in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the improved terms have proved so popular that many more householders than had been expected are now taking supply.  The ESB are doing their utmost to cope with the increased number of acceptances.  It means increased annual capital expenditure and the training of additional personnel.  They have increased their budget for rural electrification and have also increased their rate of connection but, even so, progress of the schemes, in terms of areas completed, is now behind schedule.  While the scheme will be completed in most <Col N="730" /> of the country by 1973 there may be some areas where completion of the scheme will take longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister himself might answer this question because portion of the area affected is now in the territory which he will be representing for a short while.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if any priority will be given to people who applied some years ago but who, because of the high charges, were unable to accept and who are now anxious to have connection made or would the Parliamentary Secretary say if it is staff shortage that is causing the delay, not up in the mountains or on islands, but in places like the middle of County Meath where people have been told they cannot get connection until 1972-73?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me before if any special arrangements could be made to cater for people who had been offered electricity previously but could not take it due to the high service charge.  The incidence of inquiries and acceptance on a nationwide basis in this regard has been quite enormous.  From that point of view, in each area where canvassing or recanvassing is going on it does entail the giving of a supply of electricity to quite a large number of these people who did get this opportunity before, but it has to be done on a planned scale over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that those people who applied and could not take supply because of the high charges are not to blame, that they were cut out because of the way in which the ESB carried out the canvass?  There were pockets all over the place and these people were left out.  Can he say now if these people will be connected, or do the ESB intend to carry out an entirely unnecessary recanvass in areas where all the people have applied for service?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="731" /> say why they should have to wait until a recanvass is carried out, or is it just stalling?  Is there some reason why the ESB feel they would not like to go ahead as fast as people want them to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no underhand reason.  In any given area it is very hard to imagine, as the Deputy has pointed out, that everybody who is unconnected in that area has already applied for connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody who is interested applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are a number of people who are interested when the time comes for a recanvass but who at a given time would not have made application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So the others must wait because some people are too lazy to make application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Because there are still 60,000 houses in the country that want electricity, and the cheapest possible way and the obvious way to supply them is to do it in a planned and programmed way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most intensive drumlin soil area comprises South Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, North Roscommon and East Sligo.  This is part of the main drumlin belt which stretches from County Louth to South Donegal. Drumlins are oval or egg-shaped, generally about half a mile in length and rising 100 to 200 feet above the surrounding countryside.  They constitute a complex system of soil types with considerable variation in distribution. Drumlin soils in general and especially in Leitrim, West Cavan, North Roscommon and East Sligo are heavy and difficult to drain and because of this are best suited to grass production.  Dairying based on good grassland management, calf rearing and pig production are some of the activities that can profitably be pursued by farmers in the area.  In East Cavan and Monaghan where the soil is more <Col N="735" /> free-draining tillage crops are successfully grown.</P>
    <P>While some parts of the drumlin belt are unsuitable for tillage crops the majority of the farmers there benefit from the heavily subsidised creamery milk price; the price support arrangements for beef; the store cattle price link with the guaranteed prices for cattle in Britain; and the guaranteed prices for pigs.  The Government, however, recognised that special problems are presented by drumlin soil conditions in deciding to include Counties Cavan and Monaghan within the 12county &ldquo;western area&rdquo; where a number of special measures of assistance to farmers are in operation.  A very large proportion of the drumlin farmers can avail of these special measures and also of various schemes, including the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme, designed to help the smaller farmers.  I am not satisfied therefore that additional preferential treatment for the drumlin areas, as suggested by the Deputy, would be warranted.  I might add, however, that I am giving close attention at present to the whole question whether some further re-orientation of State expenditure in favour of certain categories of farmers would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>Regarding grants for surface drainage, I am satisfied that this is already adequately catered for under the Land Project.  Grants are not available under the Project for maintenance work and I do not propose to alter the scheme to cater for work which should form part of normal farm husbandry.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the disposal of skim milk is primarily a matter for the local creameries.  I would point out, however, that by far the most remunerative way of disposing of skim milk is to use it for feeding to livestock, especially pigs.</P>
    <P>I am aware that because of the wet conditions in most parts of the drumlin area, liver fluke infestation in livestock is a serious problem there, as, indeed, it is in many other parts of the country. I have already established an expert group to advise me on how best to control and prevent this disease and my Department is co-operating in <Col N="736" /> trials with a new product which it is hoped will reduce the incidence of fluke.  There are difficulties, apart from financial considerations, in the way of subsidising the prices of anti-parasitic drugs.  The cost of dosing is not high in relation to the value of animals and all farmers would be well advised to take the necessary precautions as a matter of good husbandry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it would be a helpful step to resolve these problems with which his Department is so familiar, in view of the work that has been done with regard to them over the past 20 years, to extend the pilot scheme at present being operated by his Department to the belt of drumlin country to which he has referred?  Does he not think that if the benefits of the pilot scheme were superimposed upon the specialist schemes already in operation in the drumlin area he might have a complete answer to the problems posed by Deputy Dr. Gibbons in his question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the pilot area scheme is concerned, the House will appreciate that various difficulties face farmers in different parts of the country, particularly in these western areas where this pilot scheme is operating. Perhaps arising from the operation of this scheme changes may come to be made when we are satisfied that the changes are for the benefit of such areas and will relieve such difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not notorious that the pilot scheme is just a new name for the parish plan, and that what we really want is that the provisions of the parish plan or the pilot scheme&mdash;call it what you may&mdash;should be superimposed on the existing schemes especially oriented to the drumlin problem and, if that were followed through, we would have virtually the optimum programme for meeting these problems with which every Minister for Agriculture is inundated?</P>

      <P>Conditions on export markets for milk products to which I referred at some length in my speech introducing the Estimate for Agriculture on 10th December continue to be unsatisfactory and, in the view of competent international authorities, show no signs of early improvement.</P>
      <P>In this situation, everything possible is being done to secure a greater degree of access for our rising milk product exports in these difficult markets, and An Bord Bainne is striving to improve the returns being obtained and to develop new outlets.  My Department is also actively exploring possible new outlets on the home market, which would give better overall returns than those obtainable from some of our butter exports at present.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister reconcile the fact that dairy farmers in this country are receiving the lowest prices in Europe for milk delivered to the creameries while at the same time our dairy products are commanding premium prices on the export market with the ludicrous situation which has arisen in the last 24 hours that the dairy farmers of this country are being asked to take a loss of income of a couple of million pounds following the announcement by An Bord Bainne that they are increasing the levy?  Surely the Minister will agree there is need for a complete overhaul <Col N="739" /> of the marketing system?  It is entirely unjust that dairy farmers should be asked to take a loss in income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether his Department have made any study of the possibilities of group farming; and, if so, whether he proposes to take any steps to encourage and organise such groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Group farming can range from a simple arrangement for the joint purchase of materials, such as lime or fertilisers, to a more integrated system involving the pooling of land, labour, equipment and other resources.</P>
      <P>The potentialities and possibilities of promoting group farming are being kept in mind.  The Land Commission are undertaking a study of the value of a system of combined or group farming involving the pooling of machinery, livestock and land.  The object of this study is to assess the scope for the co-operative use of land as a means of raising farm income, particularly in areas of small-scale farming.</P>
      <P>The promotion of group activity among farmers has been an essential feature of the pilot area programme since its inception and its value has been demonstrated.  The Agricultural Advisory Service is always ready to advise and assist farmers who may be contemplating group projects or co-operative activities of any kind.</P>
      <P>Experience elsewhere indicates that group farming is not devoid of inherent problems and careful appraisal of the resources, financial and otherwise, and of the potential advantage to be gained, is necessary in all cases before embarking on these projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This and all other matters that would seem to have any hope of improving the lot of the Irish farmers is not only a matter that is being studied but I can assure the Deputy has been under study in this Department over the years as these things arise.  That will continue to be the case in the future as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that this concept of group farming is based on the fundamental concept of co-operative farming and would the Minister not agree that the proper approach now for his Department and the Advisory Service and the Agricultural Institute would be to combine with a view to formulating a concrete national plan for group farming?  It has been completely haphazard up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fact that a project is in fact being set up is clear evidence that there is not any haphazard approach about this in so far as the Government are concerned and that the proper method of true assessment in a practical sense is now about to take place.  No more satisfactory way of ascertaining the advantages or disadvantages could be devised than the practical application of this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission have recommended that, in cases where the original lease of a property, expiring before 1931, was of the nature of a building lease and where a further lease was made at a rent below the rateable valuation, the second lease should attract the right to a reversionary lease.  They have also recommended that this right should be available, notwithstanding that the further lease expired up to five years previously, provided that the lessee under the expired lease is still in possession, that there is no other person entitled to a reversionary lease and that no new arrangement has been made with the landlord.  I understand that the landlord is dealing with the tenants on the basis of these recommendations in anticipation of any legislation which may be introduced.</P>

Is it not also part of the Minister's scheme that, in the case of a married man who does not tell his Department that he has been married and who dies, his widow can, in fact, buy herself in?  I ask the Minister to look again at the scheme to see if these widows can be included.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out last night that this entry is another typical example of Fianna Fáil butchering and gerrymandering.  I said that the Minister had at least two other alternatives which would have avoided this ruthless butchering of constituencies.  I do not think it is necessary now to occupy the time of the House by going back over all the facts and figures we produced to the Minister yesterday evening.  We know they have a majority in the House and that it is their intention to bulldoze this Bill through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, it might be no harm to point out to the House and to <Col N="768" /> the people of the country that when Fianna Fáil came into office there were 61,000 people in the County of Monaghan but in the 1966 Census the population had dropped to 45,732.  During those years Fianna Fáil have driven about 17,000 people out of that county alone.  Due to their mismanagement of the affairs of the nation and due to their bad government they have driven out sufficient people to have an extra seat in Monaghan.  It is entirely wrong for the Minister to get up in this House and try to foist the responsibility and the blame on the Opposition Parties and on the judgement of Mr. Justice Budd.  The responsibility for the fact that there are fewer Deputies in rural Ireland today rests on the shoulders of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy L'Estrange, of course, is well aware that no unnecessary butchering is being carried out.  He is well aware that if it is now necessary to transfer portions of one county into another that is because he and his Party and the people in the referendum refused to accept a proposal which would make it unnecessary to do this except in cases where there would be a comparatively large deviation from the national average of population per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must also be aware of the stand his Party took on this matter when it was relevant.  When it was proposed to do something about it the official Fine Gael attitude was that it was a matter of absolutely no importance whether a person voted in his own county or in an adjoining county.  Yesterday I gave <Col N="769" /> a quotation from Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution on 28th May, 1968.  I can give another quotation today from Volume 235, column 517 of the Official Report of 5th June, 1968, at which Deputy Fitzpatrick said:</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to believe that people have all that dislike of moving from one county to another. Really, the arguments that the Fianna Fáil Party in this House are prepared to adduce to justify these measures are amazing.</P>
    <P>As lately as last June, Fine Gael said they found it an amazing suggestion that anyone would have any &ldquo;dislike of moving from one county to another&rdquo;.  It was because they succeeded in getting that attitude accepted by the people that we are now precluded from leaving these people to vote in their own county.  Although we have a three-seat constituency based on each of these five counties still, in order to satisfy the whims of the Fine Gael Party, it is necessary to require people from one county to vote in another county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are now dealing with the entry in the Schedule relating to Monaghan.  I readily concede that I said all I had intended to say in relation to the constituencies of Cavan, Meath and Monaghan when dealing with the entry in the Schedule relating to Meath yesterday.  Apparently, for some queer reason best known to himself, the Minister for Local Government wants to drag this thing on.  If he does not I must say I am quite prepared to co-operate with him.  My position has always been quite clear in relation to the county boundaries.  I say it is desirable to maintain county boundaries but it is not fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were dealing with the referendum we were dealing with something which was absolutely fundamental. We were dealing with the type of electoral system which we were going to have here.  We were considering whether or not we would authorise the present Minister for Local Government to decide that as few as 16,000 people approximately would qualify for <Col N="770" /> a TD in one area but that the same Minister might make the figure 23,000 in another area.  Fine Gael thought that was fundamentally wrong and we told the people we thought it was fundamentally wrong.  The people accepted our advice and rejected the advice of the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>That was dealing with fundamentals. The Minister was ordered by the people, or at least his Government were ordered by the people to come in here and prepare a reasonable scheme of constituencies having regard to the decision of the people that they wanted proportional representation retained and that they wanted the constituencies defined within the decision of the Supreme Court in 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I fully appreciate that but every time the Minister gets up he has a record which he plays which says because the people said something in 1968 he has to do what he is doing now.  Every time he plays that record I find it necessary to put the record right by correcting him.  I am saying now it was quite unnecessary, as a result of the decision of the people on 16th October last, for the Minister to introduce here the type of monstrosity he has introduced and the type of monstrosity the Taoiseach and himself committed themselves to introduce before the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say in relation to the constituency of Monaghan and the constituency of Meath, as amended, the Minister could have produced, had he wanted to do so, a much more reasonable scheme, much more reasonable constituencies.  I said yesterday that due to the types of land and the types of farming in Monaghan and in Meath the people have very little in common.  They are engaged in different types of farming and they have different types of farms. Monaghan is predominantly a pig-rearing county.  It might be said that by and large pig-rearing is unheard of <Col N="771" /> in Deputy Tully's county of Meath. Monaghan is largely a milk-producing area but Meath does not go into milk production at all.  They have nothing in common.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that Louth and Meath have a great deal in common from the geographical point of view and from the industrial and agricultural point of view.  I suggested to the Minister it would have been much more reasonable for him to have had some such arrangement as has been outlined here between Louth and Meath and I pointed out that I had no personal axe to grind in regard to this.  The Minister could quite conveniently have had the constituency of Monaghan and Cavan where from the agricultural and the land point of view the people have a great deal in common.  I said that they have been operating a joint hospital board for many years and they come into contact with each other to a great extent.  They belong to the same province. They are both counties of small farmers.  They are both heavily engaged in pig production and milk production. Indeed, up to recently both counties went in for grass seed production which is a type of farming which is practically unheard of in the greater portion of the rest of the country with the exception, perhaps, of Donegal.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday if the Minister wanted to be reasonable and to do the reasonable thing he could have joined Monaghan and Cavan together. Whether or not I believe the county boundaries are vital and sacrosanct there is no doubt the Minister does if we are to believe him because the Minister and the Taoiseach are on record throughout last year as committing themselves to the statement that county boundaries should not be disturbed.  I am sure the Minister does not deny that that was his gospel last year, that he preached that in this House throughout most of last year and also up and down the country in conventions launching the referendum campaign. The Taoiseach did likewise.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would not say, or maybe he will say, that he is fully converted to a new belief that county boundaries do not matter at all. <Col N="772" /> I have made my position clear about them.  I do not believe they are fundamental. I believe if they can be conveniently retained they should be retained. I repeat that the Minister's position on county boundaries is clear or it was clear and there can be no doubt about it.  Here he is, for some reason best known to himself, splitting up the county of Meath between Cavan and Monaghan.  Not alone is he doing that in the entry for Monaghan, which we are now dealing with, but&mdash;outside Leitrim I do not think the like of this has happened in the country&mdash;the Minister is putting a bit of Louth into Monaghan and a bit of Meath into Monaghan and he is also putting a bit of Meath into Cavan.  If the Minister wants to keep this debate going on those lines, I will certainly facilitate him.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have committed an absolute somersault on the question of county boundaries.  He conceded yesterday there are more ways of doing this than one.  He conceded he could have constituencies by dealing with the counties Louth and Monaghan and with the counties Cavan and Monaghan and in that way there would be far less disturbance.  The Minister also said that he had stated that people had no objection to being shifted about.  If you transfer people from one county to another then transfer them in a direction that they would usually travel; do not transfer them in an unnatural direction.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that to transfer people from Meath to Monaghan is to transfer them from one province to another, from one type of county to another and it is transferring them in a direction which they would normally never travel.  It cannot be denied that Meath people and Louth people gravitate towards Dublin rather than towards the North of Ireland. That is the sort of complaint I am making.  That is the sort of unreasonable approach to this matter by the Minister that I want to expose.  I confess that I thought I had done it adequately on the Meath entry yesterday but here we have the Minister bouncing in again with the same old hackneyed arguments he made yesterday, <Col N="773" /> relying on the same arguments in relation to the referendum and in relation to the decision of the High Court, neither of which hold water.</P>
    <P>I say that it is patently obvious that the Minister sought to punish the people of the country in general because they did not accept his advice and that he thinks that, by these unnatural distortions and unnatural carving-up of counties and constituencies, he will reap some political benefit for himself by way of gerrymandering &mdash;as the Taoiseach had in mind when he wrote his expensive pamphlet <i>The Reasons Why</i>.  It will be seen from that document that the Taoiseach warned the people that, if there was not a commission, presided over by a judge, there would be gerrymandering &mdash;and here we have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is dealing with the beginning of Deputy Fitzpatrick's last contribution when he accused me of wanting to drag on this debate.  Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to say that his position on this question of the breaching of county boundaries has always been clear.  To a certain extent, I would agree with that.  Certainly, during the debate on the proposal to amend the Constitution in order to permit of consideration being given to the question of county boundaries, his position was perfectly clear to me.  His position, and the position of his Party, at that time was that these were matters of no account.  I would say that his position now is reasonably clear to me also.  His position, and the position of his Party, now is that these are matters of great account and that they should not be breached at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>His position now is the direct opposite of what it was in May and June, 1968, and right up to October, 1968.  My view, on the other hand, has not changed, My view in 1961 was the same as the view of the then Minister for Local Government&mdash; that these were matters of importance &mdash;and, in 1959, that these were matters of importance and that it was desirable to adhere to county boundaries as far as possible; that there was nothing undemocratic in having a slightly smaller population per Deputy in one county than in an adjoining county and that there was nothing so undemocratic in that as to require the uprooting of <Col N="775" /> people from one county and their transfer into another.  That was why my predecessor in 1959 introduced constituencies that did not do any of these anomalous things that are being done today, as in 1961.  That was my view then and that was my view in May and June of last year when Deputy Fitzpatrick held the opposite view&mdash; that it was undesirable to breach county boundaries unless there would be some comparatively large difference in the population per Deputy between different areas&mdash;and that is my view now.  But, in the meantime, the view that Deputy Fitzpatrick had in May and June, 1968, prevailed, and the people have endorsed it.  I am accepting that view.  I am introducing this Bill because the Constitution requires it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to say that the referendum dealt with the electoral system.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, of course, that that is not so. He knows that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill dealt with the electoral system.  He knows that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill dealt with the subject that we are actually discussing here and that he recommended that the permission that we sought to exercise very small amounts of deviation from our national average, for specified purposes, be refused by the people.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows it is incorrect to say that, if that amendment was passed, the Minister could decide to utilise for Party political purposes the small amount of deviation that was proposed. He knows that the Bill proposed to write into the Constitution that this deviation could be exercised only for clearly specified reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the Government have been ordered by the people to prepare a reasonable scheme in accordance with the constitutional provisions.  That is exactly what is being done and what has to be done.  I agree, again, that many alternative schemes could be produced but, in my opinion, any of the large number of alternatives that have emanated from the Fine Gael benches are more unreasonable and more undesirable <Col N="776" /> than what has been put forward. Again, I agree that this is a matter of opinion.  Our opinion is that the type of solution that has been put forward from the Opposition benches would be worse than this and would be attacked much more severely if it had emanated from here.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, that the county of Meath has been split for some reason known only to myself.  Part of Meath has been added to Cavan and part to Monaghan because the population of Cavan&mdash; 54,022&mdash;is too small for a three-seat constituency and the population of Monaghan&mdash;45,732&mdash;even when added to by the transferred population from Louth which is already there, is too small for a three-seat constituency. Deputy Fitzpatrick says that I should have tranferred the population from Meath to Dublin where they would naturally go.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister is tending to cause confusion as regards this entire Bill and the thinking that is behind it.  He says that he believed back in 1960 or 1961 that county boundaries were important; he says he believed it when the referendum was under discussion here and he says that he still believes it. He claims, however, that the people have given a contrary decision and that the result of the referendum may be interpreted as meaning that the people have said to him that they do not care about county or local authority boundaries and that he may go ahead and break them up as he wishes.  This is the interpretation which <Col N="777" /> he has deliberately put on the referendum and this is the defence that he offers for doing what he is doing now to this particular constituency and to the constituencies that we have discussed here during the past couple of days.</P>
      <P>I disagree entirely.  This is a question of interpretation of the people's decision and which is important and relevant to this Bill.  The people did not say that county boundaries were unimportant. They merely refused to accept the Third Amendment which the Minister claimed was calculated to preserve the all-important county boundaries.  The people did not believe the first and they took no notice of the second as a consequence.  They rejected the third because they beleived that the purpose behind it was gerrymandering. The Minister has used this wrong interpretation of the people's decision to justify this gerrymandering Bill that he is now bulldozing through the House.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This dreary debate is really clarifying the position somewhat because at last we have the Minister pinned down to this point&mdash;that in 1961 he believed that county boundaries should be breached only for important reasons, that last year his opinion on county boundaries was the same and that today it is still the same.  It does not matter what my opinion is but that is the opinion of the Minister for Local Government. He says that the people, on 16th October, told him to do what he is doing.  The people told him no such thing.  They told him to introduce a reasonable scheme of constituencies under the law as it stands.  The Minister concedes that there are many ways of doing this but he picks on the most absurd one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He knows well that it was not necessary to have done all the butchering that he has done.  We are labouring this point on this particular entry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because nowhere is it more evident than in relation to Meath which is tied up with the constituency <Col N="778" /> of Monaghan with which we are now dealing.  He cut Meath into three, part of it for Monaghan, part of it for Cavan and part of it for Meath. This was utterly unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The next point which the Minister did not deal with in relation to my last remarks was why, if he is determined to change people from one county to another, he does not change them in a natural direction.  I did not suggest, as the Minister knows perfectly well, that he should take people from the constituency of Meath and put them in Dublin.  I did say that people from Louth and Meath move in that direction and what I did suggest was that a scheme for the constituency in relation to Louth and Meath should be linked up with those two counties because they are natural associates of the same province, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>Now that the Minister is doing something in this Bill in which he does not believe, we have unnecessary carving up of counties and if we find somebody doing something in which he does not believe, we must assume that he is doing it for some ulterior motive and the ulterior motive here is obviously for political party advantage.  That is what was meant when the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; was coined around Senator Gerry from Massachusetts who wanted to get unfair political advantage for his own party.</P>

If we had a reasonable Minister for Local Government, out of all the alternatives which have been put to him he could have drawn up a reasonable scheme that would be acceptable to all Parties in the House.

      <P>We want to put before the Minister the proposal we mentioned last night when we were discussing another constituency, the constituency of Meath.  We suggested that if a small portion of Meath was put into Louth and Louth made a four-seat constituency, it would be much better because we would be transferring only 8,568 people, whereas in the Minister's scheme it is proposed, for political Party purposes and none other, to get the maximum number of seats with the minimum number of votes, by transferring 22,084 people. <Col N="780" /> How can the Minister tell me that his scheme, which is butchering the constituencies, which is taking in part of Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, if the Minister claims our scheme is unreasonable, we are prepared to put on the records of the House that we believe a scheme that would mean transferring only 8,000 is much more reasonable than the Minister's scheme which envisages the transfer of over 22,000 people.</P>

      <P>Why does the Deputy not shut his mouth?  If Monaghan and Cavan were put together the breadth of the constituency would be 140 miles. That would be an excessive distance to have to travel.  Some Deputies mentioned the Protestant section of the people.  I have many friends among this section of the community.  We would do nothing to interfere with them.  That is only a political stunt of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I know this whole area very well, and there is no necessity for Deputy Hogan coming from Tipperary to tell us what to do in County Monaghan. We are not interfering with Tipperary. Deputy Fitzpatrick is very keen on putting Monaghan and Cavan together which, as I say, is 142 miles long. What sense would there be in having a constituency like that?  Where would the people ever get a Deputy in an area that size?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has been the cause of all this.  He stood up in this House all last summer advocating that the people should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum.  If he had asked them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the Third Amendment and &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the Fourth Amendment it would have been sensible, but he was afraid PR would be lost.  They did not get any help from the Labour Party on this issue either, and so Fine Gael told the people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on <Col N="782" /> both issues.  I would advise Deputy Fitzpatrick to leave Monaghan and Cavan alone.  Joining them would only mean longer distances to be travelled by the people living in them in order to look for TDs when they want them.</P>

I pointed out that there is a different type of farming in each of these areas and that the people are completely different in agricultural outlook.  I pointed out that, generally speaking, Meath people never gravitate towards Monaghan; they gravitate towards Louth or Dublin.  I think that is a reasonable argument and that is the sort of argument I was putting up.  The constituency of Meath has been unnecessarily butchered for this reason.  Deputy Mooney has shown a particular interest in this matter and he is quite entitled to do so as he is a Deputy for the constituency.  The mystery of it is that he did not carry on the same campaign last year.  He might have been able to save the Minister from such a catastrophic defeat.  The Minister and Deputy Mooney know that in the constituency of Monaghan at the last general election the Fianna Fáil Party had a minority of the votes but through some strange happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In 1961 there was a general election and, in Cavan, the Fine Gael vote was, in round figures, 7,000.  There was a general election in 1965 and in Cavan the Fine Gael vote was 10,050.

In the same contest the Parliamentary Secretary's Party lost a seat.  That is the reason very particular care was given to the constituency of Cavan and the constituency of Monaghan by the Minister for Local Government in this <Col N="786" /> measure.  That is the very reason.  I am glad it has been possible for me to say that.  In my opinion they should have lost a seat at the last election.  There was a minority of votes for Fianna Fáil.  In Cavan they did, in fact, lose a seat.  There is the cat out of the bag.

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I want once again to refute Deputy Hogan's allegation that I am doing anything to cause confusion with regard to this Bill.  On the contrary, the large number of people that Deputy L'Estrange has been able to coerce into coming in here on the Fine Gael side have all been putting forward their own piecemeal solutions for different parts of the country without any coordination whatever.  Any confusion there may be is obviously on the Fine Gael side of the House.  I have never said that the people decided in the way that Deputy Hogan said, that they decided that county boundaries should be breached or made any positive decision.  The decision they made at the request of the Opposition Parties was that the Government may not operate any significant deviation from the national average of population per Deputy in order to avoid the breaching of county boundaries.  Deputy Hogan knows that he is wrong when he says that there was any proposal in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to operate a rural versus urban bias.  He knows that that is not so, that the proposed small deviation from the national average of population per <Col N="787" /> Deputy could only be operated to take account of clearly specified reasons and that the question of giving greater representation to rural areas as opposed to urban areas was not one of those reasons and that therefore it could not be utilised for that purpose.  Knowing that to be flase he comes in here again making this deliberate false allegation because of the fact that he is benefit of any other ideas to prolong this debate and postpone the enactment of this legislation and postpone the revision of the constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think I have made it clear what my opinion is with regard to this matter of county boundaries: that they should be adhered to in so far as is possible.  I have said that that opinion of mine has not changed, that county boundaries are important but the decision that has been given to me is that I may not deviate significantly from the national average of population per Deputy in order to adhere to county boundaries.</P>

      <P>In those circumstances I approached this task of revising the constituencies with the objective of breaching county boundaries only where it was required in order to achieve near equality of population per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said a number of times that I agree there are many solutions but I do not think any solution has been put forward that is as reasonable and as workable as the one that we have put forward in this Bill.  It is necessary now to breach county boundaries in this case because of the <Col N="788" /> fact that the population of Cavan and the population of Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are not sufficient and because of the fact that we decided that this monstrosity of a constituency, which Deputy Fitzpatrick wants for his own benefit, of Monaghan and Cavan should not be created.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick saying that the people of one county should be joined to other areas towards which they naturally gravitate.  I do not think the people of Enniskeen naturally gravitate towards Dowra.  There is no need for Deputy Fitzpatrick or anybody else to point out that I do not believe in this policy of breaching county boundaries.  There is no ulterior motive involved now that it is being done in a number of cases in this Bill.  The only reason it is being done is that the Constitution requires it to be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy L'Estrange's allegation that these areas of County Meath are being added to Cavan and Monaghan for political purposes in order to regain the seat that was lost in Cavan at the last election and in order to retain the two seats that we have held for some considerable time in Monaghan is a rather peculiar allegation because the two Opposition Deputies from County Meath have claimed that these areas are the areas where they get their major support.  Deputy Farrelly and Deputy Tully are both on record as saying that these areas of County Meath have been selected for extradition from County Meath because of the fact that these are the areas where they get their support.  I must say I think it is a great tribute to the effectiveness of Deputy Mooney and his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Power, to assume, as Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy L'Estrange do now, that these traditional supporters of Deputy Farrelly and Deputy Tully who will now be voting in the county of Monaghan will naturally vote for Deputy Mooney and Deputy Childers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> Indeed, more direct evidence of that belief amongst the Fine Gael Party than what Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy L'Estrange have said is that the result of that proposal in so far as the Fine Gael Deputy for County Monaghan is concerned is that he decided not to contest the next election at all.</P>

Maybe if Deputy L'Estrange could now give an estimate of what he would consider a reasonable total of Fine Gael Deputies in the House we might adjourn until such time as his efforts meet with this small amount of success.

      <P>I can only say that the solid and continuous support Deputy Mooney gets in his constituency is a tribute to his continous activity on behalf of his constituents and that is why, no doubt, he can still get 5,000 more votes than Deputy Fitzpatrick can get in his constituency. It is not surprising, therefore, that Deputy Fitzpatrick is making such a desperate effort to annex another county, with which he apparently has associations, in order to improve his vote.</P>

Part of our object here in analysing this Bill as closely as we are doing, with particular reference to this entry, is to encourage the Minister to talk and to talk and to talk, because we know from experience that on the eve of a national contest the more the Minister talks the better it is for us.  He talked in this House for months last year and the result was that his Party were defeated to the tune of a quarter of a million votes.  We will have another <Col N="791" /> national contest this year and I believe if we can persuade the Minister to come in here and to talk as he is doing now he will antagonise the people to such an extent that it will do us incalculable good and his Party irreparable harm.</P>

      <P>It is typical of a Party and a Minister who are fighting for their political survival.  We know that the Fianna Fáil Party and their mohair boys are fighting for their political survival.  We know, as the Minister for Agriculture told his Ard-Fheis, that many of them had not seats to their trousers a few years ago and there is no doubt they will go to any length to gerrymander constituencies to hold on to representation and to do what harm they can to Deputies who differ from them.  In one part of this constituency, 1,975 voters are being put into Clare-Galway.  In another area, 4,884 people are being put into North-East <Col N="792" /> Galway and in another area 3,474 are being put into North-East Galway.  Then, to bolster up the chances of Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Education, the great promiser, 4,024 people are to be taken from his home town in Westmeath and put into Roscommon.  The county is being mutilated to help the chances of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the county, Leitrim has been liquidated.  It was not enough for Fianna Fáil, since they came to power in 1932, to drive more than 20,000 people from lovely Leitrim. In 1932, the population of that county was 55,907.  Now, because of Fianna Fáil maladministration and bad government, the population has been reduced to 30,570, more than 20,500 of its people having gone to Liverpool, Birmingham, Coventry and other places.</P>
      <P>In respect of this constituency, we have put forward different propositions and we have shown how, without interfering unduly with the constituencies, with only a few minor changes, Roscommon and Leitrim could have been made a five-seat constituency; a small part of Leitrim in the north could have gone to Donegal; Sligo could have been left a three-seater; Mayo could have been left a five-seater and Galway could have been divided into two constituencies of three and four seats respectively.  Of course, that would not suit Fianna Fáil because when there is so much at stake&mdash;let it be learned that in the coming election there is a good deal at stake for Fianna Fáil Deputies and for the mohair boys now attached to them &mdash;Fianna Fáil have no hesitation in adopting this tactic.  They are now the Party of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;.  After the Ard-Fheis they adjourned to the Shelbourne and the Hibernian hotels.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil know that if they do not get extra seats in the west some of their Deputies will have to go back and work for their living instead of, as many of them are doing at the moment, fattening like political parasites on the State.  We object to <Col N="793" /> the type of gerrymander that is taking place here.  There is no denying that it has been done to injure Deputies Joan Burke and P.J. Reynolds.  Deputy Burke is a hard working Deputy and no matter what Fianna Fáil try to do she will get back into Leinster House. Deputy Reynolds and his father and mother before him have represented the people of Leitrim truly and well. The people there know that and no matter how Fianna Fáil work against him he will be back here after the next election proud to represent his people.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have tried to put Leitrim off the map.  The word &ldquo;Leitrim&rdquo; was not mentioned, of course, until the grass root boys and the county councillors came up and appealed to the Minister to restore Leitrim as an entity. He did not do it.  The only thing he did was to put back the word &ldquo;Leitrim&rdquo;.  Despite the worst Fianna Fáil can do, Deputy Reynolds will be back here because the Irish people love justice and fair play.  They love to see all of the people cherished equally.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have never hesitated to use the people's money to buy votes. In Roscommon and in every other county they are putting Fianna Fáil before the State.  Their idea here, as in other constituencies, is again to get the maximum number of seats in this area with the minimum number of votes and in order to do the maximum amount of harm to the Fine Gael Deputies.  The Minister told us across the floor of this House that Fianna Fáil would win the referendum by 100,000 votes.  He misled his own Party and he misled the country.  The people in Roscommon will not now believe him and his political intrigue and gerrymandering will be defeated in Roscommon as his proposal in the referendum was defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What is happening in this part of the country is quite obvious.  There is a movement of voting population by the Minister to the constituencies of East Donegal, South-West Donegal, East Galway, West Galway and probably also to the new Galway constituency.  It is easy to understand the reason for the movement from counties like Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon.  One has only to look <Col N="794" /> at the results of any general election to discover that these three counties do not give a majority vote to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The gerrymandering started in the 1961 revision.  Roscommon was left as a four-seat constituency and likewise Sligo/Leitrim.  East Galway was a five-seat constituency because Fianna Fáil knew they had a slender majority there and would get three seats out of five.  West Galway was a three-seat constituency; Fianna Fáil got two seats and Fine Gael one.  Clare was a four-seat constituency and there the Fianna Fáil Party got two seats, Fine Gael one seat and Labour one.  Now this constituency has been gerrymandered by moving portion of it into Galway and this is done in order to deprive the Labour Party of their seat in Clare.  North-East Donegal was a three-seat constituency returning two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy.  In South-West Donegal, again a three-seat constituency, there were two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people rejected the Minister's proposal for the straight vote.  I do not agree with Deputy Mooney that it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who got the people to reject that proposal; Deputy Mooney said Deputy Fitzpatrick got the people to reject it because he talked so much in this House.  I do not think that is the reason they rejected the proposal.  I believe the proposed amendments were defeated because the people were afraid of the Minister for Local Government and they were not prepared to give him that kind of power.  He comes in here now and he tells us that he does not want to interfere with county boundaries and he does not want to breach boundaries except where there is no alternative.  If that is the approach, then the situation in Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon is unique.  Why not put Roscommon and Leitrim together and make that a five-seat constituency?  The answer is quite obvious.  If that were to be the situation Fianna Fáil would get only two seats and Fine Gael would get three. Sligo is ideal for a three-seat constituency. Again, the Minister knows that, if Sligo were made a three-seat constituency, <Col N="795" /> Fine Gael would get two seats and Fianna Fáil would get one. That is the reason why Leitrim is being carved up.  During the referendum the Taoiseach, who found time to come down to Leitrim, warned the people that the county would be butchered and &ldquo;butchered&rdquo; was the word he used.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when preparing this revision, decided to take the name of the county off the political map and, as Deputy L'Estrange says, it was only when some of the grass roots of the Fianna Fáil Party came up here to Leinster House and talked to the Minister that he decided to put Leitrim back.  What he did was to call constituencies, Roscommon-Leitrim, Donegal-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim. The Minister for Local Government&mdash;a very busy man, according to himself&mdash; found time to go down to Leitrim before Christmas to a Fianna Fáil jamboree and he disclosed there that he was going to put Leitrim back on the map.  This is the way he tries to hoodwink the people of Leitrim.  Leitrim is divided into three parts.</P>
    <P>We had some talk earlier here about the Border.  Everybody was blaming everybody else for the Border.  Now we have the Minister for Local Government creating more borders than ever existed in the past.  If there were any little bit of sincerity in the Minister he would leave Sligo a three-seat constituency and Roscommon a five-seat constituency.  Roscommon has been ferociously butchered.  Portion of it has gone to the new Clare-Galway constituency, portion to another Galway constituency, and portion of Leitrim that was in Roscommon is put back into Sligo-Leitrim.  It is an odd situation, but the number of votes taken from South Leitrim, which were in Roscommon up to this revision and which are now put into Sligo-Leitrim, is the very same as the number of votes being taken out of Westmeath and put into Roscommon.  I am curious to know why this has been done.  Some people think it was done at the instigation of the Minister for Education, who wants to protect his own seat.  Other people think it was the Minister for <Col N="796" /> Education who got South Roscommon divided so that he would not find himself with Councillor Doc Callaghan selected as a candidate in the Fianna Fáil interest because the councillor, he is afraid, would take the seat from him.  If that is what Fianna Fáil are doing, protecting individual seats, then I do not think this is a fair approach.  It is not being fair to the people in these counties.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is entitled to try to protect his seat.  The Minister for Local Government will get an even more telling answer in the general election than he got in the referendum.  I do not think anybody, even the Taoiseach, knows when the election will be held.  I do not think the Minister knows what is going on in his own Party.  I believe there are a number of Ministers in the Party who are not speaking to one another.  The situation is becoming desperate but apparently they are agreeing to preserve this desperate situation by gerrymandering the constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> As two previous speakers have said, this is an example of madness on the part of the Minister for Local Government and on the part of the Party he purports to represent here.  Here we have a traditional county, Roscommon, being virtually mutilated.</P>
      <P>Roscommon, taking it as an administrative unit, as a county, is only a little short of the population necessary to form a three-seater in its own right.  I see no reason why the Minister could not have done that.  When discussing the other contiguous areas on the western seaboard from Donegal to Clare, I have already outlined to the Minister, step by step, how we could establish three four-seaters and six three-seaters for that area, instead of the ten-by-three rule which he is proposing in the Bill.  Roscommon could be a three-seater quite simply and practically within the confines of Roscommon county, but he is proposing to mutilate this area in the following fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is proposing to transfer 1,975 people to Clare-Galway and he is proposing to transfer 7,938 people to North-East Galway.  That makes a total <Col N="797" /> of 9,913.  Then, to balance that shift of population on the western side, he proposes to transfer 4,025 people from Athlone west urban in order to compensate in Roscommon for the people he is transferring into Galway&mdash;the new constituency of Clare-Galway or Clare-South Galway, as he calls it in his amendment.  That means a total transfer of 13,938 persons in respect of that county, arising from his mad desire and devotion to forming ten three-seaters.</P>
    <P>I told the Minister when discussing this previously that a transfer of 953 people, namely 290 from Taghboy and 663 people from Ahascragh&mdash;that is a total of 953 people from Galway&mdash;and added to the official county of Roscommon would give you sufficient population to form a three-seater in Roscommon on its own.  Surely that is a far more reasonable method of dealing with this question than the method employed by the Minister?</P>
    <P>He admitted here that he thinks the preservation of the local authority boundaries or constituency boundaries is important.  I agree, not for emotional reasons.  Many of our public representatives are also county councillors in their own areas.  It is a help if they happen to be members of local authorities and Dáil representatives for a particular area.  They cannot do that if part of the county is in one constituency for Dáil purposes and in another constituency for county council purposes. Surely it is very desirable from a smooth functioning point of view to have them conterminous?</P>
    <P>Against the figure of 953 which I have suggested we have the figure of 13,938 suggested by the Minister.  He cannot complain that a three-seat constituency is too big.  It is the minimum we can have under the Constitution. For the neighbouring counties, Clare, Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim I have suggested three four-seaters and six three-seaters, instead of the Minister's ten three-seaters. That is not a great departure from what he has suggested, and it could be done with a much smaller shift of population than he is proposing. For instance, the shift of Roscommon population which I suggest is <Col N="798" /> approximately one-fourteenth of what the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>For the life of me I cannot see by what system of logic any Minister could make a defence in a situation like that.  The figures are damning.  I have been after the Minister for the past couple of days.  He is like a punch-drunk boxer running around the ring.  All he is able to utter and mutter is &ldquo;referendum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Budd&rdquo;.  I have reached the stage where I hate to hit him any more.  Having pinned his ears back so often it is mutilation to go after him again.  If he gets up to speak now I am sure it will be &ldquo;Budd&rdquo; again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only seven more occasions on which Deputy Hogan and his colleagues can repeat these so-often refuted allegations.  Of course, they can do it as many times as they like on each of these.  At least we have got through quite a large part of the Electoral Bill and I suppose we can see some end to the constant repetition of this completely unsubstantiated charge that this is being done in order to gerrymander.  It has been established that what is being done in this Bill is being done only after the Government have taken every possible step open to them to avoid doing it.  We took every step we possibly could to obtain from the people permission to revise the constituencies in a rational way.  These breaches of county boundaries which the Opposition pretend to find so objectionable now, but which they saw as completely unobjectionable only a few months ago, are being made because the Constitution requires it and because, in our opinion, this is the least objectionable way in which what we consider this objectionable provision can be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan says he does not agree with it.  He produces different schemes, piecemeal schemes for each different constituency.  There is no continuity. He has a different one every time, one more objectionable than the other.  He produces figures which are not the total figures with regard to shifts of population and, then, he continues to make the point that the objective should be to make the total shift of population as small as possible, without <Col N="799" /> any consideration as to the extent or the wholeness of the communities being transferred from their own traditional county into another county.</P>
    <P>Apparently Deputy Hogan believes it is all right to put people into a position where they will feel they are disfranchised, so long as they are a comparatively small number of people only, that individuals are not important that, so long as they are a small percentage, it does not matter if they feel disfranchised or completely lost in the constituency into which they are transferred. That has been the approach of the Fine Gael Party all along.  To them it is purely a matter of figures and percentages and the individuals involved do not count.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is also another point of view.  When people have to be uprooted and put into another constituency, in order to lessen the sense of frustration and the feeling of disfranchisement that those people must have, the idea should be to transfer a reasonable number of them so that they will form a significant part of the new constituency, so that all the Deputies for the new constituency will find it advisable to pay equal attention to their views and their needs as to those of the county with which they are more naturally associated.  What is being done with regard to Roscommon is inevitable because of the fact that Roscommon is inevitably involved in adjustments with other constituencies and the need to transfer the portion of what is described as Athlone town, which lies west of the Shannon, known as West Urban, to Roscommon, the county in which it is physically located. This necessity arises because of the fact that Roscommon is involved in adjustments with Galway.</P>
    <P>I agree all those adjustments are undesirable but they are inevitable because of the rigid requirement of the Constitution which the Fine Gael Party sought to have copperfastened in regard to the constituencies.  Deputy L'Estrange says we have made a different proposition.  Of course that is the understatement of the year.  I agree we have made a different proposition. Every Deputy who spoke made at least <Col N="800" /> one proposition which differed from every other one that had already been made.  Deputy Hogan, I think, probably made as many different propositions as the rest of the Fine Gael speakers put together.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular proposition Deputy L'Estrange put forward on this occasion, I may say I have not bothered to check all those propositions up to now but because of the fact I knew what Deputy L'Estrange had to say, as he had said it so often already, I decided I would check over the particular proposition he put forward with regard to this particular constituency we are discussing.  What Deputy L'Estrange said was that what should be done here was that Roscommon county, as an entire county, should be joined with the portion of Leitrim which would remain after some of it had been transferred to the county of Donegal.  The very minimum that would have to be transferred from Leitrim to Donegal is 5,619 and that deducted from the population, which is 30,572, leaves a population of 24,953 which when added to Roscommon, 56,228, makes a total of 81,181.  This is just sufficient for four seats, not five as Deputy L'Estrange contends.</P>
    <P>This, apparently, is the type of proposition that has been emanating from some of the Fine Gael Deputies in this regard.  While I have said that in my opinion what is proposed here in many cases is objectionable, it also seems they are just put forward without any reference to the requirements of the Constitution.  As far as I understood the last time I checked some of those Fine Gael proposals, the five-seat area involving what was called Leitrim was the whole of the two counties of Roscommon and Leitrim plus part of Donegal&mdash;some of Deputy O'Donnell's constituents which Fine Gael are so anxious to deprive him of.  As I said earlier, the number of those people who could be transferred from Donegal and still leave sufficient remaining for the one five-seat constituency which Fine Gael advocate for Donegal would be anything up to 13,409, so the constituency that I understood Fine Gael would be advocating was a constituency comprising part of Donegal, the <Col N="801" /> whole of County Leitrim and the whole of County Roscommon, but there were of course variations on that theme.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions regarding part of Leitrim and Sligo but I do not consider that would be a desirable solution.  I think to have almost the whole of County Donegal as one constituency would not be a very reasonable type of constituency and I do not think a constituency stretching from Ballyshannon right down to Shannonbridge would be a reasonable type of constituency at all.  I think in the vast area from Donegal to Clare, including the whole of the Province of Connaught, which has to be represented by a maximum of 30 Deputies, the most reasonable solution for the area is to have ten three-seat constituencies.  Even at that the constituencies will be very large, extensive and, I think, difficult for Deputies to cover.  But I think it is the best we can do under the circumstances. The decision of the Government with regard to this area was to have ten three-seat constituencies and, having made that decision, those other adjustments that have to be made throughout that whole area naturally follow.</P>
    <P>The thing about the Opposition's approach to this whole matter is that when we are discussing this Bill piecemeal, as we are at present, they can base their whole approach by starting from the particular constituency that happens to be under consideration at the particular time.  That is why they can put forward so many different propositions, as Deputy L'Estrange calls them, because they are not interrelated in any way.  Unfortunately, when you have to undertake the practical proposition of drawing up a scheme for constituencies for the whole country you cannot adopt that piecemeal type of approach.  You have to look at the problem as a whole.  What has happened with regard to County Roscommon arises because of the decision to have three-seat constituencies and because of what that involves in other counties such as Donegal, Clare, Sligo and Mayo.  Therefore, all those solutions that have been put forward are, in my opinion, less reasonable than what is proposed.  I have agreed already that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan believes it is of no <Col N="802" /> importance that small sections of the community should be put into constituencies in which they will be submerged in other counties.  I do not think that is a very desirable approach and I do not think that just because a group of people is small in number their interests should be considered as of no importance.  Deputy Hogan disagrees with me so we can only agree to differ.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds put forward what I have no doubt appears to him to be a very simple solution, that is, to put Roscommon and Leitrim together and have a five-seat constituency.  First of all, assuming the figures are allowable for that, which they are not, I cannot just consider Roscommon and Leitrim alone.  I have to produce a scheme of constituencies for the whole country and, therefore, unlike Deputy Reynolds I cannot see the simple approach of just considering the area Deputy Reynolds happens to be interested in.</P>
    <P>That is why Roscommon and Leitrim just cannot be considered on their own.  If Deputy Reynolds would get a copy of the census report he will see that the population for Roscommon is 56,228 and for Leitrim 30,572. If he adds those together, he will get a total of 86,800 and if he divides that by five he will get a quotation of 17,360.  In case Deputy Reynolds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people decided that, even for the purpose of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries, you could not have that amount of deviation from the national average of population per Deputy.</P>

      <P>That is one of the many possibilities.  You could transfer Taghboy and Ahascragh from Galway to Roscommon if you only had Roscommon to deal with and if decisions made elsewhere did not preclude that type of solution.  However, as I said, the first decision that we made was that there should be three-seat constituencies because of the vast extent of the area, the comparative sparseness of population and the fact that, therefore, only 30 seats could be allocated to the province of Connacht and to the large counties of Clare and Donegal.  Having made that decision, these shifts of population were, I believe, necessary.</P>

    <P>In this amendment I am advocating that South Tipperary should be treated as a three-seater and Waterford should be treated as a four-seater and not, as suggested in the Minister's Bill, South Tipperary, with a bit of Waterford, as a four-seater and the remainder of Waterford as a three-seater.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> To put the House in the picture, let me give the population figures.  The population of Tipperary North Riding is 53,843 and of the South Riding 68,969, so that the county as a whole has a population of 122,812.  The population of Waterford county is 73,080. Therefore, <i>ab initio,</i> Waterford would appear to have a greater claim, on a population basis, to being a four-seater than Tipperary South Riding.</P>
    <P>Now, in 1961, a population transfer of district electoral divisions was made from Tipperary South Riding to Tipperary North Riding.  That transfer amounted to 2,597: it was necessary in so far as the population of North Riding would appear to have gone down. Now, in this Bill, there is a further transfer of two district electoral divisions&mdash;again from South Tipperary to Tipperary North Riding&mdash;giving a population transfer in this case of 875. That means that the total transfer now will be 3,472 according to the 1965 census.  This will give Tipperary North a population of 57,315, that is, 231 above the minimum for three seats.  It reduces Tipperary South to 65,497. However, by adding 10,749 from West Waterford, this gives, for the South Tipperary-West Waterford proposed four-seater in the Minister's Bill, a population of 76,246.  That is a small margin of 134 above the minimum for four seats.</P>
    <P>I submit that a better arrangement, in terms of population transfer, would be to make South Tipperary a three-seater and County Waterford a four-seater. Waterford needs a minimum of 3,132 population to become a four-seater. Tipperary South, with its population of 65,497, needs a transfer out of 2,413 as a minimum under the Constitution to qualify as a three-seater. While Tipperary South has sufficient population to make Waterford a four-seater, I thought it might be expedient to spread the transfer on to another county.</P>
    <P>Cork is a large county&mdash;if not the second largest then the largest in Ireland.  So far, under the Minister's Bill, it has got only a small transfer. There has been very little mutilation of Cork county, as a county.  In fact, the total transfer from Cork is only 2,025 and that is on the Kerry border.  North-East <Col N="806" /> Cork, which is the county from which, I am submitting here in my amendment, a small transfer should take place, is only 63 below the national average.  Therefore, North-East Cork is in a position to allow for a transfer, without upsetting its level and bringing it too much below the national average.  As far as rural counties go, Cork is one of the counties with a pretty large population per Deputy.</P>
    <P>I have suggested in the amendment the areas which it might be possible to transfer and I have suggested that South Tipperary should consist of the administrative area of Tipperary South Riding except (a) the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of North Tipperary&mdash;which I have already dealt with&mdash;and (b) the district electoral divisions of Carrigbeg (Urban), Tullagharton, Ballybacon, Newcastle and the townlands of Ballybeg, Ballymorris, Ballynamona, Burgesland, Flemingstown, Garrancasey, Greenmount, Knockeen, Moloughabbey, Moloughnewtown in the district electoral division of Tullaghmelan.  I have also suggested that Waterford as a four-seater, should consist of the administrative county of Waterford and in the administrative area of South Tipperary the district electoral divisions of Carrigbeg and so on as I have mentioned in amendment No. 32 and in the administrative area of County Cork the district electoral division of Konckmourne and the townlands of Kilmacow and Lackenbehy in the district electoral division of Curraglass.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Strange to say, all the Cork men have agreed with me.  This transfer of population is inconsiderable as compared with the transfer of population which would take place under the Minister's Bill.  The position is that under the present system, more than 11,000 people in 1961 were transferred from Waterford into South Tipperary and this is a difficult constituency geographically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking here <Col N="807" /> in the debate on the referendum, adverted to the ridiculous situation of throwing 11,000-odd people across the Comeragh mountains into South Tipperary. If one travels from most parts of South Tipperary into this South Tipperary-West Waterford constituency, one must go over what we call the &ldquo;V&rdquo; which is part of the Comeragh mountains above Cloheen.  It is a difficult situation geographically and I am suggesting that instead of transferring these 11,000-odd people&mdash;that figure has fallen now to about 10,750 people&mdash;it would be more reasonable to transfer about one-third of that figure from Tipperary to Waterford.</P>
    <P>The minimum required by Waterford would be 3,132 and the transfers suggested in my amendment amount to 2,413 so that 719 more will be needed from somewhere else and I have suggested that they could be got from the area between East Cork and West Waterford by bringing in the district electoral division of Knockmourne which amounts to 687 persons and the townland of Kilmacow which provides 29 persons and also the townland of Lackenbehy which provides seven persons, making a total of 723 persons, these last two townlands being in the district electoral division of Curraglass.</P>
    <P>That is the amendment I have put down and I consider it to be a more reasonable solution that the Minister's. Admittedly there are other alternatives. For instance, instead of bringing in Knockmourne and a couple of townlands from Curraglass, you could bring in Curraglass and a couple of townlands from Knockmourne. The present transfer of population from Waterford to South Tipperary is 10,749 persons.  That is a much larger figure than the one I am suggesting which is a little over 3,000. This would entail much less mutilation of county boundaries and the transfer of 10,750 persons, which is the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>On general principles, the Minister has offered the view that in transfer of population there is an argument to be made for transferring large areas <Col N="808" /> of population inasmuch as that a large area will, so to speak, be able to make its personal impact on the county to which it is transferred.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The only justifiable transfer to my mind may be one of two types.  Either you transfer a small number of people and keep the amount of distress to a minimum&mdash;all populations who are transferred like that are disaffected people&mdash;or else you amalgamate two counties.  The population has to be big enough to enable it to have a reasonable chance of providing a Deputy of any of the three major Parties.</P>
      <P>I may point out that in West Waterford there was a notice of motion before Waterford County Council on this matter.  It was unanimously agreed that West Waterford should be returned to Waterford to provide an integrated Waterford constituency in conformity with County Waterford as a four-seater.  I may mention also that the two Fianna Fáil Deputies who are members of Waterford County Council voted to have West Waterford put back into Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Allegations have been made on every part of this Schedule that gerrymandering was involved, that the layout of each of these proposed constituencies was directed against the interests of some individual Fine Gael Deputy.  Deputy Hogan has now let <Col N="809" /> the cat out of the bag when he discloses that this was aimed at the elimination of Deputy Fahey from this House.  I do not think Deputy Hogan will get rid of Deputy Fahey as easily as he thinks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposals involve the transfer of a district electoral division and part of another electoral division from the proposed constituency of North-East Cork, which has already been passed by the House.  We have an amendment to adjust that after it has already been agreed.  It also involves the transfer of 2,413 of Deputy Hogan's South Tipperary constituents from their own county into the county of Waterford. Deputy Hogan apparently considers that because these people are small in number they do not count, that because there are only 2,413 of them they are of no importance and that they may with impunity be submerged in the four-seat constituency which he proposes to create around the county of Waterford.  I agree they form a comparatively small community but, unlike Deputy Hogan, I do not think that because the number of individuals is small they should be ignored like this.</P>
      <P>The existing situation is that there is, as Deputy Hogan has said, a substantial number of people from Waterford county joined with the part of the administrative county of South Tipperary for electoral purposes, and, as Deputy Cunningham has pointed out, these people, because they form a significant element in the constituency of South Tipperary, have been able to elect a representative.  In other words, they have not suffered disfranchisement because of having been transferred to another county.  This illustrates the point I have been making, that these people have not the same sense of frustration and disfranchisement as will the 2,413 Tipperary people that Deputy Hogan proposes to transfer to County Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out also that this proposal would make the population per Deputy of the South Tipperary constituency exactly the maximum permissible. I do not know if the solution that achieves that exact result is within the spirit of the Constitution.  It certainly <Col N="810" /> does not disclose that there was any effort made to comply with the actual terms of the Constitution, to have the population per Deputy as near as practicable the same in different constituencies.</P>
    <P>One of the principles underlying the scheme of constituencies that I have proposed in the Bill is that any constituency the population of which is within the permitted range in accordance with the Constitution and which is not affected by the constitutional necessity for changes in neighbouring constituencies would not be disturbed. In accordance with this principle the constituencies in the south eastern part of the country, including Waterford, are exactly as they were constituted under the 1961 Act.  There is a slight adjustment in the case of the two Tipperary constituencies because that was unavoidable but, apart from that, the constituencies in that part of the country have remained as they were.  Deputy Hogan's proposed amendments involve the disturbance of 13,885 people from the existing constituency of South Tipperary and North-East Cork and involve the breaching of the CorkWaterford boundary in addition to the Waterford-Tipperary boundary, and all in the laudable effort of Deputy Hogan to get rid of some of his present constituents and in the process to try to get rid of Deputy Fahey.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Deputy Hogan is conceding the pending by-election in the South Tipperary constituency. Apparently he does not visualise the embarrassment of a colleague when he proceeds to contest this three-seat constituency which he proposes in the next general election.  Indeed, that is a bit of realism on the part of Deputy Hogan, because he will not have that embarrassment, as he well knows.  But, as I say, it is not surprising that he should want to get rid of this part of the constituency which he was elected to represent. He may as well admit that he has never represented this part of his constituency. Of course, it is too late now to try to make the appearance of doing so, in the same way as Deputy Fitzpatrick has tried to do, because time is running out.  I agree with Deputy Hogan that these people are likely to give their votes to the Deputies who <Col N="811" /> have actually represented them, and that must weaken Deputy Hogan's chances considerably.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Hogan that a three-seat area is easier to represent. In fact, I think this is one of the fundamental principles in the Bill.  We have endeavoured, where it was reasonable to do so, to introduce three-seat constituencies but, because the distribution of population in this part of the country did not call for any disruption in the existing constituencies, the operation of creating a three-seat constituency was not carried out in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>I can see Deputy Hogan's objection to having to cross the Comeragh Mountains to get to his constituency, although if he is an admirer of scenery it is a nice journey.  However, it is a pity that Deputy Hogan did not think of this before 16th October when I drew attention to the fact that compliance with the Constitution did involve this anomaly for Deputy Hogan if he decided to represent the constituency for which he was elected.  If he decided to represent the constituency for which he was elected making occasional journeys over the Comeragh Mountains but in May, June, July, August, September and October this journey over the Comeragh Mountains was of no importance to Deputy Hogan.  Now it suddenly assumes such gigantic proportions that he proposes disrupting the whole constituency layout in that part of the country and transferring these 13,885 people out of the constituency in which they are at present into the constituency of Waterford.</P>

For that reason we did not propose this unnecessary disturbance of the existing situation.  Deputy Hogan, for personal reasons of his own, is proposing this disruption of the situation.  I do not agree with him.  I wonder if Deputy Hogan got the sanction of Senator Garret FitzGerald on this proposal of his which is completely contrary to the proposal put forward on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  All talk on behalf of the Fine Gael Party but with different voices.  Deputy Hogan may think he has rehabilitated himself with the Carrick-on-Suir people and he is proposing this transfer to other areas.  That is a matter for the Fine Gael Party.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is the section which specifies the constituencies for which Deputies will be elected to this House in the next general election.  I wish to say briefly that in section 3 the Minister has done what he promised to do before the referendum, and he has done it very effectively; that is, he has gerrymandered the country from top to bottom.  I was rather surprised when the referendum was over to learn that the Minister for Local Government proposed to continue to act in this office notwithstanding the fact that he was completely rejected by the people to the tune of a quarter million votes. I was also amazed when I learned that the Minister, whose electoral reform proposals had been rejected in a national contest, proposed to bring back to this House further proposals for electoral reform by way of revision of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that, because the Minister stood committed to introducing absurd proposals. In the discussion in this House on the referendum, the Minister intimated time and time again that the requirements of the Constitution in reference to constituencies as they stood, and as they stand at present, were unworkable and both he and the Taoiseach made it quite plain, both verbally and in writing, that it would <Col N="816" /> be necessary, if the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill was not carried, to butcher constituencies all over the country.</P>
    <P>That was the frame of mind in which the Minister for Local Government set upon the task of revising the constituencies. He had a preconceived idea about the feasibility of the task to which he was committed.  He had convinced himself&mdash;I will give him credit for that&mdash;in the House during the long and dreary months of debate on the referendum proposals, a debate which went on week after week and month after month and which many of us thought futile.  However, it proved fruitful: the Minister's long, agonising contributions to the debate were very valuable because they convinced the people that the Minister was up to no good and they rejected his proposals.  The Minister had convinced himself before he set about drafting this Bill that his task was impossible.  He thereupon set about justifying himself by bringing into this House, not a reasonable scheme of constituencies, not the best possible scheme he could devise, but the most absurd scheme within his competence.  He has succeeded in that.</P>
    <P>Now I am satisfied that the electorate will react to these proposed revisions just as they reacted to the referendum proposals.  Not alone has the Minister introduced these absurd proposals but he has gerrymandered the whole country.  We have an example of that in the West of Ireland where some rearrangement was necessary.  In arriving at that rearrangement the Minister made sure that those counties which could be regarded as favourable to Fianna Fáil retained, or even increased, their representation.  A glaring example of that is County Galway, which not alone increases its preCensus number of Deputies of eight but is given a bonus of one in order to arrange three constituencies favourable to the Minister and his Party. That is what the Minister set out to do.</P>
    <P>Donegal is another example.  According to the Minister, before the referendum, Donegal would have to lose a seat.  But the Minister has seen to it that it will not lose a seat.  Mayo has seven seats at the moment &mdash; three Fianna Fáil and four Fine Gael, <Col N="817" /> despite the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party have two Ministers in that county.  The Minister has seen to it that its representation will be reduced from seven to six.  Clare, the pride of the Fianna Fáil Party, could never be relied on to give the Party more than two seats out of four.  Down through the years there has always been a Labour seat in Clare.  The Minister arranged matters there by reducing the number of seats to three in the hope that the Labour seat will disappear. The same can be said about Roscommon. It was a &ldquo;dicey&rdquo; one for the Minister and his Party, so he reduced it from four to three.</P>
    <P>I want to make a passing reference to Leitrim which has been dealt with already.  Leitrim has been annihilated, as foretold by the Taoiseach in Drumshanbo; it has been divided into three and distributed, quite unnecessarily, between three other counties.  In all these constituencies&mdash;let it be noted&mdash; the Minister has created three-seat constituencies.  He could argue he was honest in that if that were the pattern throughout the country.  If the Minister were to be taken seriously in his statement that he does not believe in proportional representation and that he wanted to reduce the effectiveness of proportional representation to a minimum, while one would not agree with him, one would have expected him to produce three-seat constituencies throughout the country.  He created three-seat constituencies where he hopes Fianna Fáil will get a majority of the votes, two seats out of three.  He hopes that will be the result, but I believe he will be just as far out in that vain hope as he was in his forecast of the result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were sincere about proportional representation and if he wanted to create the same pattern throughout the country then one would have expected him to create three-seat constituencies right into Leinster and the city of Dublin.  There are no three-seat constituencies in the city of Dublin.  There are four-seat constituencies all over the place.  Again the hope is that the Minister will gain a political advantage for himself and for his Party.  The Minister has created <Col N="818" /> utterly unnatural boundaries, putting a piece of Meath into Monaghan, and another piece into Cavan and putting practically the whole town of Athlone into Roscommon, to please the Minister for Education.  All this indicates that the Minister's efforts are not <i>bona fide</i>.  All this is evidence of the fact that the Minister wanted to gerrymander the constituencies for his own benefit and the benefit of his Party. This is a most reprehensible performance. If the Minister were honest in all this he would have sought independent advice.</P>
    <P>I said he should have an independent commission.  He tells me a commission is not possible without a Constitutional amendment.  I do not agree with him in that.  I say that is not so.  Even if it is so, the Minister, without any trouble, could have set up an informal committee of this House to report to him and advise him on the new constituencies.  He did not do that. He did not do it because he wanted to have the last word, because he wanted to do the job that he thought would best suit his own Party and do as much damage as possible to the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the people will realise what the Minister has set out to do.  The people can no longer be taken for granted.  That has emerged from the result of the referendum. The people can no longer be relied upon to act blindly or without considering serious proposals in a serious manner.  When the referendum was first mooted, and the intentions of the Government first disclosed I remember saying that the slogan against those proposals should be: &ldquo;They are not fair.&rdquo;  I believe that message got across to the people, that the proposals of the Minister were unfair and unjust.  I think they knew that and, knowing what he was at, they reacted violently.  It is not an exaggeration to say the people reacted violently to the Minister's referendum proposals.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the Taoiseach would have heeded the warning and said: &ldquo;Here is a man who is discredited; here is a man who has <Col N="819" /> been rejected by the people; here is a man whose proposals were not accepted by the people, and I am asking for trouble if I ask the same Minister to do a similar job.&rdquo;  As we all know, the Taoiseach had his own troubles in the weeks following the referendum. He was being challenged.  There was complete disharmony in the Fianna Fáil Party, and he preserved the <i>status quo</i>.  He took this gamble, and for that he must be blamed.</P>
    <P>I would not expect any other sort of Bill from the Minister, having listened to him here for months last year, knowing his views on PR and knowing his views on tolerance.  The Minister complains that he is forced to do what he has done here because he did not get sanction for his tolerance proposal.  He indicated during this debate that, if he had been given the Third Amendment of the Constitution by the people, he could have done a reasonable job.  The House and the country have seen the result of the Minister's handiwork operating within the reasonable guidelines provided by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>He asked the people for a blank cheque.  He asked the people to empower him to differentiate between constituencies to the extent that it would take as many as 23,000 people to qualify for a TD in one place&mdash;in Leitrim we will say&mdash;and that it would take only 16,000 people to qualify for a TD in Galway or Donegal.  The wisdom of the decision of the people can be appreciated when, as I say, we see the Minister's handiwork operating within the reasonable confines of the Constitution.  The people are entitled to ask themselves: &ldquo;What in the name of goodness would he have produced, or what would he have done, if we had given him a blank cheque?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know this Bill will go through the House because the Minister will insist on its going through.  In the constituencies as they will be when the Bill becomes law, we will take on the Minister and his Party, just as we took them on in the single constituency of the Republic of Ireland.  As I said earlier today, I am satisfied that the Minister in these proposals will have done his own Party irreparable harm and our Party considerable good.</P>

      <P>On this occasion Deputy Fitzpatrick started off by saying I had succeeded in gerrymandering very effectively.  He alternates between two propositions: one, that I have gerrymandered very effectively, and the other that the result of this Bill will be to reduce Fianna Fáil strength.  I have not got the dictionary which Deputy Fitzpatrick carries around with him but, as I understand the word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo;, it means arranging constituencies so as to get Party advantage. If I have gerrymandered effectively I must get some advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party as a result of that gerrymandering.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's contention, then, is that we will do better in the general election that will be fought in these constituencies than we did in the last general election when we got 72 seats.  I wonder what Deputy Fitzpatrick's forecast is?  By how many seats will we exceed 72 as a result of this very effective gerrymandering?  Of course, he knows there is no such thing. He knows that when constituencies have to be disrupted, the most likely thing is that every one of the Deputies involved will feel that he is losing as a result.  That is my experience.  That is what the position is.  When I have time I must go through the debates and find out how many times Deputy Fitzpatrick has contradicted himself in this matter.</P>
      <P>The remainder of his contribution was a return to his favourite theme, a personal attack upon me.  I want to assure him that I consider the fact that his main objective is to attack me personally, the highest compliment I could be paid.  I am glad to know that his objective is to get rid of me.  That is the most sincere tribute I could be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for it.  The Fianna Fáil record with regard to local government is not confined to the matter of the referendum. We will have a very good record with regard to local government to put before the people.  That is one of the main reasons why we expect to have a greater number of Deputies after the next general election than we had after <Col N="821" /> the last general election.  It has nothing to do with the constituencies.  It has to do with their adjustment and particularly with the contrast that those adjustments provide as between our performance and the miserable performance of the alternative Government. Our record in local government embraces a lot more than the referendum. It embraces the significant improvements in housing, water and sewerage schemes and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I only mentioned this in passing because the long dissertation on the referendum seemed to imply that it was on this single issue, which was of a non-political nature, that the effectiveness of Fianna Fáil in so far as local government is concerned would be decided.  However, we will go on to deal with the proposal in the referendum.  This was a single proposal. It was divided into two.  There was a proposal to change the electoral system, which was rejected by the people.  It was no more than that.  Combined with that was a proposal to allow a very small amount of scope in regard to population per Deputy in different constituencies in order to have regard to such practical considerations as the existence of county boundaries.  This proposal also was rejected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The referendum proposal was no more and no less than that.  The result of the decision on the Third Amendment of the Constitution made this Bill necessary in order to comply with the Constitution.  This is being done in order to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.  I am perfectly <Col N="822" /> satisfied, particularly after this debate, that the proposals we are making are the most reasonable proposals that are possible.  They involve the least disturbance of the population and constituency layout.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you ever hear worse than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They involve the most reasonable size constituencies.  We have obviously tried to eliminate the large five-seat constituencies.  As a result of this Bill there will be only two of that type of constituency.  Those are the areas known as Carlow-Kilkenny and Leix-Offaly, where the movement of population did not require any adjustment to be made. Those are the only two remaining five-seat constituencies.  No doubt further changes in the distribution of population will result in those two also disappearing eventually.  Of the 42 constituencies there are only 16 constituencies which are not three-seat constituencies. Of those, eight are in Dublin, where the areas involved are small.  Of the remaining six constituencies, five are four-seat constituencies at present where either no adjustment or only small adjustments were necessary and the sixth outside Dublin, is North-East Cork, which is at present a five-seat constituency.</P>
      <P>The obvious tendency disclosed by the Bill is to have as many three-seat constituencies as possible.  At least one prominent Fine Gael speaker, Deputy O'Donnell, agreed during the debate on the referendum that three-seat constituencies were the most desirable because they went furthest to enable the people to make a definite decision at election time.  It is quite true that this is so, that it is in circumstances where there is a preponderance of three-seat constituencies that the people are most likely to be able to elect a Government.  Fine Gael conclude in those circumstances that Fianna Fáil must always be returned as a Government.  That may be so.  I would not argue with that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, as Fine Gael do, it is just as unlikely in circumstances like these <Col N="823" /> that the people will ever elect a majority of Fine Gael Deputies but I think it is a rather poor reflection on a Party putting themselves forward as serious contenders to form a Government that they should believe that in those circumstances of three-seat constituencies Fianna Fáil will always get the majority.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, contrary to the tendency we have adopted and followed in this Bill, advocates more large five-seat constituencies, particularly in the west of Ireland, where I think there is an obvious reason for moving towards three-seat constituencies. As I have said earlier in this debate the average area of a three-seat constituency in the west of Ireland would be 970 square miles and the average area of a five-seat constituency, which Fine Gael favour, would be 617 square miles.  The peculiar thing is that during this debate the same Deputies who were advocating the creation of those large five-seat constituencies in the sparsely populated western areas were also complaining about the distances which would have to be travelled in some constituencies from one point to another.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the contradictory nature of the Fine Gael approach.  We had Deputy Fitzpatrick arguing that because Clare was a four-seat constituency, and because Fianna Fáil had very strong support there, Clare was reduced to a three-seat constituency and arguing again that because Roscommon was an area in which Fianna Fáil had weak support it was reduced to a three-seat constituency.  Obviously, no matter what Fianna Fáil did would be wrong when apparently it is alleged it would be good tactics on the part of Fianna Fáil to reduce a four-seat constituency in which they are strong to a three-seat area and to reduce a four-seat constituency in which they are weak to a three-seat area.</P>
    <P>I have dealt on a number of occasions already with the question of seeking independent advice.  It hardly seems necessary to do it again.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has not specified the type of advice he recommends.  When somebody suggested setting up a non-political body&mdash;I do not know if there is <Col N="824" /> such a thing as a non-political body&mdash; that person said if it was done it would be 90 per cent Fianna Fáil and that that would not be independent advice. I am assuming Deputy Fitzpatrick had in mind a body such as the commission, which was proposed in the Amendment to the Constitution, on which there would be representation from both sides of the House.  I pointed out that if that is what is in mind you could not hope to get agreed advice from such a body if there were more than one Fine Gael representative on it because Fine Gael have failed to agree on this matter here themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that of course I did not, and the Fianna Fáil Government did not, ask for a blank cheque in regard to drawing up constituencies in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  We asked for a very small amount of scope, smaller than that available in any other democracy we know of, to be utilised and this was to be written into the Constitution only for clearly specified reasons. Deputy Fitzpatrick and the Fine Gael Party know it could not be utilised in the manner he suggested.  If that proposal had been accepted there would probably be only the one possible and reasonable solution to this question of drawing up a scheme of constituencies in accordance with the present system, unlike now, when as Deputies opposite themselves have shown, the number of possible arrangements is practically infinite.  There does not seem to be any limit to it.  The longer this debate went on the more suggestions of different solutions came from the opposite benches.  There are innumerable possible solutions now.  If the proposals we suggested or advocated requiring adherence to existing established county boundaries had been carried there would possibly have been only a few rearrangements of constituencies but, of course, that would not suit Fine Gael because they would not be able to make this ridiculous and bogus song and dance they are making now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister has just stated that he set out to create as many three-seaters as possible: he thought that was desirable in the interests of manageability of <Col N="825" /> constituencies.  He also mentioned three-seater constituencies as desirable from the point of view of being able to return a Government.  I agree with him as regards manageability.  Two-seaters would be even more manageable.  If the Minister's objective was, and if he had been guided by it, to produce three-seaters with a view to bringing about a set of circumstances where the election of a government would be achieved with a measurable degree of certainty, why did the Minister not make three-seaters in Dublin?  If the three-seat constituency system is the one which will elect a Government&mdash;which we accept as a desirable thing&mdash;why did the Minister not extend the three-seater idea to Dublin?  If it was valid in the country, why was it not valid in Dublin?  The answer is quite simple. The Government have some measure of support in the country but have lost considerably in Dublin and, therefore, the three-seat and the four-seat constituencies were introduced&mdash;three-seaters in the country, in the hope that the Government would get two out of the three seats, and four-seaters here in Dublin in the hope that they might pull in and get two seats out of four.</P>
      <P>If the Government introduced three-seat constituencies here in Dublin, their fear would be that they would get only one seat out of every three seats.  That is the reason why the Minister introduced the three-seat and four-seat rule and that was the overall plan for the entire country.  Furthermore, at the last referendum the Government asked for only a small amount of scope which would not be abused&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Certainly, the country did not believe him and the people showed their disbelief in no uncertain fashion.  Considering that the Minister is now within the straitjacket of the Constitution, and <Col N="826" /> is accepting the Budd judgment as the correct interpretation of the Constitution, then, within that straitjacket, he has done an excellent job of gerrymandering. With much lesser scope, he is now abusing the electoral system to the limit, which really goes to prove that the people, when they refused to trust him on the occasion of the referendum and refused to give him, as he called it, &ldquo;a little more scope&rdquo;, were well advised to do so.  If he can do what he is doing now, within the limited scope of five per cent, what could the Minister not do if he had succeeded in getting what he called &ldquo;a little more scope&rdquo; from the electorate at the last referenda?</P>
      <P>On more than one occasion during this debate the Minister mentioned that I was just putting up piecemeal suggestions here and there as regards the entire Electoral Bill when, in fact, in so far as the Bill was taken in stages, I dealt with these stages as they came up and made any suggestions I had to make.  If there was an area in respect of which I had no ideas to offer, I said nothing.  For the entire area of the west of Ireland, I gave the Minister a completely different solution from the one he presented to the House.  He presented a picture of about 30 seats&mdash; ten three-seat constituencies.  I offered an alternative of six three-seat constituencies and three four-seat constituencies, giving the same number of Deputies from the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The general pattern I offered on the west of Ireland was quite different from what the Minister suggested.  He had the simple solution of ten three-seat constituencies.  I suggested the alternative of six three-seaters and three four-seaters and this could be accomplished and would give reasonable size constituencies with a small displacement of population relative to the numbers the Minister has offered <Col N="827" /> to us.  On my suggested arrangement, there would be population displacement in the west of Ireland for the entire area stretching from Donegal down to Clare west of the Shannon and including those two counties of approximately 9,000-odd as against the Minister's displacement of 59,000.  I submit that it takes an extraordinary stretch of imagination to understand the approach of the Minister, if he was trying to be logical and if he agrees with the importance of local authority boundaries and the importance of keeping them coterminous with Dáil constituencies in so far as it is practicable and possible under the Constitution so to do.  I have offered him an alternative method giving him reasonable size constituencies, no five-seater and a majority of three-seaters under which the transfer would be of 9,000 people as against 59,000.  I submit that that is a reasonable suggestion for the entire western area.  I have gone into the details of all these counties as the debate progressed.</P>
      <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said, it is not necessary and neither is it permissible to go into these same details again.  Regarding the other regional area comprising Louth, Meath and Kildare, these would of course involve Cavan and Monaghan and I have offered a suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only one they considered serious enough to call a division on in the full two weeks was the proposal to take 725 of my constituents and throw them into a maximum gatherum, a piece of Waterford, a piece of Tipperary and a piece of East Cork. The people who are complaining about breaching county boundaries are here proposing to breach three county boundaries. Where is the honesty or the decency in that?

We have given examples of different areas where this has happened.  I shall not go back over that, but it is another effort to try to rivet Fianna Fáil in power against the wishes of the people. They know their backs are to the wall at the present time.  They know they are fighting for their seats and indeed &ldquo;seats&rdquo; is the operative word at the present time because we have so many of the mohair boys who have so much to lose and who had not a seat to their trousers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has deliberately set out to deprive Fine Gael and Labour Deputies of seats in certain parts of the country.</P>

      <P>In other areas he has three-seaters, hoping to get two of the three.  The Minister has produced a vindictive Bill against the express wishes of the people, expressed a few months ago when there was a massive vote against the Fianna Fáil Party.  The people love freedom and justice.  They like a Government prepared to give justice to all sections of the people and to cherish all sections of the people equally.  This Government have not done it in the past and they are certainly not doing it in this section of the Bill.  An enraged electorate are only waiting for the chance to show their rage.  The Fianna Fáil Party will face a massive defeat such as they suffered on 16th October last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to be too long at all and I will come straight to the point.  Perhaps the Minister would be so kind as to give me information, if he can.  At the present time we are working, so to speak, on the register of electors that has been compiled in September and October of last year and finalised in the various constituency areas in the last week or two.  I do not know whether or not this exercise has been worth while because this register of electors will be in operation from 14th April next.  I do not know whether we are going to have a general election before 14th April.  If we have it, and if we have it before this Bill is law, we will have to operate on the old constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> I should like to know from the Minister what effect the changes now proposed in this Bill would have on the register of electors.  What effect will it have on the new register?  Will it be necessary to take a census of the people entitled to vote or will there be, as I imagine, a transfer from one to another?  The Minister nods his head so I presume that will be the case and it will not be necessary to take a new census.  What amount of time will be taken?  Will there be a big difficulty in this or has this work been done before the passage of this Bill into law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Deputy Corish's query and Deputy Martin Corry's contribution, everything else that has been said since Deputy Fitzpatrick escaped from the clutches of Deputy L'Estrange, and nailed Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Hogan to keeping this going on their own, has been out of order.  Since Deputy Corry was on my side there is no need to reply to anything he said.  Since I do not want to co-operate with the Fine Gael Deputies in ignoring the rules of order I will just deal with what Deputy Corish has asked me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that until this Bill is enacted by the two Houses of the Oireachtas the present constituencies are the only legal constituencies.  Therefore, the register will have to be compiled on the basis of these existing constituencies.  Even after this Bill is passed the existing constituencies will be the constituencies for by-elections. Possibly Deputy Corish is more immediately concerned with the constituencies in which the by-elections are imminent.  I agree that the other constituencies are relevant also but certainly in so far as the constituencies in which by-elections are imminent are concerned, it is on the basis of the present constituencies that they will be contested.  There is always the possibility of other by-elections before a general election.  Registers will have to be compiled for the existing scheme of constituencies in any case.  I would not be surprised if the people who are in charge and responsible for the compiling of registers have plans in mind for the compilation of the new <Col N="837" /> registers that will be required for the proposed scheme of constituencies, but there will certainly be no authority for them to start compiling registers for these constituencies until the Bill becomes law.  What will be done then is that the existing registers will be adjusted to take account of the new constituencies.  That will obviously take a certain amount of time. I do not know how long it will take.  All the information will be available and it should not take too long.  They will have to be printed.  I do not know how long <Col N="838" /> that will take but it would not be legal to do it until the Bill has been enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister are county registrars entitled to engage in this switch legally?  A certain amount of expense must be incurred.</P>

This Bill has to be examined as an instrument devised by the Minister for Local Government to cause the maximum electoral <Col N="842" /> disturbance that it is within his power to cause.

      <P>In the name of common sense, how do you expect an Opposition, which has now to turn its hand to the discussion of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, and which is faced with the fact of the industrial crisis in which the country is gripped at the present time, between now and Monday next to have filed in the office of Dáil Éireann the amendments we want to have considered on the Report Stage of this Bill?  I put it to the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;not to any member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;because I deem the Ceann Comhairle, once he has assumed those robes, to have severed his political ties so long as he sits in that Chair, that he has a duty, and a very special and peculiar duty, to protect the rights of minorities in this House.  And I put it to the Ceann Comhairle that no responsible incumbent of his Chair can demur to the strongest possible protest being made from this side of the House at being asked to provide the kind of amendments that it might be our duty to set down to a Bill of this magnitude, making available to us Thursday and Friday and requiring us to have these amendments filed in the office of this House on Monday.  You know, Sir, that such a requisition is to turn our proceedings into a farce.  I said before by way of interjection&mdash;I want to repeat <Col N="844" /> it&mdash;that this House is not a Fianna Fáil Bill mill and it will never be allowed to become that so long as we are here.</P>

      <P>Whatever one may think of the Minister for Local Government, cetainly in relation to this debate, this question of electoral changes, we have had a surfeit of the Minister for Local Government but, a Cheann Comhairle, the question before us is whether the Report Stage of this Bill be taken next Tuesday or next Tuesday week.  The Minister proposes next Tuesday and Deputy Fitzpatrick proposes next Tuesday week.  For as long as I have been in this House, even in relation to the most controversial of issues, there always has been a certain courtesy extended from the Government benches to the Opposition benches and that courtesy has been in accordance with the principles enshrined in our Standing Orders that there should be a fair opportunity given for consideration of amendments and debate in relation to all legislation brought in here and open for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have ever before witnessed a situation such as we have this evening that on a Wednesday evening, after a long Committee discussion <Col N="850" /> on a Bill which was clearly prolific of amendment, the Minister says: &ldquo;Next Tuesday&rdquo; and refuses to entertain the legitimate suggestion made by the Deputy from the Opposition in charge of the measure.  It certainly is lacking in courtesy.  It is indicative of the mentality behind the Bill and indicative of the mentality of the Minister for Local Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a Bill which proposes to change and alter the vast majority of the existing constituencies. That Bill, presumably, since it has been introduced by the Government, is intended to be a responsible measure.  The motives for its introduction are open to question.  They are certainly open to suspicion by those outside the Government but there are Deputies who feel they have a responsibility to the electors of this country to have this measure fully and adequately considered by this deliberative assembly.  Is it possible, after the Committee Stage, which concludes after this discussion, whether it ends tonight or not I do not know&mdash;there are fair indications it may not end then&mdash;to have a responsible political Party, and that is the Fine Gael Party, consider before next Tuesday what amendments they wish to have reported to the Dáil? I would suggest that it is utterly unreasonable to suggest that merely tomorrow and Friday, the only two working days left this week, should be allowed for the consideration of Report amendments.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that there is behind this Bill a kind of thug mentality, a mentality which suggests: &ldquo;I say next Tuesday.  I listen to no one who says otherwise and I will crack the whip and the dummies behind will start walking.&rdquo;  Look at the cherubs. When this Dáil ends so many of those will go into the outer darkness never having opened their mouths in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>In any event, what has happened is that the Minister has made a proposal that the Report Stage of this intricate and complex Bill, which has already been discussed at some length on Committee Stage, be taken on Tuesday next and the Chair accepted that proposal and was about to take a vote on it when Deputy James Dillon indicated his desire to have this question discussed in the House and the question is now being discussed in the House.  As far as I am concerned, I think the Minister will rue the day he made this proposition and insisted on it in face of the reasonable request made by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick that proper time be allowed in order to enable adequate consideration to be given to the tabling of the amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to the drafting of amendments for Report Stage.  I wish to say quite clearly to the Minister and to every Deputy sitting behind him that, as far as we are concerned, a question of this sort will not simply be a question of counting heads, no matter what majority they may have.  You will hear the arguments and you will hear the case put <Col N="859" /> up against this proposition.  It is not a question merely of using your majority in this House to steamroll a measure such as this through the House without adequate consideration in respect of the drafting of Report amendments by members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The fact that such a proposition as this has been made demonstrates the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party when they are in possession of a majority of Members in this House.  The Ceann Comhairle has reminded Deputies of the question before us, the question being that the Report Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968, be taken on Tuesday next.  With all respect to the Chair, whose ruling I, of course, accept on this matter, it is appropriate, and even necessary, for Deputies to give proper consideration to the motion proposed by the Minister and to consider, perhaps in some detail, the Bill.  The Minister wants the Bill tabled hastily for Report Stage, with a weekend intervening, without any adequate opportunity for Deputies to consider their attitude to the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill, the situation has materially changed since it was first mooted, but <Col N="862" /> I think the Minister in his concluding speech will want to tell us how it came that he thought it right to submit the Bill in its original form in view of the radical changes in respect of sections 31 and 32 which he now informs us it is his intention to move on the Committee Stage.  I want to make it clear that until we have had an opportunity of seeing these amendments it is not possible to give a fully considered judgment of the merits of that part of the Bill, and I want any observations I have to make in this regard to be heard in the light of that reservation.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has been persuaded to fall into an error that other Ministers have fallen into, that is, he has sought to consolidate and legislate at the same time.  The result of that is that he has carried into this Bill a whole series of apparent anomalies that would not have been there if he had consolidated first, eliminated all the old Statutes and came before the House and said: &ldquo;I am coming here with a consolidated Bill simply to clear out of the way a whole series of Statutes that have no longer any relevance to the conditions in which we live.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is the elimination of the distinction between &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; and &ldquo;felony&rdquo; which has involved a number of consequential amendments in the body of this Bill.  These consequential amendments to the Bill have affected powers of arrest, have affected various intrusions on the private person by the police force of the country, which at first reading, unless the Schedule of the Bill was very carefully considered, appear to be wide extensions of the existing law; but probably when one has one's mind directed to the fact that in the process of eliminating the old Statutes certain consequential provisions had to be made, some of the new departures set out in the body of the Bill may not be as alarming as at first glance they seem to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had introduced the First, Second and other Schedules to this Bill with the appropriate accompanying consolidating legislation, we would have asked him why he proposed to repeal <i>Magna Carta</i>.  Doubtless the Minister will be in a position to give us some technical reason <Col N="863" /> for doing so, but in every sovereign democracy derived from the British system in the world today, they fall back in defence of their individual liberty on the fundamental Statute, <i>Magna Carta</i>, and when the simplest creature in the land invokes his right under <i>Magna Carta</i>, most of us know what he is talking about.  He is claiming in effect that there should be interposed between him and the executive government an incorruptible and independent judiciary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I see a proviso in an obscure Schedule of the Criminal Justice Bill repealing <i>Magna Carta</i> in the Irish Republic as something that the Minister, being himself a trained lawyer, might with propriety have dwelt upon when he was introducing this Bill.  I do not think he will quarrel with any of his colleagues in this House, professional or unprofessional, if they wonder why it is thought expedient to avail of this occasion to strike <i>Magna Carta</i> off the Statute Book of Ireland.  It cannot be done for the promotion of the Irish language because <i>Magna Carta</i> is described in the unobjectionable universal language of Holy Mother Church.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that when the Minister comes to consider the position after this Second Stage debate, he might not think it well to withdraw this Criminal Justice Bill and adopt the legislative procedure which I have suggested: first, a Bill containing a repeal with the necessary amendments in order to fill up the loopholes that amendments created, accompanied by a certificate that his first Criminal Justice Bill does no more than meet the consequential amendments made necessary by the elimination of the archaic Statutes from Ireland's existing legal code; then a second Criminal Justice Bill in which the Minister would say to the House &ldquo;I have now come before the House with certain new proposals which must be regarded by the House as amendments of the law&rdquo;.  If that course had been adopted in the first instance we would never have seen sections 31 and 32, or I hope we would not have seen those sections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The first thing I want to say in regard to the substance of the other parts of the Bill relates to the proposal to abolish majority jury decisions in criminal cases.  I recognise, and no doubt the Minister recognises, this can be a hard rule from both sides.  It is very important that the House should now know the history of this since nobody seems to know its history although it is very recent history in our own country.  We had verdicts of jury trials in this country for centuries.  Then in 1928 or 1929 the Free State was passing through a period of great civil disturbance. The civic guards were being murdered and people were being attacked.  It became manifest that juries were being intimidated.  About 1928 or 1929 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of that day, largely under the influence of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins who had a passion for the re-establishment of civil law&mdash;no, it was after Mr. O'Higgins's time&mdash;he had been murdered in 1929&mdash;it was Mr. James Fitzgerald Kenny&mdash;there was the passion then to restore that rule of civil law, so there was a profound reluctance to depart from the jury system &mdash;thought up the very concept the Minister for Justice uses to justify the inclusion of the majority rule in the country.  They thought in the kind of situation then obtaining that they could procure for jurors the kind of anonymity which would protect them from attack.  This substitution of the majority decision for the unanimous system there just enabled the jury system to function even in the exceptional conditions that obtained.  But they found it did not work.</P>
    <P>There was then a proposal made that there should be substituted for juries a panel of judges.  When that proposal was mentioned the then Attorney General, Mr. J.A. Costello, was advised by members of the judiciary that they would not act.  With profound reluctance the Administration of that day re-activated the military courts which it was necessary to use for the purpose of bringing certain types of criminals to justice.</P>
    <P>Now, we know in London recently at Westminster the principle of majority verdicts of juries has been accepted in <Col N="865" /> criminal cases.  There they are dealing with entirely different and exceptional circumstances.  These are very fluid times.  People are only too ready to forget fundamental things.  Britain has been troubled with a high degree of gang warfare.  It was discovered in two or three criminal cases conducted in the Old Bailey in London involving immense sums of money, which one used to describe as grand larcenies, that part of the spoils had been used to corrupt individual jurors.</P>
    <P>The British House of Commons took the view that no matter how carefully you shelter a jury if the corruption of one juror could secure a disagreement then the danger of allowing that to happen, in view of the gigantic size of the sums involved in the larcenies that have been recently perpetrated, is also too great permanently to endure. There was also the element of intimidation of individual jurors, which was not unknown in London.  Men have had their faces slashed or their families attacked or threatened.  To meet that situation it was decided that majority verdicts would confer on all jurors that degree of anonymity which would protect all the jurors from either of the dangers to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We have no such problem here.  To our certain knowledge the jury system is working admirably in criminal cases. It may be that some persons who are guilty are going free, but it is virtually certain in the mind of every citizen of this State that anyone convicted, or indicted as it used to be, before a jury, before 12 of their fellow citizens, has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt to be guilty of the crimes that were adjudged against him and to have deserved the punishment that the law has prescribed.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves, if hereafter we are to accept the principle of a majority decision, are we not going to say in the case of a friend who finds himself in the dock, whose character we are intimately associated with, with whose ultimate fate one's own family is deeply involved, &ldquo;the rule of criminal law is that the burden is on the State to prove beyond all reasonable doubt to 12 ordinary men or women that the defendant at the Bar is guilty?  It is <Col N="866" /> perfectly manifest that the State has failed in this particular case.  But for a Statute compulsorily considered in Dáil Éireann my father, my son or my friend would be faced perhaps with a second trial but certainly would have another opportunity of vindicating his reputation and perhaps being declared guiltless of the crimes charged against him&rdquo;?  What kind of purpose is being served by denying to all of us that degree of certainty which we ought to have if the life of one dear to us is to be permanently stained with the taint of crime never mind the dilemma of any one of us who himself stands charged at the Bar of justice?  Do we want to abandon the principle that the obligation on the State is to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the man or woman charged is guilty of the offence alleged against him?  I do not.  I want that responsibility to rest squarely on the State and I want to burden the defendant with no greater obligation than that he should assert his innocence and challenge his accuser, the State, to prove to the contrary but, remember, if you are going to adopt the principle of the majority verdict you abandon absolutely the principle that there is that obligation on the State.  I think the majority verdict is ten-two.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten-two in a criminal case.  Of course the Deputy is aware that there has been a majority verdict in civil cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I read with great care and diligence the Minister's argument that, after all, in a heavy civil case a person's personal fortune and circumstances might be most radically affected and yet that is committed to a verdict of the majority rather than a unanimous verdict.  But there is no comparison between a man losing a great fortune of money that he contended belonged to him and is in fact found to belong to another and the man whose reputation is at stake.  Who steals my purse steals trash, who steals my name steals all.  It is idle folly, and I cannot understand how the Minister for Justice, himself a practising lawyer all his life, can seriously ask <Col N="867" /> the House to identify criminal proceedings with civil proceedings.  Is there an experienced barrister or solicitor in this House who has not gone into the heaviest civil suit with a light heart and done his best but who if his client failed went home to tea without a care on his mind and who has not had the appalling experience of carrying the burden of a criminal trial, worrying and aching in his heart, asking himself if he left anything undone or if he uttered an indiscreet word to the jury in the course of the proceedings which may have meant that the man who sought his discharge from the court of criminal law is in fact in Mountjoy waiting delivery to Portlaoise?</P>
      <P>I beg the Minister for Justice to reflect for a month, to look around at any one of us sitting in this House and ask himself the question: Is there any true comparison between a civil suit in which we may be involved no matter what the cost, and our reputation?  I most earnestly impress on the Minister for Justice that he should reconsider his decision and I think on reflection he will see that the energetic argument that he advanced on the introduction of this Bill based on the parallel between criminal proceedings and major civil suits had little or no relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation in relation to flick knives.  However, I would like to remind the Minister that on, I think, four but certainly three separate occasions I have heard Deputy Liam Cosgrave ask from his place in the Front Bench if and when legislation was being introduced to control the use of flick knives.  I have heard Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Education, who was then Minister for Justice, I have heard Deputy Haughey, who is now Minister for Finance and was then Minister for Justice, tell him on three or four separate occasions that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána strongly advised that no such panic measure was necessary.  I do not know how many faces have been slashed: I do not know how many youngsters have been permanently disfigured and <Col N="868" /> I do not know how many people are dead because successive Ministers for Justice of this Government did not think it necessary to listen to what they now concede was a very sensible suggestion.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse what the Minister said about the broad definition which he felt constrained to use in the Bill of &ldquo;dangerous weapon&rdquo; because it contains the proviso that the judge before whom the offence is tried shall have full discretion to determine whether a screwdriver or a pair of scissors or some other sharp instrument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a dangerous instrument in the surroundings in which it was located.  He is perfectly right in providing that.  Having defined a flick knife, he has left it open for the district justice to say a person who brings to a dance hall a sharpened screwdriver and used it or tried to: &ldquo;That is a dangerous instrument even though you allege from the dock that you brought it there for no other purpose but to protect the neighbours against a draught.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reference to sections 28, 29, 31 and 32 must be heard in the light of the reservations I mentioned at first. They deal mainly with riots and in seeking to deal with riots they have manifestly gone too far as set out in this Bill as introduced by the Minister who has himself conceded that, and announced his intention of introducing formidable amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to pause here and to consider fully the nature of the problem with which we are seeking to deal in this part of the Bill.  We hear a lot about student riots and student disturbances.  The first thing I want to do is to ask the House to get this business in proportion.  It is true that adolescent people, many of them attending university, are to be found demonstrating, which is the popular word to use now, in the streets.  However, we ought not to forget that at the same time there are hundreds of university students who tonight and every other night go out among the houses of the poor.  They go into old people's <Col N="869" /> rooms in this city papering, painting and decorating their rooms so that they may be neat and tidy to receive the visitors who call on them with meals on wheels, which not infrequently are delivered with the assistance of the students.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that there are a great many splendidly disposed young people whose concern is to relieve suffering among the aged and poor and who are prepared to do this in their own time, with their own hands with no consideration present in their mind other than that of charity, which I consider to be a much more noble word than love.</P>
    <P>For this reason I do not approve of people shaking boxes for Oxfam or Biafra or for relieving the hungry and poor in this or that place.  Such contributions are purely a waste of time. This House stands ready, in the name of our people, to provide far more than ever could be collected in boxes, whether it be food and relief for people affected by the war in Biafra or whereever else human suffering exists.  The problem at present is not to buy and to send the food; the problem is to get it there.  I often see high-minded, idealistic, good young people overlapping in their activities to collect for half a dozen different funds which I have no reason to believe are prudently administered or which ensure that effective relief is being given to the objective in the name of which such collections are made.  I compare this with the student who gets one, two or three friends to go out and paper and paint the walls of an old person's room, wash the floor and set up his or her comforts.</P>
    <P>But then we come to the idealistic students&mdash;a great many of them are idealistic&mdash;who feel that this House is not doing its job.  I do not blame them.  There is no use in our legislating for the due control of what we regard as disorderly demonstrations if we do not ask ourselves the question: what causes the demonstrations?  This House, in my lifetime, used to be the vent for public indignation.  If there was something going seriously wrong, it was debated here, often tumultuously.  We used to shock some of our friends in <Col N="870" /> the Press Gallery by the violence of our language and the disorderly nature of our conduct, but we were moved to that violence by our knowledge of the indignation that existed in our constituencies among our neighbours because of what they thought of as current evils.  In the last seven days, the factories of this country providing employment for thousands of our people have been closing down slowly. In the last fortnight, secondary schools in Ireland have closed down.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that Part VI of the Bill consists of seven sections.  The first concerns unlawful meetings, processions and demonstrations; the second relates to power to prohibit meetings, processions and demonstrations believed to be unlawful; the third deals with meetings and processions requiring notice; the next deals with power to enforce conditions with respect to or to prohibit meetings and processions; the next deals with watching and besetting; the other deals with acting at a meeting or procession in a disorderly manner and the seventh concerns penalties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak of the feelings of the people, the feelings that bring them out in the streets in meetings, processions and demonstrations. I wish to ventilate their right to do so and I wish to tell the House how I think these meetings, processions and demonstrations become unlawful and how best we may provide against that contingency.  I say that when Parliament begins to fail in its function to provide the people with the assurance that they will get in the Legislature the leadership necessary to meet the current events of the day, it is then and only then that they take to the streets.</P>
      <P>I ask myself, if I were looking on from outside and saw this country paralysed educationally and industrially, and turned to my newspaper day after day to read that the whole 144 Members of this House are wrangling about scraps of constituencies, about who will have this handful of votes and who will have that handful I would imagine that nothing was happening outside at all.  Would you, Sir, be shocked if you took to the streets?  It is not such a desreputable thing in certain circumstances to take to the streets.</P>
      <P>My father, God be good to him, was conducted by a troop of British dragoons from Drogheda to Dundalk jail and he was glad of the people who took to the streets and cheered him on his way and gathered around the prison and sang to reassure him that they would remain faithful to the principles for which he stood.  Was there anything wrong in that?  The British thought it was wrong.  I do not think our people did.</P>
      <P>What I wish to emphasise is this. First, let us find out why this manifestation is showing itself in Ireland again.  Let us search our consciences. It is manifesting itself because the people no longer believe that the nation's business is being effectively done here and I want to say, sir, with a full sense of responsibility, that I agree with them.  I heard the Taoiseach state in this House no later than yesterday that, having asked Dáil Éireann not to discuss strikes or trade disputes, he himself, the Taoiseach, had sent the Minister for Labour down into West Clare there to state Government policy.</P>

      <P>Suppose the people outside come to the conclusion that this House is completely indifferent to the housing conditions in this city, do you blame them for taking to the streets? I said, when I was sitting in that Front Bench as Leader of the Opposition in this House, that if I were living in a single room, with my wife and three children&mdash;cooking, eating and sleeping in the one room in a tenement house in this city&mdash;and if I went down to the City Hall and they told me there they would not even put my name on the list and, as I walked back along Dame Street, I saw a new skyscraper going up, three floors of which had been taken by the Government for offices, I would have a rock through the window.  Now I may have said that in hot temper, but I am not so sure that, if I thought of these conditions now, I would not repeat it.  If the people know that there is actively functioning here a Legislature which seeks to remedy their grievances, which knows of their grievances and makes those grievances their constant concern, then no one will be able to bring the people <Col N="873" /> out into the streets to demonstrate. Mark you, when you find them in the streets demonstrating, the first people to search their consciences ought to be the Deputies of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I do, but I think this House would be a damn sight better employed examining its own conscience before bringing in a Bill of this kind, which proceeds to repeal <i>Magna Carta</i> and goes on to provide that, when Parliament ceases to function, as it ought to function, no other recourse is available to our people.  Mark you, this Bill is a pretty wide Bill and, if you want to relate what I am saying and you are not satisfied to relate it to sections 31 and 32, have a look at the Schedule.  Perhaps your attention has not been drawn to that.  I want to be fair to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle but, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle wants me to keep to the Bill here, there are not many crimes in the calendar that I cannot bring within the ambit of this debate because this Schedule refers to Acts passed in the reign of Henry III, Edward I and right down to legislation enacted in the days of Queen Victoria. But I do not want to widen the debate. I want to speak on processions and demonstrations.  Mark you, if the Minister for Justice were not so sensitive, he might discover that what I have to say on this Bill is more conciliatory to his position than much of what he has been obliged to listen to.  I think the <Col N="874" /> great problem that confronts a democratic Government in seeking to steer an even course, giving all due respect to individual liberty and, at the same time, to the maintenance of public order, is the presence of elements in our society, as in every society in the world today, who are concerned to make that course of moderation impossible.</P>
      <P>I have said on a previous occasion here that what Deputies of Dáil Éireann ought to wake up to is that we are in the middle of the Third World War and that war is not being fought with armies and navies and ultimata.  It is being fought in the streets and on the campuses of every democratic country in the world.  The position is this&mdash;it is important the House should know it and, perhaps, if Deputies are not here to listen, they will subsequently read&mdash;that, if you allow an evil to develop and fail to make it manifest that we here in Dáil Éireann are diligent to curb it the next step is that perfectly well-intentioned, honest good people answer a call to march in a procession or to participate in a demonstration. Then there appear the agents of the forces of disruption who are, in fact, the soldiers of the Third World War.  Fortunately they are branded with a clear and certain trade mark, which every adolescent and every citizen of goodwill can readily discern; one is the bullhorn and the other is the summons to protest against police brutality.  I have myself heard that cry and seen that instrument employed in Berkeley, California, in Chicago, Illinois, in New York, in Washington, in Paris, in Bonn, in London and in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now if I, as one simple citizen, have seen that with my own eyes in eight cities of the world, stretching from the Pacific Coast of America across the Continent of Europe and right up to the Iron Curtain, and back again to London, surely it is idle to imagine that there is not a system operating to back it up.  Unless we are fools or children we must legislate in the knowledge that that loathsome beast is abroad in the world, because that is the spirit of anarchy.  Young Deputy O'Malley <Col N="875" /> is here.  It will not be difficult for him to remember this.  When we were young, all of us in our hearts were anarchists.  It was our heads that taught us better.  Every decent man, when he is young, believes however fleetingly in the Pelagian heresy of humanism and the perfectability of human nature.  It is only experience that teaches that human nature is corrupt and, but for the grace of God, would sink to the level to which Hitler, Stalin and Mao would drag it, given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>So young people find it hard to learn, except in the hard school of experience, that the anarchism for which their hearts yearn is never static. Anarchy never stands still.  Anarchy is merely a bivouac from democracy to authoritarian Government from the right or from the left.  It does not matter which source it comes from.  It is the same dirty murderous tyranny which it is so easy to permit but so nearly impossible to be rid of.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you rebuked me for seeming too widely to spread the debate.  You paid me the compliment of forgetting how old I am.  I saw the Wiemar Republic in Germany.  I saw the German Reichstag function which was democratically elected.  I saw a German Reichstag function within a Constitution presided over by as venerable a President as we now have.  I saw that very Reichstag, by its indolence and reluctance to face its duty and grasp and crush the nettle that threatened its survival, degenerate into the Nazism which burned 5,000,000 Jews, and boasted of it.</P>
    <P>Remember, Sir, that happened in the homeland of Goethe and Beethoven. All the greatest artists in the world have had their peak in Germany. I have lived to see that horror overthrown by a horror just as loathsome, which eliminated the Czar it overthrew by slaughtering him, his wife, four little girls and one haemophiliac boy, on the orders of a vicepresident who himself lived to see the day when his skull was penetrated by an ice pick in Mexico, wielded by the paid hireling of the man who had succeeded him in the bloody dictatorship he created.  In that country, the <Col N="876" /> country of Tolstoy and of Dostoevsky, and of the music and the poetry of Russia, I have lived to hear its leader boast that he had murdered 2,000,000 of his own countrymen, and add that it was painful but it was necessary.</P>
    <P>Do not let us make any mistake about it; they may bury Stalin and they may put a round clown's hat on Khrushchev who succeeds him, so that we would all think he looked like Good Pope John.  He is followed by Kosygin and Brezhnev, and there are many innocent people travelling the world today who admire their methods and purposes.  I want to say, Sir, that the people who stand behind the crowds in Dublin and exhort them to attack the police are the conscious or unconscious instruments of the same system that murdered in cold blood 2,000,000 of its own people for what they said was economic necessity.</P>
    <P>Now, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this may sound incredible to you, and I do not deny that I sometimes feel like Cassandra coming down from the heights to the windy plains of Troy to warn the Trojans that a wooden horse drawn in amongst them would contain those who would destroy them. Mind you, Priam felt as you feel: &ldquo;What is this old woman talking about?  How can she expect us to listen to her and we preoccupied with the defence of the walls of Troy.  Get the horse in and shut the gates.  Send this old woman back to where she came from.&rdquo;  That is what they did. They brought in the horse and they barred and bolted the gates, and they chased Cassandra back into the hills and, in the morning, Priam was dead and Troy was taken, and all the struggle and all the bloodshed that had been spent to defend it against the Greeks was lost in one hour's folly when they preferred the Trojan horse to the Trojan prophetess.</P>
    <P>It is an unrewarding task to discharge the role of Cassandra.  I am trying to tell this House things they find it hard to understand.  I am asking this House to insist that the Minister will mend his hand in respect of this provision for controlling riots and disturbance in the streets, and to remember that, while we should be <Col N="877" /> resolved to vindicate individual liberty and freedom, we should remember the bullhorn and the meetings summoned to protest &ldquo;police brutality&rdquo;.  I do not think people in this House understand fully the strategy and tactics represented by the bullhorn and &ldquo;police brutality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy O'Malley is a symbol of my error, but I am afraid he is the exception rather than the rule&mdash;but one of the tragedies of my time is to see the rising generation growing tired of the burden of freedom.  We were brought up to strive to preserve it.  It came to our hands hot from those of our fathers and grandfathers who fought strenuously to secure it.  We were reared to treasure that as a prize superior to all things.  It was better to be poor, it was better to be hungry and free than to accept any degree of affluence burdened by servitude and strength.  I have got the feeling as I watch young people waiting for the bullhorn to direct them, waiting for the bullhorn to tell them what to say, waiting for the bullhorn to tell them to turn right or to turn left or what song to chant, that these young people have no one to direct them.  In so far as we have failed to channel their youth, enthusiasm and energy into the channels of our several political Parties we are delivering them into the hands of the gentlemen with the bullhorn.</P>
    <P>Wait a moment, if your patience will so far extend.  I am asking the House to examine with care the provisions the Minister has undertaken to amend because after the bullhorn is operative then comes the most insidious event.  I have watched it.  The bullhorn operates from behind.  It is the decent element in the crowd, full of no other purpose than to come out in lawful demonstration, who are pushed from behind against the civic guard, the policeman who is on guard or the representative of the civil power&mdash;mark the words, the representative of the civil power&mdash; whatever uniform he wears, until eventually those charged with the responsibility of protecting the fundamental rights, not of the individual but of society itself, is constrained by the pressure exercised from away behind to warn all those in the front rank to stand where they are because he must move to disperse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Remember Mr. McAteer, the Nationalist member for Derry, recently found himself in the Square in Derry being struck with a truncheon and he was in the front rank.  I do not believe he ever went out into the streets of Derry to go against the civil power.  He is a member of the Northern Ireland Parliament. I have seen outside this House in Molesworth Street a crowd of young people and I have seen the bullhorn gentlemen urge them to rush the gates of Leinster House.  I saw a Member of this House move out among them and counsel prudence and restraint and warn them of the people who were among them.  I remember one philosopher saying: &ldquo;It is half-past five and the landladies will get after them if they do not go home&rdquo;.  In the interval between a quarter-past five and a quarter to six, but for the activities of certain prudent Members of this House, there might have been rioting and mayhem outside those gates and it would have been instigated by individuals in this city at present with express instructions from carefully organised headquarters to search out causes of public malaise that may be successfully exploited for the purpose of bringing the ordinary people into conflict with the Garda Síochána, so that the organisers of riots may then hold a meeting protesting against police brutality, so that the confidence of the public at large in the Garda Síochána may be undermined in the confident hope that, once civil power is stripped of the only instrument it has to vindicate the laws enacted by this House, the next step is anarchy and out of that they will make certain that the leadership will be one they control.</P>
    <P>Does that all sound remote to the Members of this House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?  To me it is as present as the gates of Leinster House.  It is the threat to every democracy in the world at the present time.  Now, I admit freely that the poisonous, rotten element in the whole Communist assault on freedom is that in the very effort to repel it we ourselves have recourse to procedures which in some sense undermine the very freedom we seek to defend. That is the task the Minister for <Col N="879" /> Justice seeks to perform.  I believe much of his difficulties have arisen from the procedural problem of his approach to this whole matter.  I believe if he had taken the Consolidation Bill first and then looked at the law as it then stood he would have realised in the proposals he has made in the part of the Bill to which I now refer he was asking the House to vest in the police authorities discretions which do not properly belong to them at all.</P>
    <P>I want to protect the Garda Síochána of this country from the kind of misrepresentation which the enemies of individual freedom are deeply concerned to make against them.  The general principle is sought to be drawn that the Garda Síochána are yearning for power to circumscribe the individual freedom, liberty and integrity of every person in the State.  That is a fantastic element.  We who have lived in the country, having the gardaí as our next door neighbours, do not believe in the sergeant at his desk in some dark corner in the barracks having power to come down and circumscribe our daily lives, when we know his prime consideration is that the tinkers are down the street.  The one thing he wants is to be left in peace in the barracks if his duty will allow it.  To imagine that he is yearning to come down knocking at my door or anybody else's door is utterly fantastic.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have maintained that situation is something we should be very proud of.  The fact that we are in a position to say to people at a public meeting: &ldquo;Look at the Garda Síochána uniform and recognise in it the symbol of Irish sovereignty&rdquo; is something we should be very proud of. We should not allow a situation to arise in which we ever tempt the forces of the State, especially the Garda Síochána who are in intimate contact with the people, to be lured into the illusion that they are anything other than the servants of the people whose uniform they wear.  But, in so far as they have demonstrated so successfully down through the past 50 years that they are the servants of the people, they have <Col N="880" /> made themselves an inestimable treasure in the preservation of individual liberty and democratic institutions in this State.  I want to renew my suggestion to the Minister in view of the fact that it has now transpired that certainly in regard to the proposals in this Bill there is general agreement that he is doing the right thing in regard to flick knives and offensive weapons, that he should take back this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and give us a Consolidation Bill first, providing the Schedules with the consequential amendments made necessary thereby. The Schedule which abolishes the difference between &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; involves other amendments in the Statutes between the sections.  If the Minister came back to us with such a Bill and said: &ldquo;This Bill contains the repeal and amendments of other Statutes requisite to leave the law substantially as it is&rdquo;, I think that Bill would pass almost in a day once adequate assurance was provided. That is the kind of Bill this House will gladly pass in a day.  That is the kind of Bill this House ought to pass in a day.  That is the kind of Bill on which, in passing it in one day, this House should show its capacity to legislate First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages because it is merely clearing the way for legislation of substance, to which this House must pass with care and circumspection calling for due intervals between each Stage. That procedure we will adopt cooperatively in respect of the Criminal Justice Bill No. 2 which would amend the law.  I think the Minister would find that he would be received on all sides of this House with understanding &mdash;perhaps not with entire agreement but with reasoned argument and fair discussion.  I would not despair of his saying: &ldquo;I have thought again about majority verdicts in criminal trials&rdquo; just as the Minister thought again about Part VI of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that if the Criminal Justice Bill passed this House ultimately, with virtual unanimous agreement or certainly with goodwill <Col N="881" /> attending such differences as we were unable to reconcile, it would be a better Criminal Justice Bill, than this one promises to be, which the Minister is obliged to concede is already two years old, for its title is Criminal Justice Bill, 1967.  Having sat upon this egg, hatched it for two years, the Minister is obliged, on rising from his hatching, to concede before the nation that the bird had come forth in a most unexpected form and that he proposed to perform a major surgical operation on it before he allows it to strut forth upon the dunghill of the legislation.  I think the House and the country would be favourably impressed if, as a result of our discussion here, the Minister for Justice would say: &ldquo;It seems to me to be a reasonable representation. I am happy to have the help of rational Deputies who seek to help me in the necessary amendments of the law.  The dual procedure proposed will undoubtedly facilitate all of us in that task.  I am prepared to act accordingly&rdquo;. I am convinced that, if he does that, he will find his way much less controversial than it has proved to be so far. Mark you, if he adopts the course I propose, he will be relieved of the obligation of explaining to Dáil Éireann how it is that, for two years, he was energetic in his defence of Part VI of this Bill and that it is only within the past two months that he suddenly awakened to defects so grievous that, in his opening address in presenting the Bill to the House, he announced his intention of removing them.</P>
    <P>May I say in conclusion, however, that if he is prepared to mend his hand now, I am prepared philosophically to reassure him that it could happen to a bishop.  What matters is that what is wrong is now being put right and we all lend a ready hand in the accomplishment of that relatively simple task.</P>

Two minutes tonight is not very long in which to do it.  I always enjoy Deputy Dillon, even though I do not agree with all of what he says.
