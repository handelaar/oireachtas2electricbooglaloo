      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why in the Dáil on Wednesday, 16th July, in a comment on a question about suggestions by the Italian and Finnish Governments that a European security conference should be summoned, he stated that there was no Italian initiative in view of the fact that, as reported on 11th April, 1969, Signor Nenni, the Italian Foreign Minister, has proposed that the NATO alliance meet as soon as possible with members of the Warsaw Pact and that European nations that do not belong to either alliance should also be invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no Italian initiative or approach to us in the sense of the initiatives and the approaches that we received from four other countries, Rumania, Hungary, the USSR been endorsed by this House.  It will ally through official channels.  We were, of course, aware of the views expressed on a number of occasions by the Italian Foreign Minister on the subject before his resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that my question did not refer to approaches to us but to initiatives by Italy and the Italian Foreign Minister?  The word &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; is defined variously in dictionaries as &ldquo;a first step, an origination, an introductory step or movement, an act which originates or begins&rdquo;.  These Italian proposals put formally at the NATO conference in April represent initiatives in any ordinary sense of the word.  How, in those circumstances, can the Taoiseach suggest there was no Italian initiative when these initiatives <Col N="1156" /> were featured in the headlines in the newspapers three months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the dictionary definition of &ldquo;initiative&rdquo;.  All I want is to indicate to the Deputy, as I indicated last week, that we had no formal approach from the Italian Government about this conference&mdash;and that is the fact. Signor Nenni expressed his personal views on more than one occasion, not only in the Italian Parliament but on the occasion of a visit to Yugoslavia. So far as we know, no formal approach was made by the Italian Government to any other Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that the question I put down was whether we would respond to these invitations by approaching the Italian Government to indicate our willingness to participate in such a conference to which the amendment proposed European nations which do not belong to either alliance would be invited?  Will the Taoiseach now consider such a response in view of the fact that the proposal has come from Italy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our views have already been made known in response to the formal initiative and approaches which have already been made to us. The Minister for External Affairs last week told the Deputy and the House what that response was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether (a) membership of or (b) association with EEC involves membership or any other commitment to NATO or any other military alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome in itself does not require members of the European Economic Community or associates to join any military alliance.  We recognise, however, that those who wish to become members must accept the political implications of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that Mr. de Valera, when Taoiseach, made it quite clear that there could be no question of any military <Col N="1157" /> alliance whatever while the nation is divided; that his predecessor, Mr. Costello, reiterated this decision that there could be no military alliance while the country is divided and, as he says, that Mr. Lemass made it quite clear that there was no military commitment whatever involved in joining EEC or in acceding to the Treaty of Rome?  Could the Taoiseach now say whether there has been or is intended to be any fundamental change in this attitude to neutrality which was observed by the three previous Taoisigh of three previous Governments here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; is relevant in the context of our membership of EEC. Neutrality would not be relevant in the context of our being attacked by anybody: we would defend ourselves. We applied for membership of these communities because we believed in their aims and objects and because we believed it would be in our best interests to do so.  Being members of that community, we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the communities. There is no question of neutrality there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's statement that we must accept the political implications of the Rome Treaty, would the Taoiseach agree that these political implications do, in fact, include defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The political implications have not yet been developed. As the Deputy is aware, there was no reference at all to the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the Rome Treaty.  So far as there was, it was contained in the preamble which was as follows: &ldquo;... that the countries forming the Community were determined to establish the foundation of an early closer union amongst the European peoples&rdquo;.  When we made our application for membership to the community we made it quite clear that we would accept the political obligations of the member countries as these obligations developed.  Immediately after our application was made and our situation was made clear, there was a general election&mdash;that was in 1961&mdash; which was followed by two general elections.  In the last general election I <Col N="1158" /> indicated, on the day of the dissolution of the Dáil, that an incoming Government would have to look to the early opening of negotiations.  Therefore, I think we can accept as reasonably clear that the people have endorsed our application for membership of the communities and have endorsed whatever obligations we will have to undertake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this afternoon that the political obligations of EEC membership have not as yet been defined, how then can he possibly assure the Dáil that he has already committed the country to accept the political obligations of EEC membership?  In view of the fact that there have been so many questions raised in Dáil Éireann could he please inform the House in clear and unambiguous terms, possibly in a white paper or a further Government statement, of the precise intentions of the Government in relation to the military commitments arising from EEC membership or from any association with NATO, especially when so many replies have been so utterly ambiguous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach's three predecessors, mentioned by me, did not envisage any military commitments at all arising out of the political commitments and does <Col N="1159" /> the Taoiseach think that this position has changed in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The military commitments in the context of NATO, I think, were perhaps not fully or properly stated in the inter-Party Government time.  We have undertaken membership of organisations&mdash;the United Nations, for example&mdash;with certain charters much akin to the charter of NATO.  My predecessor and his predecessor, Mr. John A. Costello, said that we were not members of NATO, that we did not intend to become members of NATO, nor indeed were we invited, but that we shared the views of the countries which took part in the NATO agreement.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Desmond's supplementary is concerned we have committed ourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not military commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not military commitment, no.  We have committed ourselves to reopening negotiations for our entry to the EEC as early as these negotiations can be reopened and as soon as the existing member countries agree to do so.  The terms of our accession to the community will then be brought before this House for debate and for confirmation.  Thereafter, in so far as the political developments take place, we will be party to these developments and we will have a say in them as they emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that up to date, other than our peace keeping commitments under UN auspices, we have entered into no military alliances or arrangements of any sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true and, in fact, our non-membership of NATO contributes to our acceptability in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it still our policy not to apply or seek membership of NATO according to the policy of one of the Taoiseach's predecessors, Mr. de Valera?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  We have not applied for membership of NATO nor <Col N="1160" /> is it necessary for us to become a member if we become a member of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that there seems to be considerable difference of opinion as to what exactly is meant by the terms under which the Minister for External Affairs now says we are prepared to accept every commitment which we have to accept and the Taoiseach is prepared to back this up, would the Taoiseach consider having a full debate in this House so that all these matters could be ironed out satisfactorily before we go any further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we had a very full debate.  As I indicated, as soon as our terms of entry have been negotiated, then it will be a matter for this House to approve them.</P>

      <P>Question No. 3.  That is not a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point of order. In view of the fact that, as recently as two days ago, the Minister for External Affairs said that we were committed to joining the EEC under the terms which they are offering and the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil say that we have already debated it sufficiently, does the Taoiseach not consider that the matter should be clarified once and for all in the House now that we have plenty of time to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as a Government, committed ourselves to application for membership and to the <Col N="1161" /> opening of negotiations as soon as this can be done.  That commitment has been endorsed by this House.  It will depend on the terms that will emerge from the negotiations whether this House will approve our ultimate entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reasons for the serious growth in the adverse trade balance this year; if he contemplates taking any action in the matter; and, if so, what action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the import excess in the first six months of 1969 is mainly the result of a substantial rise in imports.  Exports continued to expand and would have been larger but for the effects of the maintenance craftsmen's dispute earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>A preliminary analysis of the trade returns for the first half of 1969 suggests that the rise in imports is attributable largely to increased investment rather than consumer spending.  Of the total increase of £54 million in the period, purchases abroad of machinery and equipment and other capital goods accounted for about two-fifths or £22 million.  Another factor which has added to the import bill is the continued upward trend in import prices, reflecting the delayed effects of devaluation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the remainder of the Deputy's question I would refer him to the statement of the Minister for Finance on the 17th July in reply to a question by Deputy Corish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the expected increase in exports and in invisible receipts in the second half of the year, the deficit in the overall balance of payments on current account for the year 1969 as a whole is unlikely to diverge significantly from the original estimate of £55 million.  Furthermore, the capital inflow continues to be buoyant and has cushioned the effect of the increased import excess on external reserves.  It <Col N="1162" /> is necessary, however, to issue a warning that the expected deficit is not sustainable for long and that the need for restraint and moderation is paramount. This applies particularly to increases in income.</P>
    <P>The Government are keeping the situation under constant review and further remedial measures will be taken if they are needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach talks about the delayed effects of devaluation. I am not in disagreement with the Taoiseach but the Central Bank said in its annual report that the effects of devaluation were over by the spring of 1968.</P>

      <P>Deputies have been informed of this concession in reply to a number of parliamentary questions during the past year.

The great majority of authorities, including Dublin, do so even where a reduced non-contributory pension is paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about the replacement in modern accommodation of the services provided by St. Laurence's Hospital has been altered by the recommendations made by the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services.  The report of the council (the FitzGerald Report), which was accepted in principle by my predecessor, advocated the development of a regional hospital on the site of the Mater Hospital which would include the specialist units now operated separately in the Mater, St. Laurence's and Jervis Street Hospitals. General medical and surgical services would also be provided in this much enlarged Mater Hospital complex.  It was recommended in addition that the James Connolly Memorial Hospital at Blanchardstown should be developed as a general hospital staffed also by consultants from the three hospitals I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>These far-reaching recommendations have been the subject of detailed study by representatives of the three voluntary hospitals concerned and the Dublin Health Authority.  These studies are now at a point where I would hope that firm decisions would be taken within a short time.  It will then be possible to proceed with the implementation of suitable proposals.  In that event, the earlier project which would have involved building a new St. Laurence's Hospital on a site at Cabra would not, of course, be proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very close inter-relationship between EEC and the United Kingdom butter markets and in view of the statement by the commission's vice-President, Dr. Mansholt, that there is apparently in the community's markets a surplus of some 330,000 tons of butter and also in view of the clearcut proposal of the commission to slash the intervention prices of butter from around 1,700 dollars down to about 1,100 dollars per metric ton, would the Minister consider that there is a good case to be made, notwithstanding the customary annual reviews, for discussions with his counterpart in Britain at this point in time arising from the major switch intended in butter production in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have these discussions, as the House is aware, but at a later stage in the year when not only our supply position but also the requirements of the British market will be more clearly seen.  As far as discussions related to the surplus now being carried by EEC countries are concerned, I do not see where this would get us at this time.  It is mainly their problem at the moment.  We have a quota which we shall fulfil during the current year and our real discussion will take place about what amount may be available to us by way of quota in the coming year.  I do not see the relevance of discussing the problems of the EEC butter surplus at the moment because our quota goes in and our job will be to renew and extend it if possible in relation to next year.  This we shall try to do but somewhat later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister if he envisages intense pressure from the British market to <Col N="1169" /> have the Irish butter quota reduced in view of the massive EEC surplus now available and which will inevitably have a major impact on British quota decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The pressure on us from the point of view of any reduction of quota arose last year from the carry-through of rather unusually heavy stocks of butter in Britain itself.  In fact, total imports of butter being arranged for this year to the British market have been reduced to about 65,000 tons, roughly 14 per cent or 15 per cent of the previous year's UK imports.  As a result of our discussions in the past year we succeeded in retaining our quota without any reduction whereas every other supplying country had its quota reduced and the total reduction between them amounted to 64,970 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether there is an overall plan to alleviate traffic congestion in Dublin city; if so, if he will give details of such plan; and when it may be expected to become effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for the Dublin Corporation acting in conjunction with the other authorities concerned.  However, in view of the importance of the issue and the need to remove certain misconceptions I shall reply in some detail.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to remind the House that our resources are limited and that there are demands for services such as housing, health and education as well as for roads and transport. On the money available for roads other parts of the country besides Dublin have their claims and these have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, it cannot be expected that a single plan can be produced to give an effective solution by a stated date to the traffic problems of Dublin.  If this were possible, other countries with far greater resources would have solved the traffic problems of their capital cities long ago.  The issue requires continual attention.  With the natural increase in the city's population, the growth in economic activity and the increase in prosperity and consequently in the ownership of motor vehicles, <Col N="1171" /> the demands on the street system are bound to increase.</P>
    <P>It is necessary therefore to envisage activity on different fronts&mdash;traffic management measures to get better value from the existing streets, a construction programme for the immediate future of such priority schemes as can be undertaken with the resources likely to be available in that period, longer term measures involving more ambitious road schemes and possibly other transport arrangements and, of course, the overall physical planning of the city and its environs.  Regional planning also has a part to play.</P>
    <P>Continuing studies are likely to be required to develop from time to time the best solutions for these several but related purposes, taking account of conditions as they change, and I have no doubt the corporation will initiate such studies as they consider appropriate at the proper time.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the studies undertaken to date a number of steps have been and are being taken.  Various traffic control measures have been introduced in the centre city and the radials from it, and other measures are in mind.  For instance, after consulting the corporation, the Commissioner of the Garda submitted for my consent on 7th instant bye-laws which would enable parking meters to be introduced. In accordance with the statutory procedure I am considering these.</P>
    <P>The corporation have outlined a fiveyear programme of road works in their draft development plan.  Recently they submitted a proposal for an inner tangent ring road for my approval in principle and this is being considered. The corporation are at present examining a report on parking and, in the meantime, are proceeding with certain projects.  For example, they have invited development proposals for a multistorey park at Bride Street.  These are some of the steps being taken at present.  As I have indicated, further steps will be taken from time to time.</P>

Positive action continues to be taken to protect ratepayers from the full impact of increases in local authority expenditure by increases in State grants to local authorities which, this year, are estimated to amount to about £66 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is essentially one for the discretion of sanitary authorities concerned.

In the case of unforeseen breakdowns in supplies no advance warning is possible.  I am satisfied that the authorities in general take necessary remedial action with the minimum of delay and, as most accidental breakdowns are of a minor nature, such repairs are effected fairly quickly and publication of the stoppage might well have the effect of causing unnecessary alarm.</P>
      <P>In the case of more serious breakdowns, where it is envisaged that there will be a significant delay in effecting repairs, then I understand it is the practice, as in the case of the fractured water main recently at Stillorgan, to inform the public through the communication media of the nature and expected duration of such stoppages.</P>

Of these applications, 24,500 or 55 per cent were refused.  Particulars are not kept of the passes and failures in each class of vehicle in which driving tests are conducted, but over 80 per cent of the applications received are for class C or private car tests.</P>

Conviction of either offence entails automatic disqualification for holding a driving licence.  The following are the convictions for these offences in the five years ended 30th September, 1968: 1968, 906; 1967, 884; 1966, 844; 1965, 957; 1964, 858.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs why in the Dáil on Wednesday, 16th July, in reply to a question about suggestions by the Italian and Finnish Governments that a European security conference should be summoned, he stated that he was not aware of any Italian initiative in view of the report on 11th April, 1969, that Signor Nenni, the Italian Foreign Minister, has proposed that the NATO alliance meet as soon as possible with members of the Warsaw Pact and that European nations that do not belong to either alliance should also be involved; and whether his Department have responded to this initiative by indicating Irish willingness to participate in such a conference.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question of 16th July referred specifically to any initiative taken by my Department in response to suggestions by the Italian and Finnish Governments about a European security conference.  Finland was one of four countries which made proposals of this nature to us last April and May, the others being Rumania, <Col N="1183" /> Hungary and the USSR.  There was no direct approach to us by Italy, although of course we were aware of the views expressed by the Italian Foreign Minister on the subject before his resignation.</P>
    <P>The response which was made to the proposals conveyed to us by the four countries follows the general lines which I have already indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question of 16th July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether that communication made it clear that we would participate in such conference or whether he has been or will be in communication with the Italian Government in the light of the fact that they took this initiative even if they have not approached us direct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House already that our embassies abroad have been told that we were, in principle, in favour of anything that would reduce tension in Europe and would participate in such a conference.  I think the House accepted, too, that a conference of that kind should have very careful preparation so that any of the conditions laid down or the premises on which it was based would not themselves negative the possibility of good results.  The calling of a conference without any result would do more harm than good.  As far as I remember, I also told the House that we would not agree to the acceptance of the immutability of boundaries because of our attitude as a nation to the boundary of our own country.  That principle is accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is an addition.  I said we would, but that it should be prepared well, and that, because of our attitude to the partitioning of our own country, we would not accept a principle of immutability of national boundaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest payable on issues from the Local Loans Fund is based on the current cost of long-term borrowing by the Exchequer.  In the case of local authority housing, water supply schemes and sewerage schemes, loans are, in effect, issued at reduced rates of interest.  The borrowing authorities are relieved of a large part of the burden of interest charges and of loan capital repayment charges by Exchequer contributions which automatically increase with the cost of borrowing.  The cost of these subsidies has increased from £3.2 million in 1964-65 to an estimated £5.3 million for 1969-70.  Recently the Government have increased the limits of cost of houses and flats for purposes of payment of State subsidy to local authorities.</P>

      <P>It seems somewhat unsatisfactory to adopt that procedure. The normal procedure is to put a question in the House as to what progress has been made in regard to something that the Government has announced is going to be done.  To say we can only hear what progress has been made once a year, when many of these things would come to fruition within that year, seems unsatisfactory.

      <P>CIE have included in their capital programme for the five <Col N="1191" /> year period ending 31st March, 1974, provision for the introduction of continuous welded rail on the Dublin/ Cork line.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of prices in hotels, restaurants and other elements of the tourist industry are affected by rising costs in the same way as other enterprises and some increase in prices is, therefore, inevitable.  The average increases in hotel prices this year was 3.4 per cent.  Hotel prices in Ireland are in general not expensive by international standards and Bord Fáilte have assured me that currently we are not in danger of pricing ourselves out of the international tourist market.</P>
      <P>Maximum charges for table d'hôte meals in hotels are set out in the Official Hotel Guide published annually by Bord Fáilte and these prices may not be exceeded without the prior consent of the board.  The board have informed me that such permission has been granted in only two cases this year.  In addition to this machinery, there is also the effect of free competition between the various establishments.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any additional action on prices is called for at the present time but the effect of price increases on the competitiveness of our tourist industry is a matter which I am watching very closely and I propose to have discussions with Bord Fáilte about the situation in the near future.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The factors which govern the volume of our tourist traffic include some external circumstances over which we have no control, for example, the economic situation in Britain, the unrest in the North and the continued restrictions on overseas expenditure by French residents.</P>
      <P>I understand that there was a slight fall in the number of persons who travelled to Ireland by sea during June, as compared with the same month last year, but that this has been offset by an increase in the number of passengers who came by air, especially from North America.  Overall, the cumulative total for 1969 has tended to level off at last year's figure.</P>

      <P>I understand that there was a slight fall in the number of persons who travelled to Ireland by sea during June, as compared with the same month last year, but that this has been offset by an increase in the number of passengers who came by air, especially from North America.</P>
      <P>In other words, there has been a balancing off between the European and British tourist and the North American tourist.</P>
      <P>Overall, the cumulative total for 1969 has tended to level off at last year's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that got to do with the question?  The question relates to the tourist traffic and passenger traffic and that includes Irish people returning from abroad and visitors coming here.  There is no breakdown and it is quite possible that the levelling off relates to an increase in the number of Irish people going abroad and coming back.  Does the Minister not agree with that?</P>

Bord Fáilte have informed me that over 22,000 visitors came to Ireland during the period October, 1968, to April, 1969, on special interest holiday programmes. <Col N="1199" /> Estimates compiled by the Central Statistics Office show that hotel receipts from visitors from outside the State in the October, 1968/March, 1969 period were 32 per cent higher than in the corresponding 1967/68 period.</P>
      <P>The extension of the season is one of the main tourism objectives of the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.  Bord Fáilte and the various elements of the tourist industry will be developing the campaign with this in view and I expect that this will result in significant increases in off-season traffic in future years.</P>

This has guaranteed basic minimum stocks that might otherwise be required at considerable expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the ESB that the amount of capital and skilled manpower which can be made available for the board's rural electrification post-development scheme dictates the speed at which the scheme can proceed.  The exceptional increase in labour costs last year reduced the amount of work which could be done. In addition, the improvement in the terms for the connection of consumers, which became operative in June, 1968, resulted in a greater number of acceptances; this in turn necessitated a greater amount of work than was originally expected in those areas which have been developed since that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms, the industrial products which were given improved terms of access to the UK market by the removal or reduction of duties or quantitative restrictions as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement were sugar and sugar goods; wine; certain manufactured tobacco; certain chemicals; photographic film; clocks and watches; yarns; fabrics; clothing and other products containing silk or man-made fibres; motor vehicles, parts and components; motorcycles, parts and components; tractors, parts and components; musical instruments; playing cards, matches; mechanical lighters.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 24th April last, two wells were bored by the Land Commission last year to provide a water supply for allottees on this estate but the yield was disappointing. These are now being supplemented by storage tanks to help overcome the <Col N="1216" /> low yield.  One tank has already been built; the other will be erected in the coming weeks.  It is hoped that the combination of well and tank will provide a reasonably satisfactory water supply for two houses and farmyards. Another well was bored recently but unfortunately &mdash; though consistent with the history of water difficulties in this region &mdash; the results were again disappointing. Additionally, tenders, due by next Friday, have been invited by the Land Commission for boring of yet a further well.  The arrangements which can be made for other allottees concerned must await investigation of the yields from these two wells.  There will be no avoidable delay on the part of the Land Commission on this aspect of the matter.</P>

Would the Minister not, on that account, have some special temporary measures taken to see that more accommodation is provided in the areas from which most of these children are drawn, that is in the urban areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education his attitude towards the question of the use of corporal punishment in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The official position in relation to corporal punishment is expressed in rule 130 of the Rules for National Schools, namely, that &ldquo;Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This ties in with the fact that being placed in <i>loco parentis</i> a teacher should be enabled to act as would a wise and prudent parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is a highly emotive subject and that it evokes great passion for and against it but I wonder would the Minister please reconsider his whole approach to the use of corporal punishment in schools?  Most reputable educationalists are now coming to accept that it has no place whatever in the relationship between children and parents or teachers and that it should be abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My guide, and I think the guide of my Department, would be to substitute for the negative attitude of just abolishing something the positive attitude of the love and kindness which a normal wise and prudent parent would have for his <Col N="1226" /> children.  The teacher is in <i>loco parentis</i> and the positive approach I have mentioned is subscribed to and acted upon by the vast majority of our teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that such factors as recognition by the Department in more recent times of the limitations of the ability of pupils, the fact that in the educational approach in recent years pupils are being treated as individuals, allied to more up-to-date teaching methods and the fact that psychiatric treatment is more readily available than it was, are by degrees phasing out the need for corporal punishment.  I can still see however that in cases of very serious misbehaviour there can be need for a deterrent.</P>

      <P>While the education given in the school which the Deputy has in mind may be comprehensive in nature, it is not a comprehensive school but a vocational school.  It was established as a school for boys by the City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee by which it is administered. All the usual local interests were fully consulted before the school was established.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is now in a position to announce the outcome of the meeting of the Dublin Advisory Council for post primary education held on 27th March 1969 concerning the new schools to be built at Sallynoggin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Following meetings of the Dublin Advisory Council on 27th March and subsequent dates my Department accepted the recommendations of the council in relation to the provision of post-primary school accommodation in the Sallynoggin area.  It is proposed accordingly that the existing vocational school should be considerably extended to cater for 400 boys and that a new girls' secondary school with accommodation for 800 pupils be erected.  It is the intention that both of these schools will be run on comprehensive lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education what plans are now in preparation for an extension of State comprehensive schools in areas of the country where there is a shortage of secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved in relation to this matter is the provision of adequate post-primary school facilities. Post-primary schools embrace comprehensive schools, secondary schools and vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in areas that are not <Col N="1231" /> otherwise adequately catered for in relation to post-primary schools that the question of providing comprehensive schools arises.  Apart from serving such areas comprehensive schools serve as pilot centres for the development of the idea of comprehensive education. I hope through co-operation between existing secondary and vocational schools to promote the concept of comprehensive education in all areas in the country.</P>
    <P>On this basis proposals for further comprehensive schools are at present confined to Raphoe, Ballymun, Limerick, Manorhamilton and Tarbert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that in the rest of the country there are adequate post-primary facilities, both secondary and vocational? Is he not aware of the conclusions in the report, Investment in Education, and the result of the 1966 Census, which show disparities in educational opportunity throughout the country&mdash; as great as four to one between different areas &mdash; because of the absence of secondary education?  Will he reconsider the decision not to proceed with further comprehensive schools in the light of that position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have stated is that we have already established comprehensive schools in areas where it is difficult for children to have post-primary education, that we intend to build further comprehensive schools in the areas I have outlined but that, in the other areas, what we hope to do is to utilise all the facilities in the various schools to develop a comprehensive system of education in those other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will consider transferring the primary responsibility for the schools curriculum, as well as responsibility for the examination system, to a schools committee similar to that which has operated successfully in Northern Ireland since 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters which my Department intends to discuss as soon as possible with all the bodies concerned is the future arrangements for the holding of the postprimary school examinations.  This will entail a scrutiny of every aspect of these examinations.  Pending the outcome of the necessary discussions and consultations, I would prefer not to make any statement on the matter other than to say that it should not be inferred that representatives of the schools and the teachers are not through syllabus and other committees very much involved in the arrangements for the examinations at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic problem involved here is one of better utilisation of the teaching force.  There is at present one teacher for every 33 pupils. The policy of closing small schools and creating larger school units is a major factor in achieving this better utilisation.  In addition, about 100 teachers in excess of normal requirements are being turned out each year. This has resulted in a position in which since 1958 the total number of national teachers has been increased by about 1,000 while the number of pupils continues <Col N="1245" /> to remain around the half million mark.  The goal which has been set is that there should not be over 35 pupils in any class.  I am satisfied that the measures already taken will enable us to reach this goal in a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <P>It might be no harm to give some details in connection with this.  Arising from the discussions on this matter previously, a meeting was held between post office workers and representatives of my Department last April.  At that time over 50 ventilator fans had been fitted in the building. It was pointed out to the union that there was little more that could be done and that part of the difficulty was caused by the unauthorised switching off of the fans by the staff. A full check was carried out and now the fans are kept on permanently with a resultant improvement in the ventilation. Four large propellor-type fans, suspended from the ceiling, have been installed in the letter office section. This is with a view to a further improvement and to try to counteract this excessive heat that does arise from the large expanse of glass in the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only really positive way we could solve that problem is by getting rid of the coal.  Reports which came before me as Parliamentary Secretary about two years ago did give the impression that alternative arrangements were being made for removing the coalyard.  At that time I expected that this would occur in 1970 but, unfortunately, the picture now seems to indicate that it will be another two years before the yard can be removed to Ringsend.

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go n-aontuíonn Dáil Éireann le téarmaí Reacht na Gníomhaireachta Idirnáisiúnta do Fhuinneamh Admhach, ar oscailt le síniú i Nua Eabhrac, 26 Deireadh Fomhair, 1956, agus a leasaíodh i Vín, 4 Deireadh Fómhair, 1961.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion, which I hope will be approved unanimously by the Dáil, is to enable the Government to become a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The agency is an autonomous intergovernmental organisation under the aegis of the United Nations, established to promote the peaceful use of atomic energy.  Its statute, copies of which have been presented to the Dáil and made available in the Library, was approved at a conference convened for that purpose in September, 1956, entered into force on 29th July, 1957, and has so far been ratified by 102 Governments, including 95 members of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the agency, as defined in its statute, is to &ldquo;seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world&rdquo;. To achieve this the IAEA assists research on atomic energy and its practical application for peaceful purposes, including the production of electric power, with special consideration being given to less developed areas.  It fosters the exchange of materials, equipment and technical information, and the training and exchange of scientists and experts.  It has also established standards of safety for the protection of health and the minimisation of dangers to life and property from radiation, and provides <Col N="1257" /> for the application of those standards through a special advisory service on radiation protection and the disposal of radioactive waste.  The agency also adminsters a safeguard system to ensure that the fissionable and other materials, services, equipment, facilities and information which it makes available are not used for the furtherance of any military purposes.</P>
    <P>The work of the agency represents a major effort at international co-operation to which almost all States subscribe and there is no valid reason why Ireland should not support this effort. With the opening for signature last year of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, there has been considerable emphasis on the role which the IAEA can play in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It is in our interest to keep abreast of these developments, which could be relevant in the future to our economic progress and prosperity.  It is also necessary for Ireland to follow these developments closely in the context of her disarmament work at the United Nations.  Our candidature for membership of EURATOM, the European Atomic Energy Community, is also an important consideration in favour of membership of the IAEA, which would obviously be useful in the course of the negotiations which will precede our admission to EURATOM and to the other European communities.</P>
    <P>Our financial contributions to IAEA are estimated at £10,000 a year.  I am satisfied that this expenditure is not excessive and, having regard to the need for us to keep in close touch with developments in the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the general desirability of this country being a member of a world organisation of this kind, I believe that we should now join the agency.  I, therefore, recommend that the Government should deposit its instrument of acceptance of the statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency at an early date and I ask the House to approve the motion I have moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Though it is rather extraordinary that this comes before <Col N="1258" /> the House only now after so many years, it is, perhaps, appropriate that it should come before the House in this week which has witnessed the greatest peaceful example of the progress of nuclear energy that this century has seen.  It would be appropriate that one would take the opportunity, first, to congratulate the United States of America on the success of their project in landing the astronauts on the moon, to hope that the remaining stage will be successful tomorrow night and, most emphatically, to praise the courage of the three men concerned and of the astronauts who had previously pioneered in this way.</P>
      <P>It is through the courage of pioneers in all walks of life that mankind has achieved progress and it is sincerely to be hoped that this magnificent feat and magnificent effort will be channelled in the cause of peace and will ensure that we will be able to get from the experience and the results of this feat a further stage in the development of progress for mankind.</P>
      <P>As I say, although it is appropriate that this would be brought forward this week, I cannot understand the timetable in this respect and I cannot understand why the Minister did not refer to that.</P>
      <P>This agency arose out of a suggestion that was made by President Eisenhower in December, 1953, and at the United Nations was adopted in its present form but not supported in its present form originally by Russia who wished to have this agency under the control of the Security Council with the consequent possibility of a veto.  I think it is a desirable development that that was not done and that the agency was introduced in its present form rather than in the form of a body under the security of the council as such, with the consequent veto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was in 1956, as the Minister has said, that the agency was set up and it was later, in the summer of 1957, that it came into operation and, quite honestly, I cannot understand why we have waited until now for the proposal that we should sign to be brought before the House.  The cost cannot be the reason because I agree entirely with the Minister that the <Col N="1259" /> amount involved is certainly not overextravagant for the part we are likely to play in this respect.  We will be, perhaps, more a receiver of information and of benefits in that respect than a disseminator of them unless we are lucky enough to have in Ireland another example of the brilliance of somebody such as Dr. Walton whose joint progress in the research field, with his co-researcher, made the splitting of the atom possible.  At the same time, there must have been some real reason. No matter how slowly great bodies may move, I do not believe that the Department of External Affairs or even the Minister's predecessor could have sat down for 12 years without some specific reason and the Minister might have indicated this reason to the House.</P>
    <P>The objects of the statute appear clear and to be those with which everybody in Ireland would agree: to promote the peace, health and prosperity of mankind through the peaceful use of atomic energy.  It seems extraordinary that we would not have come forward before now.</P>
    <P>There was &mdash; and it is slightly relevant &mdash; an Atomic Energy Committee set up in 1956 by the then Government, which Atomic Energy Committee reported on 22nd May, 1958, a committee composed not merely of many of the leading personnel in Ireland in this field, but of virtually all the leading personnel in this field.  As far as I can see from a consideration of that report, they did not make any advertence either to this agency.  Perhaps, the Minister could indicate whether any consultations were held with that committee which are not adverted to in the report itself as to whether we should or should not join the agency and whether that committee considered anything more than the individual problem that was its primary purpose as to whether a reactor should be accepted here.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also give the House some indication of the amount that had been made available to this agency in the way of material.  I think the position was that some 5,000 kilogrammes of uranium were pledged to <Col N="1260" /> the agency by the United States of America as compared with 50 kilogrammes by Soviet Russia and I think a smaller amount by other countries that had appropriate material.  We have not got and I do not think it is likely that we would ever have any uranium found here.  We have raw material of this sort.  Therefore, we cannot ourselves make any contribution in that respect.  I do think it would be appropriate that the House would know what other countries have made their contribution and what the contributions of those countries would be. More important than all of it, however, for consideration by the Dáil is the real reason why this did not come before and why it has taken the Minister's predecessors 12 years to put apparently a simple motion like this in operation and even though the original statute was amended in 1961 and the amendments promulgated I think two years before &mdash; some six years ago.  There must have been some reason for it and, perhaps, the Minister could tell the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to support the Minister's proposition and to join in his hope that this proposition will receive the unanimous approval of the Dáil.  The International Atomic Energy Agency, whose membership is almost universal, is obviously an appropriate body for us to belong to.  We can, as the Minister says, derive benefit from its work.  Indeed, participation in its work, and membership of it, is a logical consequence of our membership in the United Nations, almost all of whose members belong to this institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the lunar astronauts.  We should like to join in the congratulations which he thought should be extended to them and in the wish for the full and successful and happy completion of their great feat.  This I think is probably not strictly pertinent to the Schedule of the International Atomic Energy Agency Bill and, perhaps, we should not be too pedantic about that.  We, too, should like to hear from the Minister just why this apparently rather long delay has taken place in seeking the <Col N="1261" /> approval of the Dáil for the terms of this statute.  I am sure there is an adequate reason for that.  We should like to hear it from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a report here of the recommendation of the Atomic Energy Committee.  Perhaps I might quote the following extract from this letter:</P>
      <P>Apart from services and other facilities, the main advantage of membership of the agency seemed to the committee to lie in the possibility that any difficulties that might arise in the future in obtaining essential supplies of fissile fuel would be eased by membership, but that such an advantage could not be realised until such time as a power reactor was established here which would not be for at least five years.  The advantages of immediate membership would have to be considered against the financial outlay involved.  A realistic estimate of the time in which value from membership could be expected to accrue to this country would require estimates of future supplies of conventional fuels in relation to the expected demands for energy.  The Electricity Supply Board might be able to help in the matter.</P>
      <P>I read that extract to explain that this has been considered from time to time. Basically, the question of adherence to the agency has been considered &mdash; the main consideration, the likely value of technical benefits that this country might derive from membership.  Naturally, we have to give careful consideration to any international commitments which we undertake.  The thinking up to recently was in terms of the technical benefits which would derive from membership.  In recent times, wider considerations have weighed in the balance of Ireland's being a member. The work of the agency represents a major effort at international co-operation to which almost all States subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no valid reason why Ireland should remain aloof from this effort at international co-operation.  The big consideration is that the opening for signature of the United Nations Treaty <Col N="1262" /> on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons has put a considerable emphasis on the role which this agency can play in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Ireland must follow these developments closely in the context of Ireland's disarmament work at the United Nations.  It would be anomalous now if we were not members.</P>
    <P>In answer to the point about delay, I would say that if it were merely a matter of deriving benefit from the technical knowledge made available by membership, the pressure for membership was not such as to make it necessary to join.  However, the wider considerations of our position in the United Nations in relation to the non-proliferation treaty, in which Ireland played a big part, and our attitude to the health and safety factors, these new factors are decisive to my mind in making us want to become members of the Atomic Energy Agency now.  This has been decided by the Government at the instance of my predecessor. It is not a change of Minister that made a change of decision. The decision to ask the Dáil to accept this motion was taken to the Government by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Parties in the acclamation of the attainments of the United States.  I am sure that we as a country will let them know clearly how delighted and impressed we are at this great achievement of theirs for mankind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1969 made on the 15th day of July, 1969, by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for Finance under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1969, which I ask the House to approve, provides for two minor additions to the Garda pensions code, which are explained in the memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>Firstly the Order provides that Gardaí with temporary service in the Taca Síochána may now reckon such temporary service in full for pension purposes.  Members of the Taca Síochána were recruited in a temporary capacity in 1939, at the outbreak of World War II and they were absorbed into the Garda Síochána proper on a pensionable basis in 1942.</P>
      <P>Until 1965, temporary service in the Taca Síochána was not reckonable for ordinary Garda pension purposes.  In that year, it was accorded recognition as to one-half for Garda pension purposes, following the making of a similar arrangement in the public service.  The present provision, which will enable temporary service to be reckoned in full for pension purposes, brings the force into line with a new arrangement made some time ago in the case of the public service.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the order provides for the reduction from six to five years of the qualifying period of service for the payment of marriage gratuities to ban-ghardaí. This also brings them into line with the civil service.</P>
      <P>I commend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

I, therefore, welcome it so far as it goes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that it proposes to enable members of the Taca Síochána to reckon their entire service as members of that force for pension purposes although not for lump sum gratuity purposes.  It might be no harm at this stage to make it quite clear that the Taca Síochána is in no way associated with a rather notorious political arm of the Fianna Fáil party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that members of the Taca Síochána who came into the Garda Síochána under that arm had a very small salary, as low, I understand, as £3 a week.  They proved to be very fine officers and most of them, on account of their educational qualifications, <Col N="1265" /><i>et cetera,</i> became high officers in the force.  It is a good thing that they are now being treated in this way.  It is also reasonable that the qualification period for a marriage gratuity for members of the banghardaí should be reduced from six years to five years, which will bring them into line with other State servants.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that members of the Garda Síochána, our unarmed police force, should have no genuine grounds for complaint in respect of their terms of service or conditions of employment because it is essential that they should be a satisfied and contented body of men, not labouring under any genuine grievance or grudge because they are daily coming into contact with every citizen of the State, law-abiding citizens as well as law breakers.  It is essential, therefore, that they should be satisfied and contented and that they do not have genuine chips on their shoulders, because if they are labouring under genuine grievances and are of the opinion that they are being less favourably treated than other State servants it is then almost certain that they will not discharge their duties as well as they otherwise might. As I understand it, the members of the Garda Síochána have genuine cause for complaint when compared with other State servants and with other police forces in Europe.</P>

    <Title>National Stud Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Stud Company was established under the National Stud Act, 1945, as a measure to assist and encourage the breeding of thoroughbred horses in Ireland.  Since 1946, when it leased from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the property known as the National Stud Farm at Tully, County Kildare, the company has carried on the business of a stud farm.  Deputies will recall that this property had been used by the British Government as a stud farm until 1st January, 1944, when it was transferred to the Irish Government.  The transfer did not, however, include any bloodstock.</P>
      <P>Since the war the importance and value of the Irish bloodstock industry have been increasing progressively. Yearlings and foals from studs in Ireland command attention at Irish and English sales where buyers from the major racing countries compete for them at excellent prices.  Irish bred sires have been exported to most countries in the racing world, where their blood lines have boosted the quality of the thoroughbred and enhanced the prestige of the Irish horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net export value of the thoroughbred industry is in the region of £4m. a year including worthwhile indirect export benefits which accrue from the substantial expenditures of foreign owners sending their horses to Irish training stables and their sires and mares to Irish stud farms.  The industry provides a significant quota of good employment in rural areas.  The State through the National Stud has contributed a good deal to the prosperity of the thoroughbred industry.  Conditions are changing radically, however, in this <Col N="1268" /> industry as in so many others.  Ireland's prestige as one of the greatest nurseries of thoroughbred horses by itself is not sufficient to compete with developments in other countries &mdash; notably the United States, Great Britain and France.</P>
    <P>The directors of the Irish National Stud Company have been taking stock of the company's position in the light of changing times and of the findings of the Survey Team on the House Breeding Industry which reported in 1965.  I must accept the considered view of the directors which is that, unfortunately, the National Stud has not been able to keep up of late with what a national stud might ideally be or even, perhaps, with the standards set by the best privately-owned stud farms at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>For instance, a large part of the accommodation for visiting mares and their foals, besides being very old, is uneconomic in its lay-out and in its location <i>vis-á-vis</i> the stud's operations generally.  Then, the number of stallions at the stud which used to be six or even seven is now reduced to four. This quota is quite insufficient to meet the demands of breeders.</P>
    <P>It is five years since a stallion was purchased by the stud.  &ldquo;Fashion&rdquo; is very important in this business.  Many high-class young horses have been acquired by private studs over the last two or three years.  The National Stud should clearly be in a position to provide the services of comparable sires. The special feature about the National Stud is that the smallest breeder &mdash; provided his mare is of acceptable quality &mdash; can compete with all comers in the ballots for nominations.  The stud's fees are modest and the &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; basis of charge is a valuable concession which is not common in the industry generally as far as high-class sires are concerned.</P>
    <P>The need for new and additional stallions is represented by the company as necessary also to provide the extra revenue needed to meet steeply rising costs of maintenance and overhead charges.  Since 1960 the company have spent some £300,000 on capital account on bloodstock and on additions and improvements to the stud's facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The recent outlay has virtually exhausted the company's capital resources.  I am satisfied that the case made to me by the board of the company for a substantial injection of new capital is a good one.  All told, the purchase of additional stallions; the construction of new yards for their visiting mares and the replacement of out-of-date and uneconomic buildings and installations in conformity with modern standards and specifications would be likely to cost the company some £500,000 to £600,000 in a programme phased over three or four years.</P>
    <P>Since the authorised share capital of the company is limited under the National Stud Act, 1953, to £500,000&mdash; it was only £250,000 under the original Act of 1945 &mdash; an increase to at least £1,000,000 would be necessary for the purposes I have already described.  It is contemplated that if this Bill is enacted the additional finance found to be required by the company should be provided in the form of share capital taken up by the Minister for Finance under section 19 of the original Act of 1945 after statutory consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Up to now I have been speaking of objectives which would call for an increase of half-a-million pounds in the company's share capital, that is, from £.5m. to £1m.  Deputies will have noticed, however, that clause 2 of the Bill before them provides for the increase of this capital to £2m.  This brings me to the question of the acquisition by the National Stud of what has been described as a &ldquo;prestige stallion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Survey Team on the Horse Breeding Industry agreed that, as at the time the team reported (1965), the National Stud was providing a reasonable service to small breeders.  However, after reviewing all the evidence available about the quality of the bloodstock produced in this country and on the reputation of Irish horses generally, the team went on to recommend that &ldquo;there should be at all times at least one prestige stallion standing at the National Stud.&rdquo;  The directors of the Irish National Stud Company agree with this view while, naturally, stressing <Col N="1270" /> the risk involved in the investment of a great deal of money in a horse which might well prove disappointing.</P>
    <P>This, then, is merely an enabling provision against the contingency that an opportunity might arise of obtaining what the directors of the company considered to be the right kind of horse at the right price.  A factor of special concern to the Minister for Finance would, of course, be the capacity of the Exchequer at any given moment to provide the company with the amount of share capital needed to effect a proposed purchase.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 of the Bill deals with the company's bank borrowings.  These are restricted to £100,000 or to the amount of share capital unissued whichever is the less.  That restriction relates back to the 1945 Act when the share capital of the company was £250,000.  If the fixed capital of the company is increased as provided for in this Bill some corresponding increase in working capital facilities will obviously be needed.  Clause 3, accordingly, purports to raise the company's borrowing capacity to £200,000 without limitation by reference to unissued share capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the purpose of the Bill is to increase the share capital so that the Irish National Stud Company can undertake necessary capital development in the way of providing up-to-date buildings and facilities at the stud farm and also for the purpose of acquiring, should the opportunity offer, a high-class, exclusive sire.  I think it right to say that the National Stud has done reasonably well since it was established.  Indeed, as I look around the House &mdash; I suppose it is a sign of age &mdash; I find I am the only person here who was here when the original Act was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stud and the stud company, on the whole, have been reasonably successful.  The business, as those who are familiar with it know, is one in which very considerable risks are involved. No matter how alert or energetic the board or their advisers may be in acquiring suitable bloodstock, it does not always follow that the success which they expect for the progeny will be achieved.  The stud company's early purchases of sires were particularly successful. <Col N="1271" />&ldquo;Royal Charger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Preciptic&rdquo; were, I think, both very successful and so were one or two other sires.  The Minister's reference to the idea of purchasing a prestige stallion prompts me to refer to this: no matter how successful a stallion may be on the racecourse, there is no absolute guarantee that the same success will attend his efforts as a sire or that his progeny will inherit the characteristics which marked his racecourse career.</P>
    <P>Indeed, here again the stud had, I suppose, quite an unusual experience. In the 1950s they purchased what was then the most renowned racehorse of its time from the late Aga Khan, Tulyar.  Undoubtedly many eyebrows were raised at the purchase price at the time and, if my memory serves me correctly, we had an amending Bill to provide the funds necessary.  That attracted a lot of attention, of course. The purchase was questioned on a number of grounds.  In any event, whatever about the purchase price, they made a very successful sale in getting rid of the horse subsequently.  To that extent, I suppose, they had the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is true to say &mdash; and it is borne out by all students of breeding &mdash; that horses with traditional classic pedigrees, who have displayed capacity on the racecourse, generally tend to transmit those abilities to their progeny.  The late Sir Charles Lester, who used to write each year's article prior to the Derby, always stressed the fact &mdash; other writers and commentators adverted to it, too&mdash; that, by and large, the well-known bloodlines which had themselves attained classic success, or had finished in the first two or three in the classic races, generally tended to transmit the same characteristics or the same racing ability to their progeny.  To that extent, there is merit in the idea of endeavouring to do this.  There is undoubtedly a risk in it.  The fact that a horse has attained success does not always mean that this will follow, and Tulyar was a case in point.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for the Irish National Stud Company endeavouring to maintain as part of the <Col N="1272" /> quota stallions, or at least one stallion, of classic standard.  This depends, of course, as the Minister remarked, on a horse being on offer and available at the right price.  Undoubtedly the postwar development of syndication and share-ownership in one form or another has, to a great extent, increased prices beyond the capacity of an individual owner to acquire, on his own, sires of the value involved in buying classic horses.</P>
    <P>At the same time, if we are to maintain &mdash; and there is no doubt that the competition from Britain, France and America is very keen &mdash; our place, which is a high one, and if we are to continue to maintain the share of the bloodstock market which this country has &mdash; in round figures I think it is estimated at over £4 million a year &mdash; it is essential that we should at all times endeavour to produce and breed the best.  I agree entirely with this idea and I think it was one of the objectives laid down in our discussions when the original Bill was going through.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, it has always been the policy of the board to give encouragement to and provide facilities for small breeders.  This country has undoubtedly many large stud farms and establishments owned by people of considerable means.  On the other hand, the backbone of the trade &mdash; and it is of particular value from the point of view of dispersing employment throughout every county or almost every county &mdash; is the small breeder.  We must ensure that the small breeders get the return to which they are entitled and get the encouragement they expect.  This depends on enabling them to avail of sires in the way in which the National Stud has made them available by allowing them to operate through balloting nominations and giving them right of access to sires of this sort.  There is no doubt that many of the less expensive sires that have been available at the stud have been used with advantage by the smaller breeders.  It is essential that they should continue to have these facilities made available to them.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the standard of accommodation at the stud should be improved.  This originally was quite <Col N="1273" /> a well-equipped stud.  It was equipped by the late Colonel Hall-Walker who owned it and subsequently, as is generally known, handed it over to the British Government and it was later transferred by the British Government to the Government here.  The equipment provided during the first war, or even earlier is, of course, by modern standards, by no means adequate or sufficient and it does not provide the amenities or services necessary.  I believe it is desirable that the highest standard should be provided.  It is essential from the point of view of ensuring that the Irish National Stud affords the services which people expect.</P>
    <P>I know the view has been expressed that, with the large number of privately-owned studs here and because of the fact that a great deal of capital is involved in it, it is not necessary to have a State company carrying on a stud of this sort.  I do not agree with that view.  At any rate, we have this stud available.  It was provided initially by Colonel Hall-Walker and the reputation it achieved as a stud reflected considerable credit on Colonel Hall-Walker and those associated with him for their foresight and for the success that has attended, in the main, the sires provided there &mdash; particularly the earlier ones, also in recent times and some of the sires at present standing there.</P>
    <P>We believe this is a desirable proposal. I think it is essential to realise, in accepting it, that there is no guarantee that purchasing what is described as a prestige horse will ensure success and that it is important that the stud should continue to ensure that full consideration is given to the interests of the smaller breeders who not only breed horses for flat racing but also store horses for alternate sale as hurdlers or 'chasers.  We agree to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I would be the last to pretend to any expert knowledge of the bloodstock industry, but in the enforced absence of my colleague, Deputy Murphy, I should like very simply and briefly to say that the Labour Party also accept and welcome this Bill.  We think this is a most important major industry in Ireland, and <Col N="1274" /> more particularly it is a prestige industry of the kind which, perhaps, a small country like ours can most successfully sustain.  We also in the Labour Party take a small private and understandable interest in this industry because it demonstrates a rather unusual example in Ireland of the effective working of public enterprise in a productive sphere.  As both the Minister and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party have pointed out, the National Stud is in competition with private studs and is, nevertheless, successfully so and is performing a very useful function.  We are very glad to see an instance in which a public enterprise can compete with private enterprises in the same sphere without, in that process, inducting alien Marxist or Maoist philosophies into the horses of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. We are glad to see that principle accepted by the Minister and the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  Indeed, we will go further and say that, perhaps, the same principle might be extended to other areas of public enterprise, for example, the Irish Sugar Company, Erin Foods or even Irish Steel Holdings.  However, in this small way in this stud we are grateful that public enterprise can act effectively, can help the small breeder, and we think this contingency measure by the Minister is a justifiable and desirable one.  We support it and we trust that if and when the contingency arises that the National Stud acquires its prestige stallion they will similarly be able to do so in the interests of the State without bringing in foreign influences of one kind or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to welcome this Bill.  It is a very worthwhile measure.  The small breeders of thoroughbred horses are entitled to support from the Exchequer.  I note with a certain amount of disappointment that the number of stallions at the stud has dropped from seven to four. <Col N="1275" /> This is unfortunate and I would ask the Minister to ask the manager of the National Stud to bring the number of horses back to its traditional number and in doing so to try to establish a balance between sires for flat racing mares and sires for hurdling and steeplechasing mares.</P>
      <P>In regard to the prestige sire, I also think this is a good idea.  However, I am wondering if the price of, say, the Derby winner is going beyond the national purse.  Would the Minister consider, if he cannot buy a top-class sire like Sir Ivor, allowing the National Stud to take, say, ten nominations to a Derby winner such as Sir Ivor and, by ballot, allot them out to small breeders?  This could possibly save the Exchequer money and it would also help the small breeders to improve the blood line.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also consider diverting a small amount of the taxation on betting to help the National Stud with its running costs. It might be only one per cent of the revenue from it, but this would help especially to maintain the facilities of the stud.  Again, I welcome the Bill and give it my wholehearted support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  The people concerned in the breeding of horses have been helped and encouraged by the National Stud down through the years.  As the Minister said, we are exporting in the region of £4 million worth each year.  This is very important to the economy and to farmers and breeders.  Those connected with the National Stud have done a reasonably good job on a very limited purse and the money has been well spent.  As the Minister has stated, the industry provides a significant quota of very good employment in Ireland throughout the whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I entirely agree with the Minister that the National Stud has not been able to keep up with the standards that have been set by private studs here and in England and especially in France. It certainly does not compare with the privately-owned studs that we have here in our country.  The National Stud should be the showpiece of studs here in Ireland.  It certainly should have proper standards.  It should be a place where small breeders or any other type of breeder can visit and get valuable information to help them on their own farms or studs.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Collins I regret the reduction in the number of stallions from seven to four.  This has been a retrograde step but in view of the small amount of money at their disposal they were doing their best.  The small breeder cannot afford to pay £500 or, perhaps, up to £1,000 for a first-class sire.  Could the Minister bring into operation a scheme which would provide a first-class sire to small breeders at a low cost, even if it had to be subsidised by the State?  The small farmer and the small breeder have been the backbone of the horse breeding industry down through the years.  It is a risky business as everybody connected with it knows. A well-off man can put up with a severe loss for a year or two but the small man is not able to weather the storm.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Cosgrave and the Minister in regard to having one or two prestige stallions in the National Stud.  It is a pity that, as the Minister stated, we have not bought a stallion for the past five years.  The sooner we give the National Stud permission to go ahead with their good work the better for all concerned.  We welcome the Bill and think it should be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies who have spoken for their keen interest in this matter and, indeed, for their helpful suggestions, suggestions which I shall carefully consider.  I agree with the Deputies who praised the work of the National Stud and I am hopeful that, when I get this piece of legislation through the Oireachtas, we will be able to urge the board of the company, if urging be needed &mdash; I do <Col N="1277" /> not think it is &mdash; to get on with a considerably expanded programme of activity.</P>
      <P>Apart from the things Deputies have mentioned, I think the board could do a great deal to run courses, give demonstrations and generally be helpful to the industry in much the same way as the Agricultural Institute helps the other branches of agriculture.  The Agricultural Institute has, of course, taken a considerable interest in bloodstock breeding and has always been helpful to breeders.  However, I assure Deputies who have shown an interest in this national institution that it is my wish and the wish of the Government that this should become a real National Stud &mdash; as someone mentioned, a show place, a place of which we can all be proud and to which we can bring distinguished visitors to show them our premier product, the Irish horse at its best.</P>
      <P>I am particularly glad Deputy Thornley welcomed the Bill.  I agree with him that in a matter of this sort there is no reason why State enterprise should not come along and do a good job, setting an example to the industry as a whole.  That is our philosophy. We, in Fianna Fáil, have nothing against State enterprise as such.  I do not think any Deputy has anything against State enterprise.  We recognise that, from time to time, in particular circumstances State enterprise can do a very good job and we have no intention of stopping it doing a good job and no intention of withholding the resources necessary to enable it to do that job.  That is what we are doing here.  I am very grateful to the House for the manner in which it has received this small, but important, measure.</P>

It is absolutely essential that the Garda Síochána should enjoy as favourable pension conditions as other State servants.  However, I do not think the Minister goes far enough in this order.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I bow to your ruling.  This order entitles a small section of the Garda Síochána to have reckoned for pension purposes the years they served as members of the Taca Síochána.  I agree with that.  They shall not, however, be entitled to reckon those years of service for lump sum or gratuity purposes. I think the Minister should have gone the whole way.  Reducing the qualifying period for gratuity purposes for the ban-ghardaí is welcome.  It would be unreasonable to place the ban-ghardaí in a less favourable position than other State servants.  The rules of order prevent me from going into in depth a subject which this order highlights.  The Garda Síochána should be treated in all respects on a par with all other State servants in order to ensure that they will not go about their duties with chips on their shoulders, believing they are the Cinderellas of the State servants. That is not good for the force and it is not good for the citizens who have to come into contact with members of the force from day to day.</P>
      <P>You have ruled, Sir, that I cannot go into all the grievances that I would like to go into and I will reserve such data and information as I have on the subject for another occasion.

      <P>I should like to welcome this order as an overdue step in the right direction.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an injustice suffered by a number of people who may be covered by Article 3 of this order.  This is the fact that police who retired at a time when pay was low get less for the rest of their lives than gardaí who may have waited a little longer until pay has increased because pensions are computed as a fraction of pay earned by the garda at the time he retires.  We should ensure equality between these people and not have the position that a garda may retire just before a pay rise thus getting a smaller pension for the rest of his life than somebody who waits a little longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact this order covers very few people.  The vast majority of the members of the Taca Síochána will in due course be fully qualified as members of the Garda Síochána and eligible for pensions and all the other benefits which the Garda enjoy.  There is only one man, an inspector of the Detective Office, affected by this, and it will be a very short time before the remaining members of the Taca Síochána are fully qualified as ordinary gardaí for the benefits that these men enjoy.  I am only dealing with what is in the order.  The qualifying period for marriage gratuities for ban-ghardaí has been reduced from six to five years <Col N="1281" /> because this was granted to the public service in 1968.  This order is retrospective to January, 1968 and it puts ban-ghardaí exactly in the same position as women in the public service.  I can, and the House can, only deal with what is here in this order.  I am not going to chase the hares raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  There is at this time a commission going into all aspects of the Garda service, as the House and the Deputy know.  However, the Deputy wanted to take advantage of the Chair's leniency to try to get his point over and if he has succeeded he is welcome.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last night I was dealing with land bonds.  Land bonds, of course, were a very original and very subtle method of confiscating lands.  The landlords got the opportunity of giving their land for nothing or taking bonds and wisely they took the bonds.  For various reasons land bonds have become unpopular but in defence of bonds it must be said that if they are considerably below par at the moment at the same time in view of the tremendously inflated prices paid for land it would appear doubtful if those who take bonds are losing anything worthwhile. Anyway, in the main, they are being given to big landholders who can afford to take a little cut.  There is one point I should like to make clear.  As I understand it, for some years past smallholders are entitled to get cash.  I hope that is a fact and that these bonds are not being pushed down the throats of smallholders who do not want them and who may not be in a position to wait until they could realise even the deflated value of land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my part of the country farms are small and I would not like to see them taken over and paid for in land bonds unless the people want to take these bonds.  My main point is, whether they are paid in land bonds or not, when the lands are taken over they should be brought quickly into use and distributed. <Col N="1282" /> I do not think land bonds have anything to do with that tremendous holdup.  This is a main problem down in my territory.  It takes years and years to take over land and then it is years and years before something is done with it.  I would ask the Minister to do something about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why he selected the figure of £40 million?  Since the Land Bond Act, 1934 was passed the Land Commission have got about £25 million, in a period of 35 years.  I am being genuine when I say that the Government are very fond of big figures when it comes to money.  There should be a more realistic approach.  The Minister is now legislating for ever; this legislation will last for ever.  I notice that the Minister shakes his head.  I would seriously suggest that in view of the antipathy to land bonds the Land Commission should get away from land bonds altogether.  Even if the Oireachtas gives them this Bill, they should, on the whole, get away from land bonds altogether.  Even if the Oireach-Minister on this: they have got away from land bonds in recent years.  I will make a bet with the Minister &mdash; I have not the figures &mdash; that the Department of Lands is paying a lot more money in cash for lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a guess on my part, except that I know the background a bit.  The game is hardly worth the candle any longer, especially with the fantastic rate of interest.  If you are going to have the bonds at or near par for some reasonable time after being issued, I do not know what rate of interest the Minister will fix.  But, if you have the Metal Box Company, one of the British prime companies, paying 10½ per cent for money and, as I said the last day, a big number of companies in one week raising money at nine and seven-eights per cent and only getting £99.5 out of every £100, this game is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will consider the matter or not.  He probably will not.  One of the difficulties about dealing with, if I may say so <Col N="1283" /> with respect, the establishment &mdash; let us put it that way &mdash; I mean the Minister and his civil servants and I am certainly not referring in particular to or throwing any odium on the Land Commission in this connection &mdash; is that once they make up their minds about something it is very difficult to get them to see reason afterwards.</P>
    <P>This figure of £40 million for £25 million is, in my opinion, just ludicrous. Frankly, when we are dealing with millions, in practice, it makes no difference. These are just words written into the Bill.  In practice it will make no difference but I do think that this House ought to show a sense of responsibility and I would much prefer to see the Minister having a figure of £30 million in there instead of £25 million. This is what is known as my conservative socialism or my social conservatism; I do not know what it is, but I do hate to see huge figures in relation to money in legislation.  I am a great deal more careful of public moneys than I am of my own.  We ought to feel that way about it.  I do not know why the Minister made up his mind at £40 million.  If he had even added £10 million to the £25 million instead of £35 million, I would have said that he was providing, on the basis of anything that I can see, for the next 20 or 25 years.  The land is not left; it is being raked over time and again.</P>
    <P>Do not misunderstand me.  This is not a question of principle, really, because the amount of land bonds that will go out will depend on many factors, particularly on the present antipathy to land bonds that exists.  Unlike Deputy Lenehan up there, who weeps bitter tears for small people &mdash; we all know that kind of act; he thinks the big fellows should get the land bonds, should be rooked, or words to that effect; he did not mind what happened them &mdash; I am concerned about the honesty of the State.  I am concerned that the State should be upright and should be seen to be upright.  I would urge the Minister &mdash; I am not going to press him; I have said what I have to say &mdash; that, instead of this figure of £40 million, he and his officials should reconsider it even at this late stage and take some figure that has some <Col N="1284" /> relation to what the realities will be for the next decade.  It is good enough for us to legislate for a decade.  We need not be legislating for the rest of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister, as other Deputies have, to try to pay in cash instead of in land bonds.  Payment in cash would be much fairer and would be a more honest system.  It would expedite the purchase and distribution of a large pool of land before we enter the EEC.  Deputy O'Donovan has stated that we in this House are interested in justice and in seeing that the State deals justly with all the people and cherishes all sections of the people equally.  I claim that in this connection we want justice, not confiscation. The present system of paying in land bonds is unfair and unjust. It delays, hinders and frustrates the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time nobody seems to have confidence in land bonds.  The Minister knows as well as any one of us that when a vendor sells land he may have financial commitments or he may want to buy another farm.  If he is paid in cash he can buy another farm immediately, perhaps to his advantage.  He can meet his creditors and pay them off as quickly as possible. If he is paid in land bonds we know the trouble he has in trying to sell and the delay in many cases in trying to get somebody to buy them. That is one of the objections that landowners have.  Land bonds have the reputation of not being easily convertible or, if they have to be cashed quickly, very often have to be sold at considerable loss.  I understand that the Government stockbrokers do not operate for land bonds.  They do not stand ready to buy and sell land bonds as they do in the case of National Loans.  It is very unfair that trouble and inconvenience should be caused to landowners when they are trying to cash land bonds.  The possibility of payment in land bonds operates to the detriment of the Land Commission in acquiring land.  It certainly interferes with the goodwill that should exist and which the Government should try to retain.  The question of land bonds very often leads to bad public relations <Col N="1285" /> between the Land Commission, auctioneers, solicitors and vendors.  As a solicitor, the Minister, I am sure, knows a fair amount about that.</P>
    <P>Every one of us in public life is conscious of the appalling hardships which have arisen from the depreciation in the value of bonds.  Five per cent land bonds are now under £70; six per cent land bonds are only slightly over £70 and 3½ per cent land bonds are only around £60.  So I have been told.  Therefore, a man who invested £100 and who is selling them now would get only £60.  Taking into consideration the depreciation in the value of money, I suppose in real money terms he would be getting only about £20, roughly one-fifth.  That is very unfair.  We all know many cases of both voluntary and compulsory acquisition of land where people have suffered very serious financial loss. Taking a figure of £70 now for land bonds that were worth £100, we can see that the landholder who sold a few years ago has suffered already a 30 per cent loss in the value of his money. No other section of the people are asked to suffer as seriously as those people are.</P>
    <P>The position, I think, has become even worse within the past year or so. I can give the Minister particulars of a farm sold in my own county over a year ago or so for £12,000.  Possession was taken on 12th December, 1968.  The 8 per cent land bonds came into operation in January.  The purchase money is only now being allocated and already there is a depreciation of about 20 per cent. Therefore, this man who sold his farm to the Irish Land Commission last year in good faith for £12,000 is now getting only something over £9,500 &mdash; between £9,500 and £10,000 in actual money.  The Minister will have to admit that this is unfair and unjust. The man in question sold voluntarily. He wanted to buy again.  Now, he is in the position that land has increased in price since then.  To buy a farm similar to the one he sold for £12,000 would now cost him perhaps £13,000. Therefore, he would have to put £3,500 to £4,000 to the money he is getting <Col N="1286" /> now from the Land Commission in order to purchase a similar or a suitable farm.  That is not giving any encouragement to holders of land to hand over their land voluntarily to the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister also knows that the 8 per cent bonds came into operation in January last and that the price of those bonds today is down, I think, to 91.  Therefore, in respect of cases which still have to be completed, the owner is taking a loss of 10 per cent. The Minister will have to agree that this is outrageous and that some provision should be made to deal with such cases.  How the Minister is going to do it I do not know.  I should like to suggest three of four different methods.  We should see that justice is done to those people and we should certainly try to retain good public relations. I understand that during Mr. Blowick's term as Minister for Lands &mdash; the Minister can contradict me if I am wrong but I have been told it &mdash; there was a system whereby a bonus on the purchase money could be awarded in such cases.  I have been told that it is in section 6 of the Land Act, 1953.  If my information is correct might I suggest that some sort of similar concession should now be made to deal with very real cases of hardship which have arisen and which seem to be arising regularly.</P>
    <P>If the price of land bonds drops &mdash; we all know from past experience that they can drop very quickly &mdash; the Minister should have a provision made to allocate additional bonds.  If you are not prepared to pay in cash and if you still want to pay in bonds I think there should be provision to allocate additional bonds to bring up the purchase price to par.  I think power should be in the hands of judicial commissioners to make such concessions, where necessary. Another method would be that if, between the date the Land Commission take possession &mdash; the operative date &mdash; and the payment of bonds, bonds are issued at a higher rate of interest, the vendor should be allowed to exchange the old bonds for new bonds or he should be paid with the bonds that are in operation on the date they are being issued.  I think the acquisition date is the operative date at the present <Col N="1287" /> time: I have given the House the case of the farm acquired on 12th December and the person is only being paid at the present time.  Instead of making that date the operative date, if the Minister could make the date of payment the operative date, it would get over many of the difficulties that are arising at the present time.  When people hand over land voluntarily or when the Land Commission acquire the land, many snags arise.  Some people will tell you that solicitors may be a bit slow in dealing with cases.  I have heard some people blame the solicitors. I do not know how good their cases are but they do.  I know that there are delays even here in title and in different Land Commission offices here.  Many snags arise.  It may take as long as a year to clear title and to get everything in order.  I would ask the Minister to make the operative date the date of payment and to issue land bonds at par with the land bonds on that particular date.</P>
    <P>We were told that something like £600,000 was paid out in cash last year.  Under what circumstances were people paid in cash and paid in bonds? What law governs this or at whose discretion are the particular people paid?  Are they paid at the discretion of the Land Commission or are they paid at the discretion of the Minister? At whose discretion are they paid?</P>
    <P>In fairness to everybody, if the State wants to seem to be just to everybody &mdash; not merely just to itself &mdash; I believe that land bonds should be accepted. They are not accepted at the present time by the State for the payment of death duties, income tax or any other State debt.  They should be accepted at par value and, if not, at least at some reasonable value.  People cannot understand why the Government will not accept them.  Have the Government not got faith in their land bonds issued by themselves?  If the Government or the State make a landowner accept land bonds, surely, if anything happens to that unfortunate man inside a year or two years, the State should accept what they have made him accept?  Surely they should accept from his solicitor or his wife land bonds in payment of death duties?  If he is in arrears of <Col N="1288" /> income tax, or anything like that, surely the Minister should accept the land bonds which the State has made the particular man accept and surely the State should accept them back at par for such purposes?</P>
    <P>As the Minister himself knows, solicitors are paid their costs in land bonds.  It means an immediate loss.  It also means a lot of trouble and inconvenience to the people concerned.  The market is so uncertain that very often there is difficulty in disposing of the bonds.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on my suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of earlier speakers on the Committee Stage of this Bill when they pointed out that land bonds are a very unfair method of paying people for valuable land.  The case made by speakers on our side of the House is very strongly endorsed by an answer I received this very day in the form of a tabular statement to a question I addressed to the Minister for Finance.  I asked the Minister for Finance if he could give comparative figures for the present value of land bonds issued over the past ten years, and the present average value of fixed interest securities issued on the Irish Stock Exchange in the same year as each of the issues of land bonds.  The reply to this question is quite startling. Take, for instance, 1960.  Land bonds were issued at 6 per cent in that year. At present, they are worth 67 whereas Exchequer stock issued at the same rate of interest in the same year is worth 73?ths.  The land bond people are getting a very raw deal indeed. Take, again, 1961.  Land bonds were issued at 6 per cent.  Exchequer stock, in that year, issued at the same interest rate, is now worth 73? whereas the land bonds are worth only 67.  The story goes on.  The figures for 1968 are also interesting.  The 7½ per cent land bonds are now worth 83, the Exchequer stock and development stock issued in that year &mdash; there were three issues in all &mdash; are worth on average 93¼ at the moment.  Therefore, there is a difference of 10 per cent between the value of land bonds issued at 7½ per cent in 1968 and the value of Exchequer stock and development stock issued at 7½ per cent in that year.</P>

      <P>I should like to make some suggestions to the Minister as to how he could remedy the situation which I have outlined and remedy these injustices.  I would suggest, first of all, that the figures I have quoted of the average present value of other loan issues in the same year as land bonds would provide a very good yardstick for the Minister if he were to consider providing some compensation for those people who have been paid in land bonds, which have depreciated faster than the average for fixed interest securities issued in the same year.  He might consider taking some action to provide finance to those people to bring the value of their holdings up to the average value of fixed interest securities issued in that year.  He could perhaps do it in the form of a lump sum.  In relation to future policy I would suggest that either the Minister should substitute cash for all sales to the Land Commission for land bonds, or else he should consider making land bonds redeemable at par, say, 20 years after issue.  This by providing the prospect of one's land bonds being saleable at par would ensure that instead of going down, as they have done, they would maintain a reasonable value throughout the period.</P>

      <P>There is no point in pretending that the land bonds system does not suffer from defects; it does, but that is not to say that it is not basically a sound system.  The debate that has taken place on this particular section and that took place last week on the Second Reading is very similar to the debates that have taken place in this House over the years on this vexed subject of land bonds.  I would say straight away to Deputy Bruton that these bonds of course are redeemable at par.

      <P>With regard to the suggestion made by Deputy O'Donovan that the increase from £25 million to £40 million is unrealistic and represents an attempt by the Government and the Department at a pretence of grandiose proportions, this is simply not so, because at the present time the £25 million which is authorised has been exhausted and at the present rate of land bond issue an additional £15 million covers only a matter of a few years.  In the past 12 months, for instance, the amount of land bonds issued was roughly 1¾ millions.  With the price of land continuing to increase, to purchase the same amount of land &mdash; roughly 25,000 acres per annum &mdash; will obviously involve at that rate an increasing rather than a decreasing rate of issue for these bonds.</P>

      <P>At the same time, when the Deputy did make the point I thought it well to point out to him that there is nothing grandiose about this; it is simply an effort to avoid a situation where a further Land Bond Bill would have to be introduced in the House in a matter of two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan and other speakers also mentioned the problem of the rate of interest and, very rightly, Deputy O'Donovan asked at <Col N="1291" /> what rate of interest will the new bonds have to be issued and asked also whether it will be worth it.  These questions are very well put.  Indeed, everybody in the House is aware of the fact that, in recent years in particular, the value of money has been declining and, more important still, the cost of money has been spiralling at a fantastic rate.  Obviously, this will create very serious problems for the Land Commission in the future.  The question for the person who ultimately gets the land that is required will be whether, with the cost of money at the present time and the cost on the administrative side on top of it, it will be possible to allot land at a price that will make it attractive to a prospective farmer to accept.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not have any control over the cost of money and, for that matter, the Department of Finance have only very little control over what is, in the last analysis, not a national but an international problem. I do agree however that the State must, as various Deputies have rightly said, be just and be seen to be just in regard to the issue of bonds which depreciate and because of that fact as I have mentioned and certain other factors, will inevitably mean that the person who wishes to cash his bonds will receive less than the face value of the purchase price.  That the State never intended any injustice in this matter is clear from the fact that there is a statutory obligation to preserve the value of the bonds at or near par for a reasonable period after their issue.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy does not mind I shall answer these questions later.  I am not satisfied that <Col N="1292" /> sufficient efforts have been made to eliminate unnecessary delay over the years and I agree with those speakers who, in saying that the State must be seen to be just, also indicated their dissatisfaction with the period that elapses between the acquisition of the land and the time when the owner has the opportunity of cashing his bonds.  I shall take whatever steps are necessary as quickly as I can to reduce the time involved in the clearance of title to a maximum of three months.  I want to say equally clearly that if the Revenue Commissioners have to change their attitude in order to provide fair play for the people they will have to do that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not reasonable, at a time when money is not merely very dear but is daily becoming dearer to the point of absurdity, that an appreciable length of time should be allowed to pass while citizens' money is allowed to be frittered away before their eyes because of bureaucratic inefficiency or a bureaucratic policy of delay.  I shall go further and say that if, in 1970, this delay has not been eliminated I shall not be in this position thereafter.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I want the House to appreciate that all Governments and Ministers for Lands as well as the Land Commission down the years have been faced with the fact that one cannot produce money out of trees, that the calls on capital moneys for housing, health, education and so on result in, as Deputy Dr. O'Donovan knows &mdash; nobody better &mdash; an annual battle between various Departments as to position on the priority list.  It would be much easier, obviously, for the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands to be able to call exclusively on cash but if he were to do so it would involve the deduction of something like £2 million from the Capital Budget.  Should it be from housing, health or education or what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a reasonable and serious effort is being made over the years, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, to increase the actual cash purchase ratio.  It was pointed out on <Col N="1293" /> Second Reading that at present at £600,000 the cash purchase figure is very much higher than it had been at any time up to recently.  It is progressively becoming greater and it is certainly in marked contrast to the £20,000 provided by the last interParty Government in 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were just starting the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the amount of money spent on cash purchasing is progressively increasing and is at the highest-ever level now and also that to turn over to a policy of cash altogether would involve the extraction from the Capital Budget, at the expense of some other sector, of a minimum of £2 million a year.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should like to explain &mdash; I was asked by Deputy L'Estrange to do so &mdash; the difference between land that can be paid for in cash and that which is paid for in bonds.  Before doing so, however, I want to repudiate the suggestion, made rather to my surprise by Deputy Clinton, that cash purchase cases were cases of friends and those who were paid in land bonds were the unfavoured. It is not in character with Deputy Clinton to make this accusation which, of course, is quite groundless. As the House knows, there are two kinds of acquisition procedure, the voluntary and the compulsory. Compulsory acquisitions are those where the owners object to acquisition or if they do not object to acquisition in the first instance, subsequently disagree on price.  The statutory provision is that in these instances the lands are paid for in bonds.  Compulsory purchases represent roughly one-third of total Land Commission purchases.  The other two-thirds, which are voluntary, could all be financed out of cash if the necessary cash were available.  I have dealt with that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times when a particularly desirable property comes on the market that could not be obtained except by a cash purchase.  The Land Commission, in the exercise of their discretion, if they want the land badly enough will negotiate for cash.  I trust that this <Col N="1294" /> makes the situation clear to Deputy L'Estrange and other Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton discussed the difference between the price quoted for land bonds <i>vis-á-vis</i> Exchequer stock on the market.  I am not an expert on stock but I know that the redemption period is a factor which affects the current price of stocks.  Obviously, if the redemption date is relatively near the stock begins progressively to become more attractive and rises in price as the redemption date approaches.</P>
    <P>In recent years as well, as the House knows, each annual national loan when floated has carried with it the right that anyone who wishes to invest can hand in previous national loan stocks irrespective of their current situation on the market and have them accepted at par.  There is also the fact, mentioned by some speakers, that national loan stock is acceptable at face value for estate duty purposes and that land bonds are not.  I agree with Members of the House who say that there is no justification whatever for this discrimination against land bonds and the fact that it exists represents a blot on the escutcheon of the Department of Finance and is one which the Department of Finance should remedy forthwith.</P>
    <P>Since we now have such a distinguished and humane and fairminded Minister for Finance, I would be extremely surprised if he did not, when this situation is drawn to his personal attention here in the House, take steps to remove the discrimination against land bonds which never should have existed and which should be removed forthwith.  I have no doubt whatever that, if the interchangeability of land bonds and their acceptance for estate duty purposes at face value were to be a fact, the disparities that exist at present between national loan stock and land bonds on the stock market would be eliminated or, at any rate, very substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not think it appropriate to go in great depth into any other aspect of land bonds because, as I said at the beginning, most of the points made here have been made and answered <Col N="1295" /> time and time again annually on the Estimate for the Department of Lands and other appropriate occasions, but I think it right to point out that the majority of people who are given bonds are actually out of farming and very many of them can afford to hold on to all or most of the bonds and draw the full rate of interest each year.  Even where things like costs are concerned my own experience is that I have never bothered to cash them.  I left them there and drew my £1 6s 7d every half year, or whatever the appropriate rate of interest was, and had the feeling of security that having a few bonds in the bank would be some help when the annual half-yearly audit and reminder from the manager arrived.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I have to say on this.  I do not know whether the Opposition are so serious about this section that they intend to oppose it to the point of a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister succeeds in the action he intends taking to expedite dealings in land between the Land Commission and the vendors of land.  The Minister spoke about the efforts of the Government in trying to keep the bonds at par for as long as possible.  On the information available to us, their efforts are definitely not succeeding because, as I pointed out already, the 8 per cent bonds issued last January &mdash; and that is only six months ago &mdash; are now only 91 and the 7½ per cent bonds issued late in 1968 are now only 83.  Something drastic will have to be done by the Government to restore confidence in the value of land bonds.  I think the Minister agrees that they should have as high a reputation as our national loan stock.  Everyone will agree that it is amazing that land bonds and national loans floated by the same Government should have such different values.  They represent the same sums of money.  I hope the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, will see to it as quickly as possible that this discrimination is ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said many people can afford to hold on to the bonds and draw interest each year.  What I think <Col N="1296" /> the State should be interested in is seeing that there is justice for all sections of the community.  Many of us know large numbers of people who have suffered drastically, people who wanted &mdash; I do not want to repeat what I said before &mdash; to buy farms but who owed money and had to wait for a year or a year and a half.  I mentioned the case of the married man with a large family and because he had not got a suitable farm the Land Commission took it from him.  He wanted to purchase another but if he purchased another of the same acreage it would cost him between £3,500 and £4,000.  That is unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>I still think the Minister should make an all-out effort to pay for land by cash.  The Minister has told us that in all cases of compulsory acquisition they are paid for by land bonds, but I do not think that all the people who give their land voluntarily to the Land Commission are paid in cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <P>I want to find out how do they differentiate between people.  In what circumstances are certain people who give their land voluntarily paid in cash and others in land bonds?  Perhaps, there could be some arrangement to pay even half in cash and half in land bonds.  It is most unfair if A sells to the Land Commission and is lucky enough to be paid in cash, and, therefore, gets the full market value, while his neighbour B who also gives his farm voluntarily to the Land Commission may have to take a reduction of 10, 15 or 20 per cent in real money values inside a year.  That is unfair and unjust.  I should like to know how they differentiate between A and B, both of whom sell voluntarily to the Land Commission, but A is paid in cash and B in land bonds.  I am still not satisfied on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise to the Minister.  I was called out urgently before he was finished.  Any reasonable person has sympathy for the Minister who has inherited this awful problem.  That does not mean I am blaming his predecessor.  Not at all.  The figures are appalling.  Land <Col N="1297" /> bonds issued last year at 100 are standing at 83 and, as Deputy L'Estrange said, bonds issued in January last are now standing at 91.  Naturally we are grateful to the Minister.  He made a key statement on one aspect of the problem when he said he will attempt to reduce the delays to three months. That is the core of one part of the problem.</P>
      <P>There is another angle quite apart from the question Deputy L'Estrange raised.  The Minister said that basically this is a sound system.  So it was on the whole.  Let us take the figures from 1934 to 1960 and let us call that 25 years.  It was quite all right for 25 years but gradually over the past ten years it got worse and worse and it has gone to hell altogether over the past 18 months.  The Minister has attacked one angle of the problem.  If this tangle continues to get worse it may well be that the Minister will have no option but to abandon the system.</P>
      <P>We are grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has tackled the problem in the short period he has been Minister for Lands, and we express our appreciation of his efforts.  He still has to answer the question put by Deputy L'Estrange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the £600,000 provided by the Department of Finance for cash purchases of land covers purchases of farms under £5,000 and the Land Commission try to pay in cash for these small holdings which they can acquire at or under that figure. Obviously, there are exceptions and, equally obviously, it is the responsibility of the Land Commission to exercise discretion from time to time in regard to individual purchases as to whether or not it is appropriate to offer cash.  I do not think I can go any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. O'Donovan that in the last few years the extraordinary increase in interest rates and the cost of money have raised very grave problems in many spheres and the particularly grave problem which he mentioned and to which I adverted in my own speech in relation to its consequential effect on what the Land <Col N="1298" /> Commission have to charge farmers to allocate land to them.  It is indeed possible that in time we shall be forced to abandon the land bond system for reasons outside our control and for reasons not connected with any inherent defect in the system itself which, as the House knows, did work very satisfactorily for a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>The statutory obligation to keep the value at or near par was made at a time when reasonable stability in the cost of money was taken for granted. It becomes a very different thing when money rates of interest spiral as rapidly as they have in recent years.  All I can say is that by reducing to the absolute minimum the amount of time which elapses between acquisition and the opportunity of the vendor to cash his bonds, I shall be trying to put into effect on behalf of the State, as near as it is possible to do so in present circumstances, the object envisaged by the statute, that is, that the bonds when eventually realised should be realised at or near par by the owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not got the stability of money values we should like to see, and I am still not satisfied on two points I have raised with the Minister.  I appreciate what is the Minister's intention here but we should try to see that justice is done to these people.  One point is in regard to the operative date.  The operative date is the date the Land Commission take possession.  Because there is no stability, money is losing value rapidly. Could the Minister not change the operative date to the date of payment? What is wrong in issuing bonds at their value at the date of payment, or, alternatively by, if he could not do that, in making the bonds interchangeable as is done in the case of national loans?  If it can be done in the case of national loans why can it not be done for land bonds?  If that were done people would have confidence in land bonds and it would be much better for everybody, for public relations, and much easier to build up a pool of land. As the Minister knows, if we enter the EEC we shall be bound by other rules and regulations which may put an end to the Land Commission and the distribution of land as we know it. <Col N="1299" /> Therefore it is of the utmost importance to build up a pool of land in the next two or three years and distribute it among the people.</P>

      <P>In so far as interchangeability is concerned, I can only put the views of the Deputy to the Department of Finance.  The objection to the Deputy's other suggestion is that it would be a built-in incentive for the owner to delay the date of payment as long as possible and for that reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what is the attitude of the Government with regard to Recommendation No. 558 on the general policy of the Council of Europe which was adopted by the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe on 16th May, 1969; and whether he has instructed his Permanent Representative in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to vote in favour of the proposals contained in this recommendation.</P>

      <P>The Government supports all efforts designed to bring about the early and simultaneous opening of negotiations with the four applicant countries to full membership of the European communities.  Consequently it is in general agreement with the aims of Recommendation No. 558 of the Consultative Assembly.  With regard to paragraph 9 (c) of the recommendation it should be borne in mind that the Government is an applicant for full membership of the communities.  The Government supports the moves envisaged in paragraph 9 (d) for greater European collaboration in education, scientific research and technology, always provided that agreements in these fields would not be regarded as a substitute for the enlargement of the communities.  The Irish Representative <Col N="1253" /> in the Committee of Ministers' Deputies has been instructed accordingly.</P>
