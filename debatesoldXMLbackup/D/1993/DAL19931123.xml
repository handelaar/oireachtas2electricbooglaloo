    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 10, 42, 67 and 78 together.  I have received a pre-budget submission from the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation in which the views of the organisation on the impact of VAT and PRSI on the competitiveness of its member firms are explained in some detail.  I will bear the points made in mind in the run-up to the forthcoming budget.  However, I have indicated on a number of occasions that, for budgetary and other reasons, I do not intend to reverse my decision to place adult clothing and footwear on the standard rate of VAT.</P>
      <P>The clothing industry's submission refers to tax levels on low income workers.  The essence of the Government's tax strategy is the adoption of definite priorities and we have set these down in our programme.  In relation to income tax, we have made it very clear that our attention will focus on two goals:</P>
      <P>&mdash;firstly, alleviating the burden of taxation on workers with low incomes, particularly those with families;</P>
      <P>&mdash;secondly, raising the income threshold at which the higher rate comes into play. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> Obviously, these priorities are of particular relevance to the clothing sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's record since 1987 is tangible proof of our ongoing commitment to meaningful tax reform, pursued within responsible budgetary parameters. Very significant progress has been achieved.  Over that period, income tax rates were reduced substantially on a broad front &mdash; the standard rate being cut from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the higher rates consolidated in a single 48 per cent top rate.  Substantial improvement was also made in the exemption limits and the standard band was widened. While lesser progress was made in other areas of the income tax code, the net result was still very considerable improvement.</P>
    <P>That being said much remains to be done.  High marginal rates still affect single taxpayers &mdash; who face a marginal rate of 48 per cent on income above £10,936 &mdash; a figure somewhat lower than the average industrial wage.  The high marginal rate does not impact on married workers until they reach income above £20,786 based on a married couple with one spouse working.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the competitiveness of the clothing industry.  Under a scheme announced earlier this year the State is providing additional finance of up to £5 million to finance an initiative specifically targeted at the clothing and footwear sectors. Under this initiative the IDA is providing help to companies who can demonstrate their ability to address competitiveness in the key areas of quality, design and production processes.  In addition FÁS is providing assistance under the training support scheme.  This enables companies to address skill weaknesses which may exist with the aim of achieving the highest international standards. I urge all firms in the sector who feel that they can benefit from their scheme to contact the IDA and FÁS. Their very survival may depend on their availing of these initiatives with a view to improving their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group is currently examining the impact of <Col N="7" /> employers' PRSI rates on low-paid employment in the manufacturing sector, including clothing, and considering whether there is a need to reform the current system.  The working group includes representatives of my Department as well as officials from the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report of the working group in the very near future. The Government will consider the group's report when it becomes available in the context of the 1994 Budget.  I should point out that the employers' PRSI system will raise in the region of £1,000 million in 1994 and a reduction of 1 per cent would cost about £80 million in a full year.  Accordingly, while not wishing to pre-empt the Government's consideration of the issue, the budgetary room for manoeuvre in this area will be very constrained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the clothing sector considers he is totally out of touch with its problems and will he accept he must take his share of the blame for the 2,000 jobs lost in the clothing manufacturing sector in recent years? Will he acknowledge there is not a competitive edge to this sector when labour costs are 20 per cent higher than those in the UK and Northern Ireland and that a direct contributory factor is the double employers' PRSI rate?  In view of the special difficulties experienced by that labour intensive sector, will the Minister introduce a selective package in the budget to ensure there are no further major job losses there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, a working group has been examining for some time now the issue of the PRSI level raised by Deputy Yates.  I am glad the Deputy used the word &ldquo;selective&rdquo; because the costs involved would prohibit it from being done any other way.  I had discussions during the year with members of the clothing industry.  The discussions have been useful for my Department and <Col N="8" /> the clothing industry because we managed to focus on the difficulties of Irish manufacturers, to highlight the fact that 80 per cent of clothing sold here is imported and that 65 per cent of that manufactured is exported at a zero rate of tax.  The increases in VAT on clothing in the past few years have not helped the sector and has made it more expensive for individuals to purchase clothing and footwear.  Statistics show that for the first six months of this year sales in clothing have increased whereas sales of footwear have decreased substantially but, unfortunately, there are very few footwear manufacturers in Ireland.  Difficulties in regard to competitiveness in the sector have been highlighted in recent reports, but they are not all tax related.  The non-tax issues of design, competitiveness, quality, rates of pay and so on should be addressed urgently by the industry.  I met members of the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Association, which has recently been set up, members of IBEC and small business firms and have undertaken to examine the question raised by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept a brief question from Deputy Yates because of the time factor involved.  I am anxious to dispose of the five questions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the VAT hike from 8 per cent to 21 per cent in a short number of years has greatly depressed demand for clothing and footwear at retail level?  Instead of trying to console the sector, will the Minister give a specific commitment in regard to what he is prepared to do about PRSI and VAT so that the 30,000 people employed in the retail and manufacturing clothing sector can have an assurance they will have jobs this time next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did that there would be no point in having a budget and I am sure Deputy Yates will appreciate that. We are examining the clothing and footwear sector, but the issues of design, productivity and management must also <Col N="9" /> be to the forefront.  As I stated in my reply, since 1 August we introduced a research and development scheme through the Department of Enterprise and Employment which will assist many clothing companies.  FÁS has also undertaken training initiatives.  The Government will do its utmost to assist in that area.  I am sure Deputy Yates is aware that although we introduced the standard rate of VAT on clothing sooner than we were expected to under EC law, we would have had to introduce it within two years anyway.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 18, 26, 64, 65, 66 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>While the allocation of EC aid under the recent EC Commission decision is less than the figure on which the National Development Plan was based it still would allow for a total EC contribution of between £7 billion and £8 billion.  The allocation announced by the Commission on 21 October is indicative and is seen as a minimum figure and Commission sources have confirmed that there is every prospect that a higher figure can ultimately be achieved.  The Government is confident it will prove possible to draw down the full £7.84 billion EC aid in the period up to 1999 and on this basis it is intended that the plan will be implemented in full over the period.</P>

It would be much more honest of the Government to alter the plan to take account of the fact that it is £640 million less than provided for in it.  Will the Minister not agree that the money which the EC Commission is working towards in respect of the Community Support Framework and the operational programmes is the lower and not the higher figure?

      <P>The observations relating to alteration of documents as contained in the 1992 report of the Court of Auditors arose from the court's inspection of documents relating to one large shipment of meat.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that contrary to what is stated in the 1992 report, none of the alterations was in fact made by Customs.  Specific instructions to Customs not to alter such documents are contained in the code of operational instructions issued to Customs personnel.  Any necessary alterations to correct errors in a document presented by a trader is therefore made by the trader and is then authenticated by Customs prior to final acceptance of the document by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that it is stated in the report of the Court of Auditors that it has been difficult to verify the validity of the changes?  While the Minister has suggested that changes are now made by Customs officials it is suggested in the report that payments were made on foot of those export forms without first verifying the validity of the changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. While the changes are made by the trader they are authenticated by Customs.  I should point out that 50,000 forms are processed.  What happened in this case was that the trader decided to cancel and replace the document because it had been altered.  However, when he later presented the amended document to Customs they queried it.  Apparently, 196 declarations were made in the document relating to the shipment of one product. <Col N="14" /> In order to facilitate the trader Customs agreed to accept the document so long as it was stamped and endorsed by the trader to the effect that it had not been cancelled.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they do not accept that the alterations gave rise to confusion. When the report of the Court of Auditors is discussed by the committee in due course the Revenue Commissioners will have to explain what actually happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that the Court of Auditors failed to understand what the Minister has now explained, that no official had any hand, act or part in this matter?  It is stated in the report that in some instances the form was altered three or four times and that some of the forms were not stamped.  It seems that the process has broken down as compared with what the Court of Auditors would regard as effective due process.  Is any action being taken to ensure that the procedures are tightened up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Court of Auditors only made reference to this matter in its report but I accept that we should make sure that the changes are correct.  What often happens is that export companies change the documentation to ensure the consignment complies with the licence. If they decide to do this it would be preferable to rewrite the forms and present a clean copy.  What happened in this case was that an amended version was presented.  As 196 declarations were made the trader crossed some things out to get the numbers to add up.  It would be far better if traders started again and re-wrote the form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point on which the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry take issue with the Court of <Col N="15" /> Auditors.  While I cannot vouch for all 50,000 forms it is clear in this case that Customs asked the trader to state clearly that the form was not withdrawn or cancelled and was therefore eligible.  We will have to argue this point when the report of the Court of Auditors is discussed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the total amount paid by the banks in bank levies and corporation tax for 1992; the estimated amount for 1993; if these are adequate in view of the record profits now being made by the main banking groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of Irish corporation tax and bank levy paid by the commercial banks in 1992 was £75.5 million.  This does not include receipts from the section 84 levy in respect of which the banks act as collection agents only.</P>
      <P>Apart from the yield of £36 million from the bank levy, it is not possible to supply corresponding figures for 1993 at this time.  It should also be remembered that the banks pay significant amounts of overseas tax as well as Irish corporation tax.</P>
      <P>The 1992 tax and levy figures compare favourably with the position in recent years and indicate that the tax yield from the banking sector is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, apart from the impact of the profitability of the banks themselves on the tax yield, a whole series of measures designed to increase the yield have been introduced in recent years.  Of particular significance in this regard have been: the restrictions which have been placed on section 84 lending which have greatly reduced the volume and scope of such <Col N="17" /> lending and thereby resulted in an increased tax yield from the banks, the abolition of most accelerated capital allowances and their replacement with standard wear and tear allowances of 15 per cent per annum &mdash; this has greatly reduced the tax loss arising from the use of such allowances by financial institutions generally, both as regards their own investment and in their leasing activities; the abolition of the special corporation tax rate of 35 per cent which applied to the profits of mortgage business undertaken by the banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>The bank levy, which was first introduced in 1981 as a direct response to the low level of corporation tax paid by the banks, was increased in 1988 from £25 million to £36 million and has remained at that level since that time.  As the Deputy knows, new arrangements were introduced for the bank levy last year, which will continue in force up to next year. These new arrangements protect the position of the Exchequer while assisting the competitive position of the Irish banks in the post-1992 EC banking market by giving them an incentive to pay extra corporation tax so as to offset their levy payments.  These new arrangements involve a minimum corporation tax threshold which is indexed in line with the increase in a bank's profitability since the threshold date.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, I am satisfied that over time an increasing proportion of bank profits have, and are, being exposed to tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a substantial proportion of the amount raised by way of the levy on profits is paid by Irish business?  Is he satisfied that the Irish consumer is being ripped off to such an extent that it takes on the proportions of a national scandal having regard to the charges imposed by the banks?  Does the Minister propose to do anything about this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the powers in relation to charges are contained <Col N="18" /> in the 1989 Central Bank Act but I have availed of every opportunity to raise this issue, in particular the A, AA and AAA categories, with bankers.  I can assure the Deputy that I have had meetings with the banks directly involved and also with the Central Bank.  I also had an opportunity recently to raise all these issues at the annual dinner of the Bankers' Institute.  Since we raised those issues the banks have become quite competitive, particularly in regard to the AA category which includes small businesses and farmers, and that has been very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the controversy in relation to charges recently has related to one bank, so it is unfair to generalise. In the last few years there has not been competition, and this has not all been the fault of the banks involved.  Recently, in an eight-day period, one bank dropped interest rates by 0.25 per cent in the AA category.  Two days later another bank dropped interest rates by 0.5 per cent. Two days later there was another drop of 0.75 per cent, followed by a further drop of 1 per cent over the weekend.  Subsequently another bank dropped interest rates by a further 0.25 per cent.  This certainly indicates that competition has at last commenced.  As to whether I am totally satisfied that there is enough competition, the answer is no.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Flanagan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that voluntary hospice foundations throughout the State are liable for VAT on certain equipment and the valuable work of such associations on behalf of the terminally ill, he will exempt hospice foundations from VAT.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospitals and hospices are exempt from VAT under the terms of the Sixth EC VAT Directive which, in turn, governs our national VAT regime. In the medical area, exempt status applies whether the bodies involved are funded publicly or through voluntary efforts.  Exemption means that, while these organisations have the advantage of not having to charge VAT on the services they provide, by the same token they cannot recover the VAT on the goods and services which they buy in the course of their activities, including the construction of facilities.  Generally speaking, VAT is only recoverable by VAT-registered traders who operate in the course or furtherance of business.</P>
      <P>However, under the VAT Act, I have the power to make refund orders to provide for a refund of tax, subject to whatever conditions may be considered necessary in relation to particular schemes.  In fact, hospices may benefit under one such order, Refund Order No. 23, which gives a full refund of the VAT borne on high-cost medical equipment which is purchased by means of voluntary subscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> I would point out that an extension of the refund mechanism to cover all hospice expenditure would have to apply, at the very least, to hospitals and to other similar organisations assisting the seriously ill or handicapped.  In addition, it would give rise, quite understandably, to pressure to extend the concession to charities generally.  The Deputy will appreciate that even if such a concession were confined to hospices and hospitals, the cost in terms of VAT foregone to the Exchequer would, quite simply, be prohibitive and could not be contemplated in current budgetary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government fully acknowledges the valuable contribution that organisations such as the hospices make to society in general and I would point to the fact that many of them are in receipt of lottery and health board funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, I cannot accept his contention.  I put it to the Minister that it is both possible and practical for his Department to extend Refund Order No. 23 having regard to the non-profit making and non-commercial work of hospice foundations throughout the State. He could make an exception in this case on the basis of the specific and exceptional nature of the work undertaken by the hospice foundation which is not undertaken by any other voluntary group.  This is work that should be carried out by the State but it is now being organised on a voluntary basis in every health board region.  It would be quite easy for the Minister to give an exemption from value added tax in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Flanagan that the medical and hospital services provided by hospices are exceptional.  Refund Order No. 23, as liberally applied, is of assistance to them but it does not cover buildings which is a major issue in at least three locations that I am aware of.  If I were to change the VAT system in relation to hospices, I would have to take in many other organisations that have also made rep <Col N="21" /> resentations to me and who are also undertaking work which would be undertaken by the State if it could afford to do so.  I have endeavoured to assist all these agencies as fairly as I can.  The criterion is that an item of equipment must be worth in excess of £20,000 to qualify for exemption from VAT.  Less expensive items are ruled out.  I will certainly see if there is anything more I can do in that area, although I am not sure I can deal with it in the way suggested by the Deputy.  I assure the House that it does not give me much pleasure to take a hard line on hospices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospice care is peculiar in that, although it is extremely expensive, it is available free of charge to anyone in the State who needs it.  It is fundamentally unjust that a voluntary hospice group should face a VAT liability bill of the order of £215,000 in respect of a building.  I ask the Minister to allow an exemption in these circumstances.</P>

They do not charge VAT on any service so they cannot reclaim VAT.  There are many other organisations in that position, for example, groups working with people who suffer from multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy etc.  An exemption for one would have to mean an exemption for all, which would be very expensive.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he will look at that area once again.  As chairman of a hospice I can fully understand the question raised by Deputy Flanagan.  The equipment for this area of care is expensive and I ask the Minister to consider allocating money for the specific area of hospice care which deals with the terminally ill.  Last week £3,000 was paid for a pegasus mattress, which was required for the terminally ill. The area of hospice care is a specific one and I am pleased the Minister will consider it as such.</P>

      <P>In drawing up the National Development Plan, the Government was determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted would promote balanced regional development and the Government is satisfied that the strategy set out in the <Col N="23" /> plan will achieve this.  The plan shows that a very substantial amount of money, £1.5 billion, will be spent in the south-east sub-region.  This will play a significant role in promoting the development of the sub-region.  In addition many of the expenditures outside the sub-region will also benefit the area, such as transport developments leading to and from the sub-region.</P>

      <P>The distribution of moneys is anything but balanced.  While 11 per cent of the population live in the South East region it receives only 9 per cent of the allocated Structural Funds.

An amount of £120 million has been allocated for improvements to the Sligo road and a greater amount for the Limerick road. Would the Minister regard that as a balanced position?  Will she indicate why the south-east region has not received a fair allocation of the Structural Funds?</P>

      <P>The Structural Funds are allocated on the basis of programmes, not on the basis of regions.  The funds are allocated under the different headings of direct investment in job creation in the industrial area.  The figures in the plan in relation to particular sub-regions on the industry side are indicative of that.  For example, in the sphere of word processing, the Waterford area has secured the major Louisiana Pacific oriented strand board plant and, therefore Waterford will be in a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to draw down moneys under the inward investment section of the Structural Funds.  Regarding the industry programme, the allocation made depends on the products involved.  That must be indicative of the share of Structural Funds among different regions.  Waterford, or the south-east region generally, will be in a position to draw moneys under the industries programme if it can develop industrial projects on the indigenous industry side or attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The headage payments, which are part of the FEOGA funds and also part of the Structural Funds, affect the nominal share of funds for the south-east region. If headage payments were classified under the FEOGA funds which are not part of the Structural Funds, the figures would be somewhat different.  The type of farming carried out in the south-east does not qualify for headage payments to the same extent as that carried out in areas of the west and north-west and that distorts the nominal figures.  I would not accept that £1.5 billion is a nominal sum. In the past the Government invested substantial money in the development of the Bellview terminal in Waterford, the benefits of which will come on stream for the south-east region.  At present we are investing in the Arklow by-pass which will benefit those travelling on the coast road to Wexford and Waterford through New Ross.  I travelled that road yesterday to meet people in Waterford to discuss this issue.  I would not accept that the south-east is being ignored.  On the basis of the quality of the proposals put forward by the south-east, the region will be able to draw down a fair share of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the advent of the Louisiana Pacific industry, a major timber industry and the development of the Bellview port, but nothing has been done to improve the infrastructure to serve the port and the industries.  A proper road to Waterford and a second bridge over the River Suir is needed.  Not one shilling has been allocated in the plan for such development. <Col N="25" /> Does the Minister appreciate that there will be massive bottlenecks on the bridge in Waterford and on the approach routes to the city?</P>

      <P>The roads programme outlined in the National Plan is currently being examined by my colleagues, the Minister for Transport and Tourism and the Minister for the Environment. They are considering the detail of how funding will be allocated.  We were able to illustrate some of the routes that will be covered in the plan.  There will be additional expenditure in relation to some projects which have not yet been identified or subjected to the cost benefit analysis.  Work on routes outside the south east region will also benefit that region.  For example, at present money is being spent on the Kilcullen link road which is outside the region, but is on the Dublin to the south east route.  The roads programme has been decided on the basis of work carried out during the last number of years by the then An Foras Forbartha, now the Environmental Research Unit of the Department of the Environment.  It carried out a series of cost benefit studies on the national primary and secondary routes and identified the major bottleneck areas in the country. We are engaged in a programme through which it is intended that by the year 2005 those bottlenecks will be eliminated thereby ensuring that traffic can travel on the national primary routes at a speed of 50 to 55 miles per hour.  That programme is proceeding at an even pace.  The projects which will receive priority under the Structural Funds are what may be termed &ldquo;the next worst bottleneck areas&rdquo; which have scored highest on the cost benefit indicators.  In the course of that programme it is hoped that the Waterford area and other areas of the south-east region will be well served by the development of modern infrastructure including a roads system.</P>

The Minister has been assisted in this regard by comprehensive cost benefit studies of different routes which have been carried out in respect of programmes under the Structural Funds.</P>

Will the Minister justify why the Rosslare-Dublin rail link has not been subject to EC co-financing while virtually every other rail link from Dublin to other areas is so financed?  A figure of £5.5 million has been allocated for coastal erosion. The protection scheme in Rosslare for which there has been a wait of 20 years for the go ahead could use all that money. Will the Minister give a commitment that Rosslare will be the primary project for that coastal protection expenditure?</P>

      <P>The allocations in the National Development Plan were based on programmes.  The Department of Finance allocated moneys to the different programmes identified in the plan. Such programmes include, for example, the areas of human resources, the industries programme, the national resources programme, the transport programme and the local development programme. Within these programmes the Departments, as experts in these fields, draw up, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, detailed proposals as to how the money will be spent.  The Department of the Marine is examining the provision for coastal erosion and will determine its priorities within that provision.  Similarly, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, an expert in the transport area, decides on funding of the rail service.  The plan provides for the highest allocation ever made to public transport.  It is very much an environmentally and rail friendly plan.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has identified specific road projects for funding.  If Deputy Yates wishes to pursue the detail of the choices being made in these areas he should table questions to the Department of of the Marine and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  The Minister gave substantial replies to queries about funds and said that she took into consideration the requests from review groups.  However, there was no mention of competition.  Was there competition for funds between the south-west, west and mid-west, or was there a blanket decision by the Minister and the Department? Will the Minister accept total <Col N="30" /> responsibility for this plan and confirm that she made the decision in the case of each programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already explained, the national plan was drawn up on the basis of national programmes and a global figure was decided for industry. The regional share-out of the industry programme will depend on the regional distribution of projects eligible for funding.  Under the programme for transport, the division of the transport budget was decided between national primary routes, national secondary routes and link roads and, at the request of this House, the other House and the sub-regional review bodies, substantial investment was made in the country road network. The details of the programmes are matters for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>A decision was also made on a national programme for agriculture.  Again the regional distribution of funding in this area depends on the number of farms eligible for funding.  The type of farming carried out in the south-east is such that fewer farmers are eligible for headage payments in that area.</P>
      <P>In relation to sanitary services, a budget was specified, particularly in terms of the Cohesion Fund.  The Minister for the Environment has responsibility for deciding the detailed projects in that area in line with the criteria laid down by Brussels.  Money is allocated on the basis of individual decisions in the various Departments and the decision is not made on a specific regional share-out. The Department of Finance has responsibility for the overall distribution between programmes rather than between regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy De Rossa on 7 October last, I gave details of statistics of the average income tax payments by PAYE workers, farmers and the self-employed.  I presume it is these statistics to which the Deputy is referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the figures given in reply to that parliamentary question gave the tax take in respect of farming profits.  It did not include PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have <Col N="32" /> been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1990-91, the latest available, indicates that some £33 million in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>The reduction in income tax yield on farming profits since 1989 is mainly attributable to a fall in farm incomes in two years in succession, 1990 and 1991. A recovery in farm profits only became evident in 1992.  This is borne out in revised figures published by the Central Statistics Office in late July of this year for income from self-employment and other trading income of the agricultural sector. The current estimates of the CSO are for a fall of 1.6 per cent in 1990 profits as compared with the corresponding 1989 earnings, a further fall in 1991 over 1990 of 8.9 per cent and a recovery in 1992 over 1991 of 19 per cent.  This recovery is reflected in the increase in farmers' taxation in 1992 over 1991.</P>
    <P>However, the income tax yield of £36 million in 1991 included a fall of approximately £5 million due to the deferral of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the current year basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  This amount was included in the yield of £48 million for 1992.  When the distorting effect of the 1990-91 balances is excluded for comparative purposes, the average yield <i>per capita</i> from farmers' taxation in 1992 increased by about 18 per cent over the 1991 average.</P>
    <P>With regard to steps taken to ensure a fair tax return from the farming sector, in common with other self-employed taxpayers, farmers are subject to the various compliance and audit arrangements which apply under the self-assessment system.  As from 1992 a percentage of new cases selected for audit are chosen on a random basis.  Revenue audit activity increased in 1992 and was further intensified in 1993 with a significant increase in staff and a reorganisation of audit activity in tax offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The figures referred to in <Col N="33" /> Deputy De Rossa's question are the figures given to the House by the Minister on the last occasion this issue was raised. We cannot continue to accept a situation where the amount paid by the PAYE worker is five times more than the average amount paid by a farmer.  I accept that some farmers are on low incomes, but we are talking about average figures which have been compiled by the Minister's Department.  The Minister said that the tax take from workers increased by 17 per cent between 1989 and 1992 while the tax take from farmers decreased by 19 per cent during the same period.  Does the Minister intend to take any additional measures to introduce greater equity into the tax code, thus eliminating the disparity between what is paid by the farming community on the one hand and what is paid by PAYE workers on the other?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to small business people is similar.  There has to be equity in the system.  We have endeavoured to promote the farm profile scheme with the co-operation of the farming organisations.  We made it a priority both last year and this year to ensure that the self-assessment system was working properly.  Some difficulties still exist in terms of properly operating the PRSI and RSI aspects of the system, which will come into effect early in the new year, in the agricultural sector.  The self-assessment system is now operating more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same principle of self-assessment applies to farmers &mdash; a person earning a certain income has to pay tax.  The self-assessment system is crucial in terms of compiling data on the number of farmers who should be paying tax.  I gave data to Deputy De Rossa on the last occasion he raised this question and I am glad of the opportunity today to clarify the position and give the full figures so that there can be no argument about them.  The Deputy is making the point that the average figure for farmers is still much lower than it should be.  In 1992 &mdash; I do not have the full data for 1993 &mdash; the number of farmers assessed for tax was approximately <Col N="34" /> 69,000 and the number liable for tax was 27,000.  The Deputy referred to the average figures I gave on the last occasion.  The estimated amount which will be paid by farmers in PRSI in 1993 is £13 million.  This figure is still rather low.  Both the Revenue Commissioners and I, as Minister for Finance, have to ensure that the system is enforced in such a way that it is fair to all categories of self-employed people, including farmers.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made recently to alleged pay increases in the public and private sectors.  Does the Minister understand the plight of the average PAYE worker who pays five times as much tax as farmers and who has heard announcements by the Government of a 15 per cent increase in incomes for farmers last year and a projected increase of 20 per cent in their incomes for this year?  Has the Minister read the speech last week by the Governor of the Central Bank, a speech which has attracted much attention for the remarks on one page?  Did he read the section of Mr. Doyle's speech relating to tax reform and his belief that the tax wedge cannot be tackled unless the burden of taxation is spread and the base is broadened?  He specifically singled out farmers for not paying their fair share of tax.  What is the Minister's response to that speech?</P>

The current estimates of the CSO in regard to the farming community, which are not relevant to other sections of the community, are for a decrease of 1.6 per cent in 1990 profits as compared with the corresponding 1989 earnings, a further decrease in 1991 over 1990 of 8.9 per cent and a recovery in 1992 over 1991 of 19 per cent.

      <P>My question is purely statistical. Average figures can be somewhat misleading and can be played different ways.  With regard to farmers' incomes and the amount of tax paid by farmers, is the figure divided by the total number of farmers, the total number of farmers with a taxable income or those farmers on social welfare who do not have a taxable income?

      <P>Will the Minister agree that these statistics are frightening from the point of view of wealth produced in the economy and that there are fewer people in the farming and agricultural community liable for tax?  The Minister indicated that 69,000 farmers have been assessed for tax purposes, but only 27,000 of those pay tax and they are the only people who contributed to the figure the Minister mentioned earlier.  Will the Minister also accept that there is a cyclical nature to farmers' earnings, that this is not a sheltered sector and that other contributions are being made?  Does the Minister have any indication of the levies and contributions being paid by the various sectors of the economy to which the agricultural community must contribute?</P>

      <P>That was the point I made in my lengthy reply, that it would not be just a straight assessment figure and, in fairness to the farmers, I included the other figures.  They do not increase the total figure substantially but they increase it.  I believe the figure was £33 million for 1993 and the figure for PRSI is £13 million.  Therefore, we have included as many of the figures as we possibly can.  I agree that a relatively <Col N="37" /> small number of farmers are liable for tax.</P>

      <P>I am precluded by EC law from allowing health boards to register for VAT.  Under the EC Sixth VAT Directive, the activities carried out by health boards are either non-taxable or exempt for VAT purposes.  This means that health boards have the advantage of not having to charge VAT on the goods and services that they supply, but by the same token, they are not entitled to recover the VAT borne on the goods and services they purchase.  I should add that this fact is taken into account in the level of Exchequer funding provided.  Generally speaking, VAT is only recoverable by registered businesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to introduce a tax free allowance of the kind proposed by the Deputy.  My reluctance to introduce such an allowance springs not simply from the cost of implementing such a proposal, which would be quite substantial, but also because it would be bound to generate many cognate claims from other taxpayers arising out of their various personal and domestic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that tax relief is available on income covenanted to children aged 18 years or over.  This enables a parent to obtain tax relief on part of his or her income convenanted in favour of a child or children 18 years or over subject to an overall limit of 5 per cent of the convenantor's income.  Since the lowering of the age of majority in 1985 from 21 to 18 the cost to the Exchequer of <Col N="38" /> tax relief on covenants has risen from less than £4 million pounds to over £30 million pounds a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that 80 per cent of the entire tax take comes from the PAYE sector which gets nothing in return, no medical cards and no grants, will the Minister agree it is disproportionate and unfair that that sector receives only 30 per cent of the higher education grants?  Will the Minister also agree that he confirmed in the House today, for example, that £30 million is the figure in terms of tax relief from convenants &mdash; in fact the figure is actually £33 million?  On the same day the Minister gave that figure the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, stated; &ldquo;Free third level education for all would cost the Exchequer £45 million&rdquo;.  Therefore, we are only talking about a differential of £15 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins is aware, an expert advisory group set up by the Minister is currently examining the terms of eligibility for higher education grants to recommend the appropriate criteria. I believe a previous report on that was published some years ago which stated that wealth &mdash; not just income &mdash; should be taken into account.  The recommendation did not change in that case but these issues are being examined again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that should be taken into account is that State expenditure on third level education, apart from the tax purpose, is quite high.  Deputies will accept that the figures of £33 million is an indication that most people are operating the system.  The figure was previously £22 million and it has increased by £11 million in a very short period.  The gross expenditure on the third level sector has increased from £238 million in 1989 to £356 million this year.  Already the Exchequer funds 65 per cent of the expenditure of the higher education colleges and 95 per cent of the expenditure of the regional technical colleges.  Therefore, every student attending third level, <Col N="39" /> regardless of whether they are eligible for a grant, is receiving a significant subsidy from the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothwithstanding what the Minister says, does he not feel any sense of obligation in this regard? Does he not recall that this time last year his colleague, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, promised explicity that as and from 1994 Fianna Fáil in office in Coalition would offer free third level education?  Indeed, not to be outdone, its Labour bedfellows promised that higher education grants would be based on net rather than gross income.  Does the Minister not realise that for thousands of middle income families the task of putting their children through third level education is a savage imposition and that some gesture should be made in terms of giving interim relief by way of tax free allowances?  The study group to which the Minister referred is the same study group set up by previous Ministers for Education, Deputies Séamus Brennan, O'Rourke and Davern except that it now has a different name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different group. There has been only one other group and I think the 1989 election prevented it dealing with the points made in the report.  The Deputy is probably saying that if we did away with the convenanted money and introduced the scheme the other way, it would resolve the problem but many families have two or three children in third level education.  For example, if a family has two children in third level education the covenant system works extremely well.</P>

      <P>Apart from scholarships, remittance, maintenance, minor scholarship schemes and grant schemes, an additional £50 million &mdash; apart from the other moneys I have already mentioned &mdash; has been allocated to that category.

A total of £50 million is <Col N="40" /> being allocated in direct grants, a sum of £33 million, increasing every year, is going into covenants in addition to the £356 million allocated in direct aid.  I realise the numbers seeking third level education are increasing but the State's expenditure on education is also increasing dramatically.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Browne's argument is valid but I would like to see this report completed because, within the £50 million already allocated, there may be areas where moneys could be used to help the very people to whom Deputy Browne referred.  I am sure that successive Governments over the past five or six years who talked about setting up this commission did so for a very good reason.  We must wait and see whether some of the £50 million in grants can be reallocated.  The point I would make is that there is a great deal of money allocated for this purpose.  Others might argue that we should do away with covenanted income but I have not done that in the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to this plea.  Deputy Boylan said there were some people perhaps just £1,000 above the eligibility limit.  For example, one of my neighbours was £26 only above the limit and was not considered under any circumstances with the result that he <Col N="41" /> and his family are under enormous pressure to maintain their two sons in college. This cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.  There is now a new category of poor in our society.  Those on social welfare can obtain some benefits, they may be able to use the system better than those on PAYE, while the latter category cannot avoid the relevant bands in any circumstances.  There should be some flexibility.  Would the Minister agree that one effective way of doing this would be through the provision of tax benefits?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody, including Deputy Crawford, talks about those who are hard pressed.  In the full financial year of 1992 we widened the net substantially when it rose by 40 per cent in the case of low and middle-income families. Members will agree that a rise of 40 per cent in the income threshold for Higher Education Authority grants was very significant. I do not know what categories gained but certainly that must have helped many people.  We should await the outcome of the deliberations of this review body and then we should be in a position to ascertain whether the moneys being spent on direct aid are fair and also whether moneys being spent on covenanted income is fair.  I remind the House that, between the two, almost £85 million, which is a great deal of money, is being expended on third-level education.</P>

      <P>When comparing covenanted income and the cost of that concession to the Exchequer, in expenditure on higher education and on fees, will the Minister indicate what percentage of covenanted income goes to third-level students because I think a considerable proportion goes to dependent relatives and the like who do not fall into this category?  Would he also agree that, when I was last acquainted with the relevant figures, approximately 2 per cent or less of university places in higher education went to children of working class families in our society?  Will the Minister bear in mind that a proposal to narrow the tax base, which is suggested here, may not work out in favour of those who <Col N="42" /> most need help in gaining access to higher education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the point Deputy McDowell has made on the last issue, that one must await assessment of who is gaining and benefiting.  I have not got the relevant figures with me but they were given recently in reply to a parliamentary question.  When the figure of £4 million obtained, much of it went to dependent relatives and that has remained fairly static.  However, in recent years all of the increased expenditure has been accounted for by covenanted educational expenditure.  I have not the relevant breakdown; if the Deputy needs it I will have it supplied to him, but I can assure him that it is expended mostly for educational purposes.  I suggest that we await the outcome of the report initiated by the Minister for Education.  With regard to what the Deputy said about people in working class areas, I might reminded him that I introduced the 40 per cent income threshold in an effort to redress that balance.  However, on the basis of recent statistics, I am not so sure it has altered that balance very much.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the category of people with which we are most concerned are those whose income is just barely above the eligibility threshold, yet is not sufficient to allow them pay £3,000 or £4,000 annually to fund students at college?  Would the Minister agree that covenanted income is of much greater benefit to those on higher incomes than those in receipt of incomes just barely above the threshold which means that the people whose need is greatest benefit least from the scheme the Minister introduced?  Will he accept that what is proposed in this question would be of much greater benefit to those whose need is greatest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were the case the figures would not add up because £50 million was expended on direct grants <Col N="43" /> and the maintenance subsidy.  The overall scheme should cost between £40 million and £45 million.  I will endeavour to verify the covenanted figure but I think it is of the order of £30 million.  We should first address the criteria and there may then be avenues open to us to target what we are losing on the covenanted income aspect.  I do not argue against those people who say that, perhaps, covenanted income constitutes absolutely the wrong way of doing this, that it should be scrapped.  We must remember that there may be families who will have two students in higher level education, costing £7,000 for a full year in some cases, for example in the case of a student in the veterinary or pharmacy faculties.  I am not too sure that covenanted income constitutes the best or fairest method of assisting them.  I have an open mind; we are expending the money.  I agree with Members generally that we should target that expenditure at those in genuine need.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the average rate of VAT on newspapers sold within the European Union is 3.5 per cent, those in the UK are zero rated and ours carry a rate of 12.5 per cent?  Does this account for the 25 per cent decrease in sales of Irish newspapers over the past 11 years?  Given our close proximity to the United Kingdom does that not make it very difficult <Col N="44" /> for Irish newspapers to compete with their foreign counterparts?  Would the Minister agree that he should be helping the newspaper industry to compete on equal terms with foreign newspapers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I helped the newspaper industry in a big way this year in the Finance Act when, as Opposition spokespersons will recall, we extended the 10 per cent corporation tax rate to all newspaper revenue for accounting periods ending on or after 1 April 1992.  Deputy Fitzgerald is correct in saying that historically VAT rates have been very low in a number of EC countries but I should point out that, under the Sixth VAT Directive 1 January 1991 was taken as the operative date.  We could not revert to a zero rate; we would have to strike a rate higher than 5 per cent.  Frankly, we are not in a position to do so; indeed, we have to use such funds for many other purposes of which Deputy Yates reminded me earlier.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clarify the issue of imported newspapers I should say that newspapers imported from the United Kingdom constitute a major problem for ours.  Even though such newspapers are zero rated in the United Kingdom once sold on the streets of the Republic they are subjected to a VAT rate of 12.5 per cent.  When introducing the 10 per cent corporation tax rate change I went into this issue in great detail with the newspaper industry here who face a continuing and growing threat from imported newspapers.  The reason is the economy of scale, bearing in mind these printing manufacturing units who merely run off another 20,000 or 30,000 additional copies for the Republic of Ireland.  One must bear in mind the economy of scale when selling to a population of 50 million people which allows that to be done.  My initiative on the revised tax on manufacturing will help.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that much of the traditional newspaper <Col N="45" /> industry here is caught in a pincer movement between advertising revenues through the medium of television, on RTE and ITV, and, on the other hand, very cheap, imported tabloid newspapers which means they are losing revenue on both sides?  I wish to remind the Minister that one of his predecessors, former Deputy MacSharry introduced a special concession, <i>vis-à-vis</i> another form of VAT on knowledge, for books, periodicals and so on.  Would the Minister consider some restructuring of the VAT code, examining all indirect taxes, with a view to giving some support to employment in the newspaper industry, particularly the provincial press?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made the same point I made earlier, that the problem for advertising is clearly evident with more and more advertising being carried on local radio at cheaper rates. But, in any endeavour to reduce the rate, one would have to strike a rate somewhere in excess of 5 per cent which would also have to be extended to other categories subjected to the 12.5 per cent.  It would be better to target any reduction at manufacturing reliefs.  We have taken a step in that direction and next year we will ascertain how that assisted them, although I think it does help them enormously. The only disadvantage is that if you are losing money the relief on profits is not of benefit.  We will have to wait and see how this works out.  It is certainly beneficial to newspapers in profit.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point that the changes in the budget were helpful.  However, as sales of Irish newspapers have declined, sales of British newspapers have increased, from 499,000 in 1985 to 560,000 in 1992.  In Ireland 90 per cent of the population read daily and Sunday newspapers.  One in four daily newspapers is English and one in three Sunday newspapers is now published in Britain.  The industry strongly believes that the VAT rate &mdash; because it led to price rises &mdash; is one of the main reasons for the Irish newspaper industry not being able to compete with the British <Col N="46" /> daily newspapers.  I note from an earlier response to the Minister that VAT on newspapers in 1992 amounted to £17 million. I put it to the Minister that the damage to the newspaper sector and the losses in terms of circulation and sales are major problems for the industry and skills are being lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 14 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>VAT returns are not completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular goods or services to be identified.  From available non-Revenue data, it is estimated that the VAT yield from scientific research equipment used in university laboratories is of the order of £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the suggested introduction of a zero rate of VAT on scientific research equipment, I must advise the Deputy that it would not be possible to do so.  Under the EC VAT Rates Directive, <Col N="48" /> it is not open to member states to introduce new zero rates.  Furthermore, as the items in question are not on the list of goods and service in the directive to which a reduced rate may be applied, and as they were not in a reduced rate here on 1 January 1991, it would not be possible for Ireland to apply a reduced rate to them, even on a temporary basis. Thus, the standard rate of VAT must continue to be applied.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that, under the terms of a special refund scheme, a refund is given equivalent to the full amount of VAT borne on certain high cost medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations for use in hospitals, including equipment used in their laboratories.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is provision under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities whereby institutions of the EC are entitled to recover any VAT charged to them on foot of purchases for their official use.  For example, where a research contract is carried out commercially for an EC institution, such contracts are, in effect, zero-rated.  It should be noted that the relief is allowable only where the expenditure is borne directly by the EC institutions but it would, of course, apply to any equipment directly purchased in the course of a research project.  The relief does not apply to expenditure borne directly by a university or other non-taxable body carrying out contract works for the EC since these bodies do not charge VAT and are not entitled to recover the VAT element in any expenditure borne by them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the possible implication in the Deputy's question that Ireland may be seriously out of line with the VAT treatment of scientific research equipment in other OECD countries, particularly having regard to the rules in operation within the European Community, which represents half the membership of the OECD I have requested inquiries to be made to find out precisely how scientific research equipment is treated for VAT purposes in the other member states of the European Community <Col N="49" /> and in other OECD countries.  As soon as I get that data I will consult the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to make some arrangement to allow funding of £3.3 million, which comes into this country from the Wellcome Trust for Irish scientists &mdash; at present Wellcome Trust is supporting 20 projects throughout the country &mdash; which is spent on scientific research equipment to be zero rated?  The reason I ask is that I understand Wellcome Trust is concerned that it has to pay VAT here whereas in the United Kingdom when it provides funds for a British scientist it does not pay VAT.  This is a matter of grave concern to the point where, I understand, it is considering withdrawing from funding Irish research.  That would be a very undesirable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish beneficiaries of the Wellcome Trust have written to me and others recently.  They pointed out there are provisions in the UK VAT law which allow the same equipment the trust is funding here to be zero rated in limited circumstances &mdash; I do not have the details.  Our scheme comes under the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities.  It was stated that some of these projects are EC funded.  If that is the case and if the EC are controlling them, there is a way of handling it.  Alternatively, there is the scheme to which I referred earlier in reply to Deputy Flanagan regarding the hospice.  I will endeavour to obtain the data on how this scheme is operated.  As I understand it Wellcome Trust spends huge sums of money in university institutions in Ireland.  Based on the EC Directive it should not be on the zero rate but obviously it has found some mechanism for dealing with that.  I have already asked for the data and when I receive it I shall examine it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The development measures in the National Development Plan together with the necessary domestic policies should lead to a significant acceleration in the pace of job creation. Over the plan period it is estimated that about 200,000 jobs will be created in industry, services, natural resource sectors and construction.  The plan details where these jobs will be created.  Many of these jobs will be permanent and many more will be sustained during the period of the plan.  In addition, many thousands of jobs which would otherwise be under threat will be protected by the measures in the plan.  These jobs will translate into net non-agricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 over the period of the plan depending on the level of wage competitiveness improvement achieved and the strength of the growth in the world economy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the targets set out in the plan are reasonable.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State explain how the net target figure for employment is 20,000 better than the Taoiseach's minimum which I understood was 50,000?  I cannot give the details but I recall it and could get it from the record for the Minister.  How does the Government arrive at the supposition that the shortfall in funding will not impact on the net employment target?  I have heard the Minister respond that she is confident we will get all the money.  Is she confident that we will get all the money in constant 1993 prices or its equivalent? Does she accept the contention made in the recent speech by the Governor of the Central Bank that up to half the causes for the increase in unemployment can be found in domestic policy failures, such as tax policy and welfare <Col N="51" /> traps?  To what extent will the Government address this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last part of the Deputy's question, that arises from a paper given by a delegate of the Central Bank, Mr. Browne.  I think a paper presented by Barry and Bradley, which does not give quite the same figures, is a better specified model.  Certainly, domestic policies have contributed in part to the increase in unemployment but world factors and our demographic pattern have contributed also.  There are 25,000 more people currently coming on to the labour market having left school than are retiring and that situation is likely to continue for the next ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;our forecast is that net non-agricultural employment will expand by between 12,000 to 14,000 persons per year.  Our employment performance can improve but it will depend on our wage competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trading partners.  Estimates based on the Department of Finance economic model is that for every 1 per cent improvement in competitiveness we can achieve an extra 4,000 jobs at home from spending under the National Development Plan. It is important to say that this variable is under our control.  The effectiveness of the plan in achieving its employment targets will depend on the extent to which we discipline ourself on incomes over the period of the plan to ensure that we get the best long term value from investments made under the plan.  That depends very much on ourselves and whether we are prepared to ensure that we get maximum value.</P>
      <P>The achievement of the job targets will depend on the situation in Europe.  It is of concern that the European economy is showing a net loss of output this year of 0.5 per cent and the outlook for the European economy is not too optimistic in the short term.  I hope we will get serious growth initiatives at European level that will ensure the markets to which we sell our goods expand.  That is a way we can get the best value from investments made under the National Development Plan and out of the growth in output which we are seeking to achieve under the plan.  We need to ensure that sustainable jobs are created and we get the best long term return from expenditure under the plan.</P>
      <P>Employment forecasts are sensitive to the situation in Europe and in the countries with which we trade, as well as to the competitiveness of our goods and services and changes in exchange rates.  We will do the best we can at home to ensure that we get the best value in long term job creation.</P>

Is she aware that the former plan, the 1989-93 National Plan, promised to create 35,000 jobs a year but unemployment went up by 100,000 during that period?  Would she further agree that when all the figures are extrapolated, job growth and job loss figures, she is depending on emigration for unemployment not to reach 400,000 by the turn of the century?  What level of emigration will there be over the period of the plan?  Given that we have a net job growth of 12,000 jobs, 3,000 fewer working directly in agriculture and 25,000 additional school leavers each year seeking jobs, does she agree that under the plan we face the horrific prospect of unemployment reaching 400,000 by the year 2000?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for quickly bringing to my attention this incident which concerns not only me but Deputies involved and other Ministers.  I am having the circumstances investigated and will then communicate with the Deputies as soon as possible.  I am concerned that it has now become apparent that there was a place for the young offender in Oberstown House which is not a million miles from Trinity House.  Unfortunately, the judge did not request accommodation there.  I am having the matter investigated from the Trinity House angle and I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice as we must inquire as to why this happened.</P>

Is the Minister aware that at 4.15 p.m. yesterday the gardaí in question were told by the staff in Trinity House that they could not accommodate this young offender, yet they arrived with the young boy at 6.30 p.m. in order to serve their warrant and then left him in the car park?  Is she also aware that it was only due to the care and concern of local people to whom the boy called that he was lent £2.50 to take the bus back to the city where he lived?  Has the Minister already taken up with her colleague, the Minister for Justice, the conduct of gardaí in abandoning a young man like this on what was probably the coldest evening of the year?  Nobody seemed to care what would happen to him.  He might have committed another offence while he was already on remand.  Will the Minister agree that this is not the way to run Trinity House or the courts of the land?</P>

      <P>Is this not a clear abdication of duty by the Minister?  Is it not the Minister's responsibility as Minister for Education to make sure sufficient places are available and people remanded in custody will not be turned out on the road?  Has this not happened before?  Is the Minister aware that three years ago a juvenile ended up in the women's section of Mountjoy because there were not enough places available? There has been more than adequate notice of the lack of provision in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have already told the Deputy that a place was available. The unfortunate point is that while the court was told that Trinity House was full, if an application had been made by the judge, who sits without interference from the Minister for Education, for a place in Oberstown boys' centre, which is adjacent to Trinity House, there is no reason this boy should have been left wandering.  I take seriously my responsibility in relation to the need for places. When answering questions last week Opposition Deputies objected to the amount of information which I was prepared to give, when I gave a lengthy reply on the number of and need for places. There was a place in Oberstown next door to Trinity House.  I have undertaken to have this serious matter investigated and I will come back to Deputies when investigations are completed.</P>

Is the Minister aware that 31 per cent of all persons in custody are juveniles under the age of 16 and that one in six of these is under 14, that there is no plan to deal with the detention of offenders of this age and that far from being a rehabilitative system, people are learning in the system to become hardened criminals?

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this case illustrates yet again that there is a crisis in child care? After the Kilkenny case we discussed the need for the further development of child care services, yet last week I had to raise on the Adjournment the case of a nine-year-old child for whom suitable facilities were not made available.  We signed the UN Convention earlier this year and we will be reporting to the UN monitoring committee in August next.  What are the Minister's plans to co-ordinate the services for those children?  The Ministers for Health, Education and Justice need to co-ordinate a plan so that services are available for children who need special resources or detention places.  The Minister's reply on the Adjournment last week did not answer that question.</P>

This is a matter of concern, nobody can say the position is satisfactory, but funding is being made available, the health boards have responsibility in this area and are being asked to co-ordinate the existing systems. Three Departments are involved in dealing with the problem, the Departments <Col N="60" /> of Education and Health and the Department of Equality and Law Reform also have a role to play.</P>

This has not been done.  It is not satisfactory for the Taoiseach to tell us that he has asked his Chief Whip to let us know from time to time what is being done.

I think the Taoiseach would agree that fundamental to ethics in Government is the confidentiality of Government documentation.  In this regard I share his annoyance at the fact that a document was leaked to the <i>Irish Press</i> last Friday.  Will the new legislation include a section dealing with treason? What happened last Friday amounted to nothing less than that.  Has the Garda inquiry been concluded and will the person concerned be charged with treason? I do not blame the reporter or the newspaper for publishing it but, as I said, I share the Taoiseach's annoyance at the fact that this document was leaked.  In present circumstances it amounts to treason.</P>

I am suggesting, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5 together.  Is that satisfactory? Agreed.  One decision should suffice in respect of these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Electoral Act, 1992 is hereby amended by the deletion of section 9 and the substitution of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;9.&mdash;(1)  A person shall be entitled to be registered as a European elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of eighteen years and if he was, on the qualifying date a citizen of Ireland, and&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  ordinarily resident in that constituency, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  residing outside the State but in a member state of the European Communities and is not registered as a European elector in any such state.  </P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister for the Environment shall make regulations providing for&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the inclusion in the register of European electors resident outside of the State, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  a scheme of voting for European electors resident outside of the State.&rsquo;.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to <Col N="188" /> give Irish emigrants living in other member states of the European Union the right to vote in European Parliament elections.  The Bill before us proposes to give this right to approximately 62,000 citizens of other member states living in Ireland.  I support this proposal and I am very glad it has been made.  However, there are approximately 630,000 Irish citizens living in other member states who will not have the right to vote in any of the Irish constituencies in the European Parliament elections.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the only member state of the European Union which denies its emigrants the right to vote in their country of origin in the European Parliament elections.  This is a disgrace and it should be corrected.  The purpose of my amendment and of the other two amendments which have been tabled is to give citizens of this country the right to vote in their home constituencies in the European Parliament elections.  The right of emigrants to vote in elections here has been debated in this House for a number of years.  The Minister of State and his colleagues promoted a Private Members' Bill to that effect about two-and-a-half years ago.  I was happy to support it then and have argued for it on a number of occasions since.</P>
    <P>A number of reasons, one of them constitutional, have been advanced for not giving emigrants the right to vote in elections.  The legislation proposes to give non-nationals living here the right to vote in European elections.  Therefore, there is no constitutional reason for denying Irish emigrants living abroad the right to vote here in European elections.  That right can be given to emigrants in this legislation which deals specifically with European elections.  The argument that if emigrants had the right to vote in elections to the Dáil it would have a distorting effect on representation is spurious; it is the kind of argument used to deny women the right to vote.  Whatever case can be made for such arguments in respect of national elections, there is no case for them in respect of elections to the European Parliament.  All the people we are talking about are citizens of the <Col N="189" /> European Union and surely they have a right to vote in their constituency of origin in elections to the European Parliament. All the logistical reasons advanced in the past about the difficulty of arranging polling stations and so on go out the window in this case because we are dealing with European elections which are held between fixed dates, the election counts are all held at the same time and the elections are to the same institution.</P>
    <P>When these amendments were debated on Committee Stage we were told that the Government was considering the question of voting rights for emigrants and the introduction of a constitutional amendment to deal with that. During the debate on other legislation, a commitment was given that it would be done in the lifetime of this Government and that is very welcome.  This measure does not have to wait until the broader issue of voting rights for emigrants is dealt with.  It is something that can be dealt with in this legislation.  It is anomalous to legislate to give rights to citizens of other member states living here and to deny those rights to citizens of our own State who are living in other member states of the Community.  It is wrong that we should be the only member state of the Community to deny our citizens the right to vote in their home constituency in European elections.  The Minister should accept the amendment even at this late stage and give our emigrants some hope that this Government is serious about giving them their basic political rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments provide the Minister with a unique opportunity to indicate the Government's willingness to agree in principle to votes for emigrants.  The Minister has indicated that there would be difficulties under European law in doing this.  However, I am anxious to ascertain the legal advice he received since the debate on Committee Stage to establish if the articles in the European Community law to which he referred can be amended or changed to allow the Government to accede to the wishes of this House that emigrants be <Col N="190" /> allowed to vote in their country of origin in the European Parliament elections. Deputy Gilmore stated that there is no constitutional barrier to allowing emigrants to vote for people with whom they are more likely to have an affinity in the European elections.  The 1994 European elections could constitute a trial run.</P>
      <P>Regulations will have to be put in place to ensure that the system is not abused but all parties in the House agree in principle to allowing votes to emigrants.  I urge the Minister to examine the practical implications of allowing emigrants to vote in elections.  This is an opportunity for the Government to see what difficulties might arise in other elections as a result of this decision.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will look sympathetically at giving emigrants the right to vote in European elections and give us the benefit of whatever legal advice he received in this regard since the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There are 62,000 people who wish to vote in their country of origin.  My colleague, Deputy Bell, may have a different view on the effect this might have on the outcome of elections in the light of his experience in 1989 when about ten votes separated him and another candidate, Jim Fitzsimons.  The fact of emigrants being able to vote might influence the result of an election, but the likelihood of that in the context of large European constituencies is not great.  It would be difficult to imagine such a close result in a large constituency.  However, the result in Deputy Bell's case was unusual and shows that it can happen. Perhaps we can discuss this further when we hear the Minister's reply, but certainly the Minister should give some indication of how the wishes of the House can be accommodated in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment has the same common objective as the other two. It reads: &ldquo;the Minister for the Environment shall make regulations extending the right to vote in European Parliament elections to Irish citizens residing outside the State who have reached the age of 18 years&rdquo;.  This election Bill presents an <Col N="191" /> opportunity to the Government to implement its commitment in the Programme for Government to extend voting rights to Irish citizens living abroad.  It is strange that this opportunity has not been taken, nor was it taken when the Presidential Elections Bill came before the Seanad recently.  On both occasions the Government turned down the proposals of the Opposition parties. A number of political parties are in favour of extending the vote in some form or another to Irish citizens living abroad; it is not generally available at the moment.  Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats have expressed their support of the principle. The party of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, also indicated their support of this principle.  That means four parties in the House indicated their support for extending the vote to emigrants. The first opportunity to do so was not taken up.</P>
      <P>We know from amendments tabled on Committee Stage that the Government is opposed to extending the vote to emigrants on this occasion, even though the complication involved in extending the vote to emigrants for Dáil elections, which had been mentioned as one of the difficulties, does not arise.  The constitutional obstacle referred to by the Attorney General would not be an obstacle in the case of extending the vote in European Parliament elections to Irish citizens residing abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a unique position.  There is no major problem in relation to time. The European Parliament elections are many months away and there is ample time for the Dáil to prepare, debate, pass and implement the necessary legislation. The Minister referred to the drawing up of a voters' register.  The annual revision of the voters' register which takes place at this time of the year need not be an inhibiting factor.  If the vote were extended to Irish citizens residing abroad a supplementary list could be added to the register.  The Minister gave a weak excuse on Committee Stage in respect of <Col N="192" /> difficulties in this regard.  It is easy to make excuses when one does not want to do something.  One gets the impression that the reasons put forward by the Government not to extend the vote to emigrants or to Irish citizens residing in other EC member states on this occasion is because of a general reluctance to do so rather than any great administrative difficulty.</P>
    <P>On earlier Stages the Minister referred to a document which had been sent to his Department by the European Union.  He sent me a copy of it.  It is a Commission proposal dated 27 October for a council directive.  The first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to this document refers to the scale of the problem for Community citizens who have availed themselves of their fundamental freedom to travel and stay in a member state other than their own.  European integration has become a reality of which they have personal experience.  Today some 5 million citizens of the Union are living in a member state of which they are not nationals.  There are 630,000 Irish living outside their home member state and the number of resident citizens of other member states residing in Ireland is 62,000.  Page 2 of that document, under the heading &ldquo;The Right to Vote&rdquo;, states that, with the exception of Ireland, all member states have adopted a solution based on entitling their nationals living abroad to vote.  It lists the ways in which the member countries of the European Union have done that.  From an administrative point of view there is no great difficulty in relation to this matter.  It appears that the Government is reluctant to apply the principle of extending the vote to our emigrants.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 of the Electoral (No.2) Act, 1986, voting by Irish diplomats abroad is allowed on the basis that they are deemed resident in this State. How can the Government regard extending the vote to Irish diplomats living abroad as being constitutional while declaring it unconstitutional to extend the vote to other citizens residing abroad?  It appears that diplomats, the privileged public servants who work <Col N="193" /> abroad for the Department of Foreign Affairs, are given the right to vote in elections at home, but other public servants residing abroad working for Departments other than Foreign Affairs are not given that right.  If that is the position it is an anomalous one.  If the principle is conceded in relation to some servants of the State living abroad, surely it should be extended to all servants of the State residing abroad.</P>
    <P>Articles 16.1.2 of the Constitution envisages that the franchise will be granted to all Irish citizens who comply with the formalities of registration. Article 16.2.2 of the Constitution fixes constituency ratios based on the population for each constituency.  If those requirements can be complied with in relation to Irish diplomats, it is fair to assume that they can also be complied with in relation to other persons residing abroad.  The constitutionality of section 15 of the 1986 Act has not been challenged and, therefore, it is assumed that it is deemed to be constitutional.  I raised this matter previously but the Minister did not reply because of time constraints on Second Stage.  Those difficulties are not covered in the European Parliament Elections Bill, 1993.</P>
    <P>If the appropriate arrangements are made the franchise can be extended.  In recent years the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have carried out extensive studies of the administrative arrangements that have been put into place in other countries in relation to meeting the principle enshrined in these amendments of extending the vote to citizens residing outside the home state.  My amendment is couched in general terms to give the Minister freedom to implement the principle in a form which he may deem appropriate. It is now November 1993 and the European elections will not take place until 9 June 1994.  There is ample time to make the necessary arrangements to enable those residing abroad who wish to vote in that election to register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the main thrust of the amendments.  I was reminded by a <Col N="194" /> comment by Deputy Hogan that during the last election five of my immediate family travelled home.  If the other 45 had been able to afford to travel home or if a postal vote had been allowed, I would have secured my seat on the first count and four recounts and the expense involved would not have been necessary. However, my colleague, Jim Fitzsimons, may have had 55 first preference votes in London.  Assuming he would not have had those votes I would have won the vote by a margin of 45.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to extend the vote to all Irish citizens within specified limits.  The intention of the Labour Party Bill was not to leave this matter open-ended.  If a section providing for the necessary reguations were included in the Bill that would cover the matter.  It is Labour Party policy to extend the vote to emigrants and I am sure that will continue to be its policy.  In Opposition we supported that measure and since we entered Government the policy has not changed in that regard.  Some time limit should be introduced in extending the vote to emigrants.  For example, somebody who left Ireland 50 years ago should not be allowed to vote.  Obviously some time limit would have to be specified because people who have been away from the country for 40 or 50 years would have lost touch with what is happening here. All Irishmen and women should have this basic right, but some mechanism in this regard should be built into regulations under all Bills dealing with parliamentary, presidential and European elections.  I agree with the main thrust of the amendments, particularly the first two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their contributions. The Programme for Government covers the position as outlined in the three amendments under discussion. There are no constitutional difficulties in dealing with the matter in terms of European elections.  I did not say that difficulties would arise in terms of European legislation; I said so in relation to <Col N="195" /> another amendment.  There are no arguments on this side of the House or the other side against the principle of granting votes to emigrants.  What has to be decided is the right time and place to implement that principle.  It would be unwise in the extreme to implement the principle piecemeal, on the basis of giving broad powers to the Minister as proposed in the amendment.  If such wide powers were granted to the Minister there would be uproar from the Opposition, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Despite the principle being accepted on all sides that emigrants should have a vote at home, there are great differences as to how that should be applied.  For example, the Fine Gael Party believes that a number of people should be elected to the Seanad by emigrants.  Some Members believe that all emigrants born in Ireland should have a vote regardless of how long they have been away from the country and others believe there should be a five year cut-off point.  The Government is examining the matter with a view to implementing the Programme for Government which accepts the principle of granting votes to emigrants. It is very important that we get this matter right.  There are many issues involved but I do not wish to raise them today because that is an argument for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Molloy concerning ambassadors, he was a Minister when detailed legal advice was sought and given to the Government on that issue.  The Bill has not been challenged constitutionally and there is no difficulty in that regard.  However, if it is challenged there is the possibility of a constitutional difficulty arising.  The advice given when Deputy Molloy was Minister was that the legislation was constitutionally safe.  The point should be made that there is a difference between people who are abroad on a voluntary basis and those who are sent abroad on Government business.  Every reforming Bill &mdash; this is minor reforming legislation &mdash; in the electoral area will give an opportunity to the Opposition to raise these <Col N="196" /> arguments.  They have been raised on three different Bills in the past nine months.  We are discussing the same points raised in the select committee and I am sure that is a useful exercise.</P>

      <P>I do not know when I have heard such a pathetic response to amendments tabled in this House.  The Minister has given no answer or argument against these amendments.  He was really scraping the barrel in suggesting that he could not accept the amendments because they might give the Minister too much power and regulations would have to be made.  In dredging up that argument he sounded like a coy matron refusing a drink.  The Minister acknowledges that there is no constitutional objection to this principle and there is no difficulty in terms of European law.  There seems to be agreement on the principle of granting voting rights to emigrants.  He said that the only issue to be decided is the right time and place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They will not have the right to vote in their home constituencies in this country, which is what the amendment proposes.

By turning down this amendment the Government is saying that it agrees in principle that emigrants should have the right to vote but it does not want to give them that right now. There is no justification for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is no longer a question of technicality, constitutionality or logistics; it is a political question as to whether the Government is politically sincere about giving emigrants the right to vote.  The footballers who played for this country last Wednesday were all either emigrants or the children of emigrants, none of whom has the right to vote in elections here.  We are quite happy to cheer them but not to give them the right to vote. The 630,000 citizens of this country living in various member states of the European Union, whether they work in semi-State organisations or emigrated for personal reasons, are citizens of the European Union and have the same rights as other citizens of the European Union.  The only right they do not have is the right to vote <Col N="198" /> in their home country.  They will be the only citizens of the European Union who, in the next European elections will not have the right to vote in their country of origin.  It is hypocrisy on the part of the Government to state that it is in favour of the principle of granting emigrants the right to vote while at the same time denying them that right.</P>
    <P>I proposed a similar amendment to the Presidential Elections Bill and agreed on Report Stage of that Bill to withdraw the amendment as a result of a commitment by the Minister of State that the question would be examined, legislation introduced, administrative arrangements made and a constitutional referendum held well in time for the next presidential election.  That cannot happen in this case. If these amendments are not accepted, emigrants will be denied the right to vote in their home country in the next European elections.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the Minister's negative response to these amendments.  It is time Members of this House, some of whom have been saying for a long time they are in favour of giving emigrants the right to vote, were given an opportunity of declaring where exactly they stand on the question of emigrants' voting rights. I ask that the amendment be put to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  No person may be at the same time a member of the Oireachtas or other public elective body and of the European Parliament, and, if any person who is already a member of the Oireachtas or other public elective body becomes a member of the European Parliament s/he shall forthwith be deemed to have vacated his/her first seat.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates broadly to the issues of a dual mandate as a TD and an MEP.  Having discussed this on Committee Stage it has become clear that there is a widespread feeling that the positions of TD and MEP should be distinct and separate and should not be held by the same person.  Following on that debate the Minister stated that there was an EC law which allows members of national parliaments to be members of the European Parliament also.  I noted from his comments that he was concerned with adhering to that ruling, although in principle he felt there was merit in distinguishing between the two posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This opens a wider argument in relation to our dealings with other member states of the European Union. We are all sovereign states and there are times when the collective wisdom of the European Union may not concur with the feelings and the needs of people in a member state, in this case, Ireland.  This amendment is one example.  The other European partners may say that their national parliament is close to the European parliament and therefore they have no difficulty with people holding both posts.  However, in Ireland's case, we are on the periphery and for one person to carry out both jobs requires much travel. It also necessitates attendance at committee <Col N="202" /> meetings &mdash; in other words, longer hours of attendance than has been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>I would argue that there are unique factors which give the provisions of this amendment merit in Irish circumstances. I would therefore ask the Minister to reconsider the ruling of the European Union when replying and to bear in mind that the provisions of this amendment constitute an option.  Indeed, if we are behaving ourselves properly, being completely conciliatory as a European partner, we should seek uninformity in all things.  But the Danish exmaple in the case of the Maastricht Treaty highlighted the fact that there are times when a member state must take some initiative, think for itself and provide for its circumstances. I would argue that this is one of those times when the provisions of this amendment should apply.</P>
    <P>It is time in Ireland &mdash; and, I am sorry, in other places &mdash; that the level of cynicism about politics is compounded when people see a Member of the Oireachtas also being an MEP.  Bearing in mind the huge workload, there may have to be a compromise struck, when two people could be performing those two separate functions.  But we must also bear in mind that the accumulated income of one person with a dual mandate will seem astronomical to those who observe politics through the media or have a keen personal interest in it.  It is time for us to do whatever we can to dispel that cynicism, and that effort would be greatly enhanced by acceptance of my amendment.</P>
    <P>Traditionally MEPs here have been viewed as the poor relation of the TD, the former being somebody who went off and did something or other in Europe &mdash; we were not quite sure what &mdash; while the TD got on with the real work of running the country, so to speak.  That was the image that obtained until recently, when we began to engage in serious discussions about the European Union and its role in all of our lives.  I would argue that that perception ought to change.  Whereas the European Parliament does not have anything like the power of the European <Col N="203" /> Commission, henceforth it will be much more meaningful to the lives of our citizens than has been the case heretofore, acquiring a distinct character of its own. However, this means that the workload of MEPs is increasing simultaneously with that of TDs.  In those circumstances I consider my amendment very relevant, particularly in the way European affairs are developing.</P>
    <P>Those outside politics, employed or unemployed, or in positions in which they might as well be unemployed by virtue of their income, would look at the dual mandate of TD and MEP as an absolute case of double jobbing.  We ought to recognise such cynicism and ensure that our legislation gives expression to people's views.  It is my belief that the views I have articulated are widely held.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will assure us that all parties are free to introduce their own rules in regard to the dual mandate.  However, unless the Government makes its position clear, it will be perceived as not caring in this respect. Perhaps the Minister will say that the Labour Party will do so unilaterally, which would be a very good example to other parties, both within and without Government.  Such assurance would be welcomed, but nonetheless it would not have the same attraction as if supported and enacted in legislative form.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the view of the Green Party is very clear: we would not advocate the dual mandate of TD and MEP were such to be the case after the next European elections.  However, I agree with the case being advanced that every party should draw up its own rules.  Nonetheless, if this amendment were supported it would render the matter more urgent and warrant attention by Government.  I do not accept the argument advanced that European law prevents us from so doing. Rather it is a case of Ireland legislating for circumstances prevailing here which are different from those obtaining in other countries.  Therefore I seek support for my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to urge opposition <Col N="204" /> to this amendment, not on the basis that I do not agree with the sentiments expressed in its provisions, but because we are a great nation for drawing up rules for the other fellow.  For example, when I first stood for election to Dáil Éireann I was a senior national trade union official, Deputy Gilmore having been employed in another capacity in the same organisation. We were given leave of absence for one term of office, following which we no longer had a job.  Of course, Deputy Sargent is in a rather unique position in that he can remain a Member of this House for as long as he wishes and if not re-elected, can revert to his former position of school principal, having appointed, I assume, a substitute in the meantime.  It is all very well to talk about the position of the other fellow and what should happen him.  But were we to lay down a regulation to the effect that all school teachers after one term of office as a TD must relinquish their former position and appoint full-time teachers in their place rather than maintaining substitutes &mdash; sometimes for 15 to 20 years &mdash; on a lower rate of pay while Members enjoy additional incomes, I wonder what the reaction would be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>That point should be put on the record, because we continuously draw up regulations affecting the other fellow's pocket, as in the case of my good colleague, Deputy Molloy.  It is all right for somebody in the audience to stand up and make a proposition as long as somebody else pays the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of European Parliament elections it is only right and proper that if a Deputy becomes a candidate and is elected to the European Parliament, he or she should give an undertaking not to stand in the next general election.  That is reasonable.  But in those circumstances, having just fought an election, to expect him or her to resign the following day and fight an unnecessary by-election would not be right or proper.  My party has had only one Member of the European Parliament, who has not held a dual <Col N="205" /> mandate.  So we can say we have a clear record in that respect.  I want to assure the House that should I be elected to the European Parliament and nominated for the next general election, I would declare immediately that I would not stand as a candidate in the general election.  Perhaps Deputy Sargent would then consider nominating somebody who could pick up a seat for the Green Party in Louth.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is very practical to impose on Deputies a condition such as outlined in this amendment, in what I would regard as a very narrow-minded fashion, while saying at the same time that Members of the Oireachtas should be encouraged to declare that they will not contest a forthcoming general election or hold their dual mandate indefinitely. However, in some cases the overlap may amount to only some months, so that the position would take care of itself.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, I should say that if and when any Member of the Labour Party secures a dual mandate, he or she would receive one salary only, the other would not be paid. Equally, I should point out that the salary enjoyed by MEPs representing this country is equivalent to that paid to a TD serving this Parliament, but would amount to about half the salary of a German MEP.  With the exception of the United Kingdom, our MEP rate of pay is the lowest in the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 4 would meet Deputy Bell's requirement whereby members of the Oireachtas who offer themselves as candidates to the European Parliament would have to make a decision at the following general election as to whether they wish to continue as a member of the European Parliament or offer themselves again for election to the national parliament.  That is reasonable, particularly when one considers the new powers of the European Parliament.  The public will require that member to be more diligent than at present in respect of information disseminated to their constituents in regard to what is happening in the European <Col N="206" /> Parliament.  In other words the members of the European Parliament will be required to remove some of the democratic deficit which exists between Europe, their constituencies and the national parliament.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was established with a view to the possibility of giving a right of audience to Members of the European Parliament. That is not working successfully because meetings of joint committees are held when Members of the European Parliament are in their own parliament in Brussels or Strasbourg.  The timing of those meetings is such that Members of the European Parliament cannot participate and give the benefit of their wisdom and information to national parliamentary committees.  The practices from the past clearly indicate that the public do not take kindly to people who continue to be Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament. More and more they will elect people to the European Parliament who will be able to give that job their full attention.  The electorate will consider that membership of a national parliament is a distraction to membership of the European Parliament and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in my name seeks to ensure that when a Member of the Oireachtas decides to contest the European elections and is subsequently elected that in the following general election the candidate must decide whether to continue as a Member of the Oireachtas or to be a full time Member of the European Parliament.  The idea that one can continue <i>ad infinitum</i> to be a Member of the Oireachtas as well as a Member of the European Parliament is something to which the public do not take too kindly.  Election results have clearly indicated the view of the electorate on this matter during the past number of years.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would have a problem, under European law, in accepting this type of proposal.  Is there any way he can circumvent the ruling of the European legislation with which he has a difficulty?  If proposed amendments <Col N="207" /> can be made to that article of European Union legislation we would like to hear about them because the present practice is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the argument made by Deputy Hogan concerning the dual mandate but I would have some difficulties with Deputy Sargent's argument.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that only two Members out of 15 in the European Parliament have a dual mandate, one of whom &mdash; Deputy Cox &mdash; holds the position on a temporary basis. In 1976, 13 out of 15 had dual mandates. The dual mandate is a matter for political parties.  It is inappropriate to try to put a ruling of that kind into legislation.  The electorate will not tolerate people holding down two posts, either of which requires full time attention.  The work of a Deputy involves at least 60 &mdash; it could <Col N="208" /> be 80 &mdash; hours per week, he certainly cannot do that and hope to do the European Parliament job as well.  The electorate will not tolerate it.  The political parties should now take the formula put forward by Deputy Hogan that there can only be a short term dual mandate.</P>

      <P>That is true and perhaps the electorate should be allowed to judge and decide.  Generally speaking that would not be the case.  The candidate referred to by the Deputy is an exceptionally successful politician and perhaps that is the reason his two mandates are acceptable to the electorate.  That position may continue to be acceptable to the electorate but I do not wish to make an election speech on behalf of that particular dual mandate holder.  European law prevents what is proposed, we cannot be selective and take the pieces of European law that suit us best and ignore the parts we do not like.  Even if that law did not exist it would be inappropriate to put this type of formula into legislation.  It should be left to the political parties and those who select the candidates to do so.  On that basis I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 4, after &ldquo;occurs&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and having confirmed in writing from the Secretary of the party concerned that the person is a member of that party&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the replacement list of candidates.  If the elected candidate subsequently gave up the position, resigned, or for some other reason no longer continued as a member of the European Parliament, and a replacement had to be sought, the first name on the replacement list would be taken provided that person was still a member of that same party.  The legislation proposed by the Minister specifies that the replacement candidate be asked to make a statutory declaration that he is a member of the party.  I would have thought it would be more appropriate to have required the party to confirm that the person was still a member of that party.  When I put this to the Minister on Committee Stage he said the party had the option of challenging the replacement candidate who stated in his declaration that he was a member of the party if the party stated he was not.  That would involve a legal process and going through the courts.  If a candidate felt aggrieved at being deemed not to be a member of a party, he should have that right.  It would have been more appropriate in preparing the legislation to have put the onus on the political party to confirm whether the candidate is still a member of the party or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are elected to the European Parliament for five years and there can be dramatic changes in that period.  There may be four or five names on the replacement list and earlier candidates on the <Col N="210" /> list may not wish to avail of the invitation to accept the vacancy &mdash; as happened in the past.  I can instance a member of the European Parliament whose name was not the first on the replacement list but others higher on the list turned down the invitation to replace the candidate who had stood down.</P>
    <P>It has to be taken into account that anyone on the replacement list may eventually be invited to fill the vacancy although that person may have long since severed his connection with that political party.  There may be good reasons as to why that person may have done so but the fact is that he or she would not represent the party.</P>
    <P>It would be more proper to recognise in the Bill the rights of political organisations to confirm membership.  There are no criteria to determine who is a member of a political party, but that would be done by the officers and officials who are charged with managing the political organisation.  A political organisation may have rules which if not kept disqualify a person from membership and replacement candidate may have disqualified himself or herself by not complying with those rules but nevertheless may claim to be a member.  A great deal of unnecessary confusion in the event of a dispute on a case similar to this could have been avoided if the onus had been put in the first place on the political party to confirm by statutory declaration that the candidate was a member rather than leaving it to the candidate involved.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage debate on this amendment was very interesting and some amazing suppositions and assumptions were presented on behalf of those trying to defeat the amendment.  The intention of the amendment is to establish the candidate's membership of the political party.  This is purely and simply to allow the best possible continuation of the democratic will of the people who cast their vote at the previous election.  We should encourage people to vote in a way that reflects the way they think about politics rather than personalities.  The <Col N="211" /> business of politics ought to be about the ideas, policies, teamwork and the ability to organise a representative body whether it be in the county council, in Government or in this case the European Parliament.  It is reasonable to encourage people to think about politics in a deeper sense than simply talking about the next candidate on the list who may or may not be a member of the party which presented the list originally.  This amendment gives some assurance to the people that they will not be represented by somebody they probably would not vote for five years down the road because the candidate is no longer a member of the political party.  It is fair that the political party should be allowed to continue to hold the seat in the name of the party rather than having a candidate who jumped ship or whatever taking it. People would feel they had been sold out in that case.  Of course the friends and family of such a candidate would be quite happy, but we have to ensure as much as possible that the candidate has a mandate from the people.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument can go both ways but the parties are being left out in the cold when there is not some provision for a declaration as outlined in the amendment. The alternative of leaving the matter to the courts, as has been suggested, would make the legal profession happy because it is another job for them but I do not think we should depend on the courts to decide our legislation.  If we can enact good legislation that prevents trouble from the start, that is what the amendment will achieve.</P>

    <P>The role of a general secretary, mentioned in my amendment, was referred to on Committee Stage.  From the debate it seems that a general secretary in some parties is considered to be a type of dictator. In the Green Party we do not have a general secretary but a co-ordinator whose role is to co-ordinate rather than to issue decrees or unilateral decisions. Parties have their own structures and it is simply a matter of providing for a person to make a declaration, having consulted others, in line with party structures. <Col N="212" /> That is what I had in mind when I used the term &ldquo;general secretary&rdquo;.  The amendment should be considered on that basis.  I want to ensure that democracy comes into play as much as possible in the selection of the replacement candidate.  I have no wish to take rights from the people but I want to ensure that politics is, as it ought to be, about policies and ideas and not simply about personalities or cults.</P>

      <P>I find it strange to have to make the same replies to the same arguments, but obviously that is the system we operate.  Today we are simply repeating what we said on Committee Stage.  The requirement for a statutory declaration by the next person on the list is a very strong instrument.  Somebody who makes a false declaration is committing a crime and is liable to prosecution and remedial action arising from that.  We are seeking to meet the case made to us by the European Parliament consequent on the filling of the vacancy in the Dublin constituency in 1992, that they were not satisfied that the principle of the elected list being followed was being followed.  We are removing the right of the political party to determine whether a name can go forward.  If we do not make the change future replacements will have to run the gauntlet of the European Protocol Committee of the European Parliament who examine any replacement candidate.  We are now proposing that we put the onus to challenge on the political party if they feel that the individual they originally nominated is no longer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the point as to who determines the criteria for membership of a political party, certainly we should not ask the Clerk of the Dáil to make that decision.  It would be a grossly unfair burden to place on any official of this House but it is the type of question that would have to be determined by the Clerk of the Dáil in making a decision on whether a person is a member of a political party.  It is right that the political party, who would have the resources should make the case and make a challenge if such a challenge were to be made.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's explanation.  If a replacement candidate was a member of the party when he was put on the replacement list but then lost all interest in the party, followed a different career and lost touch with the party, he would not be aware of the rules of the party in the event of getting a letter from the Clerk of the Dáil asking him to accept an invitation to become a member of the European Parliament to replace the elected member who had resigned.  In all innocence the person might sign a declaration that he is a member of the political party without being familiar with the rules.  Surely commonsense would lead to the conclusion that the only body that can confirm membership is the group charged with the management of the political party, those who have been elected to positions of authority for that party.  What the Minister proposes does not make sense and could lead to some awkward cases and unnecessary difficulties where individuals, having <Col N="214" /> received the invitation unexpectedly might seek to accept it and make untrue claims.  While such people might be convinced that the declaration was true that it might not be so because the criteria for membership could have changed and they might not have fulfilled the requirements of the party in regard to membership. There might be a case in which a person would not know whether he was a member of a political party if he had ceased to be active in it.  The Minister is going the wrong way about this and I hope it does not lead to cases which may end up in the courts.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was drawing up this legislation himself it would have been the other way round but because of his interpretation of some letter he received from the European Parliament, he is putting the onus for determining whether one is a member of a political party solely on the individual on the replacement list. In other words, he is leaving it to a unilateral declaration on the part of the individual replacement candidate rather than to the registered political party who named him or her as a member at the time of the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy McDowell's contribution on his amendments last week and I am aware from that and a similar contribution he made on the subject on Second Stage that he has strong views on this matter.  In cases where assault on a garda is alleged, he believes the dice is excessively loaded against the defendant in the District Court.  I accept the Deputy's view is based on his extensive experience in criminal trials and on his perception of the realities involved.  Obviously, I do not have that type of personal experience, but I am sure the Deputy will accept that his perception of those realities and the conclusions to which that leads him would not inevitably be shared by all his colleagues in the legal profession. Indeed, the case has been as strongly put to me that in such circumstances the District Courts are more than adequately geared to deal with those matters and that the balance of public advantage does not lie in having automatic recourse by the defendant to Circuit Court hearings. I do not wish to adopt an inflexible approach in this matter, but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the conflicting views to which the matter gives rise pose a genuine dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> I have a proposal to make which might meet some of the Deputy's concerns but is unlikely to be entirely acceptable to him.  Before doing so let me put the matter in a general context.  The general approach which has been taken in recent years in relation to the creation of new statutory offences is that it should be left to the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide in an individual case whether the offence should be dealt with summarily or tried by a jury.  In the event that a case is brought before the District Court which the judge considers, by reason of its seriousness, should be tried on indictment, he or she will decline jurisdiction and send it forward for trial in a higher court.  This is the approach which has been taken in section 18, dealing with assault with intent to cause bodily harm or commit indictable offence, and section 19, which deals with assault or obstruction of a peace officer.  That general approach is a sensible one and, in relation to section 18, I see no compelling grounds for departing from it.  As I have said, this has been the norm in legislation for many years.</P>
    <P>I appreciate however that different considerations may apply in relation to section 19 in that that section is intended as a direct replacement for section 38 of the Offences against the Person Act, which this Bill proposes to repeal.  It is the case at present that the offences under section 38 of the Offences against the Person Act are included in the Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and the effect of this is that these offences can only be tried at present summarily where the accused elects for this.  This would not be the case with the offences proposed under section 19 of this Bill unless Deputy McDowell's amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>In view of the complex issues which arise in this area generally I intend in the context of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which I have under preparation at present, to examine the question of the approach to the election to opt for summary trials and in particular the scheduled offences under the 1951 Act, including those relating to the assault of <Col N="219" /> a peace officer.  In the circumstances I would not be unhappy in the meantime to keep the present arrangements in relation to assaults on peace officers in place.  Accordingly, my proposal would be to accept amendment No. 45 without prejudice to the outcome of the general review.  For the reasons I have already outlined I would not be prepared to accept amendment No. 44.</P>

    <P>As Deputy Mitchell will recall, we had a lengthy discussion on the definition of peace officer on Committee Stage and on the question of whether it should be extended and, if so, to whom.  Therefore there is no need for me to go into this matter in great detail now.  For the reasons outlined on Committee Stage, I was unable to accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  That is still the position.  I instanced as an example the case of a prison officer who was assaulted in a cell <Col N="220" /> and to which there are no witnesses. However, it is my understanding that the Deputy's amendment was motivated primarily by his concern at the time about the proposal to extend the definition of peace officer.  In this regard, I hope this amendment will go some way towards meeting the concerns expressed by Deputy Mitchell and others during the course of the discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone some of the way towards meeting the concerns expressed on Committee Stage about the proposal to extend the definition of peace officer and in particular what might give rise to obstruction of the peace officer.  Section 18 of the Bill deals with assault with intent to cause bodily harm or commit an indictable offence. It states that on summary conviction a person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months and that on conviction on indictment a person shall be liable to an unlimited fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.  These are substantial penalties.  I wondered therefore why it was necessary to extend the definition of peace officer in section 19.  Illustrations were given to highlight the fact that in the past traffic wardens among others have been subject to abuse.  While this is inexcusable, section 18 covers this matter adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 provides for a prison sentence of up to five years on conviction on indictment and a fine not exceeding £1,000 and a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months on summary conviction where any person resists or wilfully obstructs a peace officer.  Again, these are substantial penalties.  I felt we were going too far in providing for a term of imprisonment of up to five years where a person resisted a traffic warden, for instance.  That was unnecessary.  While this amendment goes a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed on Committee Stage by a number of Deputies, I am concerned that reference is made to a member of the Defence Forces.  I wonder under what circumstances members of <Col N="221" /> the Defence Forces will come in contact with the civilian population.  It is my understanding that this happens almost exclusively when they are accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  For example, members of the Defence Forces manning a checkpoint are always accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána who directs traffic to stop. Members of the Defence Forces act in support of the civil authority.</P>
    <P>There is an important principle at stake here.  While I do not want to take from the role played by members of the Defence Forces, which is an important one.  I wonder why the Minister is insisting that the reference to members of the Defence Forces should remain.  If a member of the Defence Forces is asked to carry out his or her duties on a public street, for example, it should be possible to have a member of the Garda Síochána present.  If a member of the civilian population resists or wilfully obstructs that member of the Defence Forces, will that member of the Defence Forces be entitled to arrest that person and will his or her word be accepted?  Would it not be sensible to say that in all circumstances a member of the Garda Síochána, in accordance with present practice, should be present?  Therefore, it is unnecessary to extend the definition of peace officer to include a member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces comprise the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. I can well understand that members of the Defence Forces serving in the Air Crops and the Naval Service have to carry out certain duties and would be happy if the Minister decided to restrict the definition to these.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to pass legislation which makes it a criminal offence to wilfully resist or obstruct a member of the Defence Forces in the execution of his duty.  I have doubts about that because the border between the Defence Forces and the civilian population should be kept intact.  It is a matter for the Garda Síochána to uphold the law; the Defence Forces are there only in support of them. If this is necessary for fishery protection, we should specify that.  However, it is my <Col N="222" /> understanding that, even in those circumstances, it is usual to have a member of the Garda Síochána on board a ship when an arrest is imminent.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 provides that &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in this section, where any person is charged with an offence under this section in relation to a peace officer who is not a member of the Garda Síochána, the evidence of such peace officer alone shall not be sufficient to establish the charge&rdquo;. Where the peace officer is not a Garda, a third party should be present to establish the charge because it is an unnecessary incursion into the rights of people that members of the Defence Forces should now have rights over civilians and that under this legislation the words of a newly created peace officer could be accepted on its own against that of a civilian.  That is a dangerous thing to do, and I say that without casting any slur on the Defence Forces who play a very important role and must be supported. The Judiciary, the Legislature, the Government, the Garda and the Defence Forces all have different roles.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment because there should be some additional protection for members of the public coming into contact with this newly created peace officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  There is a dangerous development proposed in this legislation which brings the Defence Forces very much into the area of civilian public control.  This legislation is, after all, about public order; it is essentially about policing civilians in public places. The distinction between the role of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána must be maintained.  We have seen what happens in other jurisdictions when the Defence Forces are given a role in civilian policing.  The Defence Forces are not given that role here except in exceptional circumstances where they act in support of the police force, and that is their proper role.  In this section the role of the Defence Forces is being redefined; they are being given essentially a policing role. <Col N="223" /> That is a dangerous development and should not be implemented in the way proposed.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment seeks to address that in a particular way.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time legislation of this kind came before this House.  I recall that in legislation dealing with telephone tapping there was provision to give the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces a role in authorising telephone taps.  We now have this second occasion where the Defence Forces are being brought out of barracks, so to speak, and onto the streets.  That is not good for the respected role of the Defence Forces in this State. It is very worrying.  The amendment Deputy Mitchell has tabled seeks to address the problem, and I support that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  The Defence Forces see themselves solely as a support to the civil power and do not want a role for which they are not trained. Coming from a family with a military tradition I can say that military people I have known would be very uncomfortable in such a role and conscious that they are not trained for it.  I am not sure that the wording of this amendment is adequate but I certainly support its spirit.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking into account the points made in regard to sheriffs, traffic wardens and others.  We need to address the question of the inclusion of the Defence Forces.  It is possible that where the Garda called in the Defence Forces to aid the civil power, anybody who assaulted a member of the Defence Forces would be doing so because such member was acting in aid of the Garda.  It would seem reasonable in such case to include the member of the Defence Forces because if the Garda do not have the assistance of the Defence Forces when they need it, with the same rules applying to the members of the Defence Forces acting in support of the Garda, there would be a difficulty. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's amendment in relation to sheriffs and traffic wardens, I emphasise it does not mean that this House does not accord status to these officers.  There have been sheriffs, traffic wardens, park attendants in this city and around the country, appointed legally and operating within the law who have been assaulted, we cannot condone that.</P>
      <P>I should like to satisfy myself as to what is involved in this proposal.  The retention of members of the Defence Forces suggests that the Minister is being careful in certain circumstances to draw a distinction between a member of the Garda Síochána and a member of the Defence Forces who are both in attendance where there is a riot and there are assaults on both.  If additional powers are not given to officials or officers other than members of the Garda Síochána I, like Deputy Walsh, would be sympathetic to what the Minister seeks to establish here.  I look forward to clarification of this matter by the Minister.</P>

Nobody condones that type of attack and the full rigours of the law must be applied to people who engage in that type of activity against those who have been appointed by the State to uphold law and order.</P>

    <P>As Deputy Walsh pointed out, this section does not propose to grant extra powers to the Defence Forces, nor does it propose to redefine their role.  The role of the Defence Forces is clearly set out in legislation and has been maintained by every Government.  It provides that they may be called out from time to time to aid the civil power.  No member is suggesting that where a member of the Garda and the Defence Forces are controlling a riot and both are badly injured, we should not distinguish between the imposition of <Col N="225" /> penalties on those causing the injury.  The legislation ensures that where the Defence Forces are deployed to aid a civil power, which is the only case in which they come into contact with members of the general public &mdash; I am not suggesting that this should be extended &mdash; penalties imposed in respect of an attack on a member of the Defence Forces should not be less than those imposed in respect of an attack on a member of the Garda Síochána.  I hope no Member disagrees with that position.  It is important that the amendment I tabled which includes a member of the Defence Forces, is accepted by the House and I would not accept any dilution.  No redefinition of the role for the Defence Forces is proposed. No one is suggesting that the Defence Forces will now be out of control in regard to maintaining public order on our streets.  They are not being given the power of prosecution or arrest, that power remains with the Garda Síochána. The amendment provides that where a member of the Garda and a member of the Defence Forces are working together to control a riot and where both are seriously injured, the penalties imposed in respect of injury to a member of the Defence Forces should be no less than that imposed in respect of an injury to a member of the Garda.</P>

      <P>I note the Minister did not reply to the points I made in respect of my amendment; she may have overlooked them.  I join the Minister in saying that the House is sending out a message that nobody would tolerate an attack on any public servant in the circumstances she outlined and the full rigours of the law under section 19 would apply in such cases.  Section 20 singles out the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  Traditionally the role of the Garda Síochána involved dealings with civilians which the role of the Defence Forces did not.  The argument which the Minister applies to the Defence Forces surely applies to the protection of fisheries officers, many of whom are perhaps more vulnerable at sea or on lakes because they are not armed to deal with thugs who endanger their lives.  In one case a life was lost.  It is difficult to understand why it is not proposed to extend that provision to include fisheries when it is considered necessary to extend it to include members of the Defence Forces. There is an important principle involved here.  I accept the Minister's amendment greatly improves the position in relation to the points I made.  However, I consider my amendment is necessary to safeguard against a peace commissioner, who is not a member of the Garda Síochána, giving evidence against a member of the civilian population.  I am disturbed about the reasons for including the Defence Forces in such a selective way and I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

At that Stage I explained I was unable to accept it.  The case I instanced at that time was of a prison officer being assaulted in a cell to which there were not witnesses. I considered it was important that the law as it stands and what is proposed in this legislation would remain unchanged.  If we were to accept what Deputy Mitchell proposes no case could be made against a person who might assault a prison officer in a cell in the absence of witnesses.

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the collapse of the talks for another programme for economic and social progress provoked by the failure of the Government to terminate the 1 per cent income levy and eliminate the <Col N="229" />&ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts; and, in view of the hardship caused by both measures, calls on the Government to reverse them in the next budget.</P>
    <P>The fact that a Coalition Government which includes the Labour Party would force the collapse of the talks for a new programme for economic and social progress will have surprised some people and distressed a great many people living at the margins or existing on low pay.  Yet that is precisely what has happened.  Over recent weeks, for whatever reason, the Government has deliberately and calculatedly contrived the breakdown of the talks.  I say &ldquo;for whatever reason&rdquo; because over tonight and tomorrow night the Government, including the Labour Party, either those opposite me or behind me, will have an opportunity to explain its reasons to the House.  It is a most dramatic policy reversal by both Government partners.  From the Labour Party, it is a kick in the teeth for their paymasters in the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Government contrived the breakdown is a matter of public record, but let me summarise it.  When the Government introduced the 1 per cent income levy the Minister for Finance explained it was temporary and due to the extraordinary circumstances that surrounded the preparation of the budget in the context of the currency crisis. Every indication was that &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; meant until the next budget when the creative synergy of the two parties would be given full rein.  Labour Party backbenchers were given the nod and wink &mdash; do not panic, the levy is for one year only.</P>
    <P>At the outset the Congress told the Minister that the levy would have to go if there was to be another programme for economic and social progress.  The Minister for Finance seemed to indicate agreement.  However, in October, for some as yet unexplained reason, the Minister began to backpedal.  The signals he sent out were that it would take two budgets but, he explained, after all, that was really only effectively one year &mdash; in other words, to January 1995.  After that <Col N="230" /> the Government's position began to harden further.  The Government would start to undo the levy in 1994 but the pace of completion would depend on the progress of the talks.</P>
    <P>The Congress probably took some of its own members by surprise by offering to accept the termination of the levy in two budgets, acknowledging that it would have to take into account the implications for the public finances.  The Congress negotiators, having moved to what they believed was the Government's position, must have been amazed to experience the Ministers, Deputies Ahern and Quinn, table a new offer: that the Government would eliminate the levy over three budgets. It is hardly surprising that the Congress leadership concluded that the Government was not serious about securing another national agreement.  For a Government to suggest the elimination of the levy over three budgets was transparently ludicrous in political terms.  To keep shifting the goalposts as the Congress moved closer to the Government's original position further underlined the belief that the Government had fundamentally changed its position.</P>
    <P>There is further evidence that the Department of Social Welfare was prepared to roll back at least some of the cuts introduced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, a political consideration for so doing being the commitment given by the Labour Party to reverse the cuts during the general election campaign. However, for some reason this course of action was stopped and neither Deputy Quinn nor Deputy Ahern seemed to support the reversal of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although all of this is a matter of public record it is important that this House clearly understands that the collapse of the talks was deliberately contrived by the Government.  Why the Government considered that this was the appropriate strategy is a question for which I hope we will be given an explanation during the course of this debate.  It is certainly difficult to reconcile the Government's decision to collapse the talks with the high-flown rhetoric when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was <Col N="231" /> sold to this House by Fianna Fáil and warmly supported by the Labour Party. For example, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, speaking for the Labour Party, warmly welcomed what he called &ldquo;a long term strategy for the development of this country over the next decade&rdquo;.  During his speech of 19 February 1991 he emphasised on a number of occasions that it was a strategy for the nineties &mdash; in other words, that the agreement was to last for a decade.  He told the House on 19 February 1991, Volume 405, column 750 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is the Labour Party view that the overriding priority of such a strategy should be the creation of an efficient and modern social market economy which would provide every individual in our society with the opportunity for personal growth and development. Economic benefits derived from such a strategy must be shared, on an equitable basis, and no section of our society must be left behind as we move forward, together, in the last decade of this century.</P>
    <P>It appears now that not only is the Labour Party in power prepared to change that strategy so lauded in 1991, but it is prepared to pursue a strategy where sections of our society will be left behind.  It is extraordinary that the Labour Party should want a long term strategy in Opposition, a strategy to protect the poor, low paid and marginalised, and as soon as the same Labour Party gets into Government it is prepared to wreck that strategy that is already in place.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, public and private, in the economy and the question must be asked as to how they will fare in the absence of a new agreement.</P>
    <P>What about the most vulnerable category of workers, often without the protection of a trade union, who at least under a <i>Programme for the Economic and Social Progress</i>-style agreement secured minimal increases under the various joint labour committees?  I am referring to industries which pay very low <Col N="232" /> wages such as the rag trade, or where cowboy and fly-by-night operators proliferate, such as contract cleaning and contract security.  I am referring, for example, to the hundreds of non-trade union organised employments in the tourism industry and to low paid employments where women workers are especially vulnerable and are often the sole breadwinner in the family.  I can only presume that these are the sections of society that Deputy Quinn, in 1991, assured this House that the Labour Party would not leave behind.  He may have been referring to the tens of thousands of low paid workers in the public service. For example, the CPSSU represents 10,000 clerical assistants and clerical officers.  As the Minister is aware, 82 per cent of the clerical assistant grade are women and 75 per cent of the clerical officer grade are women.  These categories of clerical staff typically contribute between ten to 15 years experience and service before they can aspire to a wage which is still less than the average industrial wage and a good deal less than the average clerical wage in industry.</P>
    <P>The second OECD report of 1993 shows that the clerical assistant grade had 60 per cent of average industrial earnings in 1981 but that the same post had only 50 per cent of average industrial earnings in 1991.  This is important in so far as references are frequently made outside, and sometimes inside this House, to the 9 per cent and 10 per cent provision for pay increases in the public sector pay bill. Yet the lowest paid civil servants got pay increases in 1992 and 1993 of 3 per cent and 3.75 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>This kind of comment also conceals the widening gap between the pay of lower grades and that of top civil servants.  In this regard it is interesting to note that while Mr. Maurice Doyle is concerned about the public pay bill, meaning pay increases for low and average paid public servants, he does not advocate replacing the pay determination system which looks after him and other well paid public servants.  It now appears that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy <Col N="233" /> Quinn, has bought the neo-liberal orthodoxy which, among other things, sees competitiveness as solely being a function of wage costs.  Consequently, the real reason for breaking down the national talks is that both the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Finance are in agreement that the public sector pay bill must be restricted. If that is their reasoning, why not say so?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to this new orthodoxy of neo-liberalism.  In provoking the collapse of the talks for a new programme for economic and social progress the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government is clearly responding to the mounting campaign by advocates of this new orthodoxy of neo-liberalism. If one takes Commissioner Padraig Flynn's version of it, this new orthodoxy would strip the social cost associated with the job.  If one takes the version of the Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice Doyle, the demand is for what he calls &ldquo;a more flexible labour market&rdquo;.  What does the neo-liberal term &ldquo;flexible labour market&rdquo; mean in ordinary man's language?  It means low pay, the old Adam Smith iron law of wages &mdash; so long as the labour content cost remains the same you can create as many jobs as you like but obviously if there are to be more jobs and the labour content cost remains the same then the level of pay must be reduced.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the new leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, expressed the same philosophy in committing herself and her party to leading a crusade of self-reliance.  What does this mean in ordinary man's or woman's language? It means a better deal for the elite, the educated, the assertive and the devil takes the hind most.  How can one be self-reliant without an income?  What does the message from the new Progressive Democrats leader signal to the 300,000 people who are unemployed? How does Deputy Harney, who represents the same constituency as me, propose that the 10,000 plus unemployed in Dublin south west will participate in her crusade of self-reliance?  Norman Tebbit told the unemployed to get on their bike and look for a job.  Ten years later the <Col N="234" /> message from the new leader of the Progressive Democrats is the same.  The Progressive Democrats Party wants the State to get off the backs of the people.  If the State pulls out of its supportive role for the 10,000 families in Tallaght and Clondalkin who have no bread earner in the household, where will the crusade of self-reliance lead them?  The Progressive Democrats campaign may more appropriately be termed a crusade for the selfish.  Perhaps Deputy Harney and the Progressive Democrats believe, like Maurice Doyle, that many of these people are not really unemployed.</P>
    <P>According to Maurice Doyle, the 1986 survey which showed that 2 per cent of social welfare claimants were fraudsters is only the tip of the iceberg.  This is Mr. Doyle's view despite the increasingly rigorous measures enforced by the Department of Social Welfare in recent years to properly root out social welfare spongers.  Is Maurice Doyle so removed from the reality of life for the unemployed that he believes there is a significant black economy in the constituency which Deputy Harney and I represent?  If he does, he knows sufficiently little about life for the unskilled unemployed in large urban estates as to disqualify him from serious comment. Yet so pervasive is the new orthodoxy of neo-liberalism that both Deputy Harney and Deputy Avril Doyle of Fine Gael have been prepared to espouse Maurice Doyle's ivory tower perspective.  Presumably they believe this philosophy captures the temper of the times.</P>
    <P>There was no word from Maurice Doyle on recent shenanigans in the financial world where social welfare spongers would be small fry by comparison. There was not a word from him on his primary role as the guardian of monetary policy on why more than £200 million of our foreign reserves was frittered away in vain at the beginning of this year. There was only a passing reference from him on his other main function of supervising the banks.  There was no analysis of why institutions returning profits hitherto undreamt of should at the same time be crucifying the Irish consumer.  There was <Col N="235" /> no comment from him either on what proportion of the £130 million &mdash; six months profits for one banking institution &mdash; was as a result of speculation against the Irish Pound at the beginning of this year and on the measures which might be adopted either at European or domestic level to minimise the chances of such speculation recurring.</P>

      <P>Looking at the terms of the Government's amendment, it would appear that the Government has decided to place the blame for collapsing the talks at the door of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The first paragraph of the Government's amendment makes it clear that it was the Congress's insistence &ldquo;on the removal of the 1 per cent income levy and the full reversal of the social welfare cuts within an agreed time span as well as the full implementation of the current programme&rdquo; which caused the collapse of the talks.  I have gone to some pains to show that this is not the case.</P>
      <P>Congress, I think to the disbelief of a great many of its members, offered to accept the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy over the two budgets and in doing so believed it moved to the position the Minister had espoused when the discussion began.  Given the usual life span of Governments and political reality, it is transparently ludicrous, and was never intended as a serious offer to the trade union movement, that the Government would back track and now say it proposes to remove the 1 per cent levy over three budgets.  Therefore, I find it difficult to appreciate that the Labour Party will vote against the trade unions and their membership tomorrow night and support the Government amendment.  I disagree with my colleagues when they say that the Labour Party will support this Government amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot believe that a <Col N="236" /> Labour Party, which is not only supported but funded by the trade union movement and which was so fervent an advocate of the concept of comprehensive centralised bargaining when in Opposition, would when given the opportunity in Government want to wreck that process and set aside the framework that was put in place for a decade, as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, told us at the time.  I still believe that between now and voting time tomorrow night the Labour Party will, when they have seen the amendment which has been finally produced by the Government, feel it necessary to exert &mdash; presumably behind the scenes &mdash; sufficient pressure on the Government to change its position.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the entry of Minister of State Burton into the House reminds me that she has had no small role in this buildup, because the Government amendment refers specifically to the question of the Congress demand to reverse the dirty dozen social welfare cuts.  It will be recalled they are the same cuts about which Minister Burton not too long ago said that they had &ldquo;gone for a Burton&rdquo;.  That is the difficulty with being an inexperienced Minister; you tend to read out or be unable to resist any catchy phrase that is penned for you.  My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, established clearly in the House that far from being &ldquo;gone for a Burton&rdquo;, only one of the cuts &mdash; and I will leave it to him and Deputy Gilmore to deal with that in detail &mdash; has been slightly modified and the rest are extant. I find it difficult to accept that the Labour Party will come into the House and vote to enforce that situation against the wishes of many of its supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the merits of free collective bargaining?  As I have said, there is no doubt that the weak and the marginalised and those on low pay will suffer.  I can understand that there must be sections of the trade union movement which support free collective bargaining in as much as some enterprises can afford to pay a great deal more.  I can understand also a wish on behalf of the trade union movement to escape from the suffocating embrace of the partnership and consensus that has <Col N="237" /> stifled political affairs in this country for so long.  Of course, the dynamics of the position have now been changed by the decision of the Labour Party to go into Government with Fianna Fáil.  In that case it is understandable that the Congress would want to release itself from that embrace and that political issues which cannot be debated in a climate of consensus and so-called partnership might now come to the forefront of the agenda.  There is no doubt that the weak, the marginalised and the low paid in this economy will suffer if the Government persists in provoking this collapse.</P>
    <P>The statistics for the period 1980-87, when compared with either the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> or the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, indicate that the lot of those who are socially excluded in our society was worse under a free collective bargaining policy.</P>
    <P>I indicated that I wanted to share my time with Deputy Gilmore, but before I give way I must say that the elements I have praised in a comprehensive approach to centralised bargaining does not mean that in any way I fall for the social partnership &ldquo;red herring&rdquo;, because when it comes down to where economic power is yielded and where it matters in the workplace, there is no real partnership. There is no partnership, unfortunately, as between the workers and management, nor has there been any real measures introduced by Government to enforce it.</P>
    <P>I find it interesting that Deputy Des O'Malley, for example, recently opposed the minimal shareholding that the workers in Aer Lingus have been afforded as a result of the recent experience of the unions and workers in Aer Lingus.  That is evidence that the concept of partnership is largely ephemeral.  It has never penetrated down to the workplace; and where real economic power and industrial democracy matters, it does not exist.  Deputy O'Malley was quite explicit.  He said that the reason he did not think it was a good idea was that it could prevent the privatisation of Aer Lingus at some stage in the future.  That <Col N="238" /> is a massive vote of no confidence in the workers of Aer Lingus who negotiated their way through a very difficult period and who presumably, if confronted with a situation that would be likely to be in their interests and the interest of this country in the future, would adopt a similarly sensible approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Democratic Left motion tonight is to call on this Government to accede to two very modest demands: to abolish the 1 per cent income levy which the Government described as temporary and to reverse the dirty dozen social welfare cuts which was a central plank in the Labour Party's election manifesto 12 months ago, and which at least Minister Burton would have us believe are already abolished.</P>
      <P>These are the two very modest demands which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made as a condition for the opening of talks on a new Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  The Government's refusal to accede to them not only sinks the prospects for a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> type agreement but also raises a fundamental question about the nature of this self-styled partnership Government. In the opening paragraph of the Programme for Government we are told that the partnership Government would be new in character and that its understanding of &ldquo;Partnership&rdquo; was to extend beyond the normal confines of party politics. It states:</P>
      <P>The key to our whole approach will be to develop a strong sense of partnership, not only in terms of political structures, but throughout the economy, our society and our community. ...the aim of the Government will be to create economic prosperity and social justice...Achievement of our aims will be accomplished by broad social consensus, social solidarity, local initiative etc., etc. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Broad social consensus&rdquo;&mdash; is that not what the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> idea was all about, wider than a national pay agreement, involving <Col N="239" /> the social partners in talks and an agreement about what was essentially the Programme for Government?  Indeed, the last <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> anticipated that it would be succeeded by similar type agreements and referred to the then Government having accepted the Congress proposal &ldquo;to adopt a long term strategy for the development of this country over the next decade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are few who would argue with the principle of involving social partners in such a broad agreement, although there are inevitably differences over the content of the agreement, its implementation and the extent to which the effectiveness of the social partners has been blunted by the operation of the agreement. Certainly, it has often appeared to me that the effectiveness of the trade unions has been blunted by the last <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, that they appeared to have been sucked into an establishment consensus and that on key social and economic issues they had lost their cutting criticism of Government performance.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that a Government so loud on the concept of partnership and so close to the trade union leadership would have been more than anxious to conclude another national agreement which might, as the outgoing <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> did, have committed the social partners to support for the Governments' policy programme.  It is certainly hard to understand why the Government has passed up the opportunity for national industrial peace for the remainder of the Government's lifetime, because it was not prepared to concede to Congress two measures which it claims it had intended conceding in any event.</P>
    <P>So much for the broad social consensus as the key to achieving the Government's objectives and as a nucleus of the partnership Government.  This episode has pulled away the pretence of social partnership, lifted the guilt and showed us what we always suspected: that this Government partnership is nothing more <Col N="240" /> than the naked frames of two political parties thrashing about in their lust for political power.</P>
    <P>The rebuff to Congress and the Labour Party's evident happiness at co-habitation with Fianna Fáil must by now be raising serious doubts among trade unionists about Labour's commitment to the historicl relationship between that party and the trade union movement.  As a trade unionist, though not a member of the Labour Party, I have always supported the concept of a political arm for the trade union movement, for trade union affiliation to the Labour Party and for trade union support for parties and politicians who represented and defended the interests of workers.  That is the way it should work, but in practice the Labour Party in Government seems only too willing to turn its back on the trade unions.  The last period of no national agreement also coincided with Labour's participation in Government in the mid-1980s.  Is the same to happen again?  Many trade unionists must now be wondering what return the Labour Party has made on their considerable financial and public relations investment in the Labour Party 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Government's rejection of the call to remove the 1 per cent levy and the dirty dozen affects more than the trade unions.  It affects the poor and the organisations who represent them.  Once again today an ESRI report tells us that Ireland has the fastest economic growth in Europe.  We have become accustomed to such reports on our country's economic wellbeing.  They keep telling us that our economy is doing well &mdash; high economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates, good performance on Maastricht convergence and so on &mdash; but it makes one wonder about economics.  What we see around us is high and ever rising unemployment, increasing levels of poverty, an ever widening gap between rich and poor and growing consequential social problems such as crime and drugs abuse.</P>
    <P>Poverty is becoming the forgotten condition in this country.  Last week the Conference of Major Religious Superiors published an excellent document entitled <Col N="241" /><i>Towards Full Citizenship for All</i> which they hoped would influence Government thinking on the forthcoming budget and would inform the now aborted <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> talks.  On page 16 of that document it is stated:</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that national wealth has grown, the number of people living in poverty has grown, not declined.</P>
    <P>The conference of Major Religious Superiors support this with figures which show a dramatic rise in the numbers of citizens now poor in this country.  In the period between 1973 and 1987 the number of people in households with incomes below 40 per cent of the average household income almost doubled, from 253,157 in 1973 to 453,202 in 1987, an increase of 80 per cent.  The corresponding increases of the numbers below 50 per cent and 60 per cent respectively of the average household income were 53 per cent and 39 per cent.  The total numbers living in households with incomes below 60 per cent of the average household income &mdash; in plain language, living in poverty &mdash; was 1,186,115, or one third of our total population.  That document went on to show that in the years between 1986 and 1993, during which the economic belt was being tightened and the people were being told that everyone would have to make sacrifices, they were the poorest in our society who had to make the greatest sacrifices.</P>
    <P>Let us take income.  The annual income of the average social welfare receipient increased by only £979, or 28.9 per cent, between 1986 and 1993.  In the same period the annual income of the head of a department in large Irish companies increased by approximately 17 times that amount, by in excess of £16,000, or 58 per cent, while the income of a Department Secretary increased by over 25 times the increase of a social welfare recipient, by £25,847 or 72.4 per cent.  Indeed, the rate of increase in income of high earners contrasts sharply with the rate of increase for the lowest paid workers in the public service who received £3,306, or the average industrial wage earners who received <Col N="242" /> £3,348.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that the gap in benefits between the top earners and the lowest paid is compounded when account is taken of the reduction in the highest rates of tax from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>The figures published by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, showing the growing gap between the better off and the poor, concentrate only on comparing social welfare recipients and low earners with high earners in the public service and private industry.  In fairness it must be pointed out that these high earners pay high levels of tax and that their earnings are either publicly known or traceable.  But what of those who have been making untaxed incomes over those seven years through land or business speculation who have salted away their considerable gains beyond the reach of the Revenue Commissioners? What has the Government done to narrow the gap between those high rollers and the poorest in our society?  The answer is &mdash; nothing except legitimise it through the tax amnesty.  It is no longer a cliché but a fact that in Ireland the rich have been getting richer and the poor poorer.  The numbers dependent on social welfare have been increasing. Again, between 1986 and 1993 the numbers receiving social welfare increased by over 77,000 to 820,000 while the number dependent on social welfare rose to nearly 1.5 million.  Despite these increases in the numbers of social welfare recipients the actual percentage of GNP expended on social welfare declined from 14.7 per cent in 1986 to 14.2 per cent in 1993, which reduction was achieved by targeting social welfare recipients for cuts and harsh measures.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts Congress wants eliminated.  Indeed, the Labour Party 12 months ago &mdash; I am now looking at a Labour Party election leaflet from 12 months ago &mdash; listed the dirty dozen and wanted them all repealed. Soon after the Social Welfare Act, 1993, had been passed in April last, the new Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, who is present in the House, declared that the 1992 cuts had been substantially <Col N="243" /> reversed, that the dirty dozen were dead and gone.  However, SIPTU prepared an analysis of the provisions of the 1993 Act and the various regulations which the new Government had introduced since taking office.  Their conclusion was: yes, some of the cuts had been eased marginally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but most of them had not.  None had been totally reversed, five had been eased, four left unchanged and three had actually been rendered worse. In fact only one of the cuts &mdash; that dealing with exceptional needs payments &mdash; is said to have been completely reversed, although that is arguable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when one sees what is happening with community welfare officers in health centres.  It is interesting that of the various cuts which have been left unchanged almost all of them are those which substantially affect women more than men.  The numbers affected by the reduction in the minimum maternity benefit are small in any one year but they are all women, low paid women at that. Similarly, the numbers affected by placing income limits on deserted wife's benefit are small, but they are all women. The vast majority of part-timers claiming unemployment benefit and deserted wife's benefit would also be women; and, of course, the many thousands of people who have still not received arrears of social welfare payments on which the European Court of Justice ruled are all women too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, not only have we circumstances prevailing in which the dirty dozen cuts have not been reversed but some have actually been extended, as the Government surreptitiously continues its campaign of assault on the social welfare constituency.  Most of the people affected by the dirty dozen cuts, who have suffered <Col N="244" /> most from them, are women.  That is a disgraceful outcome from a Government that not only claimed it was going to have partnership &mdash; that is now in smithereens, because there are no talks with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a partnership agreement of any kind &mdash; but promised it would reverse the social welfare cuts, which clearly it has not done.  This is a Government that promised it would look after working people and encourage work, but ends up imposing an additional 1 per cent tax levy on earnings; a Government that promised it would defend and promote the interests of women and ends up savaging women on the social welfare system much more than anybody else.</P>
    <P>What this Government is doing is driving the poor of this country back into the queues, back into queueing at unemployment exchanges awaiting their miserable unemployment assistance payments; back queueing at health centres waiting to be interviewed by a community welfare officer and be subjected to the humiliation of having to beg for some small allowances gradually being whittled away; queueing on hospital waiting lists awaiting medical treatment; queueing for housing, as part of the 30,000 on the housing list, which has grown by 5,000 since the last assessment of housing here was undertaken.</P>
    <P>This is the Government who, instead of defending the poor, is rendering the poor poorer while offering tax amnesties to the rich.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &lsquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the preconditions set by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before it will enter into discussions on a new programme, viz. &ldquo;the removal of the 1 per cent income levy and the full reversal of the social welfare cuts within an agreed time span as well as the <Col N="245" /> full implementation of the current Programme&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the agreement reached at a meeting between Congress and Government on 13 October, 1993, that &ldquo;the Central Review Committee should continue to meet in 1993 to transact the business it has undertaken well in the lifetime of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that in relation to the social welfare issues raised, the Committee would work to identify any issues that required action and would convey their views clearly to the Minister for Social Welfare&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the proposals put forward on 15th November, 1993 by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on behalf of the Government confirming that the phasing out of the 1 per cent levy would begin in the 1994 Budget and would be completed not later than in the 1996 Budget;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the expressed wish of both Government and Congress in their joint statement of 21 October, 1993, &ldquo;for a new Programme that had employment as the cornerstone&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Government remains available at any time to resolve the present impasse in a way which would be consistent with its responsibility in terms of employment and the public finances;  </P>
    <P>and expresses the hope that Congress will review their position and open discussions on a new programme in the light of the Government's stated position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment sets out clearly for the information of the House the position of the Government in relation to our efforts to open talks with the social partners on a new programme.  In particular, it addresses the difficulties which exist in relation to the 1 per cent income levy and <Col N="246" /> the social welfare issues referred to in the notice of motion.  I call on the House to take note of this position.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my budget speech earlier this year and in reply to questions, there were sound and valid reasons for introducing the 1 per cent income levy. It was introduced in the context of exceptional budgetary difficulties arising from the repercussions of the international recession both in terms of slower economic growth than had been anticipated at the time of negotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> PESP, and of a sharp increase in the numbers in receipt of unemployment compensation.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, and with Deputy Chris Flood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that maintenance of firm control of the public finances to achieve a steady reduction in the national debt-GDP ratio is vital to our economic wellbeing.  It is an overriding principle underpinning the Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for which all the social partners signed on.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself acknowledges that to depart from that overriding principle would plunge the economy back into a spiral of rising inflation and interest rates, lower real incomes, declining standards of living and collapse of the investment we need to create jobs.</P>
      <P>Any slippage in our overall discipline on managing the public finances would place in jeopardy the progress we made in these respects in recent years.  The levy was a vital measure to enable us to maintain that budgetary discipline as part of our overall strategy for combating unemployment and to continue the momentum which we have developed in keeping the public finances under tight control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By exempting the lower paid, we minimised <Col N="247" /> the effects of the levy on those least able to bear any extra burden.  At the same time, it was a means of seeking an equitable contribution to our budgetary difficulties from all income earners in a position to bear such a burden.  It is important in this connection to appreciate that due to the combined effects of pay increases and tax concessions over the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> real take-home pay by those in employment has increased substantially at just under 5 per cent on average.</P>
    <P>To secure the same revenue as from the temporary levy through adjustment of income tax rates would have required an increase of the order of 1.5 per cent in both tax rates or a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate or a 5 per cent increase in the top rate.</P>
    <P>The House must appreciate that the raising of revenue of the order of £145 million per year would not be easy and that managing without resources of this order would have profound implications for the full range of public services.  I find it interesting that the Members who have put down this motion are obviously more concerned about its removal than about the implications of its removal for both the public services and tax reform.</P>
    <P>Above all, the levy is a temporary measure which means that we are committed to its removal when budgetary circumstances permit.  In this regard, both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government have acknowledged that the phasing out of the levy would have serious implications for the public finances.  Furthermore, the parties to the recent discussions recognised that these would have to be taken into account in any negotiations on a new programme.</P>
    <P>I am of course acutely aware of the situation which may face the country if discussions on a new programme do not commence.  The House must not lose sight of considerable achievements of recent years under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The process of consensus <Col N="248" /> between the social partners which underpinned these programmes enabled all concerned to make their contribution to solving the problems facing us in a coordinated fashion which took full account of national priorities.  I attach considerable importance to continuing to have agreed support in the community for the macroeconomic strategy which has underpinned these programmes.</P>
    <P>I will mention for the information of the House some basic achievements of which we can all be proud.  Considering the unfavourable international economic climate, our economic performance has been impressive.  Over the three years of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for example, GDP growth is expected to average about 3.5 per cent per annum.  This contrasts with average growth for about 1 per cent for industrial countries, of over 0.5 per cent for the EC and a fall of over 0.25 per cent for the UK in that period.</P>
    <P>This growth has been driven by exports of goods and services which will have increased in volume by over 7 per cent over the period with merchandise exports increasing by over 11 per cent.  This export performance in a period of adversity internationally underpinned the large surpluses in our balance of payments. The volume of private consumption also grew but more modestly. While investment declined in 1991 and 1992, a modest growth is forecast for 1993.</P>
    <P>Our progress on the employment front, while not satisfactory, still compares well internationally.  Over the past two years there was a slight decline but this year an increase of about 5,000 is expected.  In contrast, over that period, employment is forecast to fall by over 2 per cent in the EC and by over 7 per cent in the UK.</P>
    <P>Inflation has averaged just over 3 per cent over the past two years and is forecast at just over 1.5 per cent for this year. This places us firmly in the low inflation league internationally.  It is vital that we remain so if we are to continue the improvement in our economic performance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The foregoing are just some of the improvements which our economy has achieved in recent years.  By any reasonable economic yardstick, they are very impressive.  They also compare very favourably with the early 1980s before we adopted a consensus approach.  I need hardly remind the House of the combination of low growth, high inflation and excessive taxation which was a feature of those years.</P>
    <P>The major challenge facing us now is to improve prospects for employment by continued attention to the fundamental macroeconomic policies which have stood us in such good stead in recent years and other appropriate policy measures.  Continued attention to our industrial competitiveness will be essential if we are to build on the solid foundations which we have now created and continue to tackle the problem of unemployment as a national priority.</P>
    <P>Unemployment remains a very serious problem.  It increased substantially during the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reflecting a lethal combination of limited migration opportunities, slower economic growth than we would have wished for and rapid natural growth in the labour force. While it is heartening that the trend in the live register has shown considerable improvement this year and will be below the budget day forecast, there are no grounds for complacency.</P>
    <P>Unemployment &mdash; and the relentless pursuit of suitable measures to deal with it &mdash; will continue to be a primary concern of the Government.  We consider that there is already in existence a national consensus that increasing and maintaining employment, reducing unemployment and tackling the exclusion and marginalisation caused by long term unemployment are primary national objectives.  In the Government's <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>, we laid particular importance on the measures necessary to sustain economic growth in such a way as to maximise the potential for employment growth.</P>
    <P>In the National Development Plan submitted <Col N="250" /> to Brussels, the Government placed primary importance on jobs and employment.  We emphasised once more the need to reinstate the long term unemployed and those most in danger of becoming so into the economic mainstream. The plan's targets will be achieved by a strategy aimed at the national and community objective of greater economic and social cohesion. Specifically this will be achieved through the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development of the growth potential of the economy in agriculture, industry, the services sector, forestry, fisheries and tourism;</P>
    <P>&mdash; infrastructural investment to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development of the skills of our people through education and training; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative. </P>
    <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, we have also established the National Economic and Social Forum which provides an unique opportunity for representatives of groups which in the past have been outside the normal national consultative process to put forward their views on national priorities. This matter was raised by Deputies.  It was always a valid objective and that is the reason we dealt with it.  The forum includes women's groups, the unemployed, the disadvantaged, people with a disability, the elderly, youth and environmental interests.  I understand that the forum will be taking a critical view of existing schemes for the unemployed including an assessment of non-market work opportunities.</P>
    <P>The national consensus arrangements in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> played a vital part in the impressive economic performance I outlined earlier although obviously we would prefer to have done better.  I, for <Col N="251" /> one, am committed to continuing this process provided it is focused on the priority needs of the economy.  I regret it has not yet proven possible to find sufficient common ground to enable negotiations for a new national programme to get under way with the social partners.  However, it is also vital to all concerned that we should not prejudice the future budgetary position by making large concessions on the expenditure and revenue sides in advance of negotiations on a programme.  Furthermore, changes in taxation are a matter for the Government and Dáil Éireann in our discharge of our responsibilities in the public interest.  That has always been the way in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government has made significant moves to meet the concerns expressed by the Congress on the basis that implications for the public finances would be taken into account in any negotiations on a new programme.</P>
    <P>We agreed with the Congress on 13 October last that the central review committee should continue to meet in 1993 to transact the business it has undertaken well in the lifetime of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that in relation to the social welfare issues raised, the committee would work to identify any issues that required action and would convey its views clearly to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>On 15 November last, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I put forward, on behalf of the Government, proposals to begin phasing out the 1 per cent levy in the 1994 budget and to complete this process not later than the 1996 budget.</P>
    <P>These proposals comprise a very significant move by the Government by any standards.  They reflect a clear wish on our part to facilitate commencement of national talks on a new programme. However, the Government must be certain that in making concessions such as these it does not put at risk the very considerable progress which has been made in getting the public finances in <Col N="252" /> order and in tackling the still considerable overhang of public debt.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot, of course, simply agree to any demands that any one of the social partners may put forward with no certainty that it will reach an agreed understanding.  If the process failed after the Government had conceded these matters it would have dispensed with £145 million, in addition to conceding on outstanding issues of social welfare and others in the programme, and would be left with no room to manoeuvre in the new circumstances.  I believe that any Government that would do that would not be acting responsibly. The social partners put forward almost impossible conditions before we sat down to talk.  It amuses me that Deputies Rabbitte and Gilmore believe that the order of negotiations is to concede everything and then to proceed to talks with no certainty whatsoever of reaching agreement.  If the Government did that I have no doubt that this House would rightly castigate it as it would not have been responsible. That is what we are being asked to do, but we cannot do business that way.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to continue to deal with this matter in a certain way, but not in a way that makes no sense in normal negotiations in a civilised country.  I believe we have gone a long way to solving the problem which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has had with the income levy by what we were prepared to do on that front.  I hope that on reflection ICTU will give further thought to its position. If there is any way in which I can help to clarify the extent to which the Government was prepared to meet with Congress if we had gone into talks, which we never did, I would be only too happy to meet its representatives at short notice to discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am sure the House will agree that the Government has acted responsibly and in the only way it could at all times in relation to these issues.  It simply cannot put at risk all the achievements of successive Governments of recent years which are so vital to continued and urgent attention to solving our unemployment.  We remain committed <Col N="253" /> to the ideal of national consensus but not at any price.  I urge the House to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Going back to pre-1992 will not make it perfect and in most cases will not even improve the situation.  The discussion on the so-called dirty dozen &mdash; in reality now far from a dozen &mdash; has become hackneyed and unconstructive, reflecting a level of intellectual dishonesty in Opposition thinking.</P>

      <P>Quite frankly, the constant repetition of the dirty dozen phrase has become for some in the Democratic Left and others an instrument of intellectual terror to resist any kind of change or reform in the social welfare code.  If Members do not like something or even if they do not understand it, they cry &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; and we are all supposed to shrink back in terror.  It is so characteristic of Democratic Left and the political <i>cul-de-sac</i> it is now in.  Deputy De Rossa now leads the Hare Krishna tendency in this House.  Instead of serious policy contributions we get a dreary combination of a monotonous mantra such as dirty dozen from him and some delightful one liners from Deputy Rabbitte.  They give us a sound bite on everything but a policy on nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other much more serious issues in the social welfare system which need consideration but which have been ousted from discussion by the unwarranted obsession with the 1992 cuts on the part of certain people.  May I point <Col N="254" /> out to those who are so obsessed that the recommendations of two key organisations &mdash; the Combat Poverty Agency and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors &mdash; focus on a whole range of constructive and important issues, for example, child benefit, income levels, access to employment.  These people are the experts in the field and they know these are the real issues for unemployed people at this time.  Interestingly, neither document from these two recognised bodies mentions the 1992 matters.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system we have is not entirely suitable for the problems of today.  It cannot easily cope with the different work patterns, with part time and casual work, with short term contracts, and so on.  We have to recognise that this system must change.  We cannot simply require that all of its elements remain in place as if it were some sort of perfect system which dealt with all our problems.  The system needs substantial reform and overhaul.  Continuing to fight the phoney war on the dirty dozen is not the way to achieve reform.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to list out all of the issues which arise; this has been done on a number of occasions in this House.  For the record, I want to say, as I and the Minister for Social Welfare have said on numerous occasions, that the major changes of 1992 have been reversed or modified.  The changes that caused most distress and affected most people have been reversed in the extra £180 million spent on social welfare in this year's budget.</P>

That code clearly indicates peoples' entitlements under the scheme <Col N="255" /> and provides a basis for good budget management by people on social welfare.

      <P>However, we have not allowed our agenda to be determined by the 1992 cuts.  We addressed other issues which are actually far more important to the majority in this country.  The substantial increase in child benefit &mdash; a major benefit targeted directly at women who are in the majority of caring parents &mdash; and the other payment improvements which we introduced this year benefit far more people and address the issue of family poverty to a far greater extent than any further reversals of the 1992 changes could possibly do.  Again, let me refer to the documents of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and the Combat Poverty Agency which both highlight child benefit as a key weapon in the fight against poverty in families. This was one of the areas that this Fianna Fáil and Labour Government chose to concentrate on in this year's budget.  The Structural Funds allocation to the local development fund will do far more to address the problems of unemployment than will further reversal of cuts.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the remaining demands of Democratic Left.  We are being asked to restore the so-called alleviating payments to men &mdash; in other words, to reintroduce sex discrimination into the social welfare code.  Has Deputy Gilmore actually read that particular directive?  In view of his comments on women, does he actually favour the reintroduction of sexual discrimination against women in the social welfare code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>The specific cut for people who receive redundancy settlements over £12,000 has not been reversed.  However, after discussions with the trade unions and people affected by redundancies, we did introduce major improvements into the taxation of redundancy payments. These tax changes have more than compensated for the specific 1992 cut.  Is Democratic Left asking that we reverse these tax changes, thus giving a lower benefit to those being made redundant?</P>
      <P>On the issue of deserted wife's benefit, the position of married women in the social welfare code needs the most serious consideration. This is particularly so in the case of women in situations of marital breakdown.  Indeed, the Commission on the Status of Women makes a clear recommendation on the importance of an overall review of the social welfare system in this context.  Let us address the fundamental issues.  For example, is social insurance the best way to provide income maintenance?  If it is, how can we improve it and, if it is not, what system should be put in place?</P>
      <P>There is a real problem in the public perception of social insurance.  Social insurance is primarily social &mdash; that means that we all pay so that those who suffer certain contingencies can get benefit. The right to benefit only arises if the contingency is suffered, that is if one is unfortunate enough to become sick or unemployed and if one is fortunate enough to live to pension age.  If these contingencies do not arise, there is no entitlement.  One does not have a right <i>per se</i> to get PRSI money back any more than one has a right to get one's mortgage protection money back.  A person is a very fortunate person indeed if the short term contingencies do not arise and he or she does not need to claim insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us address the real problems of <Col N="257" /> income maintenance.  We need to do that regardless of whether there is another <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> We need a system which ensures a basic level of income for everyone while at the same time rewarding work done.  We need to deal with the problems of part time and casual workers.  On this issue, let me nail on the head a persistent, but widely held erroneous, view of the 1992 cuts.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are a number of problems with regard to part-time workers.  This is an issue which does not arise from the so-called dirty dozen. In fact, it arises from what everybody would regard as a very progressive move, that is providing social insurance coverage for part-time workers.  This was done in April 1991 and the people concerned came into benefit from January 1993.  In order to ensure that part-time workers would not get more from unemployment benefit than from work, a number of new rules are introduced from January 1993. These rules are now causing problems and the Department of Social Welfare is now very actively trying to find a solution.</P>
    <P>We have already found a solution for dockers and we are looking at other categories of casual/part-time workers.  The solution is not easy.  There are problems where full-time workers have taken voluntary redundancy and then returned to work for the same employer on a part-time basis, generally at lower rates of pay and probably lesser conditions while receiving unemployment benefit for the days not worked.  The evidence would suggest that these people want to work part-time and the employer is effectively using the social welfare system to encourage them into leaving full-time work thus getting a lower paid workforce.</P>
    <P>There is a real risk that the social welfare system would be used to undermine full-time work.  This would have very serious consequences for the trade union movement and for the social welfare system.  We do not wish to see this happen.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed by the social partners and I look forward to continued discussions in this area.  It is a very difficult area in <Col N="258" /> which to get measures right without undermining traditional full-time work and the conditions which have gone with full-time work up to now.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this is not part of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  The suggestion that it is included in the dirty dozen points to what a meaningless designation that is.  In fact, every change in social welfare is being lumped under this mantra.  The strangest of all is the inclusion of the taxation of disability benefit &mdash; this was actually agreed to in the 1992 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The unpalatable reality is that the social insurance system for unemployment payments is not suitable for present day conditions.  It was designed for and suited a working environment in which people worked full-time for an employer, occasionally were unemployed for a short period and then resumed full-time work.  It was never designed to deal with long term unemployment or with work patterns which involved part-time work, casual work or contract work where there is not an employment relationship and so on. These are increasingly features of employment both here and throughout Europe which particularly affect younger people.  I recognise that it is difficult for people to come to terms with these changes but both they and the social welfare system must adapt.</P>
    <P>Serious issues in the social welfare system need to be overhauled and reformed. We should have a constructive debate and I welcome any ideas which the Opposition may have on serious reform of the social welfare system, but we are wasting our time dealing with the ghosts of 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for sharing their time with me.  Anyone recalling the last number of years would come to the conclusion that the two previous programmes benefited the country and our people.  For that reason it would be regrettable if a new programme could not be put in place due to the reasons stated by Congress or any other reasons.  I regret that preconditions were set for the commencement of talks for a new programme. That was not the best way forward.  The best approach for negotiating any major programme is for those involved to come to discussions without preconditions and if at the end agreement could not be reached on the major issues then they could decide not to go along with the programme.  If a major player withdrew the programme would be in jeopardy.  To lay down preconditions at the start was probably unwise.</P>
      <P>Despite the impasse that has developed I hope it is not too late in the day for good sense to prevail.  The Minister for Finance has moved on the demand by Congress, and his move should be taken by Congress in the right spirit.  We had hoped that a new programme would concentrate fundamentally on job creation bearing in mind that the basic aspects of the economy have to all intents and purposes been put on a sound footing.  Due to lower inflation, lower interest rates and increased competitiveness in the economy, backed up by the Structural Funds, we could make substantial progress in job creation.  I hope that even at this late stage the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to whom I appeal tonight through the medium of this important debate, will come back into negotiations with the Government and the other social partners and drive the bargain they see as essential for their members without putting in jeopardy the progress made here over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael has not tabled an amendment to this motion which we will support by voting against the Government's amendment.  I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has left as the points in relation to social welfare will be dealt with more conprehensively by my colleagues, but it is somewhat disingenuous of her to lecture us on why the dirty dozen should not be replaced when the Labour Party, more than any other, made their abolition a political virtue and flooded the country with leaflets stating that one of its primary objectives, if in an influential position following the election, would be to abolish them.  It is similar to the <i>fourchette</i>, the Labour Party is hoist with its own petard in this regard and need not be surprised that some of the chickens are coming home to roost.  It would have much more credibility in regard to some of those issues if it was consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main reason for supporting the motion is that since the 1 per cent income levy was announced in this year's budget, Fine Gael resolutely opposed it because it is an unjust and dishonest tax.  It is unjust because it applies to the first £1 of income for those liable to pay it.  That is not the way our tax code operates. Rather, it operates on the basis that one is allowed earn so much tax free income after which one pays a graduated rate of income tax.  It is arbitrary and unfair that a person earning just over £9,000 per annum has to pay a tax levy on every pound earned.  Our second reason for opposing it is that it is dishonest.  It would have been honest to raise the standard rate of tax from 27p to 29p in the pound and call it an increase in income tax.  It is likely that a programme manager, a PR committee or consultancy team claimed it would be much easier to sell a 1 per cent income levy than a 2 per cent increase in the standard rate of tax.  Revenue Com <Col N="261" /> missioners figures indicate that it would cost £78 million to abolish it after the first year and £130 million in a full year. However, most people appear to be working on a figure of £150 million which is not correct unless we are expecting a major increase in incomes next year.</P>
    <P>We were told that the 1 per cent income levy was a temporary measure in the teeth of a currency crisis with volatile and high interest rates, with an increased national debt repayment arising from devaluation and because of the labour pains of putting the Government together.  It now resembles the youth employment and health levies and will become a quasi-permanent feature of our tax structure.  The levy costs the average industrial worker £2.45 a week, irrespective of the person's circumstances.  It is a very crude instrument.  It means that people earning just under £9,000 per year may have to refuse overtime or promotion because they might earn more than £173 per week.</P>
    <P>This levy must be seen in its proper context.  It was part of a budget that also introduced a probate tax and increased VAT on clothing and footwear to 21 per cent.  The figures clearly show that during the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> tax revenues increased from £7.9 billion to £9.5 billion this year and the growth in tax revenues has exceeded the combined rate of the real growth in the economy and inflation. The real burden of taxes is rising substantially. Given this country's special demographic and dependency problems, that is not acceptable.  The core problem in relation to this Government is that it is a high tax and high spending one.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> failed completely and if school leavers are to have better prospects any new centralised agreement must be more akin to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> than to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> During the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> public expenditure increased from 35 pence to 38 pence in the pound, unemployment increased by 39 per cent, or <Col N="262" /> 80,000, and public sector pay increased at a much higher rate than private sector pay.  In 1988 the average industrial wage was £208.33 compared to £237.55 last year.  In the public sector the average wage increased from £278.42 to £381.52, a widening of the gap from 33 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for the Congress of Trade Unions is that SIPTU and the public services committee hold differing views.  Of course a case can be made for individual low paid public servants and in relation to restructuring pay deals, but the 600,000 private sector workers did not have similar access to the special pay deals as public sector workers.  The Congress of Trade Unions is correct to integrate the issues of pay and tax because if the tax code is altered every worker will be affected.  All workers would benefit from the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy.  Increasing real incomes by reducing taxes would mean treating all workers in a similar fashion and the integration of pay and tax is vital in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have taken an unpopular line in relation to the issue of competitiveness and the need for a pay freeze in 1994 but I have done so on the strict understanding that the savings the Government would make from a pay freeze &mdash; we are talking about a 1 per cent increase in public sector pay costing £40 million &mdash; could be used directly to increase living standards by tax cuts.  For example, the tax proposals we put forward would mean a 5 per cent pay increase for the average worker.  On that basis we could ask the social partners to accept a moderate pay deal and people would have more money in their pockets.  What is the point in having major pay increases if they are frittered away in higher taxes?  Competitiveness is vital because the people excluded from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were the school leavers.  The banks negotiated new productivity deals and people in employment were in a strong position, but school leavers could not get jobs and had to emigrate.  Any new deal must take that into account plus the fact that our tax <Col N="263" /> system is a barrier to employment.  The gross cost for every £1 of net pay in new low paid jobs is too high and the majority of new jobs pay under £20,000 per annum.  Therefore, the only way the cost of providing a job can be reduced is to lower income tax.  That would bring equity into the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>A number of changes need to be made and the 1 per cent income levy is only the tip of the iceberg.  I cannot justify a married couple with ten children being entitled to the same tax free allowance as a married couple who do not have any children.  Neither can I justify people earning £72 per week paying tax at 33 pence in the pound.  The exemption limit is too low.  A single person earning less than £90 per week or a married couple earning less than £180 should not have to pay income tax.  If a wife whose husband works takes up a part-time job every pound she earns will be taxed at the marginal rate of 48 pence in the pound because her husband will have used up all the tax free allowances to which she might be entitled.  Such people want to work and jobs are available for them, but the cost is horrendous.  Those are well established problems of the tax burden which bear down excessively on low and middle income workers.  I have not studied the NESC report in detail but it puts forward a similar view.  Many of my party colleagues and I have reservations about a centralised corporative style of Government in which the Government cannot be criticised because matters must be raised with the CRC.  That stifles opposition and debate.  Those issues must be addressed and, in this regard, tax reform should be the cornerstone of any deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if the 1 per cent levy is put on the table and removed, the unions will make another pay demand. This suggests that he does not trust the unions and thinks he will not be able to made a deal.  If the Minister put these costly tax reforms on the table, he could ask the unions what they would be prepared to give in pay moderation and say to them that if they fail to reach agreement, <Col N="264" /> they will be taken off the table.  The Minister could say to the employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister put costed tax reforms on the table he could say to the employers that the Government has narrowed the tax wedge and ask them what they would be prepared to do in terms of employment.  In turn he could ask the trade unions what they would be prepared to give in pay moderation to improve our competitiveness.  If the Minister fails to reach agreement he could say that all bets are off.  There is no one more shrewd or cute &mdash; a former Taoiseach used more adjectives in describing the Minister's ability to make a deal &mdash; than the Minister who knows only too well that if there is trust and good will he could show leadership in dealing with our structural problems with the social partners.  This would have lasting economic benefit.</P>
      <P>This is a missed opportunity.  I do not know if it is a phoney war but I can assure the Minister that my party is adamant that tax reforms must be the cornerstone of any new deal and the first step along this road must be the removal of the 1 per cent levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare gave us a lecture this evening using a prepared script which I am sure she did not read before rising to speak and when she had concluded she rushed out the door.  She did not want to hear the response from Members on this side of the House. Having been elected to this House this time last year on the backs of the unemployed, the elderly and the sick, she <Col N="265" /> wants to forget that she made promises. She stated in her speech:</P>
      <P>Let us deal with the real issues and stop wasting our time dealing with the ghosts of 1992 which some groups are either unwilling or unable to lay to rest.</P>
      <P>The people will not allow her to forget the promises she and her party made around Hallowe'en 1992.  These are the ghosts that are going to haunt her come Hallowe'en 1994 or 1995 or until such time as the dirty dozen cuts are reversed. I will deal with these later.</P>
      <P>Many of the Labour Party Ministers are not socialists.  They used this as a flag of convenience to attain power but once they got a sniff of this they discarded the flag of convenience that they had soldiered under.  This is a matter of regret because many people put their hopes and trust in some of these Ministers who have betrayed the people that supported them in their thousands.  We are now aware of the consequences.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place at the end of a year during which the Government made a two pronged attack on young people by introducing a means-test for European Social Fund grants and grants to third-level colleges and by introducing measures to abolish unemployment assistance for needy students during the summer months.  These socially regressive decisions have caused extreme hardship to young people, mainly from families in the lower paid and middle income groups &mdash; the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>This two pronged attack on young people, coupled with the failure of the Government to address the inequities in the third-level grant scheme has resulted in continued blatant discrimination against the sons and daughters of those in the PAYE sector and the unemployed. These measures, coupled with the introduction of the dirty dozen, have resulted in a serious exclusion of so many families at a time when we are supposed to have a Government with a social conscience. However, I can see no evidence of this. The attitude seems to be that they are in power and forget that they promised to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> In recent months the Government fiddled around with many proposals while the unemployment figure went through the roof.  In real terms, it now stands at more than 300,000.  To date the Government has failed to respond to the proposals made by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, to which reference was made, to introduce an optional work programme which my party supports. This highlights the Government's inactivity and ineffectiveness in responding to this great social problem.  Unemployment, and its social consequences, are growing daily and there is no real evidence of Government determination to deal with these issues.  The social consequences through crime and drug addiction are evident in all major urban areas. The Government seems to be intent on dealing with these issues through highpowered hype rather than through real policy.</P>
    <P>The ongoing negotiations between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a further programme for economic and social progress must be looked at carefully.  We must examine some of the statements arising from the earlier negotiations.  In any new programme priority must be given to the need to address the unemployment crisis. There must be a coherent national strategy to deal with long term unemployment. Any agreement must include measures to provide opportunities for the majority of the long term unemployed. There must be a commitment to reforming the social welfare system.  In this regard we must take into consideration many of the proposals made by the commission. There must be real tax reform and the tax reform package must contain an incentive to work.  These social issues must be addressed in a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement. While this may be a forlorn hope at this stage, any agreement must not just be about wage increases alone.</P>
    <P>Recent statements announcing the elimination of the infamous dirty dozen must be questioned.  I intend to respond to some of the points raised earlier.  To date the Minister for Social Welfare has <Col N="267" /> not specified in this House if the remaining nasty nine cuts of the original dirty dozen have been reversed.  I am sure the Minister will be present in the House tomorrow night to respond to some of the questions I wish to raise.  It is most regrettable that the Labour Party which in November 1992 committed itself to reversing the dirty dozen is now telling us that we should forget that it ever said it.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have often heard the Minister, Deputy Woods, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, say that the 12 cuts have been reversed.  At 1 p.m. one Sunday afternoon I heard on radio that the dirty dozen has been reversed &mdash; hallelujah.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct; I also heard that.  These statements are inaccurate, misleading and &mdash; I will use the word &mdash; untruthful.  The truth is that just three of the famous cuts have been reversed while, as I said, the nastiest nine which affect women are still in place.  The Labour Party has shown again that in Government it will allow itself to be walked over in order to retain the trappings of power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare should clarify once and for all tomorrow night in the House (1) whether reduced minimum pay for maternity benefit remains and that only women currently in employment are eligible; (2) whether injury benefit has been reduced by £15 per week and is at the same level as disability benefit; (3) whether maintenance orders for spouses and children are recoupable from lone parent payments; (4) whether those under 55 who have been made redundant and received a payment of £12,000 or more are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for nine weeks; (5) whether alleviation payments have been completely abolished; (6) whether in respect of the supplementary welfare allowance the first £5 has to be paid by the claimant; (7) whether deserted wives' <Col N="268" /> benefit is means-tested if a person is earning more than £10,000 a year; (8) the position in regard to part-time workers &mdash; what we were given tonight was a recipe to confuse the House &mdash; and (9) the position in regard to exceptional needs payments.</P>
    <P>The statements tonight in regard to these payments were misleading.  It was stated that they had been withdrawn.  The position is that an agreement has been put in place covering payments to the ESB and An Bord Gáis but the Minister should clarify the position in regard to mortgage and rent subsidies.  There are many examples of people affected by the Minister's original circular and the statements made in this House were designed to mislead.</P>

      <P>In requesting a review of the IDA's operations in Cork, I am conscious of how difficult it is for the authority to attract mobile international investment to Ireland.  However, when 1,800 jobs bypass the Cork area in the space of 18 months alarm bells ring and it behoves us, as public representatives, to ask why.  The 1,800 jobs were made up of 200 jobs in Synorgen which went to Holland, 600 jobs in Valence which went to Belfast, 600 jobs in Johnson &amp; Johnson which went to Limerick and 450 jobs in Louisiana Pacific which went to Waterford. Is it not totally inexplicable that in such a short space of time so many jobs should bypass Cork?  Some went to foreign locations and perhaps the Minister will say that we should be very glad to have others within the country.  When 200 jobs in Synorgen went to Holland it was indicated that there might have been an under-the-counter deal to attract the company there.  We accepted at face value the fact that this company went to Holland.  However, Valence indicated clearly that it wanted to set up in Cork and asked the IDA to point out a project <Col N="269" /> team for them.  The IDA looked for and got planning permission for the project. Now the company has gone to Belfast.  It is extraordinary that when the company was coming to Cork it was offering 300 jobs.  When it decided to locate in Belfast there were 600 jobs and the principals of Valence said the reason they went to Belfast was that the IDA was dragging its feet.  To date no substantial reason has been given for this.</P>
      <P>We know about the projects that bypassed Cork.  What about the ones about which we know nothing?  It is possible that the job numbers far exceed 1,800. With 30,000 people in the Cork area unemployed the Minister can understand our concerns about the ramifications, and that others will slip the net.  If a fisherman puts out his net and finds a great haul of fish he will pull it in.  If, having pulled in the net, he finds that all the fish have slipped out, he knows it is time for an investigation.  Will the Minister ask the IDA what exactly is happening in Cork? It might be that there are weaknesses in the system that can be easily rectified.</P>
      <P>Given what has happened in the Cork area, I ask the Minister to treat Cork as being in crisis and an area deserving of special attention for mobile international investment in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): Ba mhaith liom leathscéal a ghabháil thar ceann an Aire Fiontraíochta agus Fostaíochta os rud é nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas bheith anseo anocht.  The Minister does not have any plans to carry out a review of the IDA's operations in Cork.  He is satisfied that the Authority is doing everything possible to assist in the development of indigenous industries and the attraction of overseas investment to the Cork area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that decisions regarding the location of projects are ultimately made by intending investors following detailed examination of potential sites throughout Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding on a location, a number of factors are taken into consideration by <Col N="270" /> the promoters, such as availability of port facilities, access to rail and road networks, proximity to European markets, availability of appropriate skills and the location of sources of raw materials.  The Minister is satisfied that, as a general rule, Cork compares favourably with other parts of the country in so far as the above criteria are concerned.  Indeed, since 1987 Cork has secured a reasonable share of the overseas projects which have been won for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The city of Cork is home to a number of significant overseas-owned companies, including Apple Computer Ltd., and Bourns Electronics Ireland, which together employ in excess of 1,500 people.</P>
    <P>There have been 91 site visits to the Cork area so far this years, compared to 97 visits for the same period last year. However, the number of return visits by intending promoters is twice what it was last year.</P>
    <P>Both Cork city and the Cork region in general are home to a number of developing Irish companies.  The trend in small business in Cork is upward, despite some inevitable closures.  In 1992, small business contributed significantly to job creation in Cork.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Industrial Development Act, 1993, work is now underway to complete the preparation of the restructuring of the IDA and EOLAS.  The Government intends that the new agencies, FORFÁS, FORBAIRT and IDA Ireland, will commence operations at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>FORFÁS will provide overall policy advice and co-ordination, FORBAIRT will concentrate on indigenous industry and IDA Ireland will focus on overseas industry.  However, the establishment of the new agencies is not being done in isolation.  It forms part of our overall strategy, as contained in the document. <i>Employment through Enterprise</i>, which sets out a comprehensive approach to the generation of industrial development and job creation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental thrust of the agency restructuring is to recognise that the developmental needs of indigenous and <Col N="271" /> overseas firms are different.  While our financial and taxation incentives are the main vehicle for attracting overseas firms to Ireland, indigenous companies need far more direct assistance in areas like management, technology and finance.</P>
    <P>A significant, and increasing, amount of State support for small business is already provided in the management development, R &amp; D and feasibility study areas.  Such grant support is designed to help companies become more competitive and better positioned to meet future challenges.</P>
    <P>The State agencies are working closely with local communities to develop enterprise and to create jobs in Cork city.  In the case of the IDA specifically, their marketing efforts have been enhanced with the addition of a new promotional video on the region, sponsored by AIB, and a new regional map which has been sponsored by Bank of Ireland.  I would like to pay tribute to both banks for their sponsorship of these important initiatives.</P>
    <P>There is a strong regional dimension to our industrial policy, with regions seeking to maximize development in those areas where they have a comparative advantage.  As Deputy O'Keeffe is aware, Cork is home to a number of high technology projects.  The Cork Business and Technology Park at the Model Farm Road is being developed as a prestige location for high technology industry and will enhance Cork's prospects for further high technology projects in the future.  The first phase of the development, a 40 acre landscaped site, one mile from University College, Cork, and within walking distance of the Cork Regional Technical College, EOLAS, FÁS and IDA's regional office.  A further 80 acres, owned by Cork Corporations, will be developed by the IDA in a similar style to accommodate complementary industries.</P>
    <P>Ten per cent of the national software industry is based in Cork.  Of the 25 firms in the region which have received grant assistance, 19 are Irish owned.  I am pleased that the IDA has allocated a staff <Col N="272" /> member in Cork to deal specifically with the development of the software industry in the area.</P>
    <P>Cork remains one of the most attractive locations for the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors.  Much attention has been devoted to the environmental issue in Cork.  I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that the Government is determined that all chemical and pharmaceutical plants in the Cork region will operate to the highest national and international standards.</P>
    <P>The IDA and FÁS are represented on all four county enterprise boards in Cork, including the Cork City board.  The county enterprise initiative is now up and running, following a period which necessitated a wide range of consultation with a great many interests at national and local level.  The initiative will promote job creation and will aim to do so by providing funding support for small enterprise development.  The Government is determined to achieve our objective of developing indigenous resources to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The full range of FÁS services is available in Cork with the employment services office providing a placement service for employers and unemployed persons seeking employment.  That office also administers the various employment schemes, such as the social employment scheme, which is directed at the long term unemployed.  The training centre provides the usual range of training courses directed at the long term unemployed and early school leavers.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Minister is satisfied that the IDA is doing everything possible to assist in the development of indigenous industries and the attraction of overseas investment to the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I will bring Deputy O'Keeffe's views to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat a <Col N="273" /> Cheann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a tharraingt anuas sa Dáil anocht.  Tá súil agam go bhfaighidh mé freagra iomlán ón Aire a thaispeánfaidh cad díreach iad na rialacha a chaithfí cloí leo chun go gceadófaí iarratas faoi scéim na mbóithre áise atá á reachtáil ag a Roinn.  Tá sé teipthe ormsa a fháil amach cad iad na rialacha a chuirtear i bhfeidhm nuair a déantar cinneadh na deontais seo a thabhairt amach.  Tá mé ag cur i leith Aire na Gaeltachta agus cibé Airí eile atá ag obair ann agus a thugann tacaíocht don cleasaíocht seo, go bhfuil gaimbíneachas ar siúl ag an Aire ó thaobh tabhairt amach na ndeontais seo.  Tá an Aire féin ag tabhairt léachtanna do scoláirí in Ollscoil na Gaillimhe faoi ghaimbíneachas agus anois feictear domsa go bhfuil sé á chleachtadh taobh istigh dá Roinn féin.</P>
      <P>Is dócha gurb é an rud is mó a theastaíonn ó dhaoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu amuigh faoin dtuath ná go mbeadh bóthar ceart suas go dtí a dtithe.  Tá scéim amháin ann gur féidir leat iarratas a chur síos, agus a chur ar aghaidh go dtí an Comhairle Chontae ar Local Improvement Scheme Form.  Tá sé sin á dhéanamh agus i nGaillimh bíonn ort fanacht ceithre bliana ar a laghad sula dtabharfaí ofráil deontais duit chun an bóthar a dheisiú.  Ansin caithfidh tú íoc as cuid mhaith den bóthar tú féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1992, de réir freagra a tugadh sa Dáil ar 25 Feabhra 1993, tugadh amach £368,000 do na contaetha sa Ghaeltacht.  Fuair Gaillimh £83,000, Corcaigh £18,000, Contae na Mí £14,000, Maigh Eo £60,000, Ciarraí £35,000 agus Dún na nGall £158,000.  Níl aon riail leagtha síos chun a dhearbhú an bhfuil tú i dteideal an deontas seo a fháil nó nach bhfuil.  Tá an tAire ag dul thart ar Dhún na nGall agus ar fud na nGaeltachtaí eile cosúil le Santa Claus ag iarraidh deontais a thabhairt amach roimh an Nollaig, sin an t-am a dhéanann sé iad de ghnáth, agus tá mise ag cur ina leith anois go gcaithfí an scannal seo a stopadh láithreach. Ní chuirfidh muintir na Gaeltachta nó muintir na hÉireann suas leis an mbealach seo atá airgead an phobail á <Col N="274" /> chaitheamh ag an Roinn.  Tá sin á chur i leith an Aire agus tá súil agam go bhfuil freagra iomlán aige air mar níl sé le feiceáil cad díreach atá i gceist nuair a bhíonn sé ag tabhairt iad seo amach ach amháin go bhfuil sé fábharach nó báúil dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an deontas a fháil.</P>
    <P>Cinnte, éinne a fhaigheann an deontas seo bíonn áthas an domhain air.  Ach feictear domsa nach bhfuil an riachtanas atá i gceist á chur i bhfeidhm chor ar bith. Tá daoine ag déanamh gearáin liomsa go bhfuil deontais á thabhairt i leith bóithre ar a bhfuil teach amháin agus go bhfuil bóithre eile in a bhfuil, abair dosaen tithe, agus an bóthar go huafásach, potholes móra ann, agus iad ag fanacht na blianta ag iarraidh iad a dheisiú ach is cuma leis an Roinn faoi na bóithre sin mar go bhfuil cúiseanna eile ar fad nach bhfuil leagtha síos in aon áit.</P>
    <P>Tá Comptroller and Auditor General ann.  Tá Committee of Public Accounts ann agus caithfidh siad breathnú isteach sa cheist seo chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear deireadh leis an gcleasaíocht, leis an scannal agus leis an gaimbíneachas atá ar siúl taobh istigh de Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir le tabhairt amach na ndeontas le haghaidh na mbóithre áise ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó ama agam chun dul ar ais go dtí deireadh na seachtóidí agus na n-ochtóidí suas go dtí an bhliain atá inniu ann agus na figiúirí go léir a thabhairt nuair nach raibh Gaeltachtaí éagsúla sa tír seo ag fáil cothrom na Féinne.  Má chuirimid na blianta go léir le chéile, b'fhéidir gur cheart iad go léir a thabhairt le chéile, gan a bheith ag tabhairt bliain amháin amach as na blianta go léir agus ag iarraidh milleán a chur ar dhaoine.  Mar b'fhéidir gurb é an freagra atá ar seo ná go bhfuil caighdeán na mbóithre i gceantair éagsúla i bhfad níos measa ná bóithre eile.</P>
      <P>Ach tabharfaidh mé freagra i dtosach ar an gceist a chuir an Teachta:</P>
      <P>Na bunrialacha a gcaithfear cloí leo chun go gceadófaí iarratas faoi Scéim na mBóithre Áise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Faoi mar is eol don Teachta, is chun freastal go príomha ar bhóithre áise agus portaigh nach bhfuil na húdaráis áitiúla freagrach as a gcothabháil, a dheisiú nó a fheabhsú a ceapadh Scéim na mBóithre de chuid mo Roinne-se.</P>
    <P>De ghnáth mura mbíonn bóthar ag freastal ar dhá theach cónaithe ar a laghad, nó ag freastal ar dheich líon tí i gcás bóthair portaigh nó talún, níl sé cáilithe chun críche deontais faoi Scéim mo Roinne-se.  Cuirtear ceist na Gaeilge agus an gá atá leis an obair san áireamh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Bíonn ar iarratasóirí foirm iarratais a chomhlánú ach ní bhíonn orthu aon chuid den chostas a sheasamh.  Ní miste a lua chomh maith go dtugtar cúnamh ó am go chéile i gcásanna eisceachtúla i leith bóithre contae agus, sna cásanna sin, bíonn ar an údarás áitiúil céad codán de chostas na hoibre &mdash; 50 faoin gcéad de ghnáth &mdash; a sheasamh.</P>
    <P>De ghnáth ó thaobh Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe de caitear nó caitheadh an chuid is mó den airgead ar na bóithre chontae agus dá bhrí sin fuair siad 50 faoin gcéad eile.  Agus sin á dhéanamh ní mhaithfidh mé don Teachta Molloy an gearán a rinne sé faoi sin.  Bhí cruinniú i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe i mbliana agus bhí na hionadaithe poiblí ann agus chuir siad liosta isteach go dtí mo Roinn.  Tá an liosta sin scrúdaithe agam agus tá súil agam go mbeidh mé ábalta airgead a chur ar fáil chun an chuid is mó de na bóithre sin a dheisiú go luath.  Go fíor-annamh, tugtar cúnamh do choistí áitiúla chun bóithre a dheisiú, go háirithe nuair a bhíonn scéim SES i bhfeidhm.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn i bhfad níos mó iarratais ag mo Roinnse ná mar atáthar in ann freastal orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ag an Aire agus agam féin ar an scéim faoi láthair agus tógfaidh méa bhfuil ráite ag an Teachta san áireamh san athbhreithniú sin.</P>
    <P>Ach ba mhaith liom a rá gur trua nach bhfuil cóip de seo ag an Teachta Molloy. Tá seo ag dul ar ais go dtí 1983 ach b'fhéidir go mb'fhearr dul ar ais go dtí 1978, 1979, suas go dtí 1993, agus go <Col N="276" /> bhfaighimís amach an méid a caitheadh i ngach Gaeltacht sa tír seo le haghaidh na mblianta sin.  In a dhiaidh sin bheinnse sásta teacht isteach anseo agus an cheist a phlé.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Education, but I am extremely disappointed that neither the Minister for Health nor his Minister of State thought it worth their while to come in and take this issue.</P>
      <P>At 2 p.m. this afternoon my office rang the mother of a severely autistic 13 year old child in County Mayo, whose case I raised on the Adjournment on 7 October 1993, to tell her we had succeeded in again raising the matter on the Adjournment. On two occasions the telephone was not responded to, when the call was eventually taken the mother of the child was in tears.  She had been unable to get to the telephone for the two previous calls as she was in the house on her own struggling with the child and unable to contain her.  This is the reality for this mother and indeed for the father.  Apart from the three days a week when the child gets limited schooling from 9.30 a.m. to 2.45 p.m., the mother and father are prisoners in their own home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out previously, Pauline will be 14 years old next month.  She is mentally handicapped and very emotionally disturbed.  Since the age of five she <Col N="277" /> was catered for on a daily basis by the Brothers of Charity, Boyle, County Roscommon, to whom enormous credit is due for the level of service they provided. However, one and a half years ago the Brothers of Charity notified Pauline's parents that they could no longer cope with her.  As she was extremely strong and given to tantrums, they could no longer devote the physical resources on a daily basis to cope with her.  An arrangement was put in place whereby the Brothers of Charity kindly agreed to employ two women to look after Pauline in their own home on a Monday to Friday basis and they paid for this service. However, eight weeks ago the two women notified the Brothers of Charity and Pauline's parents that they could no longer provide custody and care for her.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the House, Pauline is literally uncontrollable.  She has the strength of an adult and two people are required to contain and restrain her at all times.  Everything within reach is in danger, and plates, implements and pieces of furniture regularly become missiles.  Some tantrums even lead to biting.  Everything I have said has been verified time and again by the social worker.  Pauline needs urgent residential care now as she is seriously at risk.</P>
    <P>It was acknowledged by the Minister of State in the House that this girl has severe behavioural problems.  It was pointed out that a case conference was held on Thursday, 30 September 1993, attended by the health board's area medical officer and social worker as well as the child's parents and representatives of the Western Care Association.  It was also pointed out that the Western Care Association was considering placing the child in its new facility in Foxford.  On the day I raised the matter in the Dáil a further meeting took place between the Brothers of Charity and the Western Care Association.  The Western Care Association has done its work and identified a place where Pauline can go to school.  It also identified a residential place where she can stay and be cared for on a one to one basis in the evening and at night.  A report and the costing for <Col N="278" /> same was sent by fax from the Western Health Board to the office of the Minister for Health on 15 November.  Since then nothing has happened.  My office has telephoned the Minister's office almost on a daily basis, but there has been no response.</P>
    <P>The result is that apart from the 15 hours 45 minutes Pauline spends in school, she is in the total care of her parents for the remaining 142 hours 15 minutes of each week.  This is not acceptable. The Minister for Health is failing in his duty to provide an adequate level of service for this child and her parents.  I ask the Minister to personally convey to the Minister for Health that unless finance is provided to the Western Care Association for the necessary facilities, for a place specially identified for Pauline, I will personally deliver Pauline to the office of the Minister for Health so that he can make the necessary arrangements in due fulfilment of his duty as Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health it has to be acknowledged that the Deputy has taken a personal interest in this child and has already raised the case in the House.  The Deputy will be aware that the child in question who is 13 years of age has a severe mental handicap, autism, and severe behavioural problems.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, the provision of mental handicap services in County Mayo is the responsibility of the Western Health Board.  Services for people with autism in the Western Health Board area are provided mainly by the Western Care Association on an agency basis for the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case conference was held on Thursday, 30 September 1993 involving the health board, the child's parents and representatives of the Western Care Association. A further meeting was held on 7 October 1993 between the Brothers of Charity and the Western Care Association to discuss the needs of the child. Arising from the meeting of the case conference, the Western Care Association <Col N="279" /> has identified an appropriate day placement in a special unit within a special school.  This placement will require a support person in the school with specific responsibility for the child.  In addition, a residential placement has been identified which will require a one to one staffing ratio both day and night, seven days a week.</P>
    <P>The Western Care Association submitted an estimate of the cost associated with the child's residential placement and day service requirements to the Western Health Board on 12 November.  The cost involved was exceptionally high and the health board is currently involved in intensive discussions with the association in relation to its costings.  The health board has asked Western Care to examine its current case-load with a view to redeploying resources to meeting some of the requirements of this urgent case. This would complement the crisis intervention service currently being provided by the Brothers of Charity.  A further option in regard to funding of residential placement for this child is also under active consideration.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the urgency of this case and the concern of the Deputy about the matter.  I would like to assure the Deputy that every possible effort is being made to find a satisfactory solution and the Minister will communicate with the Deputy as soon as he has been informed of progress in regard to the care options. In the meantime, the Brothers of Charity are providing a limited crisis intervention service of 18 hours per week until the end of December.  The child is collected from her home at 9 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and cared for in Glaneven Child Development Centre until 3.30 p.m.  In addition, I understand that the family have availed of a weekend service provided by the Brothers on a number of occasions during the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>As I said, the provision of mental handicap services is primarily a matter for the Western Health Board and these services are funded by the board and by a number of voluntary bodies including <Col N="280" /> the Brothers of Charity and Western Care Association.  The total allocation from the Department of Health for services for persons with a mental handicap in the Western Health Board area is £27.8 million, this includes a special additional allocation of £158,000 which the Minister for Health made during the year to meet particular difficulties which arose in the area.  This funding is in addition to that provided by the Department of Education and from the European Social Fund.  In view of this level of expenditure it is hoped that the health board and the agencies involved can come together and make appropriate arrangements for the care of this person.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that in association with the development of services for people with a mental handicap, it is intended to ensure that a comprehensive service is provided for people with autism.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Department of Health's mental handicap adviser prepared a discussion paper on the care of persons with autism.  The purpose of this paper was to help clarify thinking on the current and future needs of persons with autism and the development of appropriate services for them within the overall framework of the mental handicap services. The discussion paper was widely circulated for comment to organisations and individuals with an interest in autism in April 1993 and a response has been received from large numbers of groups and individuals, including Western Care and the Western Health Board.  The discussion document is now being reviewed in the light of the comments received with a view to producing a clear policy document for the development of services for people with autism.  I will, of course, convey to the Minister for Health the sentiments and anxieties expressed by Deputy Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to <Col N="281" /> raise this matter on the Adjournment and to the Minister for being present in the House to reply.</P>
      <P>Scotopic sensitivity syndrome is a visual, perceptual dysfunction which affects people's ability to read and write. Those affected are unable to read as well as people with normal eyesight and are hampered by headaches, tiredness, discomfort, sore eyes and an inability to concentrate on the work at hand.  People suffering from SSS misread words, skip lines, have poor hand writing and little or no co-ordination.  Children with this disorder have been referred to as lazy, dumb, stupid or thick.  The Minister should take serious note of this problem which affects many children.  It is estimated that up to 30 per cent of children with reading difficulties in remedial classes suffer from SSS.  This estimate is based on assessments carried out in schools where there is provision for screening.  However, as the Minister is aware, there is no provision for screening in many schools.  A comprehensive investigation into this syndrome is urgently required as figures to hand are somewhat incomplete.</P>
      <P>The SSS treatment developed by Helen Irlen consists of altering problem light waves by using coloured filters or coloured overlays.  The Irlen Clinic for learning disabilities is helping to treat the syndrome by providing coloured lenses which have been of benefit to many children to date.  However, these glasses cost approximately £200 and are beyond the means of many parents.  Research into this syndrome is advancing at a steady pace, proving beyond doubt the success of the Irlen filters as a method of treatment for SSS.  However, screening procedures must be incorporated into the support structures available and it is in this area that a positive response from the Minister would be most beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remedial teachers, in conjunction with psychologists, should be in a position to carry out the necessary screening as part of their normal remit.  This is not happening at present.  It is of the utmost importance that the Department of Education, the body charged with overall <Col N="282" /> responsibility for design, lighting and textbook production, would be sensitive to the needs of these children.  Much is made in the Green Paper on Education of the need to cater for disadvantaged school children.  Children suffering from SSS are seriously disadvantaged in comparison to their classmates.  It is clear that children suffering from SSS cannot achieve their full potential because their ability to read is adversely affected.  Without the benefit of treatment many school children will go through the educational system grossly disadvantaged and will continue to underperform in spite of remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance that the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Health, will work together to devise a strategy to help these children as a matter of urgency.  In conclusion, I want to quote from a poem written by a child suffering from SSS:</P>
    <P>Bs and Ds look the same to me</P>
    <P>And so do Ps and Qs.</P>
    <P>Ns and Us I always confuse.</P>
    <P>And Ms and Ws.</P>

    <P>They make me want to shout.</P>
    <P>The teachers tell me I must try.</P>
    <P>I try, I try, I try.</P>
    <P>It hurts my head, it hurts, it hurts</P>
    <P>And then I start to cry.</P>
    <P>An urgent response by the Minister to this problem is necessary.</P>

      <P>Scotopic sensitivity syndrome is presented by the promoters of Irlen lenses as a neuro-perceptual disorder preventing sufferers from making normal progress in learning to read.  The theory is that certain children are sensitive to some light wavelengths, which cause distortion <Col N="283" /> in their perception of symbols against backgrounds of a particular colour.  To date the existence of such a syndrome has not been proven, nor can any neurological or physiological basis for it be found.</P>
      <P>The promoters of Irlen lenses in Ireland have provided research reports to support their contention that these lenses could help certain children suffering from specific reading disability to learn to read.  The claim that up to 75 per cent of children who have specific reading disability are scotopically sensitive. Examination of the sources quoted reveals that much of the evidence is based on research which has not been carried out under rigorous scientific conditions. My Department has reviewed recent research carried out on the Irlen theory and the position is that there is no firm evidence to support the existence of scotopic sensitivity syndrome or the contention that reading problems are in any way alleviated by the use of coloured filters or Irlen lenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that using coloured filters may alleviate visual discomfort for some people.  However, this was known <Col N="284" /> long before Irlen lenses appeared on the market and I understand that such filters can be prescribed by ophthalmologists at a fraction of the cost of the Irlen therapy. Therefore, the use of Irlen lenses cannot be recommended until conclusive proof from rigorous scientific research is available that tinted glasses can help poor reading performance.</P>
    <P>Under section 66 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards provide child health clinics and national school health examinations at which screening for ophthalmic defects, among other conditions, is carried out.  The health boards provide free of charge appropriate treatment and appliances in respect of any defects noticed at these examinations, including where necessary referrals to specialist consultants.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, Irish banks are independent commercial organisations who are ultimately responsible to their shareholders.  However, I have taken every opportunity to remind the banks of the important role they can play in Irish economic development.</P>
      <P>The response of the banks has been positive and a number of schemes have been established to help new and existing business.</P>
      <P>In 1989, in response to an initiative by my predecessor, the commercial banks agreed to provide up to £10 million in loans to young entrepreneurs on certain terms.  The main feature of these terms was that the loan would be at a reduced rate of interest and the banks would not demand personal security on these loans.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the four associated banks agreed to provide a further £15 million in loans at favourable rates for the creation or development of small and medium sized businesses with employment potential.  This was within the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>To date this promise of £25 million has been exceeded by the banks and more than £28 million has been advanced to over 400 projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="64" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 31 together.  Regarding Question No. 20, I take it that Deputy Bruton is referring to the Steering Committee set up to monitor the progress of the Pension Fund Investment report which was launched last week.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Bruton that I did not establish the Steering Committee concerned.  The report was commissioned by the Irish Association of Pension Funds and was carried out under their auspices.  I agreed that my Department would participate in the Steering Committee which the IAPF established to work with the consultants on the report.  The Steering Committee also included nominees of the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>I think the wording of the Deputy's question suggests that the initiative which I launched in my Budget Statement last February has in some way threatened the interests of pensioners.  I want to categorically refute that.  Unfounded rumours have been circulating about the initiative since its inception, to the effect that the initiative was in reality nothing short of a tax or levy on pension funds and pensioners and that pension funds were being forced to invest in high risk projects with little expectation of a return commensurate with that risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me state clearly in this House that there is no basis whatsoever for either of these suggestions.  This is not a tax on pension funds or pensioners; they are simply being asked to make funds available for a particular area of investment. Moreover, there is no question, and never has been, of the Government asking pension funds to invest on anything other than a commercial basis.  The purpose of the initiative is quite simply to improve the availability of equity finance to Irish business so that the spirit of enterprise is not frustrated and job creation hindered by a lack of funds for good projects.  To that end pension funds are being asked to provide a funding facility for commercial ventures the scale <Col N="65" /> of which represents a very small percentage of the vast assets at their disposal. I would stress the word commercial and I would stress the words funding facility &mdash; there is no element of uncommerciality or compulsion involved.</P>
    <P>Regarding representation on the Steering Committee, while representatives of pensioners were not specifically on the Committee, I would point out that the views and interests of pensioners were taken into account in a number of ways. As I mentioned, there was representation of employee and employer groupings, both of whom would have a keen interest in the well-being of pension arrangements. Most importantly the Irish Association of Pension Funds itself represents the interests of a broad cross section of employers, pension fund trustees and professional advisers engaged in the establishment, administration and investment of occupational pension schemes in Ireland.  As the main trustees representative organisation the Association was well placed to ensure that the interests of trustees and therefore of pension fund scheme members, including pensioners were clearly voiced.  As the Deputy knows, the management and operation of funded pension schemes is governed by the Pensions Act 1990, by trust law, by individual pension scheme documents and by various Finance Acts. Primary responsibility for the proper operation of pension schemes rests with the trustees who owe a legal duty of care to all members.  It is the trustees' responsibility to ensure that schemes are properly funded, properly administered and properly and prudently invested in accordance with the rules of each scheme.  It is in this way that the long term interests of members and pensioners are protected.  Nothing in my budget initiative or in the recent Pension Fund Investment report compromises these duties.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that as part of their wide-ranging research into the Pension Fund and Venture Capital areas, the authors of the report met with a number of individual pension fund trustees and with a number of pensioner representative <Col N="66" /> bodies.  The Deputy can rest assured, therefore, that the particular views and concerns of both trustee and pensioners were made available to the authors of the report.</P>
    <P>I would add, that the results of the Pension Fund Investment report itself, more than anything else, should reassure Pension Fund Trustees and indeed pensioners. The report makes it clear that investment in venture and development capital will not take place unless both trustees and their investment managers believe it is prudent.  It also states that there is no reason why, if venture capital investment is underpinned by appropriate specialised skills and expertise, trustees responsibilities cannot be fulfilled through such investments.  It concludes, that it is appropriate that pension fund money should be made available by trustees for investment in venture and development capital if investments are made on a commercial basis.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that the 1993 cost of <Col N="67" /> issuing tax clearance certificates will be in the region of £800,000.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of the business community with regard to difficulties experienced in obtaining tax clearance certificates.  Unfortunately earlier this year there was some delay in the issue of certificates.  This position is now being corrected and the time taken to issue tax certificates has been reduced from 8 weeks to 2 weeks.  Measures are being taken to reduce this period further.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of tax clearance for excise licences, the seasonal nature of demand can give rise to a peak over a short period and in these circumstances the issue of tax clearance certificates may take a little longer.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the business community's difficulty with the requirement to have a separate tax clearance certificate for each public authority.  This issue has been raised by the Task Force on Small Business and a tax clearance certificate valid for one year and effective for all purposes has been suggested.  This proposal is currently under consideration by the Revenue Commissioners and in my Department.  Any proposals for improving procedures from the Deputy or from interested parties would be taken into account as part of that consideration.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> did not contain any jobs targets for the overall economy.  However, our employment performance over the last three years has been very good.  Between 1990 and 1993, the level of employment was maintained in the face of prolonged recession experienced by many of our trading partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the <Col N="68" /> reply given by the Taoiseach on 12 October last, in which he outlined the considerable progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Employment set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Over the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP) i.e. from 1991 to 1993, the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill which covers the cost to the Exchequer of pay and pensions of civil servants, the Oireachtas, the defence forces and gardaí together with the amounts included for pay and pensions in allocations to the health and education services and non-commercial state sponsored bodies increased by an estimated £878 million or 28 per cent.  Of this amount,</P>
    <P>&mdash;pay increases directly attributable to the general increases due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself account for an estimated £350 million despite the arrangements made to defer payment of the full amounts due for budgetary reasons;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a number of special pay increases which had been deferred for payment by virtue of arrangements made during the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> were subsequently agreed for payment in the course of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> at an estimated cost of £312 million; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;other provisions for increased costs covering such matters as service improvements in health and education, increments and technical adjustments accounted for the balance of £216 million. </P>
    <P>The carryover cost of restoring the 3.75 per cent third phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases from 1 December next and the cost of meeting arrears due to the imposition of ceilings of £5 per week and £6.50 per week on the second and third phases of 3 per cent in 1992 and 3.75 per cent in 1993 will amount to £186 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>Meeting these commitments to public servants caused formidable budgetary <Col N="69" /> problems during the lifetime of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It became necessary to reschedule payment from time to time in order to enable the Government to continue its responsible approach to overall management of the public finances which itself is a primary objective of the macroeconomic strategy set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and agreed with the social partners. The fact that this was achieved within the consensus arrangements underpinning the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a tribute to all concerned.</P>

    <P>While the allocation of EC aid made <Col N="71" /> under the recent EC Commission decision is less than the figure on which the National Development Plan was based it still would allow for a total EC contribution of between £7 and £8 billion.

    <P>On 8 October when the National Development Plan was formally submitted to the Commission, Commissioner Millan informed the Minister for Finance and I that he was having difficulty with the share out of structural funds and he could not envisage a total of £7.84 billion being guaranteed.

    <P>On the margins of the informal ECOFIN on 9 October, President Delors indicated to the Minister for Finance that there were problems in relation to the share out between the four cohesion countries and these called into question the allocation expected by Ireland.

      <Quest>if his Department has worked out a model or formula to assess the likely effects on income tax revenue and on the Exchequer generally of general increases in pay across the economy, of income tax increases and of the introduction of special employment levies; the estimated annual increase in income tax revenue which would result from each 1 per cent increase in pay applied generally across all employments; the cost of abolishing the 1 per cent income levy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has participated in the development of an economic model to assist in policy evaluation, and uses it for that purpose.  While this model has met strict refereeing criteria, all such models, however complex in design, are by definition a simplification of the real world; and must be used with due exercise of judgment and caution against mechanical interpretation of their output.  Subject to this caveat, I will outline what the model suggests in respect of the issues in the question.</P>
      <P>Because pay changes affect competitiveness, and competitiveness effects are largely felt in the medium term, I will put my response to the question of an economy-wide increase in pay in a medium term setting.  If pay, economy-wide, were to rise by 1 per cent per annum faster than some benchmark for a six year period, then in the final year of that period PAYE receipts might be of the order of £150 million higher than otherwise.  However, Exchequer borrowing in that year might also be of the order of £150 million higher, and total employment as much as 20,000 lower.</P>
      <P>The model would suggest that the net, full year, cost to the Exchequer of abolishing the 1 per cent income levy might approach £120 million.  The gross full year cost is £145 million.</P>
      <P>While the caveat I have mentioned would caution against regarding any of the foregoing model based assessments as precise answers, I am satisfied that they reflect the broad order of magnitude involved in taking the actions concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 34 and 72 together.  I assume that the questions relate to a story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 10 November 1993.  The story has no reliable basis in fact.  The Commissioner for Regional Policy and the Commission officials involved in the negotiations have confirmed this to be the case.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan will form the basis for negotiations with the EC Commission which will culminate in agreement on the Community Support Framework (CSF) for Ireland.  The CSF will represent the Community's response to the Plan and will set out the agreed development priorities, the forms of assistance and the indicative financing plan.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are likely to take several months and it is expected that the CSF will be agreed early in 1994.  I am confident of a successful outcome to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>At this stage only preliminary discussions have taken place and to date they have dealt solely with issues of clarification. The Commission services are still engaged in internal consultations and have not yet adopted their negotiating mandate.  Thus, no formal Commission views on the substance of the Plan have been conveyed to us.</P>

      <Col N="75" /> I recognise fully the economic benefits that will flow from the infrastructural elements of the Plan.  One must have regard also to the benefits that will flow from the other investments in areas such as the development of industry, services, natural resources, human resources and local development initiatives.  The allocation of resources between categories and the phasing of expenditure as set out in the Plan reflect the Government's best judgement of the appropriate balance between priorities.  The Government are satisfied that the Plan as put forward represents a balanced, coherent and integrated package geared to secure the optimum return in terms of growth and employment.</P>

      <P>The INTERREG programme is a Community initiative designed to assist the border regions of the Community overcome problems of peripherality and underdevelopment and to encourage cross-border co-operation.  In the Irish context we have a joint programme with Northern Ireland.  It covers counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth and all of Northern Ireland with the exception of Belfast.  The programme provides grants for a variety of projects in the tourism, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, human resources, environmental protection, community development and infrastructural areas.  It also assists organisations and companies on both sides of the border such as the chambers of commerce to come together in joint marketing and economic development measures.</P>

      <P>Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Noel Dempsey TD, announces plans for proposed Visitor Centres at Mullaghmore, County Clare; Luggala, County Wicklow and The Boyne Valley, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Mr. Noel Dempsey TD, Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, today (22 November 1993) made public his decisions regarding the plans for visitor centres at Mullaghmore, County Clare; Luggala, County Wicklow and the Boyne Valley, County Meath.  Before announcing the substance of the decision, Mr. Dempsey described the background to his decisions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On June 2 this year the Government decided that before applying for planning permission for the three centres in Clare, Wicklow and Meath, the Office of Public Works should consult widely.  Following that decision, I instructed the Office of Public Works to engage in the &lsquo;widest possible consultation&rsquo;.  The consultative process which followed involved a two-way flow of information.  As well as giving out clear and accurate information about the proposed centres and the philosophy behind them, we also set up structures to facilitiate extensive feedback from the public,&rdquo; said Minister Dempsey.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works delivered a comprehensive fact sheet to thousands of homes in the areas concerned, each newsletter containing a questionnaire to facilitate public feedback.  The Office of Public Works held meetings with interested groups and set up a series of local exhibitions in each area, which were manned by Office of Public Works personnel. There was also a freephone line open to the public on which to register comments.</P>
    <P>During the two month consultation period, the Minister received 1,363 written submissions ranging from one page letters to substantial and well researched documents.  Each of these submissions was read by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed his gratitude to all who made submissions, written or oral, and was particularly pleased at the manner in which submissions were made. Previously, he said, the debate had involved an unnecessary and unhelpful level of acrimony which has, in most quarters, been replaced by calm consultation. &ldquo;I am confident&rdquo; said Mr. Dempsey, &ldquo;that following this extensive <Col N="78" /> consultation my decision is as well informed as is possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that his decision on each area was based primarily on conservation, preservation and environmental grounds, but also had to take into account the broader economic context, where this did not conflict with the most important concern of conservation.</P>
    <P>Before announcing each decision in detail the Minister concluded &ldquo;The consultation process has taught all at the Office of Public Works the value of consultation and open management.  From this point on it will be Office of Public Works policy to involve local communities in all decisions about major developments in their areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Burren</i>
    </P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the need to reconcile the two demands of conservation on the one hand and access for social and economic reasons on the other, the Minister summarised his decision on the Burren as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have decided that the Office of Public Works should apply for planning permission for a revised Visitor Centre at the location where building has already begun.  The plans will be revised in terms of size, visitor access and freedom of movement and by an independent monitoring of the effluent treatment system.  In the future running of the centre the Office of Public Works is also committed to establishing a National Park Liaison Committee to ensure the involvement of the local community is facilitated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Liaison Committee and Region Wide cooperation</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;The Burren National Park Liaison Committee will be set up to facilitate dialogue and local input on development of the Park.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In consultation with the Liaison Committee, the Office of Public Works will prepare and publish a draft management plan for the Park.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works will <Col N="79" /> endeavour to establish an overall management plan for the entire Burren region in conjunction with local authorities, voluntary organisations, community groups, tourist bodies etc.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works will develop a close working relationship with the Burren Display Centre at Kilfenora, which will include the facilitating of joint booking arrangements, marketing, signage etc.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works will also develop its heritage sites at Kilfenora and support the designation for Kilfenora as a Heritage Town.  It will also assist in the upgrading of the existing Centre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works will endeavour to establish a networking system with existing and planned Visitor Centres in Clare, to optimise the economic benefits to the entire community.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Environmental Protection</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister summarised the specific environmental concerns into three areas: visual intrusion; threat to flora and fauna and other delicate features of the area; protection of ground waters.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Visual intrusion</i> will be minimised by a reduction in the overall size of the proposed building by 12.5 per cent.  A portion of the building will also be reduced in height from 14 feet to 12 feet.  The Centre is located in a disused quarry and in an area which has already been seriously degraded.  All development will take place in this area alone.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Much of the area surrounding the site will be designated a <i>nature reserve.</i> This will have the effect of limiting general access to the area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>The threat to flora and fauna</i> and other delicate features is heightened by visitors roaming in a haphazard manner around the landscape.  Visitors will be directed by means of signposted walking trails around the area of the Centre. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Access to Mullaghmore mountain will not be encouraged, and those few people who will still go there will be directed along carefully selected, signposted walking routes.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Access to the site will be restricted.</i> All coaches will be pre-booked and the number of coaches accepted daily to the centre will be limited.  Coaches over and above this limit will be referred to Kilfenora and other Centres.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>A code of behaviour</i> for the Burren will be drawn up and distributed to all visitors to the new Centre to encourage visitors to respect the delicate eco system of the Burren landscape.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A state of the art effluent treatment system has already been approved and a licence was granted by Clare County Council, whose decision has been upheld by An Bord Pleanála.  Rigorous conditions have been laid down in the licence, all of which will be met.  The waste will be treated four times before release. </P>
    <P>In addition, to allay fear further, there will be independent monitoring of the effluent before it is discharged.  In the unlikely event of any failure, the centre will be shut until the problem is solved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wicklow Mountains National Park</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following the public consultation, the Minister said that it was now clear that people had genuinely held fears and concerns which had not been properly addressed in earlier stages of the controversy. Said Minister Dempsey, &ldquo;Much of the controversy had arisen because local people had not been involved in the decision making process.  Some of the concerns people had were ill-informed or based on inaccurate perceptions and might have been allayed sooner if the Office of Public Works had been more open from the outset.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister continued &ldquo;There were some fears about the impact on the local community, in particular the farming community, of the National Park itself. Let me state now categorically the fol <Col N="81" /> lowing: The Office of Public Works will not acquire land compulsorily; the Office of Public Works will not seek to reduce sheep numbers through buying or suppressing grazing rights; the Office of Public Works cannot and will not seek the closure of any roads in the area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the consultation process had confirmed for him the absolute necessity for local community input in planning initiatives such as Visitor Centres.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wicklow National Park Management Liaison Committee and Plans for the Region</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;To ensure that fears based on inaccurate perceptions do not arise again, the Minister said that a Wicklow National Park Liaison Committee will be established.  The Committee will be made up of local public representatives and community groups.  This committee will have ongoing input and involvement in the management and development of the Park.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A draft plan for the management of the National Park will be prepared with the involvement of the Committee.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The management plan will include the Minister's commitment to a further Visitor Centre in West Wicklow.  The location of this proposed centre is to be determined only after full public consultation has taken place. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Environmental Concerns</i>
    </P>
    <P>Specific fears about Luggala included the prospect of heavy coach traffic and the economic impact on local towns and villages.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Access to the site</i> at Luggala will be changed.  The Minister announced that the Office of Public Works has reached agreement with a local landowner which will permit a different and safer entrance to the site than originally proposed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>The environmental impact</i> is minimal as the site is a commercial conifer development of little conservation value, hosting very little flora or fauna. <Col N="82" /> Both Local Authority and An Taisce reports have recognised that the visual impact of the centre would be negligible. However, the Minister has instructed the Office of Public Works to apply for planning permission for a building reduced in scale by 22 per cent from the original proposal submitted to Wicklow County Council.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Effluent treatment</i> concerns are also addressed.  Waste will be treated to a tertiary level followed by sterilisation and discharge to a percolated bed.  This process will be strictly monitored and will also include an automatic alarm and shutdown facility. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Traffic Problems and Threats to Local Town and Village Economies</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;The Minister announced that the Office of Public Works will establish its National Park Headquarters at Roundwood village.  The Park Headquarters will provide car and coach parking facilities.  Coaches will have to be pre-booked for the Visitor Centre.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the high season coaches will use the Park Headquarters as a drop off point.  Then passengers will be transported by mini-bus to the centre. In these periods and on Sundays and bank holidays, the minibuses will be used as an internal park bus system,&rdquo; said Minister Dempsey.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the establishment of the headquarters in Roundwood village will bring substantial benefits to the village.  &ldquo;In addition,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;a tourist office will be accommodated within the headquarters which will direct visitors to other attractions in Wicklow.  This will ensure that the socio-economic benefits of the Visitor Centre can be shared as widely as possible throughout the area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded by saying that the decision on the proposed Visitor Centre at Luggala was not the end of the issue but the beginning of an ongoing process of shared management and conservation of the entire region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" />
      <i>The Boyne Valley</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposed Visitor Centre is to be progressed largely as proposed.  Minister Dempsey has instructed the Office of Public Works to apply for planning permission based on the designs already prepared.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The strategy to develop a Visitor Centre was developed as an urgent requirement to relieve the considerable pressures on the monuments from existing visitor numbers and to prevent further damage to Newgrange in particular, said Minister Dempsey.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the new policy at the Office of Public Works all management and development of heritage areas will be carried out with the aid of public consultation. With this in mind, Minister Dempsey announced the establishment of a consultation forum which will enable the local community and public representatives to have ongoing input and involvement in the Bru na Boinne Heritage Area.  Said Minister Dempsey, &ldquo;I recognise that the participation of the local community in future initiatives is an absolute necessity and the Office of Public Works will be pro-active in facilitating this dialogue in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the consultation process in the Boyne Valley region brought to light concerns not only regarding the site itself, but also for the socio-economic wellbeing of the area as a whole.  &ldquo;As a local Deputy I am obviously very keen that the entire area benefit from the development of the centre. Office of Public Works, MERTO and Meath County Council will co-operate to enhance the attractions of Slane, the nearest town for visitors.  By doubling visitor numbers and lengthening their stay time in the locality, the Centre will have a positive impact on the local economy. The Office of Public Works will also provide accommodation at the new Visitor Centre for a tourist office, providing details of services and attractions in the whole area of County Meath.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Environmental Impact</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash;The Minister stated that after careful <Col N="84" /> consideration of all issues and submissions of the consultation process, he was satisfied that the environmental impact of the Centre is minimal.  &ldquo;It is virtually underground&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;being set into an excavated knoll of shale with a grassed roof.  The car park will be hidden behind existing mature hedgerows and the centre will be virtually invisible when viewed from Newgrange itself, 2kms away across the river.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Like the proposed Centre for Wicklow, effluent from the Centre will be treated to tertiary standard and both the county council and Regional Fisheries Board are satisfied with the arrangements for treatment and disposal of sewage.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Traffic concerns will be addressed by a proposed minibus system which will distribute visitors throughout the archaeological area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The minibus system will at all times be managed in consultation with the residents in the locality.  In response to their concerns, an engineering and archaeological survey is being carried out to investigate the possibility of a supplementary route being built for the minibus service. </P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that these measures will ensure the development will take place in an environmentally sensitive way and with the broad support of the local communities. They will allow the Office of Public Works to continue to preserve and conserve the areas concerned and to present them for the benefit of all&rdquo;, concluded the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Edinburgh growth initiative was launched by the European Council at its meeting in December 1992 and aims at promoting economic recovery and employment in Europe.  The Council called on member states to switch, to the extent possible, their public expenditure priorities towards infrastructure and other capital investment; to implement measures to encourage private investment; to make efforts to achieve wage moderation; and to increase competition and improve market functioning, including the functioning of the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Edinburgh Council also called for Community measures to promote recovery. Specifically, it called on the European Investment Bank to make available a fund of 5 billion ecu, the so-called &ldquo;Edinburgh facility&rdquo;, to accelerate the financing of capital infrastructure projects, and for loans under this facility to raise the lending ceiling from 50 per cent <Col N="86" /> to 75 per cent of project cost and the combined (i.e. loans and grants) ceiling from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.  It also called for consideration to be given to establishment of a European Investment Fund (EIF), with contributions by the EIB, other financial institutions and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Edinburgh initiative, the April ECOFIN Council announced a package of Community and national measures aimed at promoting economic recovery in Europe.  In an accompanying document the European Commission estimated that the package would add to growth in both 1993 and 1994, increasing Community GDP to a level 0.6 per cent higher in 1994 than it would otherwise have been and providing employment creation of some 450,000 jobs over the two years 1993 and 1994.  Member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) also announced a package of national measures, in association with the ECOFIN announcement.  The April ECOFIN package was reviewed and updated by ECOFIN in October.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993 reviewed the implementation of the growth initiative and increased the Edinburgh facility to 7 billion ecu; it also asked ECOFIN to examine how loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) could benefit from interest rate subsidies of up to a maximum of 3 per cent over five years, linked to employment creation.  The Council also called on the European Commission to prepare a White Paper on growth, employment and competitiveness for consideration at its meeting in December 1993 and invited member states to submit national contributions to its preparation.  Ireland has forwarded our national contribution and a copy of it has been circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards the direct benefit to Ireland from the Edinburgh initiative, two Irish semi-State companies have benefited from the Edinburgh facility by a total amount of £140 million this year.  This figure represents two loan approvals to the ESB totalling £90 million and one <Col N="87" /> loan approval to Irish Telecommunications Investments plc on behalf of Bord Telecom Éireann (BTE) of £50 million.  At ECOFIN yesterday the possibility of extending eligibility criteria under the facility was agreed.  This extension will mean that additional projects in urban renewal, transport and energy sectors will be eligible for the increased level of borrowing of up to 75 per cent under the facility.</P>
    <P>The EIF has not yet been ratified by all member states, although Ireland has ratified it.  When ratified, it will provide support for the development of trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) through the provision initially of loan guarantees but subsequently through equity participation.  As regards the proposed interest rate subsidies for SME's, the Budget Council on 15 November agreed the inclusion of some 45 million ecu in the 1994 budget for this purpose and proposals for their operation are expected to be agreed by ECOFIN before the end of the year.  Ireland should be able to benefit under both these headings.</P>
    <P>Ireland also benefits from the Edinburgh initiative in a number of indirect ways.  To begin with, as a small open economy we are very dependent on the economic performance of our trading partners.  Member states of the European Union account for a large proportion of our trade and an initiative which aims to promote economic recovery among them is obviously of advantage to us.  In addition, the fact that the European Union is promoting growth internationally, for example by the involvement of the member countries of the European Free Trade Association, is also a step in the right direction from our point of view.  Thirdly, collective action by the Union and member states to promote economic recovery can have a significant impact in improving business sentiment which is vital to investment.  A further point is that Ireland has long been pressing for the issues of growth and employment to be put at the top of the <Col N="88" /> European Agenda: the fact that this has now been done means that the European Union must attempt to deal with these problems in a co-ordinated way.  Finally, Ireland very much welcomes the preparation by the European Commission of the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, which again is aimed at focusing attention on these problems and generating solutions to them.  Such developments are clearly in Ireland's interest, as they are in the interests of all member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The last National Development Plan did not contain goals for levels of overall employment or reduced unemployment. It indicated that the eventual outcome in regard to employment and unemployment would depend on the incidence of redundancy and the extent of net emigration. The latter would be influenced not only by availability of job opportunities at home but also by the situation in the Community and other labour markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan did contain targets for gross job creation, particularly in the major productive sectors of the economy.  Of these, I will mention one of the most important.  The primary target established under the industry section of the National Development Plan 1989-93 was the creation on average of 20,000 gross new jobs in Industry and International Services for each year of the programme. The results achieved for the years 1989-92 show that this target was met.  In 1989, <Col N="89" /> 22,142 gross jobs were created; in 1990, 21,239; in 1991, 18,794 gross and in 1992, 18,708 giving a total over the period of 80,883 gross jobs created in the industry area.</P>
    <P>As regards net employment, during the period of the last Development Plan, non-agricultural employment rose by 55,000 and total employment by 40,000. This employment performance compares very favourably with that of our trading partners.  Even in the recessionary years since 1990 our non-agricultural employment has continued to expand against the background of falling employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the same period in which our total employment increased by 40,000, unemployment increased by 54,000.  This increase in unemployment reflected the rapid growth in the labour force.  While rapid labour force growth has been and will continue to be a feature of Ireland's demographic circumstances for some time, its impact on the recorded level of unemployment was particularly significant over the last five years because of the very substantial change in migration patterns.</P>
    <P>As regards policy implications, the Government is encouraged by the success of its policies as evidenced by the rapid advances in the level of employment when the international economy is strong and the maintenance of employment levels when our trading partners are in recession.  The centrepiece of the Government's strategy to combat unemployment will continue to be the pursuit of policies to maximise sustainable employment growth.</P>

      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 54, 55, 83 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the 1 per cent income levy is that this measure was introduced in the 1993 budget in order to enable us to maintain budgetary discipline as an essential element in overall employment strategy.  The alternative of increasing tax rates would have involved reversing the progress in reform of income tax over the last few years.  The Government has acknowledged all along that the levy is temporary and that it will be removed at the earliest possible date, subject to the overall budgetary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the discussions which have been taking place between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about the levy, both sides acknowledged that the phasing out of the levy would have significant implications for the public finances and that these would have to be taken into account in <Col N="91" /> the negotiations on a new National Programme. In the light of this, the Government confirmed that it was their intention to begin to phase out the levy in the 1994 budget and to complete that process not later than in the 1996 budget, without prejudice to its responsibility to take any other measures which might be necessary to maintain firm control of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that they have moved significantly to meet the concerns expressed by ICTU in terms of stating clearly a starting point for the removal of the income levy and a specific time period over which this would take place.</P>
    <P>The Government made clear, as they have to do as Government, the limited scope that exists for tax changes in the years ahead and the consequences of the removal of the 1 per cent levy for the public finances.  They believe they could not have acted otherwise, bearing in mind in particular the employment needs of the economy and the numbers of people who unfortunately are unemployed, and the signficant number who are long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>While it has not proved possible to reach agreement with ICTU to date, the Government are available at any time to resolve the situation, provided they can do so in a way that is consistent with their responsibility in terms of employment and the public finances.</P>
    <P>As regards negotiations on a new <i>Programme for Economic</i> and <i>Social Progress,</i> the Government are of the view that a new national programme would be in the best interests of the country and they would be anxious to take part in negotiations towards that end, but not at any price.  Negotiations would of course have to be with all the social partners, and the impasse reached with ICTU is a serious obstacle to negotiations.  I am not therefore in a position to say whether or not talks will commence in 1993.  As far as the Government are concerned, they have as I have said moved significantly to meet the concerns of ICTU.  Our door remains open for further discussions, <Col N="92" /> subject to our responsibilities as I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that there have been no discussions with the social partners on a new pay agreement. If and when such discussions take place, they will have to be driven by the needs of the Exchequer, competitiveness and employment maintenance and creation.  Beyond that, I would not wish to comment on the Government's likely position in relation to such discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1993, made provision for the special advance VAT payment as one of a series of measures taken to offset the greater part of the substantial cash-flow loss to the Exchequer arising from the abolition, from 1 January last, of VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade.  The special advance payment will be required from the largest VAT remitters and represents an advance on the payment they would normally make in the following January.  Full credit for the advance payment will be granted to traders against their normal <Col N="93" /> VAT liability in January.  The Finance Act provided that liability for the advance payment would arise for taxpayers whose annual net VAT liability exceeded £120,000.  The great majority of VAT-registered taxpayers, numbering some 132,000 in all, were thereby excluded from the requirement to make the special advance payment.  The Act also enabled the Minister for Finance to increase the threshold.  Last month, a review of the latest statistics enabled me to raise the threshold to £300,000, thereby immediately absolving some 1,000 taxpayers from the obligation to make the advance payment.  It was estimated at that stage that the revenue yield from the 1,000 or so top remitters who remained subject to the initiative would be approximately £145 million, as budgeted for originally.</P>
    <P>Since then, there has been a judgment of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg arising from an Italian VAT case which has implications for our special advance payment measure. Essentially, the Court has ruled to be invalid any VAT payment requirements which would impose a liability greater than that actually incurred at the time the payment is made.  Thus, to avoid any possible conflict between EC law, as interpreted by the Court, and our provision, I propose to modify the provisions governing the payment required from the traders involved.</P>
    <P>Within the next few days, I will be making an order giving tax payers the option of making the advance payment on the notified basis, i.e. equivalent to one-twelfth of their total net VAT due in the twelve months ended 30 June of the relevant year, or on the basis of their liabilities for November, whichever is the lesser.  I have no doubt that this decision will, given continuing budgetary constraints, be seen as fair and will alleviate many of the concerns expressed to me by the traders affects.  It should be recalled that, not withstanding the advance payment requirement, the business community in general will have had the benefit, for most of the year, of an estimated cash-flow gain of some £200 million <Col N="94" /> arising from the abolition of VAT at the point of entry on intra-Community trade.</P>
    <P>I would immediately acknowledge that my proposed action will have consequences for the 1993 budgetary out-turn; it is estimated the revised arrangements will leave a shortfall of some £65 million as compared with the original budget target for the measure. Taking account of this shortfall, I remain satisfied that the EBR for 1993 will be reasonably close to the budgetary estimate of 2.9 per cent of GNP.  I also want to make it clear that, given the inherent nature of the measure, the new provisions will not have any budgetary implications for 1994.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a total of 1087 notices issued to VAT payers on 4 November, 1993.  These taxpayers will be contacted again by the Revenue Commissioners concerning the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986 the number and value of prizes is a matter for commercial decision by the National Lottery Company and not one in which I would normally have a direct input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that Lotto in particular is a jackpot-driven game. Large jackpots are very popular with <Col N="98" /> players and experience has shown that as the jackpot grows, the number of players attracted to participate in the draw grows.  Occasional boosts to jackpots are therefore essential if interest in the national lottery is to be sustained and developed.</P>
    <P>The resulting boost to sales serves to increase the overall surplus, thereby increasing the amount of money available to fund beneficiary projects.  If the size of jackpots were constrained in the way suggested, it would lead to lower sales and ultimately reduce the funds available for beneficiary projects.</P>

      <P>Investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works and the Garda are continuing into the recent slaughter of seals on the Blasket Islands. Information has been passed by that service to the Garda and until inquiries have been concluded I do not propose, at this time, to make any further statement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seals are a protected species under the 1976 Wildlife Act and it is an offence to hunt or kill them, save under licence or permission under the Act.  I am aware of calls by some fisheries organisations for a seal cull in Irish waters because of concern expressed at an apparent increase in the seal population here and the effect this, among other things, is having on some Irish fish stocks.  This increase is due mainly to the migratory-breeding habits <Col N="100" /> of such species, the majority of which originate in Scottish waters and such a cull, if it were to be undertaken, would have to be carried out there.  There is a remedy available to fishermen in that they may apply for permission, under section 42 of the 1976 Act, to kill seals which are causing actual damage to their nets.  Any such application will receive proper attention.</P>
    <P>Because of this concern by the fisheries' interests a committee, chaired by the Department of the Marine, with representatives from that Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Central Fisheries Board, the Fisheries Research Centre and the Office of Public Works was set up to consider and quantify seal interactions with fisheries.  I understand that the Minister for the Marine has asked the committee to bring forward proposals by the end of the year for a census of seals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the urban renewal scheme, section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986 which deals with the allowance in relation to construction of certain commercial premises, defines a qualifying premises for the purpose of the section as, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;a building or structure the site of which is wholly <Col N="101" /> within a designated area and which... apart from this section is not an industrial building or structure within the meaning of section 255 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967...&rdquo; Section 255 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 defines an &ldquo;industrial building or structure&rdquo; as, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;a building or structure in use... for the purposes of a trade carried on in a mill, factory or other similar premises... or ...the trade of hotel-keeping&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of these provisions is to ensure that only buildings other than those defined in section 255 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 are granted the industrial buildings allowance under section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986. Accordingly, light industrial developments in designated areas would not be granted the industrial buildings allowance under section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986 but could be granted the level of relief available under section 255 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>When the urban renewal reliefs were first introduced in 1986, the rates for the industrial buildings allowance were similar for buildings granted relief under both section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986 and section 255 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. At that time, both types of developments were granted free depreciation. However, since 1988, as part of the Government's tax reform policy, there has been a progressive reduction in the rates of industrial buildings allowance available in respect of industrial buildings or structures.  The reduction in allowances for industrial buildings nationwide was a necessary step towards broadening the tax base and reducing levels of income and corporation tax.  Thus, the current position is that the industrial buildings annual allowance &mdash; 4 per cent for 25 years &mdash; is available for industrial buildings or structures whether they are in a designated area or not while free depreciation remains available for commercial developments in areas designated for urban renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1986 does not define or list the types of developments covered by it but merely indicates that no relief is available under <Col N="102" /> the section in respect of developments covered by section 255 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 where a list of industrial buildings and structures is provided.  This has been the position since the legislation was first enacted in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The paper, referred to by the Deputy, presented the results of applying a range of research techniques for estimating the size of the black economy in Ireland.  However, the paper concluded that the results of the exercise must be viewed as highly tentative since the different approaches used yield different conclusions and suffer from significant limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO already makes a number of explicit adjustments to its income based measure of GNP to incorpate estimates for black economy activities.  The most significant adjustment is not non-reporting and under-recording of the income of self-employed traders where the basic data on incomes are derived from the <Col N="104" /> tax collection system.  These incomes are grossed using factors calculated by preparing the number of self-employed recorded in the Census of Population and Annual Labour Force Surveys with the numbers making tax returns.  This and the other explicit adjustments made for black economy activities presently amount to over 3 per cent of GNP and are reflected in the GNP-debt and GDP-debt ratios.</P>
    <P>Black economy activities are also indirectly captured in other components of the GNP compilations, but the amounts of income involved cannot be separately identified or quantified.  For instance, the labour supply approach used to estimate wages and salaries implicitly captures earning which may not be reported to the fiscal authorities.  Furthermore, income arising in agriculture is measured indirectly using the so-called output approach and is not dependent on the tax declarations of farmers.</P>
    <P>The CSO will continue its efforts to improve the coverage of the black economy in the Irish GNP compilations although such activity is, of its very nature, extremely difficult to estimate.  A recent decision of the EC Commission has also stipulated a number of measures to be undertaken by all EC member states to ensure that hidden activities are captured equally comprehensively in their GNP estimates.  This decision will be published shortly and envisages that, where necessary, member states will incorporate improved estimates for the black economy in the GNP estimates to be provided to the Commission in September 1995 under the terms of Council Directive 89/130/EEC on the harmonisation of the compilation of Gross National Product at market prices.</P>

      <P>The grave and widespread violations of human rights in Iraq continue to be a matter of the utmost concern to the Government.  The actions of the Iraqi authorities against the Marsh Arabs and the Kurdish population in particular have resulted in a deplorable deterioration in the living conditions of those affected and severely hindered their social and economic development.</P>
      <P>New and disturbing reports in recent days speak of an intensified Iraqi campaign to empty large sections of the country's Southern marshlands of their population.  There are allegations that chemical weapons have been used in attacks on the Marsh Arabs in that region.  The UN is urgently investigating the situation.</P>
      <P>Iraq's human rights record is in flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991, and other relevant decisions of the Council, which demanded an end to the repression of the Iraqi civilian population and insisted that Iraq co-operate with humanitarian organisations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens were respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As evidence of the importance we <Col N="107" /> attach to the question, the Government have sponsored resolutions in the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights dealing with the human rights situation in Iraq.  In March 1991, the Commission appointed a Special Rapporteur to make a thorough study of human rights violations by the Iraqi authorities.  The reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur clearly underline the nature and scale of the abuses of human rights suffered by the Iraqi civilian population.  Further reports will be submitted by the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly at its current session, and to the Commission at its next session early in 1994.</P>
    <P>Together with our EC partners, we are now considering a new draft resolution to be tabled in the General Assembly. Particular attention is being paid to the plight of the Marsh Arabs, and to the reports to which I have referred of the use of chemical weapons, in our consideration of the question.</P>

Probate tax is payable in respect of deaths occurring after the date of passing of this year's Finance Act, i.e. after 17 June 1993.

      <P>It is estimated that in the 1992-93 licensing year, that is, from 1 October 1992 to 30 September 1933, a total of 13,800 intoxicating liquor licence holders would have required tax clearance in order to renew their licences.  Approximately 10,800 of these licences would have been &ldquo;publicans&rdquo; licences, relating mainly to public houses but also including hotels, clubs, etc.</P>
      <P>At the end of last week, 13,229 applications for tax clearance had been received by the Collector-General's Office from intoxicating liquor licence holders for the 1992-93 licensing year. 12,615 tax clearance certificates were issued and 614 applicants did not obtain tax clearance due to outstanding tax arrears for that year.</P>
      <P>As regards the licensing year from 1 October 1993 to 30 September 1994, the Collector-General's Office has at this stage received a total of 10,560 applications for tax clearance.  So far, 5,535 tax clearance certificates have been issued, decisions have been deferred in 495 cases to afford the applicants an opportunity to regularise their tax affairs and the remaining applications are still being processed. No refusals have issued in relation to that licensing year.</P>
      <P>As the Collector-General does not maintain a record of applications for tax clearance by reference to the different categories of intoxicating liquor licences, it is not possible to give separate figures for holders of publicans licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27 on 3 November (Col. <Col N="110" /> 896), the Collector-General's Office is prepared to meet with publicans who are in arrears and who are prepared to make realistic efforts to discharge those arrears over a reasonable period of time.  I would again suggest that such individuals should act accordingly with a view to obtaining a Tax Clearance Certificate and also a current intoxicating liquor licence.</P>

    <P>The yield in 1991 was increased by the once-off cash-flow effect of the introduction of Self Assessment in that year. The improvement in the 1992 performance over 1991 is due to a combination of factors, namely, once-off payments of tax on unit trusts held by insurance companies under the option granted by section 36 of the Finance Act, 1992, and the acceleration of property disposals prior to 6 April 1992 in advance of the introduction of a single rate of Capital Gains Tax of 40 per cent which applies to disposals made on or after that date.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1 January 1993, the registration and licensing of vehicles was administered by the local authorities and it would have been normal practice, at that time, for car owners to apply for registration and licensing of new or imported cars simultaneously.  However, registration is now carried out by the Revenue Commissioners upon payment of the relevant Vehicle Registration Tax, if any; licensing continues to be administered by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Given the established pattern whereby an application for registration was indicative of the availability of a vehicle for use, it was decided, in order to avoid the creation of any opportunities for abuse, that vehicle licence duty should normally be due from the date of registration. However, to ensure that motorists have sufficient time, following registration, in which to licence (tax) a vehicle, provision has been made in the new arrangements, by way of a &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; mechanism, so that a motorist will not be penalised for using (driving or parking) an unlicensed vehicle in a public place within 7 working days of registration by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In devising these arrangements, the position of persons who claim imported vehicles were &ldquo;off the road&rdquo; between registration and first licensing was given careful consideration.  However, it was decided that no special tax arrangements would be made as this would create a serious &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; in the road tax code. Furthermore, in the interest of road safety, it was considered desirable that the road tax regime should not encourage the importation of cars which have been &ldquo;written off&rdquo; in road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, apart from the first licensing of new or imported used vehicles, road tax need not be paid on previously-licensed vehicles which have not been used in a public place over a period of time.  In such cases, the applicant must make a statutory declaration, witnessed <Col N="113" /> by a member of the Garda Síochána, as to the period of non-use of the vehicle when subsequently relicensing the vehicle.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very conscious of the cash flow implications for businesses of VAT repayments for both registered and unregistered taxpayers.  In this regard the form VAT3 which is the claim form for the bulk of repayments was significantly simplified earlier this year.  For the past two years a level of service has been maintained which ensures that in excess of 80 per cent of repayable claims are repaid within 10 days of receipt.  This service is provided in the context of a situation where in excess of 5 per cent of claims are found to be faulty on initial examination and must be referred back to the taxpayer or agent for correction.</P>
      <P>A selection of claims are referred to Inspector of Taxes for examination and the turn around time for such claims has been reduced significantly.</P>
      <P>In the case of claims by unregistered taxpayers, in excess of 70 per cent of claims are repaid within 10 days.  The nature of such claims demands a more careful examination as poor presentation is often a feature of the claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, stamp duty is just one of a number of costs associated with the sale of houses. However, there exists a number of reliefs and exemptions in the stamp duty code specifically targeted at reducing the stamp duty element of the cost of family-home conveyancing.</P>
      <P>New houses with a floor area below 125 square metres are exempt from stamp duty altogether.  In this year's budget, I introduced an effective reduction in the stamp duty on new estate houses with a floor area of over 125 square metres, in order to give a boost to this area of house-building, and to assist families needing more spacious accommodation.  The stamp duty charge for such larger new houses is now based on the site value of the property (subject to a minimum site value of 25 per cent of the total house value), whereas the change had previously been based on the full house price.</P>
      <P>The costs of buying a house are also significantly reduced by virtue of mortgage interest relief, which is provided at significant Exchequer cost.  The provision of 100 per cent mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers for the first three tax years in which they claim the relief was a significant initiative in the 1993 Budget. In addition, the grant for first-time buyers of new houses was increased from £2,000 to £3,000 in the budget.  I should add that the selling of one's house is facilitated by the capital gains tax exemption that applies in respect of one's principal private residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> In view of the generous reliefs that serve to reduce the cost of buying a family home, I do not have any proposals to further reduce the stamp duty element of that cost at present.  In any event, it should be borne in mind that a reduction in the yield from stamp duty would have to be compensated for by increased taxation in other areas, in order to maintain the levels of funding needed for the Government's social and economic programme.</P>

      <P>Detailed cost-benefit analyses of various options for the drainage and relief of flooding on the Owenmore/Arrow Catchment for the purpose of improving the lands and thus increasing agricultural output have been <Col N="117" /> undertaken.  It has not proved possible to devise a scheme on this basis which the Commissioners of Public Works could recommend for approval to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Commissioners have been investigating whether it would be possible to devise a modified scheme which might attract financial support based on social and environmental considerations but which would not encourage increased agricultural production.  This examination is not yet complete.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to cause uncertainty to local farmers because of the lack of a decision on whether or not to undertake a drainage and flood relief scheme.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I am anxious to explore fully all possibilities before making any final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is the body with primary responsibility for interest rates.  The Bank has informed me that the trend of interest rates in Ireland is determined primarily by supply and demand conditions in wholesale money markets. These wholesale rates are currently on a par with those in Germany, and below those in most other EC countries including France, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.</P>
      <P>Arrangements agreed between the Central Bank and the Associated Banks constrain the highest rate these banks may charge for normal risk lending propositions for borrowers in the A (personal) and AA (small businesses/farmers) category borrowers, and the maximum rate chargeable is related to the level of the one month interbank rate.  Moreover, the Central Bank has informed me that in fact the margin between the main banks' weighted average lending rate and weighted average cost of funds has been narrowing over the past year.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy may also be aware, I have recently reminded the banks publicly of my concern that they should seek to ensure that small businesses get the maximum possible benefit from reductions in interbank interest rates and I was glad to see a response by some of the Associated Banks to these concerns in their recent round of rate reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a single European banking market the key to lower interest rate margins is competition between lending institutions.  I am informed by the Central Bank that recent legislative measures to increase the competitive potential of building societies, Trustee Savings Bank Bank and ACC Bank have also reduced the market power or the major banks and have widened the options for borrowers.  The Central <Col N="119" /> Bank's aim is to give customers greater choice, flexibility and bargaining power in relation to banking services, by encouraging greater competition.  I believe this to be the appropriate approach and therefore I have no plans to bring in legislation providing for controls on bank interest rates.</P>

      <P>This work is proceeding as rapidly as the financial resources available to the Office allow.  At present, restoration of boat access to Dublin Bay is nearing completion.

      <P>The canal from Coolnahay, County Westmeath to the 40th lock near Ballymahon has been dredged and rewatered.  As resources permit, lockgates will be fitted, environmental works undertaken and obstacles to navigation removed.  Assistance from the EC Structural Funds is being sought for this work.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a problem that has arisen in the Moatview-Clonshaugh area in the past few months caused by a number of disorderly youths congregating, throwing stones and causing damage in general.</P>
      <P>The late night bus service on route 42C is operated almost every night.  At times when there are signs of disorder in the area, the gardaí notify Dublin Bus, who make a decision as to whether they should withdraw the service for the safety of the crew and passengers.</P>
      <P>The Garda are giving this matter special attention and are doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of all concerned and to curb any acts of disorder and violence in the area.  Two mobile Garda units are detailed to patrol in the Clonshaugh-Moatview-Priorswood area each evening and night.</P>
      <P>The Garda hold regular meetings with the management and unions from Dublin Bus and all aspects of the situation are discussed.  Senior gardaí within the division have also recently met with public representatives from the area to discuss the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community gardaí from the area, along with Dublin Bus personnel, have been visiting schools in the Coolock area to show videos to the children of the <Col N="125" /> effect of disturbances on the buses and the damage and injury caused to property and passengers by throwing stones.  The Garda report that these measures are proving to be successful.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the overall demands on the force, the Garda authorities are satisfied that the policing arrangements for the Coolock district are adequate. The situation is kept under constant review by the Garda authorities to ensure that all appropriate action is taken, including the allocation of manpower, to deal with problems that arise.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities, who decide this having regard to their ongoing assessment of the policing requirements of those areas.  They inform me that the current strength of Bundoran Garda station is 15 gardaí.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, the daily opening hours at Bundoran Garda station have been from 10 a.m. &mdash; 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. &mdash; 6 p.m.  However, foot and mobile patrols are carried out by the gardaí in Bundoran on a 24-hour basis.</P>
      <P>During the tourist season, the tours of duty are rearranged so as to provide additional patrols during the hours of greatest need &mdash; 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.  The gardaí at Ballyshannon assist in policing the Bundoran area during the season. This ensures a more visible police presence during those periods when there is a likelihood of incidents of disorder or vandalism taking place especially late at night or in the early hours of the morning.</P>

      <Quest>the reason no funds have been made available in recent years by his Department for the replacement of window frames in a series of inner city flat complexes in Dublin which are in urgent need of replacement; if he will introduce a grant scheme which would allow residents themselves to replace the windows; if, in addition to the grant, he will permit Dublin Corporation to loan each tenant the difference between the cost and the grant; if he will recognise this as a way of making progress in meeting an urgent need which will reduce the overall cost to public funds and at the same time permit tenants, some of whom are poorly off, to proceed with this urgent matter at a cost they can afford.</Quest>

      <P>Funding is available from my Department for window replacement where such work forms part of a refurbishment project which has been designated for assistance under the remedial works scheme.  To date, allocations totalling almost £34 million have been made to Dublin Corporation under this scheme.  In other cases, window replacement forms part of the normal maintenance of the housing stock and is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their revenue resources.  There are no grants available from my Department for window replacement.  It is, however, open to the corporation to provide financial assistance, including unsecured house improvement loans, to tenants who wish to undertake such work.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the conflicting figures on road deaths of the Insurance Industry Federation, which claimed that Ireland had the third worst record in Europe, and the Environmental Research Unit study 1992, which claims that only the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands have lower rates.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the statistics quoted by the Irish Insurance Federation are based on a survey carried out by insurance interests in some 17 European countries and relate to the number of <Col N="134" /> road deaths per 10,000 vehicles. However, comparisons based solely on the relationship between deaths and numbers of vehicles do not of themselves offer a reliable guide to international accident trends, as the varying levels of motorisation in European countries can distort the comparison.</P>
      <P>It is accepted internationally that comparisons should desirably be made on the basis of fatality rates in proportion to population and volume of travel.  It is these comparisons which are used by the Environment Research Unit.</P>
      <P>On the basis of road deaths per 10,000 population, Ireland's rate was 1.4 in 1990, which is the latest year for which the required corrected statistics are available. This compares favourably with our EC partners.  Belgium, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal had higher rates while the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands had lower rates.  The rate for Germany was the same as for Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the basis of road deaths per 10 million vehicle kilometres of travel, Ireland's rate was 1.9 for 1990, the third lowest for the countries for which statistics are available.</P>
      <P>The data in &ldquo;Table 54: International Comparisons&rdquo; of the ERU publication &ldquo;Road Accident Facts: Ireland 1992&rdquo; are incorrect in some respects; I am arranging to have a copy of the corrected statistics forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the nature of Iarnród Éireann's past, present and planned future commitment towards the prevention of coastal erosion at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford; the basis, if any, for such commitment being required of Iarnród Éireann; his critique of the coastal erosion problem at Rosslare, County Wexford; his Department's works to date and future plans, if any, in that regard; his views on whether a planned future contribution by Iarnród Éireann of £220,000 will constitute a final contribution to an ongoing problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>By virtue of a Government decision in 1978, CIE are &ldquo;responsible for the provision of beach material for the nourishment of Rosslare Strand&rdquo;.  This decision was based on the view that the harbour works carried out by CIE in <Col N="142" /> Rosslare impacted significantly on the erosion of the strand.  In 1982, the Government further &ldquo;decided that the costs arising from the provision and transportation of beach material to counter coastal erosion at Rosslare Strand should be borne as to 80 per cent by CIE and as to 20 per cent by Wexford County Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Iarnrod Éireann have been providing beach material at Rosslare Strand at three year intervals, 1983, 1986 and 1989. By agreement the nourishment due to be provided in 1992 by Iarnrod Éireann was deferred to 1993.  This was to enable previously constructed rock groynes to be extended to accommodate the nourishment. Discussions with Iarnrod Éireann regarding their contribution towards the provision of beach nourishment are currently being finalised.  I do not see this beach nourishment exercise as CIE's final contribution.  It is my intention to ensure that the spirit and intention of the earlier Government decisions is fully respected by CIE, and while the Department and Wexford County Council are active in works to mitigate the problem, I will expect CIE to make its contribution as and when required, in line with that Government decision.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine's approach to the erosion problem at Rosslare Strand is to construct protection works in a systematic manner phased over a number of years.  The current phase, the construction and extension of rock groynes and the placing of nourishment in the resulting compartments, will have cost approximately £1.5 million by the end of 1994.  Any protection works that may be undertaken after 1994 will depend upon analysis of the success of the current phase.  The works will, however, contribute significantly to reducing the long term level of erosion at the strand.</P>

In her January 1993 application for grants under the January-February 1993 special beef premium scheme she declared that the animals listed were 22 months whereas she had shown them as being 16 months on her December 1992 application less than two months earlier.  Under the EC Regulations governing the scheme the applicant cannot be paid any grants under the 1993 special beef premium scheme and must be excluded from the 1994 scheme also.  Her application for grants under the 1993 cattle and equine headage schemes is being processed at present and if found in order a 60 per cent advance will be paid shortly.  She did not apply for grants under the suckler cow premium or special beef premium schemes in the June 1993 application period.</P>

      <P>Payments made to date in 1993 under the various headage and premium schemes total £255 million.  I expect that up to a further £140 million will be paid to farmers under these schemes over the next four weeks. When account is taken of other direct compensatory payments being made this year, the total figure for 1993 should come close to £450 million.  This compares very favourably with the previous record payments level of £409 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>Payments are now commencing under cattle and beef cow headage and special beef and suckler cow premium schemes. In so far as headage is concerned, payments normally commence around this time of the year.  With regard to special beef and suckler cow premium schemes, the EC regulations preclude any payment before 1 November and they limit payment to a 60 per cent advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to clearing as many cases as possible for payment before <Col N="145" /> Christmas, I have authorised overtime for all the local offices and the special beef premium unit in my Department.</P>

      <P>The person named lodged a combined application for grants under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme in respect of 40 cows and the 1992 cattle and equines headage scheme in respect of 40 cows and 28 cattle on 7 July 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the suckler cow premium scheme the person named was required to maintain 40 cows or replacement in-calf heifers for six months from the date of lodgment of the application and under the terms and conditions of the cattle and equines headage scheme, he was required to maintain 40 cows and 28 cattle until any field inspection was carried out.  At an inspection of the herd carried out on 5 January 1993 only 20 cows and 5 in-calf heifers were presented.  A subsequent inspection was arranged as the herd-owner claimed to have the remaining cows on another farm but the applicant presented no further animals for inspection. Since my Department is not satisfied that the person named maintained the required number of cows for the six months retention period no grants under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme can be paid.  A reduced grant will however be paid under the cattle and equines headage scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 147, 154 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>As regards rented land, I wish to state that my Department is in negotiation with Ordnance Survey to see if the problems of farmers renting conacre can be dealt with by a later ordering deadline than the deadline appropriate to farmers who do not rent land.  I am confident that a satisfactory solution to the problems of such farmers will be worked out and announced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very conscious of the position of farmers requiring more than one map to cover their holdings.  To address this issue I have negotiated with Ordnance Survey a 50 per cent reduction from £25 to £12.50 in the cost of all maps over and above the first map required by any individual farmer to cover his or her entire holding. Farmers who submit maps in early 1994 will not be required to buy and submit further maps with their area aid applications in subsequent years unless there are changes in the areas declared by them in those years.  Therefore, the outlay arising from the purchase of maps for 1994 will benefit the vast majority of farmers over a number of subsequent years. Farmers who submitted original maps in 1993 &mdash; and where there are no changes <Col N="152" /> in the land farmed in 1994 &mdash; will not be required to submit maps in 1994.</P>
    <P>My Department has to have confidence in the accuracy of the maps which farmers submit.  That is why we need original maps.  I am satisfied that the reduced price now available for all maps over and above the first map required by any individual farmer should overcome any difficulties due to the non-acceptability of photo-copies.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 150, 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on 42 animals under the 1992 cattle headage scheme and on 20 animals under the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme.  The tag numbers of 42 animals were recorded on the standard form at the field inspection of 6 October 1992.  These included the 20 animals presented by the applicant at that inspection as being suckler cows or replacement in-calf heifers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tag numbers of all the 42 animals mentioned were read from the eartags on the animals' ears but could not be cross-checked during the on-farm inspection against the relevant cattle identity cards as the applicant did not make them available to the inspecting officers that day. Because the metal eartags can be worn <Col N="154" /> or bent after being on the ears of cattle for some time understandable mistakes can be made in reading them.  This is why they are cross-checked against cattle identity cards.  The cross-check was carried out 10 days later in this case after the cattle identity cards had been requested from the applicant, when some minor errors in the tag numbers recorded on the day of inspection were corrected.</P>
    <P>Normally applicants are required to sign the inspection report form on the day of inspection.  In this particular case the applicant was not required to sign the inspection report form.  When this came to notice in December of 1992 he was asked to sign the report form but refused to do so.</P>

      <P>As referred to in the National Development Plan, I have recently received a proposal from Bord na Móna for the provision of a new 120MW peat-fired electricity generation station to be located in the East Midlands.  Bord na Móna's choice of location was based on the result of a feasibility study which included a detailed survey into available peat resources.  The conclusion which Bord na Móna reached was that the most appropriate location for such a station would be the East Midlands where peat resources are greatest. The Littleton group of bogs were not considered as containing sufficient peat to supply such a station and therefore not capable of meeting the requirements for the proposed station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government attaches a high priority to the development of modern efficient transport links with Britain, Europe and further afield and to improving access arrangements to/from Ireland. As the regulatory authority for air transport, my Department makes every effort to ensure that there is a wide range of reliable and regular commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry, at the lowest economic cost. However, the actual development of air <Col N="160" /> services on specific routes is a matter for the individual airlines.</P>
      <P>Outside the EC, traffic rights for air services are negotiated within the framework of bilateral air transport agreements. In order to facilitate the commencement of new services to and from Ireland, I have and am pursuing a vigorous policy of negotiating air transport agreements with countries with whom there is potential for services to operate in the short, medium and long term.</P>
      <P>Under Council Regulations (EEC) No. 2408/92 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community routes, which came into effect on 1 January, 1993, all Community air carriers are free to fly on international routes within the Community without Government regulation.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2409/92 on fares and rates for air services provides that cargo rates charged by Community air services shall be set by free agreement between the parties to the contract of carriage.</P>
      <P>Air freight is a strong growth sector, with throughput in the three State Airports increasing from 70,000 tonnes in 1989 to 87,000 tonnes in 1992 (24 per cent increase).  At Dublin Airport, the increase was from 47,000 tonnes to 63,000 tonnes (34 per cent).  With the advent of the Single Market and the abolition of customs controls from 1 January, 1993, air freight is becoming increasingly important for the quick export of goods, particularly those with a high added value/low weight ratio, such as electronic/computer components and pharmaceuticals.  Freight facilities at the three airports are being further developed to cater for this traffic growth.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was prepared by KPMG/Stokes Kennedy Crowley for my Department and the EC Commission.  Following its completion, the Government formally applied in 1991 for EC aid for mobile assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following were among the main findings of the consultants access transport study which supported the application: the Irish economy is heavily <Col N="161" /> dependent on the export and import of goods and services; improved external access is essential to offset the competitive disadvantages of Ireland's peripheral location and investment measures under the Operational Programme on Peripherality to develop road, rail, port and airport infrastructure, while necessary, would prove insufficent without a parallel upgrading of external access transport services.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has formally responded negatively on three occasions to Ireland's application.  The main reasons for rejection centre around the Commission's belief that aid for mobile assets would lead to a distortion of competition and there is insufficient evidence for market failure to justify intervention.</P>
    <P>The Government has mounted a sustained campaign at all levels to convince the European Commission of the need to take practical measures to offset the unique disadvantages caused by Ireland's island status and peripheral location.  The Government's case has been carefully formulated and, on the basis of the best professional advice, I am satisfied that it is fully justified.</P>
    <P>The Government will accordingly continue to press for EC support to further develop Ireland's external trade and tourism.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="168" /> number of people on the waiting list for orthopaedic assessment in County Tipperary (South Riding), as at 31 October, 1993 is 487.  However, in the normal course a number of these will not require surgery.  There is a total of 141 patients awaiting elective orthopaedic surgery.</P>
      <P>Orthopaedic surgery is one of the specialties which is being targeted in the £20 million major action programme on Hospital In-Patient Waiting Lists.  Under this programme, I have provided funding for an additional 260 orthopaedic procedures to be carried out in the SouthEastern Health Board area in 1993.  In addition, more resources have been allocated in 1993 for the regional elective unit at Kilcreene Hospital for orthopaedic service enhancement.  These measures, I am sure, will increase the orthopaedic throughput and thereby reduce waiting times.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the major maternity hospitals is as follows:</P>
      <P>Rotunda Hospital &mdash; The hospital has recently opened a new delivery suite which includes nine individual birthing rooms, finished to a very high standard.</P>
      <P>Coombe Hospital &mdash; a new delivery suite was completed at the hospital consisting of five individual birthing suites complete with en suite facilities.  There are wards in the existing delivery suite where patients are nursed side by side during the first stage of labour.  However, patients are then moved to a delivery room to ensue that there is privacy for the second and third stages of labour.</P>
      <P>Holles Street Hospital &mdash; a new delivery suite has recently opened at the hospital consisting of 12 single rooms with en suite facilities, to facilitate privacy during labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> In addition, the hospital has a further four single delivery rooms, and two other delivery rooms, each of which contain two beds.  Curtains are used to ensure privacy for patients in these rooms.</P>
    <P>Airmount Maternity Hospital, Waterford &mdash; There are three single labour wards available for mothers.</P>
    <P>Erinville Maternity Hospital, Cork &mdash; There are two beds in each labour ward. Privacy is provided by curtains between beds.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is sufficient privacy for patients within the main maternity hospitals.  In relation to maternity units within acute general hospitals, I understand that every effort is made to ensure that there is a maximum amount of privacy afforded to mothers. Indeed, many of the larger maternity units also provide individual labour rooms, and in the relatively few cases where labour rooms are shared, curtains are used to allow privacy for patients.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position is that it was not possible to provide this pupil with a home pick-up set-down service due to the high costs involved.  However, as an alternative my Department sanctioned a transport grant, not exceeding £460 per school year, towards the cost of private transport arrangements to link up with the existing special service to the school.  The level of grant offered is determined by reference to the distance the pupil resides from the pick-up point on the service. The exact amount payable will depend on the pupil's attendance.</P>
      <P>My Department is reviewing this arrangement at present to see if further improvements could be made.</P>
