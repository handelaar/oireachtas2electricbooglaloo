      <P>I welcome the Government's initiative in seeking a meeting with Mr. Jim Molyneaux, Leader of the Official Unionist Party and the fact that the Government is taking action in this area.

      <P>I appreciate the approach Opposition parties are taking to this delicate process in which we are engaged, but I do not regard it as appropriate to have a discussion now on this subject.  I do not believe it would be helpful at this time to have a debate on Northern Ireland as the process in which we are engaged is delicate.  It is a difficult time and I hope the House will bear with us in our strategy.</P>

    <Title>Irish Aviation Authority Bill, 1993: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 23, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) A director or member of the staff of the company shall not be appointed under paragraph (a) and a person standing appointed under paragraph (a) shall be disqualified for appointment as a director or member of the staff of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this amendment but the principle contained in the amendment should be spread more widely in the Bill.  I pointed out that one of the difficulties I see in what is proposed is that the company which it is intended to establish acts at the one time as both an operating and trading company and as a regulatory authority, that there is an inherent conflict in that and that efforts should be made to avoid it.  This amendment seeks to avoid a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest in one narrow respect.  I welcome that, but a broader effort should be made to avoid this conflict of interest and overlap in respect of more fundamental matters than the specific matters contained in the amendment. I sought to draft a Report Stage amendment to cover this, but it is very hard to do it on Report Stage because one would have to put it down to some specific section and it is hard to see where one could put such an amendment in the Bill to cover what I see as one of the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have that problem in other respect.  The Minister will be familiar with the argument about the conflict of interest between the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and, for example, a State company under the aegis of that Department, such as <Col N="867" /> Telecom Éireann.  There is conflict, or potential conflict, there between the Department and the company and the relationship is perhaps too close at times; but here we go a stage further because the conflict is between the differing functions or activities of the company, a conflict between its operational and trading activities and its regulatory or supervisory activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Deputy might seem to be embarking on a Second Reading speech rather than the brief speeches made on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a long way from a Second Reading speech.  What I have to say arises directly from this amendment where there is a recognition of that problem, but a recognition of it in microcosm rather than in macrocosm.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about what can be done to avoid the undoubted conflict there.  If the Bill is passed in its present form it will result in that conflict being made permanent and being institutionalised and it will have to be faced at some time in the future if and when something goes wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points made on a possible conflict in the operational and regulatory roles of the new authority. These points reflect concerns voiced on Committee Stage.  Many Deputies expressed concern about the fact that the Aviation Authority would combine both the regulation of safety standards and the provision of service operating to those standards.  We are fully aware of these concerns and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, specifically referred to them when introducing the Bill.  The fact that the area of overlap between the operational and regulatory areas is small does not alter the basic principle that as far as possible the operational and regulatory functions should be discharged separately.  Neither is the principle <Col N="868" /> altered by the fact that the regulatory function is relatively small and would possibly not be viable in a stand alone system.</P>
      <P>We could debate this issue at length without finding the ideal solution. However, apart from setting up two separate bodies on leaving the regulatory function within the Department, there is no practical alternative to what is proposed in the Bill.  The Bill is a practical approach to the issue and I am confident that the safeguards in it will ensure that the problems which Deputies fear will not arise.  Having decided that these functions must be combined in one authority, we have put in place arrangements that will ensure transparency in the regulatory and operating standards of the Authority. We have done this by providing that the Minister retains overall responsibility for safety in policy and standards. The Authority will have to formally report to the Minister on its safety standards and he will arrange a safety audit at least every three years by an outside body to ensure that the standards are maintained.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which has been welcomed, provides that the person appointed to conduct the safety audit must be independent of the Authority. This will allay any concern that the Authority might end up auditing itself.  I have no doubt that the board of the Authority appointed by me will discharge its business with a proper regard for its safety mandate.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill also makes provision for the unlikely eventuality that the board may take a decision which, in the view of its expert staff, would compromise safety.  In that case the disagreement would be referred to the Minister who would then decide, after taking independent advice, what should be done.  I must emphasise again that this brings the issue of safety policy back to the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Minister I will retain responsibility for all aspects of accident investigation. I am satisfied that the Authority, with these safeguards, will responsibly and transparently discharge both its regulatory and operational functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will proceed to amendment No. 11a which is a drafting amendment.  I observe that amendment No. 12 is cognate.  I suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 11a and 12 together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 21, to delete &ldquo;from&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that the standard usage in legal drafting is to say that someone is disqualified for an activity rather than from an activity.</P>

      <P>One is disqualified from driving for dangerous driving.  With respect to the parliamentary draftsman I think he is wrong.  One is disqualified from driving for the offence of dangerous or drunken driving; that is the way it is used.  The proposed change does not make sense; it transposes normal usage. Nobody will say that they have been disqualified for driving; they will say that they have been disqualified from driving for the offence of dangerous or drunken driving.  The provisions should be left as they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 29, line 38, after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;annual&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the debate on this section on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, I left the appropriate reference in my office and I cannot quote what was said on Committee Stage. However, I read it in the past few days and I can recall it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the pension or superannuation arrangements that will be made under section 41 in respect of those who transfer to the company from the Department.  On Committee Stage there was a long discussion on this point and about some of the problems that appear to arise.  The Minister of State concluded the discussion by saying that there appeared to be potential difficulties which he thought should be sorted out <Col N="871" /> before Report Stage.  He said he would table an amendment or amendments on Report Stage to deal with the points that had been raised.  When asked by Deputy Noonan to outline the type of amendment he would table he said the amendment would relate to the question of annual payments by the Minister for Finance. To my surprise no amendments have been tabled by the Minister to this part of the section although the Select Committee agreed to the section on the basis that the Minister would table amendments.</P>
    <P>The overall position in regard to the transfer of staff is not satisfactory.  More than 600 staff are involved.  At present these are civil servants who have all the rights of civil servants.  In particular, they have very valuable pension rights but, as we are aware, these pensions are not payable out of a fund.  No provision is made for them; they are payable each year as they arise out of current expenditure through the Exchequer.  When the 650 people transfer to this company they will no longer be civil servants, they will be employees of the company.  Therefore, they will lose their right to a Civil Service pension but it has been agreed that they should not be worse off.  In particular they should not be worse off in respect of their superannuation rights but the company will have to establish, as companies of this kind do, a funded pension scheme.  Because it is taking on approximately 650 people with varying degrees of service &mdash; some were employed as recently as six months ago while others were employed up to 40 years ago and are now reaching retirement age &mdash; it will be necessary to make provision for the fact that some will soon reach retirement age and the company will have to start paying pensions quite soon.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 41 that not later than the end of the seventh year after the operative date, the date of commencement of operations of the company, the Minister for Finance will make a payment or payments to the company in respect of the State's superannuation <Col N="872" /> liabilities to the 650 people concerned. During Committee Stage the Minister of State said that at least 10 per cent of the entire staff of the company would retire before the seventh year on the basis of their age and length of service.</P>
    <P>It seems unsatisfactory that, although the Minister is free to make earlier payments if he wishes, he is not required under this section to do so until the end of the seventh year.  That this company should have to operate for seven years with a grossly underfunded pension scheme is unfair to the people who work in the company and, in particular, to the people who might retire within the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State estimated on Committee Stage that the amount which the Minister for Finance would have to pay was likely to be £60 million and that interest would run on that figure from the operative date.  The interest rate on that, 8 or 9 per cent, depending on how interest rates run in the future, will be very substantial. It may mean that the entire payment will be as much as £90 million or £95 million.  The fact that the bulk of this payment is not to be made for seven years puts the people concerned at a serious disadvantage.  When the time comes to make the payment the Government may say that the Exchequer cannot afford to do so because it is too big a sum to be paid out in this way and they will have some very compelling reasons for not paying.  That sort of thing has happened in the past, not just in relation to superannuation but to other matters.  From time to time devices are used to get round the difficulties, for example, putting the money up through the Central Bank and things of that kind.</P>
    <P>This is unsatisfactory.  It underlines the unsatisfactory situation in regard to Civil Service pensions.  Quite a number of civil servants, particularly the more senior ones, are so concerned about their pensions that they go to some expense to insure them.  As I have discovered in the past, when one talks about this issue one is alleged to be suggesting that civil servants not be paid their pensions in the future.  The opposite is the case and those <Col N="873" /> who understand the situation realise that drawing attention to the difficulties which may arise in 15 or 20 years time is only doing a service to those who could then stand to lose.</P>
    <P>Those who are moving out of the Civil Service are entitled to a properly funded pension scheme and they cannot have that unless the Minister for Finance makes the payment or payments quickly and funds the scheme properly.  In the early years the contributions that the company can collect from its employees and will make to the fund from the operative date will be but a tiny fraction of what the Minister for Finance actually owes this fund.  I am suggesting that the period within which the final payments should be made be reduced from seven years to two years and that payments be made annually.  At the moment it is open to the Minister for Finance to make an annual payment, but he is not obliged to do it.  The amendments I am proposing would require him to make annual payments and that would be much more satisfactory.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments.  Otherwise there will be total uncertainty about the position of those 600 people.</P>
    <P>The popular view is that the State always looks after its own.  That may be true when the State is in a position to do it, but will the State be in a position to do it in 15 years time?  Present indications are that it will not, and many people are privately aware of that even though it is not talked about much in public.  We must also remind ourselves of how the State looked after people who were regarded as its employees in certain State companies. For many years we saw former employees of Irish Shipping parading in uniform outside the gates of Leinster House.  The Minister should ask them how they were looked after as employees of a State company and what pensions they enjoy today after many years service. How would the employees fare if this country were to go the same way?  It is necessary to face up to these questions and not simply fob them off with general assurances that everything will be all right.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The case made by Deputy O'Malley was made here on Second Stage and was made very extensively on Committee Stage.  The arguments he has now reiterated were recited on Committee Stage by several Deputies and reached finality when the Minister of State agreed with the principle of the argument that was being advanced and committed himself to introducing an appropriate amendment to guarantee the pension rights of those civil servants who are being transferred out of the Civil Service in its strictest sense and into the new State company. That was the clear impression on Committee Stage.  I am very disappointed that no amendment has been brought forward by the Minister to meet the points raised, and this outcome will influence my behaviour on Committee Stage in the future.  It was a feature of debate on this Bill that right through Committee Stage the Minister had all party co-operation. On several occasions we arrived at points where there were clear differences of opinion between some of us on the committee and the Minister, and amendments were withdrawn on the basis that the Minister would bring in appropriate amendments on Report Stage.  He has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had another example of this yesterday when we discovered during the week, subsequent to assurances having been given to the Meteorological Service that their professional work would not be interfered with in any way, that air traffic controllers have got barometric equipment at Shannon, Dublin and Cork airports which enables them to take pressure readings at airports and cut straight across the service being provided by the Meteorological Service.  Yesterday we heard a cock and bull explanation of that.  We co-operated on Committee Stage.  The same co-operation will not be forthcoming on future occasions because there has been a serious breach of trust in the manner in which the Minister of State and the Department have dealt with the committee.  We withdrew amendments in good faith on being given certain <Col N="875" /> commitments and those commitments have not been met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a serious view of the charge that the Department, the Minister of State and I have acted in bad faith.  When charges like that are made I would like the record of the House to show it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who was sympathetic to the arguments put on Committee Stage, undertook to consult extensively with the Department to see if there was any way he could meet the argument put.  It has not been shown to me that an undertaking was given specifically to bring forward an amendment and in the absence of such evidence the charge of bad faith should not be made.</P>
      <P>Section 41 of the Bill deals with the superannuation arrangements for the Authority.  ANSO staff who will be transferred to the Authority will carry with them their full pension entitlements. These pension entitlements are a liability of the Minister for Finance to be discharged within seven years of the vesting day.  Deputy O'Malley's amendments suggest that payments be made anually to discharge the liability within two years. As I have said, on Committee Stage the Minister of State undertook to consult with the Minister for Finance on this issue.  The conclusion is that the seven year payment period is appropriate and should not be changed.  It would not be appropriate to provide for annual payment and the Minister for Finance has no interest in deferring payment.  If Exchequer finances permitted, it would be preferable to make the payment early rather than late to avoid paying interest. However, in this matter it would not be wise to fix arrangements too rigidly. There always must be flexibility available to the Minister for Finance to vary the amounts and times of payments to the fund within the parameters of the seven year limit.  I understand that in the preparation of the 1994 Estimates a sum of £9 million is being provided for in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Aviation Authority pension fund <Col N="876" /> arrangements will be subject to the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and the requirements of the Pensions Board, which regulates the adequacy of funding in pension schemes.  As it is the firm intention of the Minister for Finance that the funding will be paid in regular instalments within the period of seven years as specified, I do not propose to amend the Bill to require that these payments be made annually.  As Deputies will be aware, staff who retire before vesting day will receive their normal pensions as civil servants in the usual way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that I am disappointed with the attitude taken by the Minister.  There was a great deal of co-operation in the committee which sat on two days for a total of five or six hours. Even though this is a very long and complicated Bill, a very high degree of co-operation was shown.  A statement was made by the Minister of State that there would be an amendment to section 41.  As I clearly recall, the Minister was invited, I think by Deputy Noonan, to specify the general nature of the amendment and he spoke in particular about ensuring that there would be annual payments.  I think the Minister was convinced by the argument made.  He realised that there was a problem and said he would try to meet it as best he could.</P>
      <P>There was a number of amendments down in my name and in the names of others and we agreed to withdraw those amendments as a result of the assurance given.  I find it disconcerting that even though assurance was given there are no amendments in the Minister's name.  The position is not as simple, clearcut and safe as the Minister now suggests.  The staff involved, certainly the more senior staff who understand what is involved here, are concerned about the matter and they are entitled to be so.  It is a great pity that these amendments which seek to meet the point conceded by the Minister of State in the committee are not now being accepted.</P>

      <P>Before I move this amendment may I say that Deputies who had the benefit of attending Committee Stage will agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in an effort to reach agreement on these issues, sought to reconcile the points being raised by Deputies with the position of the Department of Finance?  Despite extensive consultations, this did not prove possible.  I do not wish to repeat what I said in my reply, but in order that there would not be any indication of bad feeling as we come towards the end of this Bill, the Minister of State sought to reconcile two opposing positions and the assurances that are being given, without putting forward an amendment, in substance meet the point that has been raised.  I am sure down through the years Deputy O'Malley in his ministerial capacity found that, while he was sympathetic to the position of other Deputies it was not possible to put forward amendments which would meet Opposition Deputies' points.  That <Col N="881" /> did not reflect on his good faith in the matter.  In the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, I must defend him in that respect.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 45, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&rdquo;(c) in the said section 32&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in subsection (2), `or, in case the changes are alleged to be due to Eurocontrol, to Eurocontrol' shall be inserted after `as the case may be,',</P>
      <P>(ii) in subsection (3) (a), `or Eurocontrol' shall be inserted after `authority', and</P>
      <P>(iii) in subsection (10) `or Eurocontrol' shall be inserted after `authority',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the detection of aircraft.  The general effect of this amendment is to ensure that where Eurocontrol is responsible for collecting charges for services, it will have all the necessary powers to secure payment.  The Bill as drafted omitted to mention Eurocontrol in certain subsections, so the powers given to Eurocontrol were incomplete. The effect of the amendment is to rectify the omission of Eurocontrol from specific provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>In detail, the section as redrafted first of all provides that where an aircraft is detained because the operator failed to make payments due to Eurocontrol, the aircraft may not be detained if the operator gives Eurocontrol security for the charges due.  In the Bill as drafted provision had been made for the giving of security only to the Authority.  The section as redrafted provides also that a detained aircraft may be sold with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that charges are in fact due to Eurocontrol.  The Bill as drafted covered the situation only where money was due to the Authority.</P>
      <P>Finally, the section as redrafted provides that this section does not prejudice the right of Eurocontrol to recover any charges by court action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage, I wish to refer to what I said in the Select Committe on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, column 590 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's commitment [that is the commitment in relation to certain amendments] is binding on no one other than himself.  I would love to hear what the Department of Finance has to say to this.  It obviously knows well that it is not in a position to pay over this money.  That is why it insisted on this subsection being drafted in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go on then to expand on the amount of money and so on.  The Minister, in his attempted defence of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said that agreement could not be reached with the <Col N="884" /> Department of Finance and that therefore the Bill could not be amended.  That is precisely the point I made in the committee. That is exactly what I foretold, that the Department of Finance would not agree, and to say therefore that this House cannot amend the Bill simply because the Department of Finance does not agree seems to display an extraordinarily warped level of priorities.</P>
    <P>There are many things to which the Department of Finance never agrees but that does not mean that people do not go ahead and do things, whether in Government or in the Oireachtas.  We would not make much progress in this country if we accepted the strictures and censures of the Department of Finance in relation to everything.  That is why I regard it as regrettable not merely in relation to this Bill, which is not that important in itself, that if assurances of this kind are given in committees in the future, frankly, they will not be believed.  I predict that will mean a great deal less progress being made on Committee Stage than if assurances given by Ministers could be believed.  I contend Ministers are very foolish to weaken their credibility by saying that they will do certain things, then not doing them, and using as an excuse the fact that the Department of Finance would not agree.  That is making little of their own position.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Bill as a whole; I hope its provisions will work. Undoubtedly, it contains some potential difficulties.  A great deal will depend on the attitude the Department takes in relation to this company.  I should love to see circumstances prevail in which Departments were more objective than has often been the norm in dealing with State companies, or operating companies of this kind.  There were indications, at least on the air transport side, that that was happening.  If that is the case I greatly welcome it but there are indications in other areas that perhaps it is not happening, particularly in regard to Telecom Éireann.  In so far as it is not happening it is regrettable.  I hope that, in relation to this company, the rather delicate relationship which will have to exist will <Col N="885" /> be a genuine one at arm's length and that the Department will not see its function simply to cover up whatever deficiencies come to light from time to time in the operations of the company.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no objection either to the Bill passing but I want to make some reflections on the manner in which it was dealt with.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the committee system was that Committee Stages of Bills would be taken in Special Committee.  It was never envisaged by those of us on this side of the House who agreed with that that this was merely a parliamentary device to progress committee work out of the view of the media or public so that Committee Stages of Bills could pass more quickly through the House.  It was envisaged that, because of the committee system, the views of all Members of the House, through the committees would be taken into account, that the more confrontational type of Committee Stage which we used have here on the Floor of the main Chamber would be obviated, that in the calm, more intimate atmosphere of a committee, Ministers would listen to the views expressed by Opposition Members and so far as possible, improve the legislation by taking their views into account also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three areas of contention in this Bill.  One was a matter of principle which I believe to be very important, that is, that as well as providing the service of air traffic control, the new aviation authority would also carry out regulatory and safety functions.  It was pointed out to the Minister of State that this was a serious flaw in the Bill, that the practice in other European countries is that the agency which regulates is not the agency which provides the commercial service of air traffic control, yet scarcely anything has been done between Committee and Report Stages to meet the objections voiced.  I predict that everything will go fine for a while but that inevitably something will happen when the conflict of interests inherent in this Bill between the two functions of the new aviation authority will become clear.  On the one <Col N="886" /> hand, the service providers in the new aviation authority are mandated to work commercially.  But we must remember that on the margins always there is a tension between effective commercial operations and the safety measures which would be required.  I contend there is a need for an alternative agency or the Minister's Department to decide on marginal cases, when questions of safety should override questions of commerciality.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left that flaw in the Bill, has not taken into account the views of the Members of the select committee which were widespread and expressed by all parties.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas of contention, one we have just gone through, that was the question of the preservation of pension rights for civil servants who would be transferred to the new agency. Commitments were very clearly given by the Minister of State, we were left in no doubt whatsoever that if we co-operated and allowed the sections to go through, appropriate amendments would be introduced on Report Stage.  That was not done.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, there is now a feeling among us that there was bad faith there.  It is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;We did our best, lads, but we are only a line Department, the Department of Finance would not allow us do what we feel should have been done in the Bill.&rdquo;  That is not the way business should be conducted.</P>
    <P>The third area of contention hinged on the guarantees to other sections of the public service which might be affected, in particular the Meteorological Service. I believe that the Meteorological Service has been treated in a most shabby fashion, as have members of the select committee, in that absolute guarantees were given by the Minister of State in committee that there would be no encroachment on the professional area of the Meteorological Service.  Before we even took Report Stage there was the purchase of the very equipment which would allow the air traffic control people to carry out the functions of the Meteorological Service.  I might add that the same <Col N="887" /> commitments were given to the staff associations, which commitments have also been breached.</P>
    <P>To my mind that does not augur well for the committee system in the future.  I can assure the Minister that, in relation to any other legislation that comes before a committee on which I serve, we will not be so soft in making concessions in the light of the grave question mark over the credibility of the commitments given on this Bill.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan's point about the purchase of some technical barometric equipment by the ANSO people, I should say that is available as an alternative to provide an indication of barometric pressure to aircraft should the Meteorological Service be on strike.  For example, if a housewife buys a fire extinguisher, does that mean that the fire brigade becomes redundant?</P>

I should like to say on behalf of the Department and of the Minister of State who handled this Bill that I and my Department very much appreciate the efforts, work and contributions of Members on all sides in relation to the speedy passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, as we enact the Bill, some areas of disagreement remain; that will always be the case no matter how well a Bill may have been drafted.  I want to reiterate that I am at the disadvantage of not having been present to listen to the debate through all Stages.  I should say that the Department have acted in good faith on all matters.  Substantively the points raised in relation to certain amendments have been met by the assurances of the practices that will be engaged in by the new aviation authority once it <Col N="888" /> comes into being after vesting day.  I do believe that the commercialisation of this organisation into a semi-State company is the right move and will provide a secure future for this type of operation.  I wish the incoming chief executive designate and incoming board well in the important work on which they will embark as a new fledging semi-State company.  I do believe this is a successful means by which we can pursue air navigation safety into the future.  I am sure it is welcomed by everybody.  The staff and everyone else who will be involved in the transfer to semi-State status, I think, are happy, after a long discussion, that proper safeguards and arrangements are being made for the security of their employment and pension rights in the future.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, before we embark on Report Stage of what is a very important Bill I want to register the strongest protest.  This Bill has gone through Committee Stage, commencing in July and through a number of days in September before the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  If the Bill had gone through Committee Stage within the Chamber of this House, within seven to ten days of that taking place there would have been a full Dáil report containing details of the debate, the discussion that took place on the Bill and on the amendments, and recording commitments made by the Minister in relation to amendments tabled by Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that when I first entered this House in 1981 the tradition was that Dáil <Col N="889" /> reports were available normally within four days of a debate concluding.  Despite improved technology things appear to have deteriorated hugely in this area in recent times.  I appreciate that is partially due to the additional workload on staff because of the committees.  The only point I want to make is this.  This morning we finally had published and circulated to Deputies the Select Committee on Social Affairs parliamentary debate, printed report of 15 July 1993, which deals with the start of the discussion on this particular measure.</P>

      <P>No other reports have been published.  Deputies did not have available to them the assistance of the printed reports for the preparation of Report Stage, nor did groups outside this House who have a particular interest in this have available to them the record of the debates that took place.  If the committees are not properly staffed the committee system will not work properly. Instead of assisting the legislative process it will create difficulties within that process. I am saying that to the Minister because presumably this Minister will be bringing further legislation before the House, the Committee Stage of which will go before the Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>I want an explanation as to why the Minister's office did not ensure that a full record of the debate that took place was circulated to all Members of the House. I want an assurance in future that that will happen before the Report Stage of any further Bill is taken.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 8 to 12 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `matrimonial home' means a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resides or reside on or at any time after the 25th day of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling and exercisable over any other land;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I was struck by the arguments made by many Deputies who put forward the view that in certain circumstances the original definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo;, with its emphasis on ordinary residence, immediately before the commencement of section 2 could act to the detriment of vulnerable spouses and the definition could, in effect, be used to subvert the intention underlying the Bill, namely, that of shared ownership of the matrimonial home as is the norm within marriage. Having considered the matter further I am now satisfied that it would be appropriate to backdate this particular provision to 25 June 1993, the date of publication of the Bill.  It is reasonable to assume that as and from that date individual spouses would be on notice concerning the fundamental provisions of the Bill and that it would be manifestly unjust if that knowledge were to be used to deprive a vulnerable spouse of rights which they might otherwise have enjoyed under this Bill.  A consequential adjustment is also being made in relation to mobile homes &mdash; section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment on this point would backdate the definition indefinitely and cover couples who had separated 20 or more years ago provided that one of the spouses is still living in the home.  In my view this would introduce uncertainty and would go far beyond any limitation period that could be reasonably <Col N="892" /> justified.  With the backdating of this provision to 25 June 1993 it is more than ever likely that couples who may have separated since that date will have made their own arrangements with regard to the disposition of their property.  It is not my intention to upset such arrangements and an adjustment in the existing separation provision to line it up with the new definition of a matrimonial home is being made in amendment No. 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In the last line, after &ldquo;other land;&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression comprises in addition a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided prior to the 25th of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and in which either spouse continued to reside on or after the 25th of June, 1993 and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling and exercisable over any other land;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. For a Bill of this importance I am amazed that there is nobody in this House to deal with Report Stage from either the Progressive Democrat Party or Democratic Left.  I find that absolutely incomprehensible.  I find it particularly incomprehensible in the context of the serious issues that will now be discussed under this amendment.  It bodes ill for this House that Report Stage of an important measure is treated in this way by the other parties in the House.  I noticed on the preceding Bill that there was nobody present from Democratic Left and I find that extraordinary.  I also deplore the fact that there is not a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the House debating this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment derives from a lengthy discussion we had on Committee Stage.  I have to say that when this Bill was first published I had serious concerns about the nature and quality of the Bill as drafted.  The principle of the Bill has at all times been supported by the Fine Gael Party and for many years I <Col N="893" /> have campaigned for legislation to ensure that the partnership element in marriage was recognised during the lifetime of couples and that they would be regarded as automatic joint owners of their matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>When first published this Bill had very many serious flaws but fortunately a number of those flaws were remedied on Committee Stage by the Minister's taking on board amendments I tabled. Following detailed debate on Committee Stage the Minister is now bringing forward amendments to redress some problems which he admitted either existed or whose existence he vehemently denied. On Committee Stage I made the point that applying joint ownership to the matrimonial home in circumstances in which the couple were residing in it only immediately prior to the commencement of the Act would create all sorts of difficulties and would exclude many thousands of spouses from joint ownership. As this Bill is primarily designed to redress the imbalance whereby large numbers of wives do not have joint ownership of the family home it is particularly prejudicial to many thousands of wives who were deserted or already separated but had not entered into any formal legal separation agreements with their husbands or in circumstances where there were no court orders.</P>
    <P>The amendment the Minister has tabled is a limited recognition of the extent of this problem.  In non-legal language, the effect of the amendment is that if a married couple were residing together in the matrimonial home on or after 25 June 1993, regardless of who has legal title to the property it will be regarded by and large as jointly owned. On Committee Stage I deliberately sought to cajole the Minister in a constructive way to address some of the problems in this Bill and I think I was successful.  However, if the Minister adopts his definition of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo;, this Bill will be fatally flawed because on its enactment it will exclude from automatic joint ownership thousands of wives already separated or <Col N="894" /> deserted who are residing in family homes owned by their husbands.  It will do so for one reason only, that their husbands happened to walk out on them sometime prior to 25 June 1993.  If a husband deserted his wife on 24 June 1993 and his wife is living in the family home with her three children, she will not have automatic joint ownership if the home is currently in the husband's sole name.</P>
    <P>I will explain in more detail why this is such a major problem.  I have here the statistical information on social welfare for 1992, published by the Department of Social Welfare.  That report states that 15,000 women were in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.  I am sure a number of those wives were living in homes jointly owned with their husband but it is not unreasonable to assume that at least 50 per cent were living in homes that were vested in the husband's sole name.  From Government statistics alone I can identify in the region of 7,500 wives for whom this measure will not provide automatic joint ownership of the home.</P>
    <P>Let us take it a stage further.  One only qualifies for deserted wife's allowance on the basis of a means test.  There are many deserted wives throughout the country who do not qualify for this allowance and whose husbands or themselves have not made sufficient insurance contributions to qualify for the deserted wife's benefit. An unknown number of wives who are deserted do not appear in these statistics. There are also husbands and wives who have agreed to separate without concluding a formal agreement or by bringing proceedings, for example a husband may agree voluntarily to move out of the family home because of an extra marital relationship but that is not desertion and his wife does not qualify for deserted wife's benefit.  A husband may be currently making support payments to his wife from whom he made a verbal agreement to separate.  It is impossible to estimate the number of wives in that position.  No one has accurate statistics and I am not going to pretend that I have. We do not know the number of husbands <Col N="895" /> and wives who may be getting legal advice on their options where only one spouse was left residing in the family home prior to 25 June 1993.  A very conservative estimate of the number of wives in that category would be between 16,000 and 20,000.  I will not say there are 25,000 people or more in that position because I do not know, but it is reasonable to assume that there are more wives living apart from their husbands without any legal arrangements sorted out between them who are not in receipt of social welfare payments than there are wives who are in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I can see no justification for the Minister's amendment defining the &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo;.  The fact that on Report Stage we are still trying to redefine &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; illustrates the complexities and difficulties in this area, even when there is agreement on all sides of the House on the principle of what we need to do.  I tabled an amendment to amendment No. 3 because I anticipate that if the Minister does not accept my amendment there will be huge anomalies and injustices created and those anomalies and injustices may give rise to constitutional difficulties with this legislation. Wives in identical circumstances will be treated differently depending on the date their husbands deserted them. That is a bizarre way to go about implementing legislation of this nature. When the Family Home Protection Act came into force in 1976, there was not a cut off date to define what a family home was.</P>
    <P>In his amendment the Minister seeks to define matrimonial home as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 4, to delete lines 8 to 12 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `matrimonial home' means a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided or reside on or at any time after the 25th day of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling <Col N="896" /> and exercisable over any other land;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I propose that the following addition be attached to this definition:</P>
    <P>In the last line, after &ldquo;other land;&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the expression comprises in addition a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily resided prior to the 25th of June, 1993, as their sole or principal residence and in which either spouse continued to reside on or after the 25th of June, 1993 and includes any easements attached or annexed to such a dwelling and exercisable over any other land;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that acceptance of this provision would introduce uncertainty into the legislation.  It will not, because if someone had moved out of the family home 20 years ago it would be unjust to give that person an interest in the matrimonial home and there is specific provision in this legislation to ensure that he or she does not get it.  To take the example the Minister gave, if someone had moved out of the matrimonial home 20 years ago and the couple had resolved any matters at issue between them by legal proceedings or by conclusion of a formal deed of separation, that would not affect the ownership position of the family home because of the other provisions contained in the legislation.</P>
    <P>This amendment will provide protection for thousands of deserted and separated wives for whom the courts have not made orders to resolve the consequences of their marriage breakdowns and where there is no written agreement in force between the husband and wife in regard to ownership of the family home. Let us take the example of a husband who deserted his wife 20 years ago and has been living with another woman since.  Let us say no legal arrangements were put in place and, following the enactment of the Family Home Protection Act, the wife did not take any legal steps in respect of ownership of the home because she knew the husband <Col N="897" /> could not effect the sale of the home without her consent.  She continues to live in the home which is in her husband's sole name while he resides in another house he has purchased jointly with a person with whom he is having an extramarital relationship.  Is the Minister saying that such a wife should not have automatic joint ownership of the family home?  He may say that she is entitled to take proceedings under the judicial separation Act, but that argument could be used to prove that this legislation is unnecessary because if one's marriage breaks down either before or after 25 June 1993, one can take proceedings under the judicial separation Act and ask the courts to provide one with a joint or full interest in the family home.</P>
    <P>The intent of this legislation is to recognise that marriage is a partnership and that when two people marry the family home, in law, will be regarded as jointly owned.  The intention is to provide wives, who are often the financially vulnerable party in a marriage breakdown, with the security of knowing that if they must go to the courts or seek legal advice that, at the very least, they jointly own the family home.  The Minister has committed a grave error in dismissing my amendment before hearing the explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I were on the same side in the divorce referendum of 1986. I recall the individuals and groups who sought public recognition during that campaign in opposing the referendum by spreading scare stories to frighten people who, in the weeks prior to the referendum, were in favour of divorce, into voting against divorce.  I spoke to many wives both in my capacity as a public representative canvassing support for the referendum and as a solicitor advising people in respect of marriage problems. During the divorce referendum campaign thousands of deserted wives planned to vote in favour of divorce but were frightened into voting against it by scare stories which claimed that if they voted for it they would be left homeless.  Despite the promises of the then Government to introduce legislation similar to the judicial separation Act to provide protection <Col N="898" /> in the home prior to divorce decrees coming into force, they were led to believe that if they voted for divorce they would lose their family home.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether or not divorce is introduced, this is a worth-while Bill. The Minister spoke about the need to put this Bill in place so that people would feel secure if a divorce referendum is held and to ensure that the scare tactics used to frighten people, against their better judgment, into voting against divorce would not be successful again.  However, the Minister is depriving thousands of wives of rights to which they are entitled under this legislation and creating two categories of wives, the wife whose husband deserted her prior to 25 June 1993 and the wife whose husband deserted her after 25 June 1993.  Both will hold a different status and that is indefensible in the context of rights in respect of the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also laying the foundations for the creation of major difficulties for the success of a divorce referendum, something I hope will be successful.  That type of anomaly would be exploited unmercifully by those who oppose a change to allow people a second chance when their marriages break down.  It is extraordinary that a Minister for Equality and Law Reform should introduce legislation that will create two types of wives in law, the wife who has rights in the matrimonial home and the wife who does not and who will be left to the discretion of the Judiciary to get ownership rights in respect of the matrimonial home if her marriage breaks down.  That is the exact antithesis to the philosophy which should surround the Minister's Department in addressing issues.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage any difficulties in practice in accepting my amendment. The uncertainty to which the Minister referred could be dealt with easily by other provisions in the Bill.  The Minister is condemning to uncertainty thousands of wives who, because they do not understand the technicalities of this legislation but have a general indication from the media that the legislation is before the <Col N="899" /> House, believe this legislation will assist them, but they are wrong.  What is happening here in the context of wives who were separated prior to 25 June 1993 and live on their own in the family home is of no relevance because they are not entitled to the same rights as others.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour this point any longer.  I am conscious that this legislation is implementing a principle we all support, it is extremely difficult and technical and the general public do not understand its technicalities or the anomalies pertaining to it, but this issue is vital to thousands of wives.  Of course, as the legislation also extends rights to the husband, it will be vital to husbands whose wives currently own the family home and have deserted their husbands.  That is not the usual position when marriages break down but it is the case in some circumstances. I am sure all Members have met husbands who are in that position.</P>
    <P>We should not enact a measure which, in effect, under statute compounds a discrimination and gives a legislative imprimatur and affirmation to it.  Currently, no wife has an automatic joint interest in the family home, unless the home is in joint names or she has made a financial contribution to it.  Under this legislation a category of wives will remain in that position and others will be taken out of it.  Such discrimination may be unconstitutional and could be at the very root of the operation of this measure but I would be happy to be proved wrong.</P>
    <P>I stated in respect of other provisions of the Bill that it would be a good idea if the Bill was referred to the Supreme Court for a decision as to its constitutionality. If the constitutionality of this Bill is not determined, pursuant to a constitutional reference by the President, as sure as night follows day within 12 months of its enactment it will be constitutionally challenged by either a husband or a wife.  The Bill will wind its way through the High Court and the Supreme Court and the law will be uncertain for one or two years.  That is not desirable. The Minister is adding another complication. He has dealt with a portion of <Col N="900" /> the problem that derived from the use of the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.  He has not dealt with the larger problem I referred to on Committee Stage that he appears to be copperfastening today.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  In his later amendments he appears to be seeking to amend the Bill to deal with problems other Deputies and I raised on Committee Stage and which the general public were informed through the broadcasting media need not be addressed.  He now recognises the need to address them.  This is our last opportunity to address this issue in the Dáil unless it is returned from the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is intended to make the Bill workable, comprehensive and to apply it equally to people in identical circumstances.  It is regrettable that the Minister has indicated he does not intend to accept this amendment.  If he does not, this matter will be put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Report Stage I gave careful consideration to the commencement provisions of the operative and definition sections of the Act and concluded that the format presented in amendment No. 3 is the correct and proper one to use.</P>
      <P>There are two elements involved, that of residency and marriage.  To bring legal provisions into play now in regard to say a separation that took place 20 years ago is something that could not be seriously considered and would have many dangerous implications.  Far from accepting Deputy Shatter's point that to leave the provision as it is might have constitutional implications, I believe the reverse would be the case.  To introduce the element of indefinite, non-defined, uncertain retrospectivity could bring constitutional questions into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out to provide that married couples will have the ownership of their matrimonial home vested jointly in them from the date the Bill was published on 25 June 1993.  That was the date on which a new prospective legal position was established.  People who separated 20 years ago are in a different position. They have rights but their rights are <Col N="901" /> different.  The legal and factual position of that family changed from the date of their separation 20 years ago.  They may have availed of their rights during the years of their separation.  They may have entered into a separation agreement and brought proceedings under the 1989 judicial separation Act.  If they had not taken such action it is still open to them to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Shatter's comment that by reason of the judicial separation Act this Bill is redundant and I am sure very few people would hold that view.  The Bill is an important and necessary one.  It deals with marriage partnership positions as the law finds them at the date of introduction of the Bill on 25 June 1993 and from that date forward. The legal position of couples before that date is covered by a different legal regime.  Their rights exist and are adequately covered by the 1989 Act.  In the majority of cases whatever arrangements were appropriate may by now have been availed of and if not, may yet be availed of.</P>
    <P>To leave open the question of vesting a matrimonial home in a spouse in respect of a separation which took place 20 years ago would give rise to incalculable conveyancing problems.  It would have very serious effects on the conveyancing and marketability of property and would raise retrospective questions relating to an indefinite period in the past which could not seriously be contemplated.  It would leave the way open for unjust and unacceptable positions.</P>
    <P>Under Deputy Shatter's amendment, if a wife was deserted by her husband 15 years ago and he settled with another woman, and the wife owned the dwelling, the spouse who deserted would be vested with a joint interest in the former matrimonial home.  That position is not one that should be allowed develop.  I have gone the maximum length to meet the proposals put to me on Committee Stage by taking the earliest possible date that could reasonably be contemplated as setting up the new legal situations envisaged by this Bill &mdash; the date of introduction of the Bill on 25 June 1993.  Having considered <Col N="902" /> the matter carefully, I regret it would not be appropriate to extend the date, particularly on an indefinite basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the Minister has not fully grasped the position. His Bill ensures that no one will unjustly benefit as a result of joint ownership.  The Minister gave an example of a wife who owns a family home and was deserted by her husband 15 years ago and he claimed that under my amendment the husband could now claim joint interest.  The Bill provides a mechanism to ensure the husband could not gain joint interest.  To take a counter example of the wife who is living in a home solely owned by the husband who deserted her 15 years ago. Why should that wife not have an automatic joint interest?  A wife who was deserted on 25 June 1993 will have that right.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill are anomalous, unjust, arbitrary and do not provide for equality of treatment.  No one outside this House has any control over the date on which a Bill will be published. The provisions in the Bill make no legal sense.  The Minister is not considering this matter as someone whose remit is to protect the rights of vulnerable wives. Effectively he is approaching this matter as a conveyancing lawyer might.  Lawyers who deal with conveyancing matters have always felt uncomfortable at the manner in which family law impinges on the work they do.  I do not see this as creating any more problems than the Family Home Protection Act did.  At the time it was enacted it had certain defects that gave rise to problems, but this difficulty was not one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act provided for the definition of a family home as a residence in which a couple were ordinarily residing or in which they had ordinarily resided.  It did not say that a family home was only a family home if a couple lived in it after the date on which the Family Home Protection Bill was published.  Although that Act was passed in 1986 it provided protection for wives who had been deserted in the seventies and early eighties and this Bill should <Col N="903" /> provide the same joint interest right.  If there were any constitutional difficulties they would have arisen in the context of challenges to the Family Home Protection Act.  The Minister is wrong in what he is saying.  I regret that he is not taking on board this amendment.  The message that should go out from this House is that a wife who has been living apart from her husband prior to 25 June 1993 without having had the good fortune to conclude legal arrangements to ensure an ownership right in the family home cannot look to this measure for ownership rights and that this measure is of no relevance to a woman living apart from her husband in the home owned by her husband if she has been living apart from him prior to 25 June 1993.  That is the message and it is a wrong message.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I did not say that the judicial separation Act was not relevant.  Of course it is.  Fortunately that Act was put through this House as a Private Members Bill and will provide for a residue of protection, but it means that a wife now going to the court under that Act when a marriage is broken down, if she has separated from her husband prior to 25 June 1993, may do so from a starting point where she has no ownership right in the home but she will if she is separated after 25 June 1993 have such ownership right.  Having completed the debate on the matter I regret that the Minister is not accepting this amendment and I now want it put to a vote.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 1 to 6, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a married couple have concluded a deed of separation or a separation agreement on or after the 25th day of July, 1993 but prior to the commencement of section 4, the application of that section to the matrimonial home concerned shall be subject and without prejudice to the provisions of any such agreement made between the spouses.</P>

    <P>This is a technical amendment which has been designed to ensure that the section works and I urge the Minister to accept it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would address in a more technically correct manner what I perceive to be the Minister's intentions in regard to this section and ensure that the legal position was relatively clear with regard to couples who resolve their marriage difficulties in the interregum period between the date of publication of the Bill and the date it comes into operation by the conclusion of deeds of separation which address the issue of the matrimonial home or by the granting of court orders.  It is a lacuna in the Bill that this is not spelled out to this extent.  Issues of interpretation could give rise to a great deal of litigation if the current subsection (2) remains as drafted without the amendment I am proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 11 is designed to ensure that the joint ownership provisions of section 4 will be subject <Col N="909" /> to any court order made during the period between 25 June 1993 and the commencement of section 4.  In the case of a couple who have separated or agreed to separate during that period, section 5 (2) already makes those provisions subject to the terms of any separation agreements. The main difference between section 5 (2) as proposed to be amended and Deputy Shatter's amendment seems to be that he does not wish the existing court order in relation to the ownership of the matrimonial home to be affected by the coming into operation of section 4.  Section 5 (4) expressly preserves the jurisdiction of the courts in relation to any future such orders.  If, after full consideration, a court has awarded full ownership of a home to one spouse because of, say, the reckless behaviour of the other spouse, section 4 shall not operate to give a half share of the ownership back to him or her.</P>
      <P>I would like an opportunity to consider this proposal between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad.  There is the point that such an order could have been made many years ago and the errant spouse may have become rehabilitated in the meantime.  If that did not happen and section 4 applied, it could be disapplied under section 6 of the Bill by reference to the misbehaviour of the benefiting spouse.  I am inclined to be sympathetic to the principle of the amendment.  I will look at it closely and if I find it necessary I will move an appropriate amendment in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The manner of dealing with the matter is correctly set out in the amendments I have tabled.  I raised these issues on Committee Stage to warn the Minister of my concerns about them. Certainly that is my recollection.  I am not satisfied that what the Minister is doing deals with these issues adequately and it is my belief that the amendment as tabled does so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> In relation to the Minister's subsection (2) it is not clear, when he talks about a couple having separated, whether he means separated and some form of agreement put in place, that one has walked out on the other or that they have agreed to live apart with no formal legal agreement in place setting out what is to happen to the matrimonial home.  That would give rise to very real problems.  I do not want to delay the House unduly on this.  I merely want to say that I am pressing the amendment.  Otherwise this matter will go to the Seanad and will then come back here.  If the Minister feels there is merit in the amendment he should take this amendment on board to avoid the necessity of having to come back here.  If, on reflection, he finds further change is needed, the amendment might inevitably have to come back here. However, from the Minister's remarks, I think he recognises that the amendment I have tabled is desirable and as we are now completing this matter in this House I see no particular reason for postponing this further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> In page 8, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Act, 1850, shall not apply so as to enable a judgment against the spouse in whose favour section 4 applies to be registered against the interest to which that spouse becomes entitled by virtue of that section in the matrimonial home concerned in respect of debts, obligations or other liabilities arising out of acts or omissions occurring before the application of subsection (2) or (3) of the section to the interest of the other spouse in the home.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Act, 1850, a creditor who obtains a judgment in a court against a landowner may convert that judgment into a mortgage against the land.  On Committee Stage there were very persuasive arguments advanced in favour of the idea that the debts of a non-owning spouse prior to the section 4 interest becoming vested should not be available to creditors as this would put them in a position which they would not otherwise have enjoyed of being able to move against the matrimonial home concerned.  This could arise in a situation where the non-owning spouse who has incurred substantial debts did not have any worthwhile property interests which justified his or her creditors in obtaining a judgment mortgage.</P>
    <P>I undertook to consider this matter further and bring forward an appropriate amendment.  The amendment before the House is intended to ensure that the obligations incurred by a non-owning spouse prior to the section 4 vesting will not be available for ultimate conversion into a judgment mortgage.  This is done by effectively disapplying the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Act, 1850 in this one specific instance.  I am sure that Deputies will share my view that this is a fair way of proceeding.  It should be noted that the provision is quite broad and extends not just to debts in the ordinary meaning of the term but also to contractual obligations <Col N="912" /> and to any liabilities that might be incurred on foot of a personal injuries claim, for example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that I specifically raised with the Minister on Committee Stage.  It was debated at some length and the Minister agreed to have a look at it.  I welcome the amendment he has tabled.  I support that amendment as it would ensure that a spouse who has been dealing impecuniously with the family finances or who has incurred large numbers of debts that the house-owning spouse may be unaware of will not be able, following the enactment of this Bill, to affix the matrimonial home with any liability for those debts.  It is a welcome amendment.  I am glad the Minister took on board what was said on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 12, after &ldquo;1989&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;nor as affecting any matter in issue in relation to a matrimonial home or a family home in respect of which proceedings were issued before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary to ensure the constitutionality of the legislation. There are currently before the courts many hundreds of cases pursuant to the judicial separation Act both at Circuit Court level and at High Court level in which there are claims and disputes with regard to ownership of matrimonial homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Sinn Féin funds case many years ago this House sought by way of legislation directly to affect a litigation before the court by changing the law whilst that litigation was before the court in a way which would require the court to reach a particular decision based on the legislation the Dáil was then enacting, as opposed to the possibility of the court reaching an entirely different decision if that legislation were not enacted.  It was <Col N="913" /> held to be unconstitutional for laws to be enacted which directly impinged on current or existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already said I fear there may be constitutional challenges to this legislation that will create difficulties.  The amendment I tabled earlier may relate to an area that will give rise to constitutional challenges but there is nothing I can now do about that.  I am anxious that this issue should not create another layer of difficulties.  To some extent this is a technical amendment relating to the way the work of this House and legislation we enact interacts with litigation pending in the courts.  I ask the Minister to take on board this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure this amendment is necessary.  In so far as a family home is concerned section 23 (2) as proposed to be amended provides that any proceedings instituted under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, before the passing of the Bill will not be affected by the amendment to the definition of family home being made by subsection (1) (a) of that section.  As regards a matrimonial home, this concept will not come into being until the Bill is passed so that technically at any rate proceedings cannot be instituted in relation to it before then. However, I would like to explore the matter further in consultation with the Attorney General to see if some transitional provision may be necessary for proceedings instituted after 25 June last in relation to a home which becomes a matrimonial home when the Bill becomes law.  If necessary, I shall move an appropriate amendment in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to a later section which deals with the Family Home Protection Act.  There are proceedings in being currently under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act in which claims will be made regarding beneficial interests in a family home or matrimonial home and there are proceedings in being under the judicial separation Act in which a husband or wife may ask the court to make property transfer orders or sale orders in relation to a <Col N="914" /> family home or a matrimonial home.  The court will have to start from a key position of knowing in whose ownership the home is held at the start of those proceedings. It is quite clear that the section the Minister referred to is not adequate to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I find myself in a rather odd position in relation to this legislation in that rather than standing on this side of the House as an Opposition Deputy &mdash; these are technical issues &mdash; perhaps I should be getting some retainer from the Minister to ensure the legislation he puts through the House is workable and is not constitutionally infirm, giving rise to difficulties. I would have expected that the discussions the Minister is suggesting he will have with the Attorney General would have preceded Report Stage.  I am quite certain this is an amendment that should be made.  I am certain that if the amendment is not accepted the Minister will come back to this House from the Seanad with yet another amendment. The amendment could be put into this section, as I am seeking, and into the later section referred to by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are starting to reach the stage where this House is ceasing to act as a Legislature.  Perhaps what I should do is every so often send the Minister private flyers by way of comment on his legislation so that he can consider them in some backroom with the Attorney General. We are supposed to be legislators. This is a technical amendment and I am sure the general public has not the remotest interest in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6. &mdash;A person who has been guilty of the murder of his or her spouse shall be precluded from retaining or acquiring any interest in the matrimonial home under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter refers to a debate we had on Committee Stage.  Earlier the Minister pointed out that it might be unjust that someone could get joint interest in a matrimonial home if they had many years before left the matrimonial home.  It would be highly unjust if someone who murdered their wife or husband automatically got joint interest in the matrimonial home and if the only way that joint interest could be taken from them was by surviving children or personal representatives initiating court proceedings under this legislation to deprive them of that interest.  On Committee Stage I suggested that an appropriate measure should apply not only to murder but also to attempted murder and manslaughter. Some Deputies argued that, for example, in the case of a wife who is convicted of manslaughter upon the death of her husband, having been the victim of violence for many years and was provoked into her actions, it would be unjust in those circumstances that she should be automatically disentitled to joint interest in the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>The amendment is different to that I proposed.  My amendment states: &ldquo;A person who has been guilty of the murder of his or her spouse shall be precluded from retaining or acquiring any interest in the matrimonial home under the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  Under the Succession Act, 1965, a person who murders his or her spouse is automatically precluded from entitlement as a legal right to a share in the estate of that spouse. That Act also deals with manslaughter and attempted murder, as my original amendment sought to do.  I have taken into account what Deputies said and, bearing in mind other provisions in the legislation, it is not unreasonable to <Col N="916" /> remove the reference to attempted murder and manslaughter.  We should not allow a situation to prevail whereby, for example, if a husband owns a house and the wife, on a pre-meditated, planned basis, murders her husband she would automatically have joint ownership. Equally, if the wife owns the family home and, on a pre-meditated, planned basis, the husband murders the wife he should not have automatic joint interest in the matrimonial home.  The position should not prevail whereby the only way the husband would be deprived of joint interest would be by the initiation of court proceedings by the personal representatives of the deceased wife or by the surviving children.  I propose that where a spouse is found by the courts to be guilty of the murder of the other spouse automatic joint ownership of the matrimonial home should not apply.</P>
    <P>It is particularly anomalous that a spouse convicted of murder is deprived of inheritance rights under the 1965 Act but will initially get joint interest under this Bill.  If a person is convicted of murder it does not mean they have killed their husband or wife because of some uncontrollable provocation to which they have been subjected.  It means they have killed the person cold-bloodedly on a planned basis with the intention to kill. As a person is deprived of his succession rights under the 1965 Act &mdash; there is no suggestion from the Minister that he will amend that aspect of that Act &mdash; this amendment should be made to this Bill so that it will be consistent with the approach we have taken to this horrendous problem which rarely arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well settled legal principle that a person may not profit by that person's own crime.  Where one joint tenant kills another the joint tenancy will be severed and the murderer will be prevented in equity from benefiting from the right of survivorship.  If both spouses have a share in the ownership of a home by virtue of section 4 and one kills the other he or she will not acquire full ownership by survivorship.  If the spouse who commits the murder is the spouse <Col N="917" /> who originally owned the home he or she will not get back the half share that was conferred by section 4 on the murdered spouse but will retain his or her own half share.  If the murderer is the benefiting spouse he or she will not benefit by receiving the murdered spouse's half share, but as the Bill stands he or she will retain the half share in the joint tenancy conferred by section 4.</P>
      <P>There is a number of issues involved here, one of which is whether we wish to treat the statutory joint tenancy substantially different from a joint tenancy created by the spouses.  On the one hand, if a joint tenancy is to be the norm the spouse who committed murder should be in the same position as any other joint tenant, particularly where the statutory joint tenancy has been in operation for a long period, and forfeit only the half share in the tenancy that would otherwise pass by survivorship.  On the other hand, the House has indicated by its acceptance of the principle of section 6 that the benefiting spouse can be deprived of the benefit of section 4 by a serious misconduct. Clearly murder would justify any court in disapplying section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I am making &mdash; it may justify a court not applying these provisions but why should the personal representatives or surviving children have to go to court to deprive a murderer of an interest which would otherwise be vested in the murderer when they do not have to do so under the Succession Act?  The Minister read out a grand technical script about how joint tenancies work.  The bottom line is that under this legislation a person may acquire a joint interest in the home although the legal title to the home was not originally in that person's name.  The point I am making is that a person who acquires a joint interest in the home should not be entitled ultimately to own the full house and should not be entitled to retain his joint interest in it if he murders his spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give as an example the position of a wife who owns her family home at present and who is living with her <Col N="918" /> husband.  If this legislation is passed by the Oireachtas and this section becomes operable on 30 March next but the husband murders his wife on 2 April 1994, we will be told the husband has a joint interest in the matrimonial home even though he has murdered his wife.  If his children and the personal representatives of his wife want to deprive him of that interest they will have to go to court.  If he is foolish enough to murder his wife on 28 March 1994, a few days before the legislation comes into force, he will not have a joint interest in the home.  If that happens &mdash; and God forbid it does &mdash; how many Members of this House will stand up and say it is an outrage that this murderer has a joint interest in the home?  Emergency legislation will have to be rushed through the House to deal with this peculiar anomaly.</P>
    <P>If this anomaly arises it will not be unexpected.  If the Minister is saying the court will deprive a murderer of his interest in the home if this happens, why should we generate legal costs and force personal representatives and children to go to court and to get legal advice?  Why force proceedings to be brought which presumably will ultimately be paid for out of the estate or property of the deceased person to the detriment of the people, her close family, who will inherit the property?  I do not understand why the Minister will not accept this amendment. We are having a very strange debate on this Bill.  It seems that a rather odd message is being sent from this House, that is, a wife who was deserted on 1 June 1993 and who is living in a house which was owned by her husband will not be given any protection under this Bill but a spouse who murders his wife after the Bill comes into force should start off with having a joint interest in the home.  This means we are giving preferential treatment to future murderers over previously deserted wives.  I find all this very odd.  It is an outrageous anomaly, an injustice. The Minister's reluctance to accept this amendment makes absolutely no sense. I will not delay the House any further.  I have made the point and I cannot make <Col N="919" /> it any better than that.  I wish my amendment to be put to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) if the application is by the personal representative, or by or on behalf of a child, of a deceased spouse, the fact (if it be the case) that an application under subsection (1) had not been made by that spouse in relation to the matrimonial home concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While I remain convinced of the desirability of allowing children in particular to apply for an order disapplying section 4 where one of the parents has died, the somewhat distasteful nature of such proceedings and the fact that success in obtaining such an order may result in the enrichment of the applicant cannot be denied.  Therefore, I have decided that it would be appropriate to introduce an additional specific factor to which the courts must have regard before granting such an order, namely, that no application under section 6 was made by the deceased spouse during his or her lifetime. I am sure that the courts would in any event have given due weight to this factor, but it is no harm to specify it in the manner proposed in this amendment.</P>

    <P>Under section 6 as now drafted the court may make an order declaring that section 4 shall cease to apply to a benefiting spouse's interest in the matrimonial home or shall be deemed to have ceased to apply to that interest.  However, it may be the case that the benefiting spouse has already registered a joint tenancy interest under, for example, section 8.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that any vestigial legal interest also revests or is deemed to have been revested in the other spouse once the court order has been registered.</P>

      <P>I put down this amendment as a fall back position following the debate on Committee Stage about the rights of a spouse when the opt-out clause is being used and a spouse is giving up her right to a half share in the property.  The Minister seemed to be intransigent on Committee Stage and we did not think he would take this point on board.  The point was very strongly made on Committee Stage that the rights of a spouse, particularly the wife &mdash; it is more likely to be a woman &mdash; had to be protected.</P>

      <P>Let me finish my point. At the time we seemed to be trying to push an immovable object.  Even though it took a lot of pushing, I am delighted that the Minister has put down an amendment which includes this clause.  I know the difficulties, financial and otherwise, experienced by people in getting legal advice.  Perhaps a special fund should be set up for this purpose &mdash; I cannot imagine that many people would be affected.  Despite the financial difficulties, there is no alternative to establishing the principle that a spouse who is giving up his or her interest in what is probably the most important asset they will ever own should not make a declaration until he or she is fully aware of their legal position.</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 19 which will protect the rights of women in particular in regard to ownership, a right which was hard won.  I will happily withdraw my amendment No. 18 which is not as comprehensive as the Minister's amendment.  I welcome this change.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following: &ldquo;(2) (a) A declaration under subsection (1) shall be void unless, before making it, the spouse concerned has received advice from a lawyer in relation to the declaration and its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) In relation to such a declaration, a certificate purporting to be signed by a lawyer and stating that the spouse concerned has, before making the declaration, received advice in relation to it and its effect from the person purporting to sign the certificate shall, without proof of the signature of that person <Col N="922" /> or that such person was a lawyer, be evidence in any proceedings of the matters stated in the certificate. (c) In this subsection lawyer', in relation to advice to a spouse, does not include a lawyer who is acting or has acted on behalf of the other spouse or who is a member of a firm of lawyers which, or another member of which, is so acting or has so acted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was extensive debate on Committee Stage concerning the need to obtain independent legal advice. Deputies from all sides of the House seemed to be of the view that the provision of such advice was essential before a benefiting spouse should be able to opt-out of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Although I still have some reservations about this matter, in response to the weight of argument I have decided to introduce this amendment to deal with the points raised on Committee Stage. The essential element of the proposed amendment is that a declaration opting out will be void unless the advice of an independent lawyer in relation to it and its effect has first been obtained.</P>

      <P>There was a very lengthy debate on this point on Committee Stage. I can recall the Minister engaging in something of a campaign against this proposal.  Every time I turn on the radio I seem to hear the Minister launching attacks on lawyers who might make money out of giving advice to wives about this issue.  Perhaps the Minister will be a bit more restrained in taking to the airwaves in that way in future when people come forward with constructive proposals.</P>

    <P>My amendment No. 20 is somewhat different from the Minister's amendment. <Col N="923" /> I bore in mind a remark made by the Minister which rang a chord with me.  I took the view that there must be protection to ensure that no wife was forced into signing any documents without having independent legal advice and that there had to be some certainty that the advice was independent.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised an issue regarding two people who are perfectly happy and who do not wish to incur expense, so I framed a somewhat different amendment to the one I proposed on Committee Stage.  I proposed a new subsection (2) which would state that a &ldquo;declaration pursuant to this subsection shall not be valid unless the person making such declaration has first obtained independent legal advice and in such declaration confirms that such legal advice was obtained or in such declaration confirms that their entitlement to obtain independent legal advice was explained to them and they have declined to seek such advice&rdquo;.</P>

I did not agree with those objections and I felt they contained an element which was designed more to pander to prejudice than to ensure that people's rights were truly protected.  Wives should not be forced into signing documents that they would subsequently discover to be hugely prejudicial.  In the light of the Minister's amendment I will not formally move my amendment.  I will agree to the Minister's amendment and I welcome the fact that he has had a change of mind on this issue.</P>

On a technical basis the Minister might want to <Col N="924" /> reconsider subsection (c) of the proposal when he puts the Bill before the Seanad. I am not sure whether the term &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; is normally used in legislation.  One often sees references to solicitors or barristers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

On a technical basis I am asking the Minister to examine it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this amendment is being made.  I regret that we had such an unnecessarily lengthy discussion about this on Committee Stage and indeed the Minister, myself and others present in the House today took to the airwaves on this particular issue at one stage. However, the change that has been made will ensure that a wife does not sign documentation whilst unaware of the consequences.</P>

    <P>I expect we will complete this stage of this Bill within ten minutes.  As we are five minutes away from 1.30 p.m. could it be agreed by way of motion of the House that we sit here until 1.40 p.m. to complete the Bill rather than coming back to deal with only five remaining minutes?  The Minister may want a moment to think about it but we are coming towards the conclusion of matters and I am inviting the Minister to consider making the proposal.  I will continue to speak to my amendment so as not to delay the House.</P>
    <P>In the context of amendments Nos. 33 and 34, I suggest we also discuss amendment No. 40 because they are interrelated. I want to explain the reason for these amendments and I suggest we discuss amendment No. 40 in the context of the other two.

      <P>Section 18 seeks to replace section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, which was a replacement for section 17 of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882.  Section 12 of the 1957 Act provided the courts with the general jurisdiction to determine disputes between spouses concerning property. Section 18 of this Bill replaces section 12 and again provides the courts with a general jurisdiction to determine disputes between spouses about property and some others in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I expressed concern that a large body of law has built up under section 12 of the 1957 Act that would continue to be applicable under section 18 of the new Act save in so far as this Bill contains a specific provision to amend or reform that law.  The reason I am seeking to delete the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; and replace it with the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; is that I want to take the wording from the 1957 Act and put it into <Col N="928" /> section 18 so as to avoid a plethora of court cases in which it is suggested the court has some different power in dealing with property under section 18 from the power it had under section 12, and so as to preserve the existing case law in this area, save in so far as it is amended by express provisions in this Bill which will arise specifically under section 4, this particular section and also the section to which amendment No. 40 relates.</P>
    <P>I am seeking in amendment No. 40 to insert in the legislation a subsection which states:</P>
    <P>(3)  For the avoidance of doubt, the law as developed by the Courts in proceedings determined pursuant to section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, prior to the commencement of this Act shall continue to be applied in proceedings instituted under section 18 of this Act save in so far as it is amended by section 4 of this Act and by this section.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and also to give consideration to extending time for the few minutes necessary to complete the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The students summer jobs scheme, which was introduced earlier this year to provide work for students who were no longer eligible for unemployment assistance, <Col N="930" /> proved to be an outstanding success. Over 9,000 job opportunities were offered by more than 2,100 sponsors throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is a reservoir of jobs, particularly in the voluntary and community sectors, which could be available to school leavers who may not have other options open to them.</P>
    <P>To broaden the range of options available to young people and to make use of the job opportunities which are available in this area, I have received the approval of the Government for a new school leavers jobs scheme.  This will operate along similar lines to the students summer jobs scheme and will be open, on a voluntary basis, to school leavers who wish to take up these job opportunities. Working on projects within their communities will provide invaluable work experience and practical on-the-job training for those concerned which will enhance their prospects of gaining sustainable employment afterwards.</P>
    <P>The details are being finalised at present.  I wish to explain there will be no element of compulsion involved in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If this new scheme is similar to the summer work scheme I should point out that that was a compulsory scheme, despite what the Minister says, because if people did not take up the option they did not receive unemployment assistance.  Would the Minister accept that this initiative, if we can call it that, constitutes another attempt to massage the unemployment figures, now well in excess of 300,000?  Would the Minister further accept that this proposal is just another one of a number of uncoordinated and overlapping schemes within the overall social welfare, education and training areas?  Would the Minister also give us the views of his junior Minister and confirm that the Labour Party are agreeable to the provisions of this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record I should make it quite clear that unemployment assistance had been taken from summer <Col N="931" /> students before I introduced that scheme. That is the chronological position; the scheme was introduced as an option for the summer.  That is now in the past and will be a matter which will arise for discussion again in relation to next year. I am particularly concerned about the demoralising effects of the dole and social exclusion, the exclusion of unemployment assistance to young people who do not have the advantage of further educational opportunities or training courses.  After the leaving certificate certain numbers of students are taken into third level educational institutions, in training courses with FÁS and on other schemes.  After all of those, there remain approximately 5,000 or 6,000 with nothing, with no opportunity.  In these circumstances I wanted to provide them with the option which arose from our experience gleaned from summer students.  I am convinced of the potential of this voluntary option for new school leavers who are about to join the dole queues.  In that respect we are discussing and preparing final details with the Department of Enterprise and Employment the possibility of having a training module attached to that scheme, because there is no doubt but that jobs of that kind are available within the community in areas we have witnessed following work carried out under the summer jobs scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen mentioned also the overlapping of schemes.  They are not overlapping schemes but separate schemes for different segments of the overall 290,000 people unemployed.  Not all of those people are the same; they do not all have similar circumstances.  Some want second chance education, which is why we introduced second chance education schemes. Some want training schemes; some can benefit from the &ldquo;back to work&rdquo; allowance which I introduced recently.  All of these are options available to people who are unemployed.  I am sure Deputy Allen and other members of his party on that side of the House would not want to see the removal of these options which are much valued by unemployed people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully supportive of the idea of having guaranteed training and/or job opportunities for school leavers.  My concern is with the nature of the current scheme the Minister is introducing.  When he says that this scheme will be similar to the summer jobs scheme, would he say whether school leavers who have less than the £15 per week eligibility for unemployment assistance will be excluded from availing of these wonderful opportunities the Minister believes he has for them?  Furthermore, would he say whether if a student is not eligible at all for unemployment assistance, he would be eligible to participate under the provisions of this latest scheme?  In addition, would the Minister say what type of training will be provided? For example, will students have access to FÁS courses?  Will there be some kind of accreditation for training? Will there be an obligation on employers, whoever they may be, to have a particular training process undertaken and how will that be monitored?  Those are a few only of the questions remaining to be answered about this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, people in receipt of only £15, £16 or £20 a week would be receiving the £40 anyway, so it will be of benefit to very large numbers in terms of the actual money they will receive if they take the option.  But people who would be in receipt of under £15, as the terms are set, would not be eligible to participate in the scheme but obviously would be eligible for their payment in the normal way.  That will continue to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to people who would not qualify or be eligible at all, I should say they would not be coming to me; they would not be the people about whom I am talking in these circumstances.  On the question of whether they would have access to FÁS training courses, I should say that yes, of course they will have access to FÁS training courses.  I should point out that, as we become more computerised and more in control of our business in social welfare, I want to provide a better service to everybody involved. <Col N="933" /> In this case we are talking about people who are unemployed.  I want to be able to ensure there is good linkage to FÁS, that people are given access to FÁS and to opportunities.  Of course, they will have such access.  My problem is a very practical one.  It is this.  When all this access to FÁS and other opportunities are taken into account, I am left with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 school leavers who are given no opportunity, who have nothing but who have merely to sign on for the dole.  I want to endeavour to provide other options for such 18-year-olds leaving school.  I think Deputy Allen understands that is what I am endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>We are discussing with the Department of Enterprise and Employment a module which might ensure a training element and also that they would be interviewed at certain intervals to ensure that they are aware of the other options in FÁS and where possible that they pursue longer term training courses.</P>

      <P>I propose to call the two Deputies again but I wish very much that they would be brief for obvious reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the overlapping of schemes, to which I referred, were not my words but rather the words of the Minister for Finance in the memorandum he sent to Government? Also would the Minister accept that these jobs will create a permanent underclass in the whole employment area where Government sponsored jobs will be creating this underclass?  I am asking the Minister to drop this proposal and to seriously consider the CMRS proposals put forward at their conference recently. I would urge the Minister to scrap this daft proposal and take on a proposal that will create real jobs in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the CMRS proposals are being fully considered by the Department <Col N="934" /> of Finance.  This is a good scheme and I have no intention of dropping it. Although the Deputy asked me to drop the summer jobs scheme I did not and it has been quite successful.  Deputies should have a little patience and approach it on the lines suggested by Deputy De Rossa when he said &ldquo;There is some good in this but we want to try to shape and develop it.&rdquo;  The problem is that last week and this week students who have finished school are coming onto the live register.  There are all kinds of categories involved, including people who have as yet no incentive to go for training courses.  Obviously, we want to build up that incentive.  There are also people who would avail of training courses if they could get them.  I want to assist those and I want to do it now.  That may be inconvenient and awkward, but it is timely.  The Deputy talked about massaging the register.  I wish Deputies would stop that nonsense.  If we are going to do things for people it will have the effect of reducing the number of people sitting on the sideline permanently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that this scheme if it is to be introduced &mdash; and obviously the Minister is determined to do so &mdash; should actually provide real training for the school leavers concerned. I want some guarantees that that will be the case.  When the Minister says this is a voluntary scheme can he clarify if school leavers who would qualify for £15 or more per week unemployment assistance <Col N="935" /> and do not apply for this scheme will be denied unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point I wish to raise concerns people who may have a disability of one kind or another or be unfit for work but who in the normal course would qualify for this scheme on the basis that they are in receipt of £15 or more.  Will they be denied assistance because they are not in a position to take up a place?  Finally, can the Minister indicate to the House what rates will be paid?  Will they be paid the same rate as if they were taking up a FÁS course, that is approximately £55 per week, or will it be £40 per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate will be £40 for 16 hours; that is the rate at which the summer students were paid.  I can only give the money I have.  When we talk about FÁS funds and FÁS courses we are talking about courses that have 65 per cent EC support.  I do not have that support.  I have the money and I have got approval to spend a little more on this scheme, but beyond that I cannot go at this stage.  If Deputies are patient with me we may be able to develop something worthwhile from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about training.  As I have already said, we are discussing with the Department of Enterprise and Employment the question of a training module which would be appropriate to the situation.  There are three matters to be considered.  First, some of the groups are very professional and have training. Second, there is the question of ensuring that people see a pathway as well as the other opportunities.  As I see it, that is one aspect which would be part of a package. Third, experience is crucial.  All the studies carried out over the years <Col N="936" /> revealed that two things mattered to unemployed people: training and experience. We can at least give people experience. If we build a module of training &mdash; even though it is a simple one &mdash; and if we can then through our facilitators keep in touch with FÁS and ensure a better linkage between training and experience, then I think we will see in time a transformation in the way we approach these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 16 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7, individual court proceedings were initiated by a number of married women seeking retrospective payments in respect of the period of delay, from December 1984 to November 1986.  In some cases these proceedings were initiated as far back as 1985.  In the absence of implementing measures, settlements were made in eight such cases which were subject to conditions as to confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is normal practice in court proceedings, cheques payable to the individuals concerned on foot of the settlements in question were issued to them via the solicitors authorised by them to act on their behalf in the proceedings. Any agreement made between the individuals concerned and their solicitors is a matter for the parties concerned and is <Col N="938" /> completely outside of the control of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Government have provided for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the directive.  The necessary provisions are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992, which came into force in June 1992.  Since then some 40 sets of legal proceedings have been initiated, all of which include claims for alleviating payments.  The position in relation to the case referred to by Deputy Connor is that my Department has been asked to provide details of certain payments made to the people concerned and this information is being compiled at present.</P>
    <P>As already made known these proceedings will be defended by my Department. Ultimately the matter will have to be determined by the courts and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement in the matter at this time.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department attended a lengthy meeting of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights on Tuesday, 12 October to discuss matters related to the equal treatment provisions of interest to the committee.  In view of the legal proceedings currently in train, it was considered inappropriate for officials of the Department to attend an earlier public meeting of the committee.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister concede that there is approximately £160 million worth of claims before his Department, which he says is <i>sub judice</i>? I am referring to people who have settled with the Department and are unable to establish the level of the settlement either from their solicitor or from the Minister. Would the Minister accept that it was wrong for a public representative to be refused information in relation to specific cases when approaches were made to his Department?  This happened not only to Deputy Connor as I was refused information by the Department when I made approaches on a specific case.  The information should be supplied.  Does the Minister concede that this area is wide <Col N="939" /> open to possible exploitation by legal representatives as people cannot determine the level of settlement from any source?</P>

      <P>Deputy Connor raised a case in his question; proceedings are being considered and the solicitors have asked the Department for certain information which is being compiled.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I spoke at length in this House during the budget debate and on the Social Welfare Bill earlier this year about the measures introduced last year and the initiatives I have taken to review them.  Those initiatives include the following: the condition for disability benefit requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year has been revoked for people on long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance; <Col N="941" /> the condition for dental and optical benefits requiring at least 13 paid PRSI contributions in a recent contribution year has been revoked for people on disability benefit for more than 12 months, invalidity pension, long term unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance; dental and optical benefits have been restored to pensioners affected by the change in the contribution conditions requiring five years paid contributions; dental and optical benefits have also been restored to workers earnings up to £30,000 per annum and £60,000 per annum if the worker has a dependent spouse; the conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit for part-time workers has been relaxed by reducing from two days to one day the loss of employment which a part-time worker must incur in order to be regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment &mdash; I am further reviewing these conditions in relation to their impact on particular categories of workers; the amount of daily earnings disregarded in assessing earnings from casual insurable employment for unemployment assistance purposes has been substantially increased to the daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an extra £15 for each day worked; and, as regards exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, arrangements are being introduced to help people on social welfare incomes who get into difficulty with fuel bills.  The new arrangements involve the establishment of a code of practice which will integrate the help and advice available from the health boards and the fuel providers with a view to ensuring that clients who have problems in meeting bills receive all the assistance that is available.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the overall effect of the initiatives I have taken has been to alleviate any particular difficulties identified as arising from the measures introduced last year.  Deputies may be assured that the measures still in force will continue to be reviewed in the light of their impact on social welfare customers and any further necessary changes will be <Col N="942" /> made.  In that context, account will be taken of the views of the social partners in the context of discussions on a new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 21, 41 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced in November 1990, provides a direct payment to carers on a meanstested basis.  The scheme was originally designed for people on low incomes who were providing full-time care and attention to elderly or incapacitated social welfare pensioners.</P>
      <P>In July 1991, I extended the allowance to people providing care for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards or recipients of an equivalent social security payment from another EC country or a country which has a bilateral social security agreement with Ireland.</P>
      <P>At the end of August this year there were a total of 4,613 allowances in payment. Carers received a special increase in this year's budget of £6.20 per week bringing their payment up to the long term rate of £59.20.  This improvement represents an increase of almost 12 per cent compared to the general increase of 3.5 per cent provided for in the budget.</P>
      <P>The scheme is specifically designed for carers on low incomes who are providing full-time care and attention and who are residing with the pensioner.  Any extension of the scheme to include carers who are not residing with the persons needing care would have substantial cost implications. In addition, the question of relaxing the means-testing arrangements would also have significant cost implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources and in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>I am liaising with my colleague the Minister for Health, regarding provision for carers generally.  I recognise the essential contribution made by carers and I made provision this year for a fund of £500,000 for grants to organisations providing respite care facilities and services to full-time carers.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance under this scheme are being considered and I am confident that this initiative will help to bring about important improvements in the position of carers in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not need me to tell him that the scheme is highly contentious and unsatisfactory. Will he agree that in many cases the carer may live next door to the person being cared for?  I do not accept this argument that substantial costs would be incurred by including people such as family members who live next door, in the neighbourhood or, in the case of the countryside, within easy distance of the person needing care.  Will the Minister not agree that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are being denied the service because of this pernickety requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was introduced with those conditions for people living in the same household and to extend it beyond that would not include only the person next door.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many cases in which extra people could become qualified. In those circumstances budgetary approval would be required and extra funds would have to be allocated in the budget.  That matter will be given further consideration as the scheme develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if this provision took 2,000 or 3,000 elderly people out of our welfare institutions over a given period, an extra cost would not be incurred?  The Minister was kind enough to tell us that there are now 4,613 recipients, but will he tell us what percentage of the total number of applicants that represents?  I suggest it represents no more than 30 per cent of the total number who applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I listed some of the improvements we carried out this year in extending the scheme to the long-term rate.  That was a significant improvement and automatically made the scheme available to more people, as it is means tested.  However, any further extension or development of the scheme is a matter for the forthcoming budget and the scheme will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>As the Minister stated, everybody welcomed the improvement in the scheme.  Nevertheless, would he not agree that if he extended it to people not living on either side of the person requiring care, but to those willing to care for the elderly, we would be saving on other services?  Will the Minister make more of a commitment than merely telling us he will examine the matter in the forthcoming budget?  Will he tell us that this is the way we should proceed as a matter of policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that an extension of the type mentioned by the Deputies would incur a direct increased cost of approximately £13.5 million.  I accept Deputy Keogh's point about the savings element, but that matter will have to be developed further and I am open to discussions along those lines.  I will be discussing how the scheme can be further developed and improved with the Minister for Health, bearing in mind the savings that could be made.  I agree in principle with Deputy Keogh's point, but at budget time we would have to seek further moneys and prove that the scheme would bring about real savings. To prove such a case would require a great deal of homework but, in principle, I agree with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government is serious about community care, will the Minister consider extending the scheme in the manner suggested by my colleague? We are all aware that many elderly people prefer to stay in their homes for as long as possible and that, frequently, the support of a carer can mean the difference between staying in their homes and going into residential care.  That does not necessarily mean somebody who resides with the person needing care, but who lives nearby and is willing to visit the person involved each day.  I am surprised at the Minister's initial hesitancy about this matter, although he appears willing to reconsider the matter.  Surely such a provision would incur budgetary savings given the cost of residential care compared with supportive community care such as this.</P>

The Minister should recall the comments made by the Taoiseach last week when he shed crocodile tears about the elderly and introduce a scheme whereby if an adult goes to live with an elderly person such a person will not lose his or her electricity and telephone allowances. Will the Minister agree that even increasing the eligibility limit by £10 would cost only £1 million in this budget year and £2.3 million in a full year?  In view of the cost of institutional care, will the Minister agree that there would be an overall saving to the Exchequer by introducing a comprehensive scheme and we would be delivering a much better scheme to the elderly?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of those carers work 24 hours a day 365 days a year?  In reply to an earlier question the Minister asked the Deputies to have patience in regard to this matter, but would he not agree that the 56,000 carers who have not qualified for the carer's allowance have considerable patience?  Could the guideline in relation to the carer's allowance be based on the carer's income rather than that of the household?  Sometimes people cannot qualify for the carer's allowance because their husband or another member of the household is in receipt of income.  How many of the 60,000 carers in the country are in receipt of the full time carer's allowance of £59.20?</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister give a commitment to deal with the assessment by considering the income of full-time housewives who are carers as being half that of their husbands? By not considering their income many full-time carers who are doing great work and providing the State with a free service will not qualify for the allowance. It is farcical to talk of a carer's allowance without considering the conditions necessary to qualify for such an allowance.</P>

In rural areas families may care for an elderly relative who lives nearby and such carers are placed under enormous financial burden as they are not entitled to <Col N="952" /> any assistance.  I have a letter from the Department of Health in my area.  It outlines the case of an elderly person in need of care, the availability of home help but the elderly person's desire is to be cared for by his relatives who are not entitled to any assistance.</P>

      <P>People expected that the introduction of the carer's allowance would provide some benefit for the carers.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the scheme was disappointing and because of the means testing requirement many carers will not qualify for the allowance. I received a letter recently from a person who came home from England to look after her elderly mother.  She was disappointed at the attitude here towards assistance for carer's allowance.  If a person sacrifices a position in England and comes back to Ireland to care for a relative and is not in receipt of any income, what criteria are applied in respect of the means test of that carer?  The Minister sympathetically referred to the day care facilities in Donegal.  A day care centre in west Limerick has applied for financial assistance and will the Minister be sensitive to applications for assistance from day care centres from any part of the country?</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that many voluntary grants have been given to various day care centres which strictly come under the responsibility of the local health boards, but due to the shortage of funds we have supported those centres when funds were available.  The introduction of the respite care approach will be an important development for many of the carers referred to by the Deputies. There is no easy solution to this matter; it requires resources.  We have provided a basic scheme and have extended eligibility to include those in receipt of an income on a par with the long term unemployment rate.  Steps beyond that will have to be considered but as Deputies know every Minister is bound within the budgetary context in making any commitments.</P>

      <P>The social welfare amnesty which I announced in June was designed to add impetus to the ongoing successful drive by my Department against fraud and abuse of the system.  It offered people who were defrauding the social welfare system a final opportunity to come clean and pay up what is due to the taxpaying public.</P>
      <P>The amnesty against prosecution applied to employers, the self-employed and social welfare recipients who co-operated with my Department and put their affairs in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to supply final figures in respect of social welfare recipients who applied for the amnesty. However, up to mid-September some 475 <Col N="954" /> people had made inquiries to my Department about the amnesty.  A further 174 people under investigation by my Department when the amnesty was announced were given the opportunity of availing of it.</P>
    <P>In excess of 200 people claiming social welfare payments have applied for the benefits of the amnesty and these cases are now being processed.  Exact savings figures are not available in respect of these cases.</P>
    <P>The collection of PRSI arrears and the imposition of penalties in respect of those arrears is primarily a matter for the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The tax amnesty which includes an amnesty from penalties on arrears of PRSI for employers and the self-employed, provides for the payment of all arrears of tax and PRSI due by 14 January 1994.</P>
    <P>The majority of employers and self-employed wishing to avail of the amnesty in respect of their outstanding PRSI liability have to contact their local tax office to have their applications considered.  My Department does not have statistics on people claiming the tax amnesty in respect of outstanding PRSI liabilities.</P>
    <P>The social welfare amnesty is part of a package of control measures introduced by me over the last few years.  I am satisfied that the amnesty has contributed to the on-going efforts by my Department to stamp out social welfare fraud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax amnesty includes an amnesty from penalties on arrears etc, for employers and that is going on until 14 January.  The £200 million target will be exceeded.  One of the difficulties is that this is part of a management approach.  We are aiming for increased compliance from employers and to that end we have increased investigations of employers.  That programme began in the latter part of 1991.  The £200 million relates to that period.  Compliance has improved beyond our anticipation and returns are higher than expected.  That is the management position and I am concerned with managing a system which delivers the goods.  We deliver the service and manage it effectively to keep taxpayers' costs down and to ensure that those who should contribute are contributing. We are doing very effective work on compliance.  There were a large number of cases which would have come before the courts and now many of my officers who have been involved in court cases have been freed to increase compliance levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to pull the wool over our eyes. I draw the Minister's attention again to his statement in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> where he claims a huge success for this amnesty and that the target level of £200 million in unpaid PRSI payments will be reached.  The Minister said in the House that he is not in a position to tell us how much in PRSI payments will be brought in as a result of the amnesty.  In the 1991 amnesty 464 employers sought information on the scheme but only 17 subsequently paid, according to the report <Col N="956" /> of the Comptroller and Auditor General for that year.  Is the Minister now claiming the payments made under the 1991 amnesty for PRSI under this current amnesty?  It appears from his reply and from the press reports that he is claiming that the £200 million will actually be for the last three years up to the end of 1993. In June the Minister claimed £200 million as a result of the current amnesty, not as a result of the last one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme I set up has run through from that time.  The difficulty is that the income on PRSI comes into the Revenue Commissioners who allocate on a percentage basis an amount of money to us.  The percentage figure is worked out by the Revenue Commissioners, so it is not that simple.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we get the money. I only want the money and the compliance. The Deputy is looking for something else.  I want to ease the burden on the PRSI payer and the taxpayer and I have been doing that.  When the Deputy sees the outturn at the end of this year he will see what I am talking about.  We will have achieved not only the targets about which we spoke but we will have exceeded them and that is what matters at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>We are back again into the old problem of fraud, abuse, unwarranted claiming and compliance.  We may have cases of fraud and abuse and the Auditor General may accept that there are 200 cases in court and point to that as being the fraud statistic.  Of course it is, but we would be wasting our time if that was all we dealt with.  This work relates to all the people who come in who would never get to court, so that we increase compliance resulting in a better income, a smaller burden for workers and a fairer system as a whole.  One aspect of this is that PRSI comes into the Revenue Commissioners and they allocate a proportion of it to us afterwards.</P>

When will he be in a position to give a detailed report to this House on the outcome of the amnesty for 1993, not for 1991, with the facts and figures for the number of inquiries received, the number of self-employed and employers who have made inquiries and paid their PRSI and the number of recipients who have offered to pay back overpayments they have received?</P>

      <P>We will have the figures at the end of the year but I can tell the Deputy now that they are running ahead of target, which is my main interest.  We will also be in a position to provide certain information on certain categories but the bulk of the savings is not readily identifiable in terms of individual categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there has been an increased level of compliance across the population. The point I am trying to make is that there will be no detailed information but we will have the money.  The object <Col N="958" /> of the exercise was to ensure an increased level of compliance and in turn that the income to the Social Insurance Fund and the Exchequer would be increased.  This is made up of a number of elements of which the amnesty is one.  For instance, if an amnesty is announced, people may decide to put their affairs in order &mdash; we may not have them listed &mdash; or to put their affairs in regard to PRSI in order with the Revenue Commissioners.  This is a complex matter but the Revenue Commissioners calculate the amount that should be paid to us.  At that stage they would be included in the system and would make payments to us from then on.  That is of importance to the worker who pays PRSI given that others would be carrying their fair share of the burden. I can assure the Deputy that the amnesty has been of help in improving the position this year.  In addition, some of my staff who were becoming totally embroiled in the courts have been released to carry out other tasks to ensure an increased level of compliance.  Consequently, we will see improvements in the delivery of funds and the removal of unwarranted claims by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>On the question of funding, I have no doubt that the Minister will achieve what he says he will achieve.  In regard to the amnesty when the Minister was speaking about the figures I was reminded of the advertisement for crunchy nut cornflakes in which one of the characters says &ldquo;I am coming out with my hands up&rdquo;.  When the Minister mentions that there has been an increased level of compliance he is surely referring to the blitzes that are being carried out.  One such blitz was carried out in Newcastle West last week when approximately 12 social welfare inspectors moved into this small town&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason there has been an increased level of compliance is that blitzes are being carried out all over the country?  As a consequence, the Minister will raise £200 million.  If a person, for example, a small farmer, decides to put his affairs in order and enter the tax net usually the Revenue Commissioners do not go back over the figures for a number of years.  In this case, on the question of PRSI, will the Minister go back over the figures for a number of years in an effort to include people in the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, when they call inspectors and officers will be looking for moneys that are due.  As I said in reply to Deputy Keogh, one of the most important points is that when people are included in the system and begin to pay PRSI the burden on the taxpayers will be eased.  The more people who pay on a regular basis the better, given that there will be fewer demands made on everyone else.  I would prefer if people kept their affairs up-to-date and operated in the white economy rather than the black economy.  The matter can be reassessed at the end of the year to see how the position can be maintained from then on. I do not think it will be as difficult to do this as it has been during the past two and a half years.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a fine line between ensuring that companies and individuals comply with the regulations and harassing, almost out of existence, legitimate companies which are floundering in the recession?  Would the Minister ensure that a reasonable approach is adopted because in many cases the approach is extremely unreasonable?  Finally, since the amnesty has been such a success does the Minister intend to remove the 1 per cent levy?</P>

The Minister has not told us the amount of money remitted to his Department under each of the categories referred to in the question. Let me ask him some specific questions. Bearing in mind that this amnesty was introduced as a sop to the Labour Party because of the row over the tax amnesty for tax cheats, is the Minister telling us that the social welfare amnesty has now been extended beyond the end of August and, if so, to what date?  In regard to one of the categories the Minister identified when he announced the amnesty, namely, those self-employed who did not register in 1988 when they became liable for PRSI, how many have applied under the tax amnesty to be registered?

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a rent supplement may be paid to those who are unable to provide for their accommodation needs from their own resources or who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Guidelines in relation to rent and mortgage supplements indicate that a young single person seeking a rent supplement from a health board must demonstrate that he or she has a valid reason for leaving home.  Such reason could include moving to seek employment or the existence of serious problems within the family home which make it necessary for the young person to leave home.</P>
      <P>Where there are serious domestic problems the guidelines specify that independent verification should be sought by the health board from social workers or others familiar with the family situation. These requirements do not apply to older single people.</P>
      <P>In general health boards will consider a supplement where it would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to continue to live at home.</P>

      <P>The guidelines do not specify an age limit but the health boards use 25 years as a general rule of thumb. The health boards are receiving increasing numbers of applications for rent supplements from young people leaving home and this appears to be part of a general trend right across the country. It is difficult to assess such applications because of the lack of evidence in regard to reasons for leaving home, etc.</P>

Will the Minister now issue a guideline urging an abandonment of this use of the 25 year rule of thumb by the health boards? Finally, I am sure many people are aware that part of the reason for the increase in applications for rent subsidies is that in many cases people living at home get no unemployment assistance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in that we had been discussing the three amendments and the Minister indicated that he would accept two of them.  We were about to discuss amendment No. 40 which is interrelated to the two earlier amendments.  I have yet to respond to the Minister who was only starting to speak on the matter when we adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 40 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the law as developed by the courts in proceedings determined pursuant to section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957 prior to the commencement of this Act shall continue to be applied in proceedings instituted under section 18 of this Act save in so <Col N="1031" /> far as it is amended by section 4 of this Act and by this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems Deputy Shatter's amendment is inappropriate and not required.  Having regard to the provisions of section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act and section 18 of this Bill, the purport of the Deputy's amendment escapes me.  If one looks at section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act one can see it is not a section that enacts any substantive matters of law.  It is simply an enabling provision to enable disputes of a certain type involving family property to be determined by the court in a convenient and summary manner.  The substantive laws which the courts would examine when dealing with applications under section 12 are matters of general law, matters that have been laid down over the years, primarily rules of equity developed over a long period.  There is nothing whatever in section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, that affects any of those laws.  They have been developed along certain lines and in certain ways.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for a convenient method of access to the courts to deal with applications that one spouse may wish to bring affecting property and to enable such applications and such disputes to be resolved simply and quickly in the manner laid down in that section. The section contains no substantive law that in any way affects the rules of law which have developed over the years. When section 12 is repealed and reenacted in section 18 of the Bill before the House it will provide for an application to the court in a summary manner to determine questions arising between the parties.  The principles of law on which they will operate are there and section 18 does not change them any more than did section 12 of the 1957 Act.  Therefore, to insert an amendment to provide that the principles of law which developed over the years continue under section 18 of this Bill as they were under section 12 of the 1957 Act would be entirely inappropriate. The corpus of laws which evolved over the years may at some stage <Col N="1032" /> need to be amended and reviewed in a modern context.  In one minor respect that is precisely what section 20 of the Bill before the House addresses.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the corpus of laws that has developed, namely where one spouse puts up money to carry out improvements on matrimonial property, a development resulting from the W &amp; W case which has been referred to, required immediate attention and was, perhaps somewhat inappropriately, slotted into this Bill.  It does not have a direct reference to the Bill but I felt it was appropriate to include it.  I will have more to say on that matter when we come to amendment No. 38 which deals more directly with that point.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the Bill of a provision which says that &ldquo;the law as developed by the courts in proceedings determined pursuant to section 12...&rdquo; is not appropriate because that law has not been developed by section 12.  Section 12 is no more than an access mechanism to the courts to enable disputes which arise to be determined.  Therefore, the acceptance of an amendment which refers to the law as developed in applications under section 12 would be entirely inappropriate. It is clear that that amendment is not well founded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's last contribution is probably one of the most depressingly foolish contributions I have heard from him in the debate on this Bill. I do not make any bones about saying that.  I wonder what function we have in this House and, on occasion, what function Opposition Deputies have when we listen to such contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with three amendments, two of which are being accepted by the Minister.  These two amendments propose to substitute the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in section 18. As I said, the reason I put down these amendments is that under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, the courts were directed when dealing with property disputes between spouses to make such orders as they deemed proper.  I want to ensure that when the jurisdiction under <Col N="1033" /> section 18 is enacted it does not turn back the law some 30 years and create a situation where all the legal principles the courts have enunciated in cases instituted under section 12 have to be gone over yet again to determine whether they are still applicable.  I gave a relatively simple and brief explanation of my reasons for putting down these amendments and the Minister seemed to understand and accept it &mdash; he is taking two of the amendments on board.</P>
    <P>Another reason I put down the amendments is that when the 1957 Act replaced the 1882 Act &mdash; which told the courts to make such orders as they deemed fit &mdash; there was an ongoing legal discussion at the time as to whether the 1957 Act conferred a different jurisdiction to the 1882 Act.  I was anxious to ensure that that difficulty and problem did not arise again. The acceptance of two of my amendments by the Minister means that the possibility of that problem arising again has been greatly ameliorated.</P>
    <P>My third amendment, which is totally appropriate to this legislation, was designed with the same purpose in mind. Decisions were delivered by the High Court every two to three weeks from the mid-sixties up to 1989-90 and proceedings instituted under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, in more cases than one could count.  Even though they did not all produce written judgments or report judgments, a large number of them did.  The judges pored over the legal principles applicable in determining such disputes which the Minister now seems to think are irrelevant to section 12.  The Minister correctly stated that the section provided a procedural mechanism for instituting proceedings between spouses. However, decisions are delivered by the courts in cases initiated under section 12 and the law has been developed, as the amendment says, &ldquo;... by the courts in proceedings determined ...&rdquo;.  If the amendment is so irrelevant, I wonder why the Minister has included section 19 in the Bill.  The Minister seems to think that this is all very amusing.  He has included a similar provision in section 19 which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the reference in section 5 (1) of the Family Law Act, 1981, to the rules of law relating to the rights of spouses in relation to property in which either or both of them has or have a beneficial interest shall relate and be deemed always to have related only to the rules of law for the determination of disputes between spouses, or a claim by one of them, in relation to the beneficial ownership of property ...</P>
    <P>Because my first two amendments are being taken on board, my other amendment is now of somewhat lesser importance. I think the courts will assume that the law they have to administer under section 18 is the law they administered under section 12 except in so far as it is affected by section 4 and section 20, which is highly appropriate and relevant to the legal principles applicable.  The Minister seems to be partly disowning this provision and wondering why it is included in the Bill.  The provision is clearly applicable and relevant to my amendment No. 40.  I will be pressing my amendment No. 40 to a vote when we reach it because I have an interest in ensuring that husbands and wives do not unnecessarily litigate issues which do not need to be litigated.  The inclusion of the subsection (3) proposed in my amendment to section 20 would ensure that the law was clear and obvious, which would be helpful.  I am not going to extend the debate on this amendment any further.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to take on board my other two amendments.  I presume the reason he is taking them on board is because the difficulties I have just described appear to him to be a possibility. Otherwise, there would be no particular reason for agreeing to take them on board.  I will be putting my amendment No. 40 to a vote.  The Minister's comments on this amendment were somewhat disingenuous and confused.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 25, before &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;acquisition or&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 as currently drafted is designed to deal with a legal anomaly which has arisen from a number of decisions &mdash; initially a decision of the <Col N="1036" /> High Court and more recently a decision of the Supreme Court which was delivered some 12 to 18 months ago.  As the law stands, a wife who contributes financially to the purchase of property which is in her husband's sole name can acquire a beneficial interest or ownership right in the property in proportion to the contribution she has made to its acquisition. Section 20 seeks to deal with a difficulty which arose in a court case in which it was held that if a wife contributes to the improvement of property which is owned by her husband &mdash; for example, making £10,000 available for the building of an extension &mdash; and there is no borrowings on the property she may not have a beneficial interest or ownership right in that property by virtue of the fact that she has only made a contribution to improvement as opposed to a contribution to acquisition.  The same would apply if the property was a business property.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to incorporate within our law a provision which, I think from recollection, was enacted into English law in 1958 or 1968, namely, a contribution in money or money's worth to the improvement of property should be regarded as giving the contributor a proportionate beneficial interest or ownership right in that property.  My amendment is designed to ensure that there is no confusion about the law.  The Minister referred to proceedings under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, which will now be brought under section 18 of this Bill in which the law I have described is judge-made law. My amendment seeks to make it clear that the current common law as developed by the courts &mdash; the way in which one contributes financially towards the acquisition of property &mdash; will become part of statute law.  Section 20 states that where a spouse contributes in money or money's worth to the improvement of real property that contribution can give rise to the acquisition of an interest in the property.</P>
    <P>But this Bill is silent on cases where one make's a contribution to acquisition as opposed to improvement.  Because of <Col N="1037" /> the way section 18 was originally structured and because there is no reference to acquisition, I was concerned that this could be perceived as changing the law to mean that a contribution to acquisition, in the absence of your name being on the property, would not result in one having any ownership rights.  Deleting the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; and replacing it with the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; would partially resolve the problem.  If the Minister accepts amendment No. 40 it would totally resolve the problem.  In the light of the Minister not accepting amendment No. 40 there is no real argument for not putting into section 20 the position as we understand the law to be.  What we are doing now is providing for the acquisition of property or an interest in property where one contributes by way of financing an improvement.  That will be made part of statute law.  Where one makes a direct or indirect contribution to acquisition, that will be left part of common law as developed or declared by the judges, leaving a question mark over whether it continues to be part of our law because of the restrictive nature of section 20.  Section 20 could be interpreted as a restrictive provision rather than simply extending the circumstances in which contributions give rise to ownership rights.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister would accept amendment No. 38 and I urge him to do so.  In this context I want to ask the Minister also to comment on something which might more appropriately arise under amendment No. 39.  The intention of this legislation is that where a family home is in the sole name of the spouse it will be regarded as being jointly owned. Presumably, where the property and the legal title are in joint names they simply remain in joint names and the position is not affected by the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is in effect being copied from an existing English statutory provision and because English law does not have legislation which approximates to this Matrimonial Home Bill &mdash; English law does not deal with the matrimonial home specifically in this context &mdash; this section applies not just to the matrimonial <Col N="1038" /> home but to all property.  It does not just apply to making improvements in the matrimonial home; it refers to any real or personal property.  It seems to me there is a confusion in the Bill, and I will come back to this when we deal with amendment No. 39.  The tenor of this Bill throughout &mdash; if one confines section 20 to dealing with the matrimonial home, although it extends to other properties &mdash; is that all matrimonial homes in effect are jointly owned, except for those in which deserted wives may be residing who were deserted before 25 June, but I do not want to complicate the argument for the moment.  We then put in a provision which says that if one contributes to the improvement of a matrimonial home or other property, one might obtain a greater interest in it.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the intention of this Bill is that regardless of the level of contribution made by a husband or wife to the acquisition of a matrimonial home, it will be jointly owned unless one falls under the bailiwick of the court application and a court deeming it unjust that one should get a greater interest. However, marrying section 20 into the earlier sections of the Bill does not work and it seems to me the Minister has a problem in this regard.  In one part of the Bill it states that regardless of who contributes what to the acquisition of a matrimonial home it is jointly owned, but then in section 20 it states that if one makes an extra contribution to improvements one will get a greater share of the matrimonial home.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled concerning acquisition or improvements is to deal with all other properties and when we come to it I am proposing amendment No. 39 to clarify what the Minister intends.  However, the Minister may want to tell us exactly how he envisages section 20 interacting with the concept of joint ownership of the matrimonial home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Matrimonial Home Bill is to allow for matrimonial homes to be in the joint names of both spouses.  Section 20 departs from that general issue in one respect and makes an amendment to the law which requires to be made following on a particular decision of the courts in a case of W v. W, 1981, <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly,</i> 202, where Mr. Justice Finlay stated the principles of law which applied in cases where an improvement in property was paid for by one spouse:</P>
      <P>Where a wife expends moneys or carries out work in the improvement of a property which has been originally acquired by, and the legal ownership in which is vested solely in her husband, she will have no claim in respect of such contributions unless she establishes by evidence that from the circumstances surrounding the making of it she was led to believe, or it was specifically agreed, that she would be recompensed for it.  Even where such a right to recompense is established either by an expressed agreement or by circumstances in which the wife making the contribution was led to such belief it is a right to recompense in moneys only and cannot and does not constitute a right to claim an equitable share in the estate of the property concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That provision is a measure which required urgent amendment and section 20 is intended to provide in effect an overrule of that decision.  In a typical case, say, where a wife contributes £5,000 or £10,000 towards carrying out a substantial improvement in a property that belongs to her husband, regardless of whether it is the matrimonial home &mdash; it excludes a matrimonial home where it is held equally but that is excluded in subsection (2) &mdash; it is not sufficient that she should be simply recompensed or entitled to a recompense ten or 20 years later of the £5,000 or £10,000.  It is fair <Col N="1040" /> and appropriate that she thereby acquires a proportionate share ownership interest in the property in which she invested the money.  There is a fair and reasonable proposition to make where the sum is substantial.  If the sum was not significant it would not arise, but where the sum invested by the spouse was substantial she should be entitled thereby to acquire a specific <i>pro rata</i> share of ownership in that particular property.</P>
    <P>This does not apply to the matrimonial home where it is owned in equal shares by both spouses.  No one is suggesting that if someone contributes £5,000 or £10,000 to put a new bathroom in an ordinary matrimonial home, that share in the matrimonial home should be put into any state of imbalance.  However, cases could arise where the matrimonial home would not be owned on an equal basis for one reason or another.  These instances may be rare, but it could occur that part of the wife's 50 per cent ownership might have been transferred back to her husband for whatever reason thereby creating an imbalance in the ownership. In that case I would want this provision to apply, that a substantial financial input in improvements would increase her proportion of the ownership position.  Apart from that limited provision, matrimonial homes are excluded from this section but it is intended to include other property in the reversal of that provision.</P>
    <P>There is a whole <i>corpus</i> of law out there dealing with circumstances in which one person puts up money towards the purchase price of a piece of property and that piece of property goes into the name of the other party.  In other words, the husband buys a piece of property, the wife puts up, say, £10,000, but the property goes into the husband's name.  There is a whole <i>corpus</i> of law out there dealing with those circumstances &mdash; the doctrine of advancement, resulting trusts, it is a whole, well developed area of law.  It may be that it requires re-examination at this point.  This Bill is not the vehicle to do that.  That law has developed, is well settled; it may need reform, it may need amendment, but this Bill is not the vehicle by which to do it.  That would <Col N="1041" /> require a major piece of conveyancing legislation which would need to be examined on a broad, comprehensive basis for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 20 is limited. Nonetheless, it is intended to effect an important improvement in the law as we now find it.  I am sure all Members would agree that where money on improvement is put up by one spouse, it is appropriate that a share should vest in proportion thereto rather than at best, as the Chief Justice said in that case, entitle her, as would be the position that would prevail in most cases, merely to recompense perhaps very many years down the road.  The position is that if money is put up for an acquisition of property purposes the resulting trust position does apply.  By and large that is the legal position.  There is no intent to interfere with that proposition in this Bill.  I do not accept that by a process of elimination that body of law is in any way affected by the limited amendment dealing with improvements posited by section 20.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter would purport to perhaps restate the law as it is by including the words &ldquo;acquisition or&rdquo;.  That would involve a major re-examination of quite a number of broad ranging, equitable principles.  As I said, it may be appropriate to have them re-examined, but there is no need to do so in this Bill.  That is not appropriate to this one, which is a Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend it is as appropriate to do so in this Bill as it is to include section 18 in this Bill.  I am in an odd position here in that I actually have to tell the Minister that not only is this a Matrimonial Home Bill but one which now sets down the procedural mechanisms for resolving all property disputes between spouses regardless of whether they relate to the matrimonial home, business properties, investment properties, bank accounts or anything else.  In deference to Deputy McManus, one might even lob in the pet dog in the circumstances.  I am not sure whether the <Col N="1042" /> pet dog would qualify as real property or personal property, probably personal property.</P>

      <P>Yes, perhaps a household chattel, which is a term I hate.  We shall have to invent a 21st century term for &ldquo;chattel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Parts I and II of this Bill deal with the matrimonial home and Part III with all property, family property, in disputes.  I can tell the Minister it is highly appropriate that he has section 20 included.  It is equally appropriate that the amendment I propose to insert the words &ldquo;acquisition or&rdquo; be accepted because it would finally provide a statutory basis for what is happening in practice anyway.  It would also ensure that no legal dispute arose in the future as to the court's powers being in any way limited under section 18 in a way in which they are not limited under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957.</P>
      <P>The Minister is relying on the advice available to him.  I am really trying to dot i's and cross t's.  I would suspect that the courts &mdash; because we have now provided for a change in the wording of section 18 &mdash; are unlikely to regard the body of law to which I have referred as no longer applicable.  I thought it made sense, that we might as well set out precisely in the Bill what is the position currently in practice and what we intend it to remain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 32 and 33 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) by the substitution of the following section for section 2:</P>
      <P>2. (1) In this Act &ldquo;family home&rdquo; means the dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside at any time after the passing of the Matrimonial Home Act, 1993, as their sole or principal residence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Select Committee I moved an amendment to make the definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo; in the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, correspond with that of &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; in the present Bill.  The amendment was designed to ensure that a family home would remain <Col N="1044" /> a family home even where the couple had gone to live elsewhere.  I withdrew the amendment with a view to re-tabling it on Report Stage in conjunction with a provision under the 1976 Act to protect the rights of spouses who were separated at the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 41 contains a revised definition of &ldquo;family home&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 44 ensures that any spouse who is separated by reason of desertion or otherwise still has available to him or her the essential protections afforded by that Act.  Once this Bill has been passed the mere fact that a married couple ordinarily resided in their home at any point in time thereafter will be sufficient to ensure that those protections can still be availed of in the case of either party to the marriage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 is a consequential drafting one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some detailed debate on this issue on Committee Stage when both the Minister and I had tabled amendments.  I think it is fair to say that the worries I had relating to rights currently vested in spouses under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, being taken away from them have now been addressed by the Minister in amendment No. 44. That is the crucial amendment in this context.  I made the case that in the context of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, as its provisions currently operate, if a wife is residing in the family home and the husband behaves in a manner which is likely to lead to a loss of the family home, such as failing to make mortgage repayments or is dealing foolishly with the family finances and creating major debts which could result in judgments being lodged against the home, the courts can make orders under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, to provide for protection for the home, perhaps orders which would force the husband to make mortgage repayments and, in particular circumstances, can transfer a home directly from a husband to a wife to ensure that it is preserved for the benefit of the wife and children of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's original amendment, as <Col N="1045" /> tabled, in relation to spouses who were separated or deserted before the coming into force of the provisions of this Bill, once enacted, would have deprived them of all of the protections that the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, extended to them up to the date of its provisions coming into force.</P>
    <P>I welcome amendment No. 44, which largely addresses the problem under the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, but &mdash; to finish on a note on which I began today &mdash; it puts the spotlight on the anomaly in that Act. I find it difficult to comprehend that the Minister accepted the difficulties in this area in relation to the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, but appears to be rejecting them in relation to this Bill and joint property interest.</P>
    <P>To take the example of the wife who was deserted, say, on 1 June 1993, if that wife's husband fails to pay mortgage repayments she will be able to go to the courts and get an order under the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, to force him to pay the mortgage repayments.  If he is behaving with the family finances in a manner that may place the house at risk she may even be able to go to court and ask the court to transfer the house to her.  But if she was deserted before 25 June 1993 and if the husband is paying the mortgage repayments and is not placing the house at risk, she will not have a joint interest in the matrimonial home.  I do not understand the logic of that.  I welcome the fact that we are dealing with the problem under the Family Home Protection Act but we are leaving a major anomaly in relation to the matrimonial home law and we are leaving thousands of wives in a position where they will not have joint ownership rights automatically conferred on them because that will only apply if they are living with their husbands on or after 25 June 1993.  It does not matter whether it is your fault or whether you were living with your husband.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;fault&rdquo; in the context of marriage breakdown.  In my experience it takes two people to break up a marriage, though that is not always the case.  There <Col N="1046" /> are instances where one spouse is the contributor to a marriage breaking down. In the majority of instances both spouses make a contribution towards a marriage breaking down.</P>
    <P>We are addressing the problem under the Family Home Protection Act and we are putting through this House legislation which creates a new problem and creates a new type of wife &mdash; a second class citizen &mdash; in the context of ownership of the family home.  We will have a situation where different wives will be treated differently instead of all wives being treated differently following the enactment of this legislation.  The Minister has recognised the problem under the Family Home Protection Act but for reasons that escape me does not recognise the new problem he is creating with his own legislation. Having said that I welcome the fact that the issue we addressed at some length on Committee Stage in relation to the Family Home Protection Act appears to be largely addressed by the Minister's amendment and this side of the House will not be opposing those amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Shatter does not appreciate the distinction between the two situations he enunciates. Perhaps in the fullness of time it will occur to him that there are basic distinctions. The thrust of the Matrimonial Home Bill has some features in common with the Family Home Protection Act but it is an advance in a different direction. It gives different protections in different kinds of situations.  The Family Home Protection Act was a very important measure but its effect was limited in a negative kind of way.  It did not actually vest any ownership interest or take a proactive position in actually changing an ownership of the matrimonial home and vest an actual property right in the wife. This is a very different proposition from saying, as the Family Home Protection Act did, that the home could not be mortgaged or sold without the written consent of the other spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a major step forward and I am sure Deputy Shatter, in the fullness of time, will come to the conclusion that <Col N="1047" /> there had to be an appropriate starting point for the transfer of that ownership interest as there could be major possible consequences if it was left open-ended through the recesses of history.  If it was left open-ended a husband and wife who were living together in a house 20 or 30 years ago would now find that one of the half share ownership vested interests in it would be affected by an Act passed in 1993.  That is not a tenable property proposition and is unlikely to be a constitutional proposition either.  It is not required and the parameters of the Bill as laid down and as it will go forward, are appropiate to the needs of the situation today and it will be well received.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the help of Deputy Shatter and other Deputies in pointing out the protection and the limited remedy so far as the Family Home Protection Act is concerned.  I am pleased he is happy that the new amendments I am bringing forward today meet the reasonable and agreed needs of the House.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I introduced an amendment to enable the court, when making such an order, to further order that the consent of that other spouse would not be necessary in the circumstances of the case.

      <P>In general I welcome the Bill.  Having listened to and participated in the debate at various levels I have seen the benefits and I have learned a great deal.  As I do not have legal qualifications I found that most of the Bill was very technical and there were many legal definitions and terms.  One of the features of the debate on this Bill both in the House and at the Select Committee on Social Affairs was the constructive manner in which it was approached by all Deputies.  A particular word of praise must go to the Minister who has shown himself to be receptive to the arguments advanced by all sides.  It is a welcome development for legislation that the Government is committed to introduce and pass in accordance with its programme during the remainder of the lifetime of this Dáil.  I hope this precedent will continue, particularly in the coming months when important Bills will be coming from the Minister's Department, notably the Family Law Bill dealing with issues of nullity and providing for spouses and children in the event of marriage breakdown.  It would be desirable if the precedent established with this Bill was to be followed in the case of the other Bills which will come before the House on this subject.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, I found much of this Bill very technical and I was at a loss in regard to terms, definitions and clarifications. The Minister extended the definition of the &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; to give ownership rights to couples who may have separated before the Bill becomes law when the Bill was introduced in June. It gives the benefit of joint ownership only if a couple were living in the home when section 4 came into operation &mdash; six months after the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Second Stage and the debate in the Special Committee the Minister was pressed to back-date that provision to a spouse who has been deserted or <Col N="1050" /> who had been forced to leave the home before the passing of the Bill.  The Minister has now amended the Bill in order to give the full benefit to a couple who have separated on or after 25 June 1993 &mdash; the date on which the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>I think Members on all sides welcome that tremendous advance.  It may not have gone as far as some Deputies had sought but one can appreciate there would have been serious difficulties in going further back.  As the Minister explained, a separated spouse may invoke the judicial separation Act, 1989, at any time to have the ownership of the matrimonial home assigned to him or her, if the circumstances of the case justify it.</P>
    <P>Another example of the Minister's flexible approach to the amendments is evident in an amendment he moved today to provide that a spouse must have obtained independent legal advice before opting out of joint ownership.  It must be said that there is a case against as well as for such a provision and one might ask why an adult should be forced to seek advice from a solicitor and pay the relevant fee, whether substantial or nominal. Perhaps at a later date the Minister will clarify whether it is proposed to introduce a nominal fee for this service, particularly as some people may be of the opinion they are well capable of making up their own mind.  I am sure many people, both men and women will feel offended at being obliged to engage a professional in that regard.  Of course, those who support the requirement of legal advice are concerned in the main for wives who are unduly influenced by or live in fear of their husbands.  As a public representative I can appreciate that point because I have often come across such cases but I wonder if this provision will really help or give the wife the necessary support to fight off someone of whom she is living in total fear. One would like to think that it will and it may have the desired effect in many cases but if someone is that intimidated I doubt if any advice, whether legal or otherwise, will have any effect.  However, <Col N="1051" /> the view of the majority is that such advice should be taken but there is no way such a provision could be designed to distinguish between those spouses who would need legal advice and those who would not.  The Minister received due congratulations for bringing this provision before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister made significant improvements on the original text by simplifying the various technical terms.  Let me assure the House that I for one benefited from that.  He has amended such terms as &ldquo;matrimonial home&rdquo; and the &ldquo;former matrimonial residence&rdquo; without any apparent adverse side effects.  There are many other improvements, mostly of a technical nature, that have resulted from the Minister's receptive attitude to the debate.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a milestone in the development of equal rights for men and women and demonstrates how such rights can be achieved with the co-operation of all parties and with the support of the Minister and his Department.  We had a great many problems and difficulties arising from marriage breakdown but this Bill brings us ahead by leaps and bounds and we are now on a par with some of our European counterparts.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill but in slightly less gushing terms than the previous speaker.  A good principle is being established, but the Bill is short on imagination and long on caution.  It shows up the slowness of the legislative process to respond to changes in modern life, in family structures, in the way people live and the way property is owned.  Now that we are nearing completion of this Bill questions need to be raised.  The easy part has been dealt with but the difficult parts remain to be dealt with in the future.  First, if a spouse has a right to property that he or she has not bought for himself or herself, surely people who cohabit as a couple and have a commitment to the relationship &mdash; where, for example, the woman stays at home and looks after the children and gives up the <Col N="1052" /> ability to earn an independent income &mdash; have certain rights to security.  What about the grown up son or daughter who stays at home to look after elderly parents who may then end up in old age having committed his or her life to the role of caring and given up the right to an independent income?  Surely their rights have to be considered.  If the principle has been acceded to in this regard it has to be acceded to other people as otherwise it would be unfair.</P>
      <P>It also raises the question of property. The question of community property was raised in the Second Commission on the Status of Women report which recommended the concept of community property in marriage and not only of the matrimonial home or the chattels.  I had tabled an amendment in this regard but unfortunately I was called away when my amendment on chattels was called.  I would hate to finish the debate without making the point because it is important and relates to the disjunction between the legislation and the way life is being lived.  When one considers that household chattels for the purpose of this Bill include linen, china, earthenware, glass, books, ornaments, consumable stores, garden effects and domestic animals, my modest little amendment which asked that an important item of the household chattels, the car, should be included in that list &mdash; I do not have to state the reasons why a car is so vital for modern domestic life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of chattels is in the Bill and as I read it a spouse will now have the right when the Bill is enacted to half the budgerigar, half the cat, half the dog or, indeed, half the garden hose or half a tin of baked beans, if consumable stores mean what I take them to mean.</P>

      <P>This Bill is poor consolation for a spouse who owns half the matrimonial home but does not have the means to get from that home to the shops, particularly if she lives in a rural area, to buy a tin of beans.  I acknowledge that I am raising a matter which I should have raised earlier but, unfortunately, I was called away.  In general, this legislation does not relate to the way life is lived today and does not reflect the importance of material goods for people to survive, to meet the educational requirements of their children or to have an independence which gives equal status to women. Finally, research has shown that the likelihood of a child having learning disabilities can be determined by whether the householders own a car or a telephone. The value of a car in enabling a spouse to have access to educational or shopping facilities is important, but this Bill does not recognise that.  The Bill limits equal status to the chattels, which include the domestic pet.  This indicates a weakness in the legislation.  It illustrates that we are looking backwards, that we are always a few steps behind.  We were promised progress and the previous speaker believes we have made great progress.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> As a member of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, participating in that type of exercise for the first time was somewhat similar to being on the outside of a goldfish bowl looking in.  The debate was confined to members who are expert in the law.  However, it was an interesting experience to observe the passage of the Bill through Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is not in the area of law, but in my previous capacity as a community worker and current capacity as Member of this House I am familiar with the question of access to the legislation we are about to pass.  It is appropriate that law should be amended and <Col N="1055" /> brought up to date, but will the legislation be accessible to those who need it?  I acknowledge that the Minister is preparing proposals which will improve access to legal aid services and allow people to access this legislation.  I trust that the co-operation which members of other parties have shown during this debate will be forthcoming when the Minister requests the necessary finance from this House to allow people recourse to the law under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This legislation is an important step in bringing our laws into line with reality. Deputy McManus's point about whether we are behind or in front of reality is a separate argument.  Opinions differ as to whether law should lead change or cope with it as it happens.  This legislation is a reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>Frank Litton's book, <i>Unequal Achievement</i> makes a worthwhile point in relation to the changes since the fifties. The project of economic and social development initiated by the Government at that time resulted in a much more complex society in terms of its economic, gender and social structures and this Bill is a genuine attempt to bring our laws into line with that complex reality.  Some people are against such progress and when we come to deal with the substantive issue of divorce I am sure we will hear their voices raised in a much more controversial manner.  While it is necessary to deal with the matter of divorce through legislation, this Bill stands on its own merits.  I welcome the fact that it will update the law in regard to equality and the Minister and the officials of his Department, which was set up at the beginning of this year, are to be complimented on the way they have speedily brought this legislation before the House. It was introduced in June and will pass through this House today.</P>
    <P>As a newcomer to this type of procedure, I was impressed by the contributions from all sides.  I pay tribute to all Deputies who contributed on Committee Stage.  As a non-expert it was difficult to make a contribution, but, as a <Col N="1056" /> member of the Select Committee on Social Affairs I am glad that many Deputies contributed and that flexibility was shown on all sides.  That demonstrates that with a reasonable approach better laws can be enacted.  I will support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as amended.  Substantial amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister was flexible in answering many of the points raised and as a result we have a better Bill than introduced initially.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals mainly with the rights of spouses, but there is a danger that women might consider it will provide protection for them, as is the case in respect of the Family Home Protection Act.  This Bill will not provide them with any great protection and this should be drawn to the attention of dependent spouses of both sexes who should be advised to become actively involved in the legal status of all their property, including their home.  It would be better for the owners to have the property jointly registered in their names regardless of the provisions of the Bill.  The intestacy provision in the Bill is welcome.  In a nonconflicting relationship where a spouse dies intestate the Bill provides that the surviving spouse will automatically inherit the estate and that is a significant improvement.  However, people should be aware of the legal position surrounding the ownership of property and dependent spouses should not depend on this legislation to protect them.  A word of caution should be sounded on the passage of this Bill that where there is a conflict the provisions of the Bill will be superseded by those of the family law separation legislation.  People will need to be actively involved in the proper resolution of personal disputes and not depend on the absolute protection of the Bill.  In the past spouses who believed they enjoyed such protection later found that was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister, <Col N="1057" /> and Opposition Deputies, who worked on this legislation even when the House was in recess.  They used the legislative process to the full in Select Committee. The Bill does not address all the problems identified, particularly by the Opposition. I accompanied the Minister on a recent visit to a constituency and we found the need for this legislation.  There is a need for it in all constituencies, irrespective of people's background or social standing.  There are social concerns particularly in regard to women's rights.</P>
      <P>Many women, separated from or deserted by husbands now living outside the jurisdiction, felt insecure in the family home.  Some were making extraordinary claims on the spouse in the family home who was looking after the children, trying to maintain the home and meet the mortgage repayments.  Demands were made on those women to sell the family home to meet the other spouse's claim to half the value of the property.  Those women were getting advice on the judicial separation Act and trying to work within the Family Home Protection Act, and this Bill addresses some of the problems identified. It provides that a spouse who had no ownership rights in the past will now have joint ownership rights in regard to the property.  That is progress.  The Bill will also address some of the problems dealt with in the past in social legislation. Items of property and chattels were used as a diversionary tactic by those with vested interests and this moved the debate away from the real contest.</P>
      <P>Women in particular will benefit from this Bill.  I know of cases where people are trying to reach a settlement and chattels are the important issue.  The Bill will address that issue.  I welcome the co-operation of the Minister and the contributions of Opposition Deputies who have such expertise in this area.  The House benefited from that expertise and the legislation is all the better for it.  I welcome the Bill which was promised in the Programme for Government.  Hopefully, following the enactment of this legislation we will be able to address many of the problems we face in our constituencies.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Ferris in welcoming the Bill.  I have worked to ensure that women's rights in Ireland are recognised.  I am hopeful this Bill will pave the way for a more equitable society.  This Bill is particularly important in a country where 70 per cent of women work full time in the home, where access to paid employment outside the home creates great difficulties for women and where there are so many barriers to women getting paid employment. I appreciate the flexibility the Minister displayed on Committee Stage in accepting amendments which make this a more comprehensive Bill.</P>
      <P>I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter in relation to the two categories of women to which he referred and I am concerned about how that will play out legally for some women.  I am sure many women will be disappointed that their problems are not dealt with in the Bill.  I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Shatter for the hard work he put into the Bill on Committee Stage.  Many of the amendments he tabled were accepted and improved the Bill.  The real test will be when women seek to avail of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that women have access to information about its provisions. Good quality legal information should be made available to women and there are many ways this can be done. A booklet should be prepared by the Minister's Department following the passage of the Bill and financial help should be given to organisations such as AIM, the group advocating family law reform, to help it make such information available.  While this is a technical and complex Bill it is extremely important that its main provisions should be explained to Irish women as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we have reached the stage where this Bill has been passed by this House.  We have contributed substantially to the Bill which will leave the House a better Bill than when it was introduced.  That is what the legislative process is all about.  I regret <Col N="1059" /> that some of our amendments were not accepted.  I hope the Minister will reconsider them when the Bill is going through the Seanad and, perhaps, redress some of the difficulties that exist under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is of importance in particular to wives.  It will benefit wives more often than it will benefit husbands.  I regret we have created two different categories of wives in the context of the Bill.  A previous speaker referred to the Bill as being a milestone of equal rights for men and women.  Unfortunately, under this Bill, because of the Minister's refusal to accept one of the earlier amendments, some women will be more equal than others and that is a wrong way to go about our business.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an improvement on the legal position that pertained and is one women will welcome.  I hope the Minister between now and the Seanad debate will seriously reconsider the problem I outlined which can be properly and adequately addressed.  We should ensure that all women are treated equally and not leave some women more equal than others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies on all sides who made such a major contribution to this Bill, which, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, is a milestone in progress on the Irish scene.  This Bill was an exercise of legislation here at its best.  It was recognised that this was a major technical Bill, as witnessed by the fact that it has been on the stocks for many years.  Many Deputies had not realised how complex it was until it was circulated.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that it is a better Bill leaving the House and that is the way it should be.  Deputies who have a particular expertise should give their best and those who do not have a professional expertise also have a major role to play and many played that role at the various Stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the officials of my Department who worked long and hard at the preparatory stage for me and other Deputies who came for briefings to the special committee. <Col N="1060" /> The special committee is an important new device and many Deputies considered it very helpful.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that it was not possible for me to accept all the amendments put forward but I tried to be as objective and constructive as possible.  In some instances to some extent the amendments I accepted were against my better judgment.  I allowed myself to be influenced by the arguments put forward.  It was unfortunate that some amendments were not debated.  I know that Deputy McManus was very concerned about second homes and motor cars, perhaps not in classical Democratic Left style.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Deputy was not in the House when her amendment came up so that we did not have the opportunity to debate the question of the motor car.</P>
      <P>This Bill in its thinking puts us to the forefront in western democracies.  Some countries in Scandinavia have a universal community of property regime which is an advance of this &mdash; and something to be aimed at, as recommended in the second commission report &mdash; but, so far as matrimonial homes go, we are to the forefront and we can congratulate ourselves on that in a moderate fashion.  In the UK, for example, a law reform commission report going back to 1970 recommended the introduction of a law putting matrimonial homes into automatic joint ownership of both spouses, but that proposal has not seen the light of day there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has often been referred to as being a run-up to the issue of divorce.  I would make it quite clear to the House that this measure stands on its own independently of the issue of divorce. Whether or not the people decide to vote for divorce in 1994 is separate and distinct from this important Bill.  Both spouses are entitled to this measure.  I know from communications received by me that women and women's groups in particular <Col N="1061" /> have warmly welcomed it and I appreciate the generous comments on the Bill made by Deputies from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the question of access to necessary advice in connection with the Bill is important and steps are being taken by the Department in that regard. The structure of the Bill is such that it makes any procedures needed to be invoked in connection with the Bill as simple and as cheap as possible.  For example, the vesting of the joint interest in both spouses is an automatic measure, and even without the benefiting spouse taking any specific overt action there is a vesting of the beneficial interest in that benefiting spouse.  That is not to say that the spouses should not take steps to get themselves registered and we have devised the simplest and cheapest possible procedure to enable them to do that. I strongly recommend that all spouses should take that step when the Bill is passed.  We have provided that in the Land Registry stamp duty will not be involved in registering title.  That is a major step forward.  Only simple documentation will be required for it and likewise in the Registry of Deeds there is a simplified cheap procedure involving no stamp duty.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody concerned with the Bill and will consider outstanding matters in the context of the Seanad.  As has been said, this is a good Bill and we can look forward to further measures in this House on family law issues which I trust will be addressed in an equally constructive manner.</P>

Heroin and other drugs are being sold openly on city streets in my constituency.  The main drug is heroin and the problem is now worse than in the early eighties.  It is far more widespread and more people are involved.  The tragedy is that the number of new addicts, young people, attending the local counselling and drug treatment centre set up recently on the north side of the city is rising.  That centre has been swamped by new applicants and a waiting list has been set up for those seeking help. The staff simply cannot cope with the numbers seeking their help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another new manifestation of the problem to which I would like to refer briefly is the nightmarish and appalling attacks carried out by those who use blood-filled syringes.  This is happening <Col N="1064" /> with increasing regularity and has been reported in the evening newspapers.</P>
    <P>Another new and sinister manifestation of the spiralling drug problem in my constituency is the takeover of large properties and derelict houses by unscrupulous individuals, some of whom have criminal connections, who renovate them and move in criminal and drug elements.  These new elements are intimidating and demoralising the local community. The Garda are aware of this problem.  Indeed, I am due to meet, along with a delegation of residents, the local superintendent to address this frightening problem.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to the fact that guns are increasingly being used in my constituency.  Many of these attacks, including one murder by gunmen in recent months, are drug related.  I understand that the Minister for Justice recently visited the Seán McDermott Street area to assess the extent of the problem.  She is the only Minister for Justice that I am aware of in recent times to show an interest, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>It should be said that the local Garda are doing their best.  They have been very dedicated during the years.  However, the local drug unit in Store Street Garda station has been placed at a major disadvantage; it has been deprived of resources and manpower for years.  It has only one car available to it for operations and has virtually no surveillance equipment at its disposal.  I understand that following the Minister's visit a new task force has been set up.  This comprises ten men drawn from Store Street, Fitzgibbon Street and the Bridewell Garda stations. I hope that they will have more than one car available to them.  While I welcome this new initiative, it is not enough; it is too little too late.  I hope this new unit will receive the technological back-up it requires to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the serious problems that are being encountered in the courts.  Even when people are brought to trial the Judiciary are out of touch with this problem, which is alien to them.  Recently, to the frustration of the gardaí involved, a heroin dealer was <Col N="1065" /> released, having been convicted, without serving a prison term.  It seems that some judges have no idea of the destructive effects heroin can have on entire communities and of the serious threat the heroin problem poses to society.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that each Member of this House has some experience of this problem in that family members, relatives and neighbours have been the victims of crime.  It is also fair to say that each Member is sincere in expressing concern at the level of crime in the community.  I am chairperson of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation, which, prior to the recess and during the past few weeks, spent over 21 hours debating the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993.  It was evident that all members of the committee were sincere and open in addressing the problem. Tributes were paid to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, particularly at the conclusion of the debate, for trying to accommodate the views and opinions expressed on all sides, for accepting amendments and for indicating that she would look at the Bill again before Report and Final Stages are taken in the House.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the level of crime in the community is the source of concern.  There is a lack of respect for the elderly in our community today.  They are being terrorised and are frightened in their homes.  Indeed, they are afraid to go to the local shop because gangs of youths congregate on street corners.  It is equally true to say that there is a lack of respect for property and this is evident throughout the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make these points at the outset because it is important that people are clear that there are no winners in this debate.  It is important that we approach it in a constructive and positive manner. <Col N="1066" /> I commend Deputy Mitchell for making a personal effort to highlight the problems caused by crime, particularly in our urban centres.  I do not doubt his sincerity for one moment.  But this motion, however well intentioned, is superfluous.  As Deputy Mitchell knows full well, the Government and the Minister are not sitting still in the face of crime.  On the contrary, we have a reforming Minister who in a short period of time has accomplished much.  The Government is actively pursuing solutions to the problems which have been presented by crime.  Generating further reports and more red tape, as Deputy Mitchell suggested, is not the answer.  There is a need for concerted action and that is the path being followed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I regret to say there is a fundamental flaw in Deputy Mitchell's motion.  Throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the solution.  That approach would be far too simplistic.  A problem as complex as that of crime demands by its very nature a multifaceted approach.  In this regard I refer Deputy Mitchell to the Programme for a Partnership Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which commits the Government to a radical set of measures to combat crime and allows for the resources to back it up.  This includes tackling crime in its diverse forms, from vandalism to white collar crime.  No branch of crime will be left unattended.</P>
      <P>Crime is a particular problem in urban areas.  The Programme for Government allows for a broad-based approach to be adopted to crime prevention in urban areas.  A five year corporate strategy for the Garda will be drawn up and implemented to enhance the capacity of the Garda to fight crime in present conditions. The Garda are at the coalface in the battle against crime and the Government is committed to lending them all the support possible in this demanding task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our prison system has a central role to play in the fight against crime and must <Col N="1067" /> maintain a careful balance between redress and rehabilitation.  To this end the Government is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of prisons policy and strategy.  A document will be published in the future and will, I am sure, act as a suitable framework for prison reform.</P>
    <P>The recently launched National Development Plan will be central to the Government's approach.  As Deputy Mitchell knows, it is the largest capital investment in the history of the State.  Among the key aims of the plan is significant growth in employment and an attack on the social exclusion and marginalisation caused by long term unemployment and poverty.  Of course, the vast majority of those who are unemployed are decent law-abiding citizens.  Yet there is a wealth of evidence to indicate that unemployment, especially among the young, is a major contributing factor in crime growth.  A reversal of the unemployment trend through the National Development Plan will make a major contribution towards the control of crime.</P>
    <P>It is on this latter point that the differences between the Government's approach and that of Deputy Mitchell become clear.  Deputy Mitchell's motion addresses the symptom, but that is not sufficient; the underlying causes must also be addressed.  If we address only the symptom and ignore the underlying cause, crime will only continue to perpetuate itself.  This Government is not prepared to let that happen.  The causes must and will be tackled.  That is the only long term viable solution to the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's suggestions, while sincere, are somewhat short-sighted.  The Minister is undertaking the co-ordinated approach necessary to combat crime backed up by the overall Government commitment to tackle the underlying social problems that can lead to crime. Another strand of the Government's crime policy is a commitment in the Programme for Government to implement the recommendations of the inter-departmental group on urban crime and disorder. <Col N="1068" /> The group has prepared a detailed report, some of which is already being implemented.  This task involves a co-ordinated intervention by Government Departments and State agencies to promote employment and improved educational and environmental facilities and to provide the necessary level of social services tailored to meet the needs of each area.  This is a most welcome step and one that reflects a personal viewpoint, that is, that combating crime and its root causes is not confined to a particular Department or agency.  Rather is it a task that involves many arms of the State working co-operatively.  This is the most effective way to combat crime.</P>
    <P>The Government has initiated a comprehensive process of criminal law reform.  I would refer Deputies to the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, which contains a series of important measures designed to place greater emphasis on the victims of crime and will also make a most positive contribution towards combating crime.</P>
    <P>These pieces of legislation are but the beginning of this Government's ambitious programme of criminal law reform.  For all the reasons outlined above, I believe Deputy Mitchell's motion, while well meant, is unnecessary. However, I look forward to hearing any other suggestions he may have to make in the busy legislative terms ahead. The committee, of which we are both members, plays a very important role because there are no easy solutions to the problems that exist.  There is a commitment by the Government and by the Minister, already demonstrated, to tackling crime.  There are huge problems but with the co-operation of everybody in this House we can make inroads into the serious problems that affect communities. They are looking to this House for support and the necessary legislation and reforms and I have no doubt that these will continue to be forthcoming from this present Minister and this Government.  Deputy Mitchell's motion is well-intentioned but it is not necessary because what he is looking for is already taking place.</P>
    <Col N="1069" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Mitchell for putting down this motion following the developments over the summer months.  This discussion is timely.  There is no doubt that Ireland, like many other western countries, has experienced a steady rise in the incidence of crime in recent years.  This is an unfortunate fact of life in modern society.  Most Irish people are shocked and horrified at the violence and viciousness of some of the crimes committed today.  This is a major challenge to modern society and, indeed, to modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>During the summer I received numerous complaints from my own constituents regarding gangs gathering at corners and greens.  Ordinary residents point out that these gangs intimidate people going about their day-to-day activities.  In this regard I welcome the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. This, at last, gives appropriate powers to the Garda to deal with these situations.  I suggest that those who are now criticising the provisions of the Bill are simply not aware of the problems in urban communities where these gangs are literally terrorising old people, are being generally intimidating and show lack of respect for property, people, society in general and, indeed, the Garda.  I suggest that these powers are much needed.  I have every confidence that the Garda will use the powers wisely.  Those who are criticising the provisions of the Bill are stating that the Garda are not to be trusted.  That is not the case.  There is tremendous goodwill towards the Garda and there are very few cases of abuse of powers.  I believe the Garda will use the powers in this Bill wisely.  At the end of the day there is a serious problem and I believe that this Bill will address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue which I want to raise relates to burglar alarms.  It is now accepted that houses and premises with a burglar alarm fitted are far less likely to be burgled.  I suggest that, as an incentive, the fitting of approved properly installed alarm systems should be tax deductible regardless of all other home improvement tax allowances.  It would be a worthwhile step.  It would benefit us all <Col N="1070" /> and help the Garda in their work.  I will be taking that matter up with the Minister for Finance as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would also like to raise the question of gardaí on the beat.  There is no doubt that there is a demand from our communities for this.  I welcome the Minister's initiatives in that regard.  I know it is catered for in the Commissioner's plan. Civilianisation in the Garda and computerisation will free up the manpower to put gardaí on the beat.  That is not an old-fashioned concept.  Certainly it is the overwhelming desire of the general public to see gardaí on foot patrol in their communities because it would act as a deterrent to crime.  I urge the Minister to continue to pursue that line and I have no doubt she will be congratulated on doing so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this new scheme whereby in most neighbourhoods there is a garda who deals with community activity.  I cannot stress how important these gardaí are.  They do invaluable work with residents' associations, neighbourhood watch schemes and so on.  These gardaí can usually identify those who commit crime &mdash; there is only a small minority of people in any neighbourhood engaged in this activity &mdash; but unfortunately they experience difficulty in pressing charges.  If the small group of people who commit crime were caught and charged it would go a long way towards stamping out crime.</P>
    <P>On the question of alcohol-related offences, more needs to be done in relation to under-age drinking and particularly off licences.  The law in general should be enforced to ensure that alcohol is not sold to those under age, as is happening in our communities at present. The gardaí should carefully monitor off licences, observe the activities taking place and, if necessary, press charges. That too would go a long way towards stamping out crime.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of assisting the victim, moves have been made, including the passing of legislation, to deal with this matter.  Facilities are to be provided in courthouses for victims.  I have the highest praise for the work of the Irish <Col N="1071" /> Association for Victim Support.  This is a new initiative and at long last we are getting the balance right in terms of the victim.  I congratulate the Minister on her role in this area.  Since the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Justice has been enabled to deal with many of the real issues on the ground.  The Criminal Justice Act has been brought into force and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and the Criminal Procedure Bill are under discussion.  The Minister last night suggested she will be introducing confiscation of proceeds legislation as well as the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  These measures are very welcome.  The measures that have been taken in the last few months and those proposed will bring about an improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, which I diligently circulated to residents' associations and neighbourhood watch schemes, is the most welcome Bill to come before the Dáil in recent times.  All the other activities undertaken as part of the so-called liberal agenda made less impression than this Bill.  People want to see real action on issues that concern them.  In concluding, I call for a speedy resolution to the serious crime problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on putting down this motion.  Opinion polls show that crime is one of the main issues about which people are concerned.  A number of years ago I carried out an opinion poll in my constituency and the main concern in regard to crime was lack of parental control.  People believed that parents had no control over their children, they did not seem to care where they were or that they might be causing problems for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people will agree that in the south inner city there is a serious crime problem, much of which is drug related, although I do not believe it is as bad as that in the north inner city.  I am glad the <Col N="1072" /> Minister recognises that all is not well. Her recent visit to the north inner city was an indication that she recognises that Dublin, particularly the inner city, is experiencing serious problems.  We must find a solution to the problem of crime and I welcome the Minister's strategy as outlined in her speech.</P>
    <P>There is great frustration among the general public about our prison system. There is a perception that there is a revolving door policy in prisons, that people who are arrested, brought to court and sentenced are back out on the streets almost immediately.  I am sure the position is not as bad as media reports suggest but the gardaí are frustrated at how quickly people get out of prison.  It is very frustrating for a garda who follows up a crime and goes through the court procedure to find that the person is released a couple of months after being sentenced. I am glad the Minister is considering the policing policy and I welcome the review in that regard.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's points about social exclusion.  In the inner city area of my constituency there is a high crime rate.  People feel marginalised and believe there is no hope for them.  There is high unemployment and social deprivation and people believe that the educational system has let them down.  Sadly, the only way many of these people can make money is through crime.  There is also a serious drug problem in the area. I welcome the measures in the plan announced on Monday to tackle the problem of social exclusion and the fact that extra resources will be made available to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the points made by the Minister in regard to key policing priorities, including emphasis on the service ethic, underlining the key role for gardaí on the beat, computerisation and assessment of resources implications.  These are all very important points.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I should like to see more gardaí on the beat.  The longer training period for gardaí will ensure that we have better trained personnel who will be more adept at solving crime.  The training period for gardaí was too short <Col N="1073" /> some years ago and was not as good as it should have been.  I welcome the increase in the number of clerical staff working in the Garda Síochána.  While the number of gardaí is much the same today as it was in 1983, the number of clerical staff has increased by approximately 600-700 during that period.  Because gardaí do not have to deal with this huge amount of paperwork &mdash; they complained bitterly about this some years ago &mdash; more gardaí are on the beat.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is committed to solving the crime problem. She has shown that she is not afraid to take on and deal with difficult issues. Since she came into office she has put through much legislation which had previously been thrown around like a hot potato by many of her predecessors who were afraid to tackle it.  The Minister has shown that when she makes up her mind to do something she will do it.  She has stated in public and in private that she intends to tackle the problem of crime about which so many people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the balance will be tilted towards the victims of crime.  The perception at present is that criminals are not properly punished for their crimes while victims receive very little help in recovering from violent crimes in particular.  Under the Criminal Evidence Act appeals can be made against lenient sentences and victims can claim for compensation.  The regulations recently signed by the Minister will allow witnesses to give evidence through a live television link.  Well known criminals in my constituency &mdash; the Minister knows who they are &mdash; have intimidated people in the worst kind of way.  In some cases people have had to move out of their homes as a result of intimidation by organised criminals.  I am glad that the victims of such intimidation will now be able to give evidence by way of a live television link or audio visual system.  It is only when one meets people who have had to move out of their home because of intimidation that one realises the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister <Col N="1074" /> say that she will be introducing a Bill dealing with the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and a Criminal Procedure Bill, all of which will help solve the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on putting down this motion.  Crime is a major problem in Dublin city, as no doubt it is in many urban areas.  As I said, the Minister has spoken both publicly and privately about the ways in which she proposes to deal with this problem.  She is not afraid to introduce legislation which may be regarded as awkward by some people.  She is committed to her job and I have no doubt that she will tackle the crime problem in Dublin in a strategic way during the next few years.  It is very important that we do not over react to this problem, thus giving rise to other problems in a few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said he had nothing but the highest of praise for the Irish Association for Victim Support.  While I agree with his praise in the sense that he meant it, unfortunately I think that is all the Government has for that association.  If one looks at the experience of the victims of crime one will see that they are being treated in an appalling manner.  I know one man who was badly assaulted, who had hospital expenses of £10,000 and who applied to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal for compensation.  After a very long delay his case was heard and the tribunal decided it would award him £10,000 in compensation.  I should say that this man has very limited means.  He got a letter telling him that he would get £10,000 but that there were no funds to pay him at present and that he could expect to wait, I think, 30 months before he received the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government talks about fiscal rectitude and responsibility, but it is borrowing the compensation of the victims of crime and applying it to current expenditure; it acknowledges that it owes these people the money but it borrows it for two and a half years.  We should not forget that this is money which has <Col N="1075" /> already been laid out.  We are not talking about personal injury damages for pain and suffering; we are talking about outlay.  The Minister should make provision to pay these people in the next departmental Estimates.  It is nonsense to say that the Government is dealing fairly with the victims when it transpires that it is borrowing their out of pocket expenses for two and a half years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be sorry to hear that there are no legal expenses involved.  I am referring to a case involving a man who had to pay £10,000 in hospital costs and who suffered a loss of earnings.  Some people may think he had a very menial job in the public service.  It is a scandal that a person in his circumstances should be treated in this way.  However, that is the reality for the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>I take very seriously Deputy Ryan's suggestion that we cannot approach crime in a tabloid manner.  All our proposals have to be fairly measured and thought out.  Much nonsense is spoken about restricting the right to bail.  If this was to have any serious impact on crime it would mean putting more people who have not been convicted into our already overcrowded prisons and releasing more prematurely more prisoners who have been convicted.  If that is justice I do not know what the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; means. We cannot afford at present to introduce a scheme in our society which results in more people being kept on remand pending trial and more people serving less of the prison sentences imposed on them.  The answer to this problem is to make bailsmen liable to forfeit their bail money when people on bail abuse that bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan queried whether the media perception of a revolving door prison system was exaggerated.  This perception is not exaggerated.  Bearing in mind the number of sentences imposed, we have an inadequate number of prison <Col N="1076" /> places.  The public demand is for stiffer and more sentences, but this demand is not capable of being met within the present system.  The Government claims to have this issue under review.  We have to realise that it is normally young men who commit crimes.  Having regard to demographic and criminological trends, there is no reason to think that the situation will improve in the near future. The Minister would be well advised to think of building another prison now. Even though it may seem surplus to requirements, one of our inadequate jails could be closed in the long term if there was a decrease in the level of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Deputies in particular have spoken about the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and the Criminal Procedure Bill.  I have expressed my views on those measures on other occasions and I do not intend to repeat them now.  However, both of those Bills are severely flawed and many changes must be carried out before they are introduced.  Otherwise, they will simply add to the problems of our legal system and our prison system rather than procure a solution.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made in the past number of days, particularly by Deputy Mitchell, the proposer of this motion, of parental responsibility for offences committed by young people.  Most people do not seem to be aware that under the Children Act, 1908, parents are liable to be fined where it transpires that the crime was committed due to their default or neglect.  I heard Deputy Mitchell on the radio today suggesting that somehow parents could be subjected to curfew if their children misbehaved.  The ingenuity of this proposal exceeded its practicality. I cannot imagine how anybody could seriously enforce such a curfew.  Will parents be arrested because they have nipped down to the pub when an order has been made confining them to their homes after hours?</P>

      <P>One would need to have a sense of humour in this House for what is beginning to sound like the &ldquo;Roland Rat Hour&rdquo; on television.  If we are serious about crime we must produce reasonably well thought out proposals. There is no point producing tabloid proposals or posturing as being concerned about the crime wave which is taking place if we are not willing to put&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Mitchell would be a little less defensive he would see that I am not accusing him of doing this.  The Government must produce serious proposals.  There is no point in the Government's posturing as concerned on the issue.  They must produce the means whereby we will deal with problems such as the crisis in the prison population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Mitchell's initiative in putting this measure before the House. I welcome his ingenuity and his imagination in producing his ten point plan but I suggest that in all of these matters this House should look to this Government, which claims that it will be adventurous and effective in dealing with crime, to deal with the problems which we can identify.  The first thing the Minister should do is address the problem of the victims who are at present left without compensation for 30 months.  She has the means to do this.  Second, she must examine the bail issue in terms which do not involve putting more people into prison prematurely and letting more people out.  Third, if the prison crisis <Col N="1079" /> requires the building of a new prison, she should face up to that quickly and put it in place because that problem will not go away.  Fourth, in relation to many criminal procedures &mdash; perhaps Deputy Mitchell will agree with me on this &mdash; much time wasting takes place in the courts and many procedures are deliberately abused by people who are trying to avoid justice.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example which she might consider at some stage in the criminal procedure legislation. That is the problem of depositions.  At the moment any person can insist that all the evidence that will be put against him in a case is recited openly in a District Court and in large cases which might involve 50 to 80 witnesses the accused person has of right the entitlement to insist that every one of those witnesses is produced before the District Court and run through the hoops before him, though he has a limited right of cross examination under recent case law.  One might think that is Victorian in concept, which it is, but it is abused by the big drug barons and crime bosses whom Deputy Ryan mentioned.  They abuse that system to make sure that they cannot be returned for trial for three and six months on occasion.  I would ask the Minister to address that problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Finally, having provoked Deputy Mitchell to great passion, I want to reiterate my best wishes to him and my warm feeling of congratulation for having raised the issue of crime in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In all these matters we must keep a balance between important civil liberties for the ordinary citizen and protecting people from crime.  In the final analysis we cannot afford to put in place laws which actually worsen the problem.  It is that which concerns me most about the Criminal Procedure Bill and the anti-boisterous provisions in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.  If <Col N="1080" /> we create more and more occasions on which criminality will be detected and prosecuted and where young people will come into conflict with the police, there is then a danger of creating a worse rather than a better climate as time goes by.  I yield to Deputy Mitchell now to allow him to reply to me.</P>

      <P>I join in Deputy McDowell's gracious compliments to Deputy Mitchell on putting down this motion.  We all believe that crime is a growing problem in Dublin, in Galway and every part of the country.  For the Minister to amend Deputy Mitchell's motion to say that we should praise the efforts of the Government and the Minister in this matter is to treat the problem too lightly.  It is an effort to sweep the problem under the carpet.  We should all realise that we have a problem and work collectively to endeavour to solve it. Obviously the Government amendment to the motion will be carried in the vote to be held later this evening.  But if this debate has highlighted the fact that we have a growing problem, if the Minister accepts that fact, then this debate will have been worthwhile.</P>
      <P>I have two to three points to add to the debate thus far.  It is very demoralising for the Garda authorities that known criminals can be out on the streets again, sometimes within days of having received a prison sentence.  There is a cure for this. I say to the Minister: do not fill up our prisons with non-criminal offenders.  For example, it should not be necessary to imprison somebody for the non-payment of a fine; there must be a better way of coping with such offenders.  I am sure the Minister could ascertain that better way within the resources available to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another startling statistic in this matter is that 31 per cent of places in our detention centres and prisons are occupied by <Col N="1081" /> juveniles, costing this State a staggering £26 million annually.  I contend we could get much greater value for money.  For example, were the Government to channel some of that money into the provision of amenities for young people in our towns and cities it would be much more beneficial generally.  In this regard enormous work is being done even in my city of Galway where voluntary groups and individuals are making a great effort. I might give the House one example to illustrate this point.  The Minister and I are aware of the involvement of Chick Gillen who coaches approximately 60 young people from the travelling and settled communities in boxing skills two or three nights a week in Galway. Through his own initiative he refurbished an old hall in Bohermore, yet for his efforts in the course of the year he received the princely sum of £1,000 from national lottery funds.  I contend that if more of the £26 million to which I referred was spent on that type of work there would be less need for our young people to fill 31 per cent of places in detention centres.  I say to the Minister that resources should be put into the provision of amenities for our youth, such as sporting facilities, football pitches and so on, which would pay enormous dividends in the long term.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Michael McDowell said &mdash; I support Deputy Gay Mitchell in his motion &mdash; I do believe that parents have a grave responsibility in the matter of knowing what their children are doing, knowing where they are, knowing who they are with at all times.  I contend that greater acceptance by parents of responsibility for their children and their activities would greatly reduce the crime rate and the genuine growing fears held within our communities that law and order is breaking down.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody might think this problem is confined to towns and cities only, I should say it is not; it is a problem now being experienced in rural areas also.  I will give an example of something I came across in the course of the last general election campaign.  I was canvassing in a rural area when I came across an old <Col N="1082" /> woman, the door of whose house had been padlocked on the outside by a neighbour who fulfilled that task for her each evening.</P>

      <P>That door was padlocked at the woman's request because of her fear of being broken into at night, she being apprehensive that a bolt on the door would not be sufficient to keep people out.  I should remind the House that that fear exists as much in rural areas as it does in our towns and cities.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister and the Government not to pretend that this problem does not exist &mdash; as the Government amendment to Deputy Gay Mitchell's motion would appear to suggest &mdash; but rather let us all sit down and work together to ascertain whether collectively we can solve this very serious problem in our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to support the ten point plan put forward by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell. I would urge the Minister to consider it very carefully.  I agree with the points Deputy Mitchell has raised.  It is essential that they be taken on board if we are to tackle the crime problem obtaining in this country.</P>
      <P>This issue is of serious concern to all sections of our community.  Within my constituency of Dublin South-East the overall issue of crime is raised continuously with me, by traders in the area, by the elderly who are frightened within their own homes, by women, indeed by all citizens.  The Minister knows this very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past week, while speaking <Col N="1083" /> to some business people in Dublin South-East, two doors away from where I met the owner of a shop the bank had been robbed on the previous Friday when two men entered with a shotgun and a handgun.  The house across the road from that shop has been burgled.  Despite there being an alarm system the burglars had entered by the back door and left by the front door taking goods with them.  The owner of the shop to whom I was talking had himself been assaulted, knocked to the ground by an intruder in his shop. This had happened on more than one occasion.  Yesterday within the constituency ten men were arrested following a £10,000 raid on a building society and were released from Garda custody after being apprehended by the new quick response Garda Unit who had chased them and arrested them in a nearby flats complex.</P>
    <P>My constituents today have raised with me the anger they feel in that these people are now back on the streets.  A survey, the results of which are still being processed by Fine Gael in Dublin South East, has highlighted the range of ways in which people are affected by crime in the constituency.  People feel vulnerable in their properties, in their homes, in their cars.  I was struck very much by this in the course of the general election campaign last year.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on a number of areas not discussed so far in the course of this debate this evening or last evening.  I want to speak about juvenile delinquency particularly.  However, before doing so I should like to welcome the Minister's review of the prison system, essential at this point.  It is extraordinary &mdash; I think the Minister did say last evening &mdash; that this had been the first review undertaken by a Minister for Justice of the prison system.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that it is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that in one vital area &mdash; how we deal with children who break the law here &mdash; in the nineties we have the same legislation we had almost one hundred years ago.  It is outrageous and makes nonsense of our claim to cherish <Col N="1084" /> all of our children equally.  Indeed it underlines the fact that we have put on the back burner the overall issue of children in trouble.  We have postponed it, ignored it, glossed over it; we have failed the children involved.  The point that must be made is that we have failed the sectors of society affected by those children and, as I have already said, they are many.</P>
    <P>Our response to the overall problem of juvenile crime is totally inadequate and unco-ordinated.  We need to increase the age of criminal responsibility, we need further policy development within the Department of Justice and, above all, a coherent approach, particularly to the problem of truancy not mentioned in the course of the debate so far. Criminals do not begin suddenly at age 25; to do not suddenly enter into a career of crime at that age.  We need to look at their origins and ascertain how we can intervene in the system that takes them on this road to delinquency.  There is no doubt that truancy is the high road to delinquency. The growing number of teenagers who contemptuously mock the law is frightening. It is also known that a minority only of young offenders go on to make crime their career.  Cautions and non-custodial punishments could deter most of them from going professional.  It is not only impractical to threaten them indiscriminately with instant imprisonment, it is also counter-productive.  We know that most teenage offenders need to be steered away from their self-destructive peers rather than locked up and labelled as crime college graduates.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that we do not need a certain number of places of detention within which the programmes are appropriate, where persistent young offenders know that they will be dealt with seriously.  However, I must make the point that we realy need to focus on prevention in this area.  These young people place incredible demands on our schools system; there is no doubt about that.  Equally, the schools system is the radar that can identify these young people, a very accurate radar, as we have <Col N="1085" /> seen increasingly from studies conducted in the United States, For example, the high scope programme there has identified young people most at risk of delinquent behaviour and has identified them very early on.  In the United States they have shown, by introducing appropriate early programmes of identifying high risk children, that one can intervene in their lives, when there will be less delinquent behaviour at age 19.</P>
    <P>I hope very much that the education convention this week and next week will not just discuss the management within our schools but will seriously examine the programmes and strategies we need within the education system to hold on to our most disadvantaged and at risk young people.  I am not missing the point that we need places of detention for the persistent offenders but equally we need to track the other young people at risk. There is a conspiracy of silence about dealing with juvenile crime at Government level and it has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell about parental responsibility.  He went through the ten points in great detail last night and the specific recommendations in relation to parental responsibility in particular cases.  Clearly we have to highlight further the need for supervision of very young children. Parents must know where their children are, teach them right and wrong and discuss the consequences of their risk taking behaviour.  It is in the nature of young people, particularly teenagers, to take risks.  We must have an open approach to this and parents must be helped and encouraged to discuss the consequences with their young people.  The criminal system and the courts must spell out very clearly their response.  There is no doubt that many of our young people are not clear on the judicial consequences of their risk-taking behaviour and have lost respect for the law.  There is a job to be done in spelling out clearly to young people the judicial consequences.</P>
    <P>One cannot avoid speaking about unemployment and its consequences in society and the powerlessness which many families feel.  As Deputy Mitchell stressed, many of the parents of these <Col N="1086" /> young people feel powerless because of unemployment and the housing situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention violent videos. Recently, a statistic showed that 25 per cent of young people who committed very serious crime &mdash; murder &mdash; had been watching violent videos the week before. This is a critical issue and one we have to address in this House again.  The whole question of the action which the State can take to prevent the spread of some of these violent, degrading and dangerous videos must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a related area where Government policy is seriously lacking and must be co-ordinated and further developed.  Recently I asked a parliamentary question on homelessness in Dublin.  I was appalled to learn that in a very short period between January and June 1993 we had 39 children in bed and breakfast accommodation.  This is not the way to deal with these young people.</P>
    <P>Victim support, which Deputy McDowell also mentioned, is obviously receiving more attention and the whole victim movement must be further highlighted. Very often crime victims are the forgotten persons of the criminal justice system, valued only for their capacity to report crimes and to appear in court as witnesses.</P>
    <P>There are many forgotten victims of significant crime such as burglary, robbery and sexual assault.  I have seen many young people working in a child and family centre who have been present when burglaries were taking place and who have been very traumatised by it. We need to ask which counselling techniques are most effective for victims. How do victims cope effectively in the aftermath of crime?  Are victim compensation programmes assisting the victims with the greatest needs quickly enough?  Do victims want the opportunity to submit victim impact statements?  Do the elderly and child victims have special needs that are not being addressed?  The Minister has gone some way towards addressing some of these questions but we have a long way to go before our thinking is victim centred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time <Col N="1087" /> with Deputy Martin.  I thank the Minister for the innovations she has introduced under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, some of which Deputy McDowell decried.  For those who live in cities and towns and see the violence which takes place after discos &mdash; racketeering, breaking of windows etc. &mdash; it is a disturbing scene.  It has to be corrected somewhere along the line.  I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell that the main responsibility lies not with Dáil Éireann or the Minister for Justice but with the parents.  If responsibility does not start at home there is no point in legislating for it.  The basis has to be built up in the home and no legislation can substitute for it.  I am not sure that I agree with the curfew on parents as suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  Every second pub and every third disco throughout the country would have to be closed.  The drink driving laws which will take effect from October will probably resolve the greater part of the problem.  The problem starts in the home.  The parents should be in court with the juvenile who has committed the crime so that they are aware of what is happening.  They can report to the court in a couple of months' time and say: &ldquo;We have no control, we have no responsibility, we have no chance any more&rdquo;.  That is the essential area that must be taken care of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two areas that could relieve the court system at present.  First, civil cases should not be heard in the criminal courts.  The suffering of the victim is far greater than is indicated by court orders. Some justices are imposing ridiculous fines.  Recently, a lady in my constituency was fined £300 for not having a television licence.  She has an income of £63 per week and has a drink problem and was fined £300.  In the end it did not matter because the television company had taken back the television set; she had not even paid for it.  Where is the point in fining somebody in her circumstances or making an order to put her in jail?  Sometimes a man is put off the road for being over the limit &mdash; I emphasise that &mdash; rather than for drunken driving.  Automatically he loses his job, his insurance premium is increased the next time he <Col N="1088" /> seeks to have it renewed but he has no ability to pay the fine because he has lost his job.  The disqualification for 12 months or &mdash; as the new law will require &mdash; two years is severe enough but if he is fined £300 it must come out of his social welfare payments in that period.  Many of the non-criminal offences or social offences could be dealt with through community work.  The irregularities and inconsistencies in fines by different District Courts are absolutely ridiculous and have given a bad reputation to the law and the courts.  A person who pays tax every week, pays their PRSI, attends work may be treated much more severely than somebody who is in court for a serious criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Recently somebody who was 13 years unemployed was given a two-month sentence for possession of £4,000 worth of drugs hidden under dirty napkins in their premises, while in the same court a man who was charged with being over the limit by 26 milligrams was put off the road for 12 months and fined £400.  There is no comparison between the two sentences and people are outraged by that, particularly the families who are put in danger by those selling drugs.  More severe penalties should be imposed on those who assault the gardaí.  This is necessary to restore respect for the Garda Síochána and the courts.  Too many of the Garda Síochána are being severely beaten by criminals and that is not recognised in the penalty imposed by the court. If the garda retaliated, even in his own defence, he might be charged.</P>
    <P>For that reason justice is not seen to be done.  Deputy McDowell raised the question of victim support.  I am totally in favour of victim support but I am not sure how criminal compensation works. However, if it is funded only by the taxpayers, it is an offence that the taxpayer, who is usually the victim, has to pay for the crime again.</P>
    <P>Our courts are clogged up with prosecutions for non-criminal offences such as illegal parking, drunk driving and so on, offences that should be dealt with under a system of social courts.  The criminal courts should be used for those who need to be removed from society.</P>
    <P>I am deeply worried that people in <Col N="1089" /> rural Ireland who feel they need to defend themselves in their homes will fall victim of the criminal justice system. People are afraid and they feel they need to protect themselves and their families. More than ever people are prepared to use weapons when attacked in their own homes because they are genuinely afraid of being beaten up.  Two old people who live near me were recently tied up for six hours by criminals from Tallaght, County Dublin.  Such people would not find the house if they did not know the area but it is well known that the house was pinpointed by a certain nomadic group in the area.  The occupants were beaten and tied up for six hours for the sake of £400. The shock to those people resulted in them going senile.  I am sure that when this case goes to court somebody will plead on behalf of the perpetrators on the basis of their social deprivation. People will take the law into their own hands to defend their homes.  I promise that will happen more often unless we make crime less attractive in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity that this Bill affords me to make an important point about alcohol and drug abuse and the need for intervention at an early age to prevent such abuse. Generally when people talk about drug abuse they think in terms of the policing and apprehending of the drug dealers. However, if we are to have long-term results we need a preventive education programme at all primary and second level schools.  It disturbs me that there is no adequate provision proposed in the Green Paper for such a programme and there is no indication that there will be a major allocation of resources in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest problem facing young people today is substance abuse, both alcohol and drugs.  Indeed, those in prison will confirm that many of the younger criminals have behavioural problems arising from substance abuse and addiction.  It is critically important that we have programmes on the curriculum at primary and second level to give people the necessary self-esteem and confidence to combat the peer pressure <Col N="1090" /> they face.  That would help to prevent them becoming involved in crime later.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental team should consider this issue because education is also very important in the prison system. A good deal of work can be done to educate people about drug and alcohol abuse and, indeed, that has commenced in a number of our prisons.</P>
    <P>I wish to sound a note of caution on the question of parental responsibility. Members suggested that we should hold parents responsible for the conduct of their juveniles.  Those Members must be removed from reality because in many respects the parents need help.  That has been my experience in dealing with young people who have had problems with the police.  Generally they have been marginalised from an early age.  I sound that note of caution so that we do not do anything to exacerbate the situation.</P>

      <P>It is certainly something I would not do if I was trying to build up a reputation in the Law Library. I would ensure I had knowledge of the subject before I spoke.</P>
      <P>First, I will dispose of some of the points the Minister made.  The Minister said the motion gave the impression that most people lived in a state of siege.  In the motion I set out to relieve the siege but Deputy Haughey's suggestion that the purchase of burglar alarms should be tax deductible, such is the demand, makes my point.  He knows that in many communities people are under siege.  It is wrong, therefore, for the Minister to suggest that the message which the motion signals is misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said she is engaged in a comprehensive review of prison policy. The Whitaker report, one of the best reports on prison reform ever produced, was published in 1985.  What further review do we need?  It is time to act <Col N="1091" /> on prison reform instead of turning out recidivists on to our streets.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to comment on the available statistical evidence.  The available statistical data is erroneous and the Minister quoted it to support her case that things are hunky-dory.  The Minister stated that the crime figures are down. Perhaps the incidence of crime is down where the Minister lives &mdash; I doubt very much if that is the case &mdash; but if the Minister read the <i>Irish Independent</i> of last weekend she would see that the crime statistics are up.  Furthermore, a very substantial number, 22 per cent, do not bother to report what would be considered a serious crime.  The Garda crime statistics only record reported crime. That is the problem.  We should measure the problem and then from time to time measure our success or failure in dealing with the various aspects of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the present strength of the Garda is 11,373.  There are not 11,373 gardaí as the Minister included in brackets the 513 student gardaí who are not gardaí.  At one time they were, and they were paid properly but now they are paid a nominal amount and are in training.  Whoever included that figure must not have realised that the Opposition at least know what a garda is. The Garda force is almost 500 below its authorised level.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>In line with previous policy 1,000 gardaí are being recruited in the period 1992-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, before the debate commenced, I received a telephone call from the parent of a Garda applicant who was due to start his training on 15 November but has now been told that training will not commence until February 1994.  Did the Minister think we would not check this out?  I checked the matter with Garda headquarters and was told that the intake arranged for 15 November has been deferred until February.  The impression <Col N="1092" /> was given by the Minister last night that recruitment was proceeding.  How does that tie in with the so-called commitment in the Programme for Government? Members may well check their notes but that is the situation and I checked it out with Garda headquarters yesterday.  That is far from telescoping recruitment over four years into three years.  It is time we put all the facts before the House and stopped bringing in here half-baked scripts which do not give the true picture.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she is confident the Europol drugs unit will prove extremely effective, but I am not.  This country is awash with drugs, people are selling drugs openly on the streets.  On 17 February 1993 the Minister stated in reply to a parliamentary question in this House that she was informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest any significant increase in the supply of heroin to this country. Who is advising the Minister?  The Garda report published two weeks ago states that we have the highest increase in heroin on our streets since 1986, and that was the 1992 report.  The Minister should get her facts correct and supply accurate information to Parliament.  We may have to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine this matter.  A drugs enforcement agency is necessary and the Minister is quoted as saying that outside this House, but it is peculiar she has not put it on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she will establish an independent judicial commission to examine and make recommendations in respect of the court services.  That is unnecessary because judges do not have skills in that area; they are the wrong people for the job.  If the Minister wishes to do something along those lines she should consider the recent report &mdash; a report which for once makes sense &mdash; published by the Incorporated Law Society and my good friends at the Bar Council.  They must have received external advice in regard to that report, which sets out details on reforming the courts and outlines how such reform could be financed.  We should not set up any more judicial commissions.  Such commissions should deal with matters of law, not matters <Col N="1093" /> of administration, as the Judiciary are not equipped to carry out such work.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for his words of congratulations, which were much appreciated, but I did not suggest throwing money at the problem.  I identified fines, their effective collection, the need to get value for money by carrying out an audit of the law enforcement system through the Comptroller and Auditor General and the making of contributions to court reform costs by commercial companies using the courts for arbitration and sources for funding a reform of the courts system.  Those who talk about more prisons are the people who want to throw money at the problem and produce more recidivists on our streets.  I hope Deputy Wallace notes that point.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the contribution of my good friend and esteemed colleague, Deputy McDowell.</P>

      <P>I was struck by the cordial note of the contributions from most Fianna Fáil Deputies, who had the decency to acknowledge the worth of the motion, and I appreciate that.  However, not one Labour Party Member contributed to the debate, which is an appalling indictment of the second party in Government.  No Member of that party saw fit to come in here and contribute to this important debate.  What happened to Deputy Costello, the great spokesman for the prisoners?  Have the Members of the Labour Party completely lost their conscience when they could not find time to come into the House to contribute to this important debate?</P>
      <P>Members of the Progressive Democrat Party were not much better.  Not only did they not attend the debate, but the learned advocate, Deputy McDowell, came in and contributed a short few words in which he said a lot of nonsense. I would have expected that somebody of Deputy McDowell's experience in the courts would have done some research for a debate such as this and made a worthwhile contribution.  He made it clear that he did not even hear what I said last night.</P>

      <P>He asked how we could ensure that a curfew system would work in regard to parents.  I will tell the Deputy how it would work.  At present the courts regularly impose curfews on juveniles.  They inform the juvenile that they are imposing a curfew on them as part of their bail bond and that the juvenile will be required to be at home as stipulated by the probation and welfare officer.  If the probation and welfare officer permits, the juvenile may go to a disco occasionally, but if the probation and welfare officer does not allow the juvenile to go out his or her decision stands.</P>
      <P>A total of 31 per cent of people in prison or places of detention are juveniles, a figure of 695, at a cost to the State of £26 million a year.  One in six of those juveniles is under 14 years of age. Is it too much to expect that when the courts order children to be at home and off the streets their parents might be there to look after them?  Is it too much to expect that the courts in exceptional circumstances would have a right to tell parents that their place is not in the pub but at home taking care of their children? Why should the courts not have that right?  Deputy McDowell talked about people's civil liberties being interfered with if this was allowed, but I believe it would be used only in exceptional circumstances, as is the case at present for juveniles.  What about the civil liberties of old people who are incarcerated in their own homes?</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister for Justice told the House that the Fine Gael motion seeking the implementation of a comprehensive and co-ordinated plan of action to deal with the current crime, vandalism and law and order problem facing the country was unnecessary.  This afternoon a statement was issued by the Government stating that they are preparing a five year plan to tackle the crime problem of this country. What happened between last night and today to make the Government issue <Col N="1096" /> such a statement?  The officials of the Department of Justice do not appear to be aware that this statement was issued and, therefore, I will read it.</P>
      <P>The statement issued by the Government Information Services stated that the Taoiseach told today's Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting that crime in the view of many members of the public, was even more important than unemployment. Is the Taoiseach scare-mongering? Did the position change between last night and today?  We raised this motion and people reacted and said we were right.  How does the Minister square this development with the announcements she made last night that people who express public concern about crime and causing despair?  This is a serious contradiction which shows that the Department of Justice is badly led. The Minister did not prepare adequately for the debate last night and has not prepared adequately for the fight back against crime.  She is relying on handlers and public relations when what is needed is a comprehensive plan.</P>
      <P>There is an appalling lack of co-ordination when the Taoiseach says that he, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance are together preparing a plan and last night the Minister talked of the great plan they had and that there was no need for a new plan.  I have put forward a plan.  It may have its imperfections, but it is the only plan that has been put before this House for some time.  The crime problem is too serious to be dealt with by way of a piecemeal approach.  I appeal to the Minister to publish a plan to which we can work, review and measure its success or otherwise.  If the crime problem is not tackled soon, law and order will be a thing of the past.  I hope the House will support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is accepted at European level that Ireland falls far behind when it comes to research.  For that reason it is unacceptable that our meagre resources should be further diminished by the sale of necessary land in which agricultural scientists can carry out experiments.</P>
      <P>As far as the proposed sale of land at Oakpark Research Centre is concerned, the land proposed for sale is absolutely necessary for the work that goes on in Oakpark.  There is a belief, because Oakpark Estate is quite big, that there is plenty of land available.  The Minister will have to accept that 50 per cent of Oakpark Estate comprises of woodland and lake.  This certainly reduces the arable land available, but the woodland and lake area is a marvellous amenity to have so close to Carlow town.  For that reason I am astonished that serious negotiations going on between the management of Oakpark and the Office of Public Works have been shamefully ignored.  The plan was to convert the lake and woodlands into one of our planned natural reserves for use by the local community and for national and international scientific studies.  The news of yesterday that under the Structural Funds the development of national parks and nature reserves is allocated £10.6 million surely means that the plan is much more feasible now.</P>
      <P>There was a major fear in Carlow that this area could be sold off into private hands to solve the financial crisis.  The people of Carlow would never accept this.  It is unbelievable that the Teasgasc management should jump the gun in the middle of these negotiations.  It is extremely unwise to take any precipitate action while this plan of opening a nature reserve is being discussed with the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister put a halt to the sale of the 77 acres needed for research and follow through with his colleagues in the Office of Public Works the plan to take over the woodlands and the lake district? In doing that the Minister will save the land that is needed, help the financial situation in Oakpark and, above all, will be providing a marvellous facility for the people not alone of Carlow but of <Col N="1100" /> Ireland, who will visit these nature reserves as part of their planned holidays.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not let anybody destroy the facilities at Oakpark.  Once the land is sold it is gone forever.  We should make up our minds about research and agriculture.  We need diversification now more than ever in an era when normal agricultural products are forming mountains in some cases or are tied up in quotas in others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this important matter.  Deputy Pattison and Senator Townsend have also made strong representations to me in this regard.  Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, has responsibility for the Oakpark centre.  In recent years Teagasc has experienced some financial difficulties and in order to help remedy this situation and to provide for the efficient and effective operation of the body, an efficiency plan was prepared by Teagasc in consultation with the Department.  That plan which is now in the course of implementation contained a number of elements, including the utilisation of Teagasc resources, human and physical, in the most cost effective manner.  In addition, some disposal of assets is essential in order to provide the resources for necessary capital expenditure required by Teagasc to fulfil its mandate.</P>
      <P>Such action has already been undertaken in a number of Teagasc centres throughout the country.  It was decided by Teagasc that some land at Oakpark should be sold because of the capital requirements I have mentioned.  Initially the Teagasc proposal was to sell approximately 150 acres.  This included the adjoining lake and the woods immediately surrounding it.  Following consultations between Teagasc staff and the OPW on possible acquisition by the OPW of the woodlands and lake area, it was decided to exclude these areas.  Instead, 77 acres of agricultural land have now been offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice for Ministers to get involved in the day-to-day activities of Teagasc.  Under the Agricultural <Col N="1101" /> (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc may dispose of assets subject to sanction of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In practice this sanction is given if the Minister is satisfied that the best possible price is being obtained for the asset being disposed of.  I am happy to assure Deputies that if and when an application is received from Teagasc my Department will assess the full implications of the sale of this asset prior to recommending whether or not sanction should be given.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has confirmed that if this sale takes place, it will not lead to a downgrading of Oakpark in any way.  In fact, Oakpark has been identified under the efficiency plan as one of six centres to be developed as lead centres for the entire State.  The centre will, therefore, get preference from the point of view of investment and it will continue to be the lead centre for the Teagasc corps research programme.  In order to fulfil the role of lead centre a capital injection is necessary.  It is in this context that the disposal of any Teagasc assets, including some land at Oakpark, must be viewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my concern to the Minister tonight at the recent incident at the National Museum. Rain came through the roof on Tuesday, 5 October, during a storm and serious damage was caused to a portion of the valuable collection of books and manuscripts at the museum.  It is extraordinary that such an event should occur at the National Museum.  I ask the Minister to explain the reason his Department has not taken steps to ensure that the collections are housed properly and protected from damage.  I also ask the Minister to outline the extent of the damage and to indicate if it can be repaired.  Have any of the works been damaged beyond repair and is it the intention to carry out restoration work immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the National Museum has been neglected during the years.  A discussion on this matter has already taken place in the Dáil.  I am <Col N="1102" /> aware of the Minister's intentions in relation to our national institutions and I welcome the fact that he intends to make money available to ensure that the National Museum is able to put on display in a proper fashion its many collections, in particular the folklore collections which have not been put on display.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the collections that are on display are at risk.  Is the Minister satisfied that no further damage will occur and that repairs are being carried out?  Furthermore, what action does he intend to take to ensure that the collections are not damaged?  Many collections are not on display.  The National Museum needs to take action as a matter of urgency to address the question of the exhibition and storage of collections and to draw up development plans to enable it to play an appropriate role in the cultural life of the country.  I ask the Minister to ensure that these collections are protected in the future and to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buioch don Teachta as uct an abhar seo a thógaint suas mar tá tábhacht ag baint leis.</P>
      <P>There was a spillage in the National Museum, as the Deputy said, on Tuesday, 5 October last.  The spillage affected some books in the library part of the arts and industries collection.  The material in question consisted of copies of arts journals but all the material affected was rescued.  I am informed that no damage to the paper in the journals was caused although some may have to be rebound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that an extensive programme of roof replacement is being carried out at the museum. I understand that the main reason for the spillage was a combination of temporary plastic roof covering and a blocked drain pipe.  The incident did not result in serious damage and it is not indicative in any way of neglect of the museum.  In fact, the spillage was the admittedly unfortunate and perhaps avoidable result of the extensive roof repairs being carried out.  I am informed by the director of the museum that the repairs are due to be <Col N="1103" /> completed in November and that such an incident is unlikely to recur.</P>
    <P>The work being carried out on the museum represents our commitment to the continued prosperity of this institution and follows on extensive work on the heating system of the museum in recent months.  This commitment not only to this institution but to our cultural heritage in general has been reflected in the inclusion of a significant investment of £139 million for cultural tourism purposes in the National Development Plan published earlier this week.  The Government proposes, through the plan, to continue its programme of measures to assist specific projects with tourism generative potential, including major museums, regional centres for local arts and culture and historic sites.  I am delighted that this recommends itself to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It is a cause of deep satisfaction to me that in securing these substantial funds I have succeeded in moving the cultural sector from the periphery of the economic landscape to centre stage as an instrument of economic and social policy but progress must be made on a number of fronts.  It is not enough to provide funding if there are not in place the most efficient structures to administer them. To this end I am in the process of preparing proposals to establish an independent board to oversee the National Museum.  I believe that a board with autonomous structures is necessary if it is to deal with the challenges facing a modern cultural institution.  It is my intention that the future development needs of the National Museum will be generously addressed within this framework.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ambulance Service Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this matter.  The strike by 75 ambulance workers in the Eastern Health Board who are based at James's Street and Loughlinstown began on 27 September last and is now in its third week.  It is potentially one of the nastiest and most dangerous industrial disputes for a very long time. The failure to date by the Departments <Col N="1104" /> of Health and Finance and by the Eastern Health Board to negotiate a settlement to this dispute is putting the lives and health of the public at serious risk.</P>
      <P>Straight away, I want to pay tribute to the striking ambulance staff who, despite the length of the dispute have continued to provide, free of charge, an emergency service to the health board.  Every hour of every day since the strike began, ambulance crews have worked without pay to keep an emergency service operating.  It seems, however, that this responsible attitude by the ambulance crews has not been reciprocated by the EHB management. Instead they have engaged in the lowest form of strike-breaking by engaging a private ambulance firm and employing non-union labour, in their attempt to either break or prolong the dispute.</P>
      <P>I understand that this dispute is over a pay claim.  It is not my intention to comment on the claim.  That is a matter for negotiation between management and union.  The problem, however, is that there is no negotiation.  Since this strike began on 27 September there has been no meeting between the health board and the union and, so far as I am aware, no attempt by either the Department of Health or the Labour Relations Commission to bring the parties together.  This is highly irresponsible for an emergency, life and death service, such as our public ambulances.</P>
      <P>We can be thankful that to date there has been no loss of life as a result of this continuing dispute.  But how much longer can the patchwork involving the Army, a private ambulance firm and taxis continue to provide a service whose inherent weaknesses will not be exposed?</P>
      <P>The emergency services are operating with untrained crews, and with crews which are not able to cope with, for example, a cardiac emergency.  How long will it be before a member of the public suffers a heart attack, or is involved in an accident and dies because there is not an adequate ambulance service in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that to date neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Labour has intervened in this dispute or caused the Labour Relations <Col N="1105" /> Commission to bring the parties together. It may be that the Government has decided to leave the ambulance drivers out on strike as part of some greater bargaining strategy in advance of the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> talks.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, then they are literally playing with the lives of the public and I call on them now to intervene in this dispute to ask the Labour Relations Commission to bring the sides together and to negotiate a settlement before a disaster occurs.</P>
    <P>The need for intervention is underlined by the possible escalation of this dispute since the union involved in the dispute is in the process of balloting all of its health board members so that the dispute which is now confined to the ambulances may indeed be extended to involve all of the Eastern Health Board services in the Dublin area.  I would ask the Minister for Health to intervene as a matter of urgency to bring about an end to the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by thanking Deputy Gilmore for affording me the opportunity of addressing what is an important issue. The background to this dispute is the date of payment of an increase to ambulance drivers and attendants.  The issue is not the payment of the increase but SIPTU's demand that the increase be backdated to the middle of 1989.</P>
      <P>The increase falls to be dealt with under Clause 3 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Eastern Health Board is prevented by this clause from agreeing to any backdating beyond last January as that clause clearly states that increases of this nature cannot be implemented earlier than January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court, which has involved itself in the dispute, has indicated that the question of implementation should be addressed within a Clause 3 framework and has also indicated that it will make itself available at short notice to give any assistance as may be deemed necessary should the parties require assistance to reach agreement within these parameters.  The management side accept that position and are willing and <Col N="1106" /> ready to co-operate with such an initiative. However, the matter now rests with the union side who must give an indication as to whether it is prepared to work within this framework to search for a solution to the dispute.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned at SIPTU's decision to seek to escalate this dispute through the involvement of its non-nursing members employed in the Eastern Health Board Dublin hospitals.  This is particularly so given the prominent role played by SIPTU in framing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.</P>
    <P>Both sides to this dispute are party to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  Given this position and the failure by the ambulance staff to work through the accepted industrial relations machinery, it is a matter of some surprise that SIPTU could contemplate widening the dispute.  The effect of this would inevitably bear on the sick, the elderly and other vulnerable groups in the community.</P>
    <P>Finally, while it is a matter of regret that the routine patient transport element of the service cannot be provided at present, I take this opportunity to reassure the House and to reassure the public that all urgent and emergency calls are being responded to as normal.  The Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that the dispute is having no adverse effect on the time taken to answer emergency calls, and that normal reaction times are being achieved for such emergencies.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will be possible in the near future to bring the parties together through the good offices of the Labour Court and that a solution will be found within the parameters available under Clause 3 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The extension of Scoil Uí Mhuirí has been long awaited. At present the school has 372 pupils, that number having increased from 170 in ten years.  The building unit in the Department <Col N="1107" /> of Education originally received the application for the extension about ten years ago.  Needless to say, much water has passed under the bridge since then and, unfortunately, the expenditure on the provision of prefabricated equipment has increased greatly, particularly in the last three years.  I understand a total of six prefabricated buildings have been provided on the school site since 1990 leaving a grant total of 15 prefabricated school classrooms in Scoil Uí Mhuirí. That illustrates the urgency of getting this building project under way in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The school is an excellent one by any standards.  Its record of academic achievement stands comparison with any secondary school around the country.  I know the principal, Paul Nolan, and his excellent teaching staff are very proud of the achievements of the school and are anxious to improve the facilities for the pupils there.  On the basis of the figures I have just quoted the parents in the school's catchment area are conscious and appreciative of what the school is doing for their area.  I would be delighted if the Minister for Education could tell me tonight that she will be in a position to provide finance for the building project in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the matter raised by the Deputy regarding Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer, County Louth.  I am well aware of the accommodation problems affecting the school and the application for an extension it has with my Department.  I would like to give some brief background information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer is the sole provider of post primary education in the <Col N="1108" /> catchment area.  It had an enrolment of 358 pupils &mdash; 184 boys and 174 girls &mdash; in the last school year 1992-93.  The accommodation at the school consists of some traditional permanent structures and a number of prefabricated rooms.</P>
    <P>A project to provide an additional 845 sq. metres of new accommodation, at an estimated cost of £600,000, was approved in the mid-eighties.  However, having regard to the long term, an in-depth evaluation of the project was undertaken in May 1990 and a modified phased development was agreed with County Louth Vocational Education Committee. Phase I of this development is estimated to cost £380,000 and will provide the following additional accommodation: science laboratory and preparation area; metalwork room and store; GP/dining/ social area, including kitchenette; staff toilets.</P>
    <P>The planning process is now complete and the project is ready for the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the huge demands on my Department's post primary capital in the current year, it was, unfortunately, not possible to include the Dunleer vocational school project in the building programme for 1993.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance regarding the 1994 budget.  Until I know what capital will be available in 1994 for the post primary building programme I am not in a position to say when tenders will be invited for the project.  As I have said I am fully aware of the situation at the school and I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to include this project in the 1994 programme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 October 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling our high level of unemployment is the most important task facing this country.  I look to our economic policies, in particular our continued commitment to low inflation, improvements in our international competitiveness <Col N="966" /> and public finances plus the higher growth that will flow from the investment programme set out in the national plan, as our primary weapons in the fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>I attended the whole of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors conference and listened carefully to the contributions and participated in the debate.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Deputies' attention to the section in the National Development Plan dealing with area based local development on page 23.</P>
    <P>The plan introduces a radical new local dimension to enterprise and employment creation.  It is aimed at encouraging and supporting local communities to participate in tackling unemployment and to pursue local development.</P>
    <P>Programme expenditure under this heading will be £1,263 million over the period.  The programme will have four elements.  Additional funding under Community initiatives should strengthen local development efforts.</P>
    <P>The area-based local development programme is targeted at disadvantaged areas through integrated socio-economic development in areas characterised by high concentrations of long-term unemployment, economic marginalisation, social exclusion and environmental deprivation; partnership companies in specific areas where unemployment is acute; funding for the costs of these companies, an initial contact programme, enterprise development, community development, and education, training and special initiatives to counter social exclusion; county enterprise boards to act as a catalyst for local enterprise initiatives, to provide financial support for local enterprise groups and to maximise the efforts of State agencies.</P>
    <P>Thus we have adopted a strong approach to providing support measures.  In addition in the programme outlined in the national plan, the Department of Social Welfare has initiated a number of schemes targeted at unemployed people. Deputies will already be familiar with a number of the schemes which have been put in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> On the education and training front, the vocational training opportunities scheme, the third level education allowance, the second level and part-time education initiatives provide second chance education opportunities for over 3,600 people this year.</P>
    <P>Recent back-to-work initiatives include the part-time job incentive scheme, the voluntary work option, and the back-to-work allowance.  This back-to-work allowance allows unemployed people to retain their entitlement to a weekly social welfare payment while exploring the potential for employment or self-employment opportunities in indigenous industries or the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The PRSI exemption scheme provides an incentive to employers to take on new staff and has been extended to April 1994.</P>
    <P>Currently the Department is preparing a pilot school-leavers scheme which will give unemployed school-leavers the option to take up job opportunities in the community and voluntary sector allied with further education and training.  This follows the successful students summer jobs scheme.</P>
    <P>Currently my Department is establishing a jobs facilitation service in each of my Department's main offices which will help unemployed people to make the most of the options outlined above.</P>
    <P>I welcome the submission by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors as an important contribution to the debate. I can assure Deputies that I will be studying the proposal in detail in the context of the continued development of the various initiatives we are currently operating. The proposal is detailed and ambitious. It raises important questions, for example in relation to the cost and the possibility of displacing or undercutting existing jobs, which need to be very carefully considered.  As the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday in reply to a question from Deputy Rabbitte, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors are represented at the National Economic and <Col N="968" /> Social Forum and I understand that the proposal will be raised and considered there in the context of the forum's review of issues surrounding unemployment. The views of the forum on the proposal will clearly be of major relevance for Government policy on unemployment as a whole and for my Department's policy in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these conditions is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
      <P>The yearly average condition has caused some difficulties for people with gaps in their insurance but in recent years I have taken measures to alleviate some of the anomalies caused by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 I introduced special partial old age pensions for people who became <Col N="969" /> compulsorily insured for pension in 1974 but failed to qualify because of gaps in their insurance record caused by the operation of the remuneration limit. Under these arrangements pensions were granted for averages of between 5 and 20.</P>
    <P>In 1991 <i>pro rata</i> pensions for people with &ldquo;mixed insurance&rdquo; records were introduced, the rate of pension payable being in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age/retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Social Welfare Act made provision for the introduction of an alternative &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test for entitlement to the maximum rate of old age contributory and retirement pensions. This allows a person to qualify for full pension if he/she has an average of 48 since 6 April, 1979 when the present PRSI system came into operation.</P>
    <P>The matters referred to by the Deputy including the question of the qualifying ages for pensions are among the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board in the context of its final report on the future development of pensions generally.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the board's recommendations shortly and these matters will be considered further in the context of these recommendations.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if people in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the regional health boards will be allowed retain a portion of these payments on the new back to work allowance scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new back to work allowance scheme, which is a pilot scheme, is intended to provide a financial cushion to persons in receipt of unemployment payments who wish to explore the potential of employment, or self-employment and work experience in developing indigenous industries or in the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially the scheme will allow up to 3,000 long term unemployed people to <Col N="970" /> keep up to three quarters of their unemployment payments while pursuing viable employment in the indigenous industries sector or while setting up self employment ventures in areas such as horticulture, fisheries, heritage or tourism or in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this scheme will encourage growth in the industries which have been identified in the Culliton report as having potential for expansion while at the same time providing opportunities to unemployed people to explore additional employment or self employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The scheme is targeted primarily at people on the live register who have been in receipt of unemployment payments for 12 months or longer.  It does not apply to people in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.  I would however like to point out that a person receiving a rent allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme who qualifies for payment of the back to work allowance will be able to retain the rent allowance, along with other extra benefits, for the duration of the back to work payment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the draft White Paper on voluntary social services I am conscious that this will be one of the most important <Col N="971" /> developments in relation to the voluntary sector in this country for many years.  My intention is that the White Paper will set out a framework for partnership between the State and voluntary bodies and develop a cohesive strategy for supporting voluntary activity.  If the White Paper is to effectively determine the future direction of the relationship between statutory agencies for many years it is important that we get it right at the outset.  It is essential in this context that both the statutory and voluntary sectors have adequate opportunity to fully consider all the issues involved and the implications for them of any proposals which may be made.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental task force, which was set up under the chairmanship of my Department, to assist in the preparation of the White Paper has considered a number of draft proposals prepared by my Department in relation to the White Paper.  The expert group, which was established to mediate the views and concerns of that sector and to act as a resource to the task force, has also had an opportunity to consider and offer views.</P>
    <P>In the light of the views expressed, my Department is at present finalising the preparation of a draft White Paper. When the draft has been finalised it will be circulated to all Government Departments prior to submission to the Government. My intention at this point is that I will be ready to go to the Government with my proposals before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of family break-ups in Ireland over recent years.  As far as the social welfare system is concerned <Col N="972" /> there is a number of social welfare schemes specifically for dealing with the financial consequences of such break-ups for the family and, in particular, the children involved.  These include the deserted wife's allowance and the deserted wife's benefit which were introduced in the early seventies.</P>
      <P>In the 1989 Social Welfare Act, I introduced the widower's non-contributory pension and the deserted husband's allowance and in 1990 I introduced the lone parent's allowance which made provision for the various categories of lone parents, including both separated and deserted fathers.</P>
      <P>All the schemes in my Department are kept under review in the light of changing circumstances.  The introduction of divorce legislation will clearly have implications for social welfare arrangements for families who break up and I will be considering what modifications of existing schemes may be necessary in that context.</P>

      <P>Extensive modernisation of the payment systems for unemployed people is underway.  Traditionally, people had to sign at least once a week and they received their payments in cash.</P>
      <P>More modern payment methods are now being used which means that less frequent signing is becoming possible in the majority of cases.  The modern payment methods include cheques, book of payable orders, post drafts and a system based on electronic data transfer &mdash; that is, a computer file &mdash; to An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the latter system, An Post is rapidly installing a very modern system based around the social services card <Col N="973" /> which can now be used in selected offices in much the same way as bank cards.  An Post is also operating a household budget facility for the cases transferred to them electronically.  This is a major innovation and it has attracted a considerable amount of favourable comment.</P>
    <P>Difficulties were being experienced with the timely production and delivery of cheques to unemployed people each week.  Accordingly, it was decided to arrange for a proportion of them to be paid at their local post office instead.  This means that people must attend their local post office but they can do so at a time that suits them.  In addition, they will be able to avail of the household budget facility which is being extended throughout the country and which is not available to customers paid by cheque.</P>

    <P>The students summer jobs scheme has <Col N="974" /> been a major success.  Some 2,100 sponsors joined the scheme offering over 9,000 job opportunities.  The majority of these jobs were in the voluntary and community development sectors.  Almost 6,000 students were approved to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme provided financial assistance to third level students who otherwise would not have been entitled to any payment during the summer holidays.  It made additional resources available for the benefit of the local communities.  It also provided the students with an opportunity to gain valuable work experience.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been a very positive development.  It has helped students and the community generally.  It is my intention to submit proposals to Government to continue with the scheme again next year.  The many positive responses received from both sponsors and students will be taken into account when the plans for next year's scheme are being drawn up.</P>
    <P>A full evaluation of the scheme will be carried out shortly when all sponsors have submitted their claims for the recoupment of payments made to students under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Following the extension of the treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of insured persons in 1987, an additional 300,000 people became eligible to apply for dental benefit.  The vast majority of these were women working full time in the home.  A dispute arose with the Irish Dental Association following the introduction of the dependent spouses' scheme in 1987.  This has been resolved, and all dental practitioners on the Department's dental panel are offering the full range of treatments available under the dental benefit scheme to qualified dependent spouses.</P>
      <P>Some 150,000 dependent spouses have benefited from the scheme since its introduction. It is estimated that 50,000 dependent spouses will benefit annually from now on.</P>
      <P>Treatments available under the dental benefit scheme include an annual examination, scale and polish and treatment of mild gum disorders, all of which are free of charge to the patient.  Treatments such as fillings and extractions attract a modest patient charge towards their cost, with my Department paying the balance. More complicated procedures such as the treatment of severe gum disorders and root canal treatment are also covered under the scheme, with my Department making a fixed contribution towards the cost of these treatments and the patient paying the balance due to the dental practitioner. In the case of dentures my Department pays 50 per cent of a fixed fee.  All these treatments are now available to dependent spouses under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> The cost to my Department of the work done under the extension of dental benefits to the dependent spouses of insured workers since I extended the scheme in 1987 has been £8.5 million.  The cost per annum in 1993 is estimated at £2.6 million.</P>

      <Quest>if he will deal with the anomaly in our social welfare system in the area of maternity benefits, where a person applying for maternity benefit in two consecutive years will receive a lesser payment in the second year, due to the methods employed by his Department in calculating the benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>At present the weekly rate of maternity benefit is calculated at 70 per cent of the claimants' average reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant tax year, subject to a minimum payment of £65 per week and a maximum payment of £159 per week.  The relevant tax year is the last complete income tax year before beginning of the benefit.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is not treated as income for the purposes of determining average reckonable earnings.  The minimum payment of £65 ensures that recipients whose earnings in the relevant tax year are low do not have their entitlements reduced below the level of other analogous social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I am aware, however, that the method of calculating the level of maternity benefit gives rise to problems for women who have children in consecutive years in that it results in them receiving lower maternity payments than they would otherwise receive.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the maternity benefit scheme at present in the light of the operation of the scheme and of the provisions of the recent EC directive on the protection of pregnant workers.  It is my intention that any necessary changes in the scheme will be brought into effect in 1994 and the particular issue raised by the Deputies will be addressed in that context.</P>

    <P>The introduction of divorce would have implications for many of the schemes administered by my Department. This includes not only the schemes which have been introduced specifically to cater for situations of family breakdown but pensions and allowances generally. <Col N="978" /> It would also have implications for occupational pension schemes, policy in relation to which also comes within my responsibility.

      <P>The Social Employment Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, provides part-time employment for long term unemployed people in noncommercial, socially desirable projects which are sponsored by local authorities, community groups and others.  The personal rate is currently £77 per week as compared to £59.20 for a long term unemployed person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments under the scheme include special allowances for a spouse and children. The allowance for children is at the same rate and subject to the same conditions as the rate of child dependant allowance with unemployment assistance. This allowance is paid up to age 18 years where there is an underlying entitlement to short term unemployment assistance and up to age 21 for long term unemployment assistance where the child <Col N="979" /> continues in full-time education whether at second level or third level.</P>

      <P>In order to be regarded as a dependent spouse for the purposes of qualifying for dental benefit, a person must not have means above a certain limit, and must not be in receipt of any social welfare payment.  Once a spouse is in receipt of a social welfare payment other than supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance, or child benefit payments, he or she is not regarded as being dependent within the meaning of the legislative provisions on dependency. The Deputy will appreciate the difficulties inherent in legislating for a concept such as dependency, but I wish to assure him that I will keep the matter under review and consider anomalies as they arise, against the constraints of budgetary provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>We operate a number of educational schemes designed to allow unemployed people an opportunity to improve their academic qualifications and enhance their job prospects.  These schemes are: the vocational training and opportunities scheme (VTOS); second level certificate courses; the third level allowance (TLA); part-time educational initiative.</P>
      <P>Under the VTOS, people over 21 years who have been unemployed for at least 12 months or in receipt of a lone parent's payment can enrol in specially designed courses run under the auspices of the vocational education authorities.  The courses are aimed at preparing participants for the junior certificate, leaving certificate and other similar examinations.</P>
      <P>An allowance is paid which is equivalent to the lone parent's allowance or the rate of unemployment benefit/assistance payable to the client. The allowance is paid by the vocational authorities and is supported by the European Social Fund.  During the summer vacation participants resume claiming unemployment payments.  The VTOS has been very successful, the number of participants has increased each year and currently stands at almost 3,000.</P>
      <P>People aged 21 or over and in receipt of an unemployment payment for 15 months or more can also pursue other full-time second level courses at an approved centre such as vocational education committee, other second level school or centre approved by the Minister. The courses must lead to a recognised qualification e.g. group certificate, junior certificate, leaving certificate, city and guilds.  People are deemed to be available for work while participating on the scheme and continue to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced the third level allowance scheme in 1990 and participation in 1993-94 is expected to exceed 700.  The <Col N="982" /> scheme allows people aged 23 or over who are in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least 12 months or a lone parent's allowance to pursue a full-time undergraduate third level course at an approved institute such as a university or regional technical college.  An allowance is paid for the duration of the academic year equal to their unemployment payment or lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>In addition unemployed people may engage in part time study provided it improves employment prospects and is of such a nature so as not to preclude availability for work.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities available to unemployed people and lone parents are promoted extensively through my Department's local office, through the general outdoor information campaigns undertaken by the Department's information service.  A special information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Educational Opportunities for Unemployed People and Lone Parents&rdquo; (SW 70) is available from any of the Department's offices.</P>
    <P>The schemes are also advertised by the educational authorities.  In addition I have recently secured the approval of the Government to my proposal for the appointment of a jobs facilitator in each of my Department's main offices.  These officers will have a strategic role in helping unemployed people to seek out options for themselves whether through job opportunities or by improving their job prospects through better education or training.  As part of this role they will of course be directing unemployed people towards the various second chance education schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for only one national lottery grant-aided scheme, namely Gaeleagras which is for the training of civil servants in the Irish language.  The 1993 allocation for Gaeleagras is £100,000.</P>
      <P>The Vote for the Office of Public Works also comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  That Vote includes an allocation of £500,000 for 1993 in respect of the restoration of Kilmainham Gaol.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question is based upon a misconception.  Prior to 1990 all funds for lottery-approved programmes were voted to a single subhead in the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance, in turn released funds to suspense accounts maintained by the Departments directly responsible for the relevant lottery programmes.</P>

    <P>Since 1990, lottery funds are no longer issued from a single subhead in the Finance Vote.

      <P>There is no basis for comparison between the interest rate charged by the Revenue Commissioners on late payments of tax and the credit terms in contracts between State bodies and their suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory provisions relating to the payment of taxes provide for the charging of interest in respect of late payment. This interest charge, which is an integral part of the collection and enforcement machinery, is designed to ensure timely payment, to compensate the Exchequer for loss of revenue where there is not prompt payment, and to achieve equity as between taxpayers who pay on time <Col N="985" /> and those who do not.  The interest charge is a statutory one which the Revenue Commissioners do not have the authority to reduce or waive.</P>
    <P>Credit terms in relation to the supply of goods and services are matters to be settled between suppliers and their customers, whether these are in the public or private sector.  The general question of late payments is one of the issues being considered by the Task Force on Small Business which was set up by my colleague the Minister for Commerce and Technology.</P>
    <P>Any specific question in relation to local authorities or health boards should be addressed to the responsible Ministers.</P>

      <P>The best response to unemployment is to so manage the economy as to achieve employment growth.  Annual Labour Force Survey data indicate that total employment grew by 45,000 between April 1987 and April 1992 the most recent date for which such data are available <Col N="986" /> relative to the period of the two programmes.  This contrasts with substantial employment losses prior to the programmes, a fall of 66,000 in the five years to April 1987.</P>
      <P>The annual average number on the live register fell by almost 23,000 from 1987 to 1990 but rose again, by almost 60,000 by 1992.  This increase in the live register reflects both the downturn in the world economy and continuing exceptional demographic pressure in Ireland. Despite the unfavourable international environment, Labour Force Survey data indicate that Irish employment held up well between 1990 and 1992, and later data at sectoral levels point to a continuation of this relatively good performance. This is in sharp contrast to the EC where total employment fell by ¾ per cent in 1992 and is expected to fall even more steeply this year.  Ireland's employment performance in adverse circumstances is due in large part to the Government's policies which have been implemented in the framework of both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>This case contains certain complex issues and goes back over a number of years involving payments of disability <Col N="987" /> benefit, disablement benefit and unemployment supplement.</P>
      <P>As is the normal practice in cases of this nature, the person concerned was called for examination by the Department's medical referees to ensure that she continued to be entitled to payment and at the degree of disablement with which she had earlier been assessed.</P>
      <P>She has disagreed with and appealed against the degree of disablement assessed by the medical referee.  This resulted in her being called for further medical examinations following normal practice.</P>
      <P>There was considerable publicity arising from an earlier medical referee examination of the person concerned and a medical referee who was due to have examined her decided that it would be inappropriate for him to conduct the examination in the particular circumstances. This decision was taken in good faith in the interest of the client.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the person's entitlement to unemployment supplement and to disablement benefit have been provisonally restored with effect from 4 June 1993.  The case is still on appeal and further medical evidence has been sought.</P>
      <P>There are other factors in this case and I am having a complete review made by the Department's chief decisions advisory officer of the person's entitlement back to 1990 to ensure that she has been paid all her entitlements.

      <P>Over a number of years I have progressively increased the age limit for payment of child dependant allowances to long term social welfare recipients where the child remains in full-time education. In the case of invalidity pension and other long term payments, such allowances can now be paid up to the age of 21.  In the case of short term payments such as disability benefit, child dependant allowances are paid up to the age of 18. Any extension of this age limit, or any alternative scheme of finance for the people concerned, would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a submission from the Widow's Association that the widow's contributory pension be paid, in the case of self-employed people including farmers where the full three years PRSI has been paid in advance, or in the case of sudden death and that the extra contributions could be made afterwards to qualify for this pension.</Quest>

      <P>I have received submissions on a number of issues, including the matter raised by the Deputy, from the national association of widows.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people, including farmers, became insured under the social insurance system with effect from 6 April 1988, the commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  Contributions at the Class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for old age, contributory and widow's and orphan's pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions to qualify for a widow's contributory pension is that contributions must have been paid in respect of at least 156 contribution weeks between the late husband's date of entry into insurance and the date of his death. This condition applies to all workers paying the rate appropriate for widow's contributory pension, as well as the self-employed. In the case of employees, contributions <Col N="989" /> are deducted on a weekly basis, but in the case of the self-employed the amount due and payable is collected on a yearly basis and can be collected in advance for the full year up to the following April.</P>
    <P>If there was a liability to contribute before a person died the contributions due could be accepted after the person's death and entitlement to a widow's pension granted on the basis of such contributions.</P>
    <P>However, under the social welfare legislation it is clear that contributions cannot be allowed in relation to any period after the death of a contributor. Any changes in this area, such as allowing extra contributions to be made afterwards to qualify for the widow's contributory pension, would have to be applied to all contributors and would have major budgetary implications.</P>

      <P>The particulars sought in the question are detailed in the following table.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that population figures are not available on a Divisional basis.  However, the population of the areas in question, in so far as it is available, is contained in the 1991 census.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, like to point out that <Col N="993" /> the population of an area is but one of a number of factors to be taken into account in assessing the policing needs of any particular area.  Any attempt to compare levels of service in different areas would also need to take account of other matters including the size of an area, the overall resources available to an area such as support staff, transport and other facilities, as well as the incidence of crime in that area and any special policing needs or problems that may exist there.  It would be seriously misleading to regard the ratios of gardaí to population in any area as an accurate measure of the level of Garda service provided for that area.  The overall deployment of Garda resources is kept under regular review by the Garda authorities and adjustments are made as necessary in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>

      <P>Bantry Courthouse is in very poor condition.  Since February 1992 sittings of the District Court have been held in the County Council offices in Bantry and sittings of the Circuit Court have been held in Skibbereen.</P>
      <P>In early 1991, Cork County Council, following a series of complaints about dampness and lack of heat, carried out an engineer's inspection of the premises. It was found that the nearby tidal conditions were causing severe dampness in the courthouse.  The council stated that because of the poor condition of the premises they could not instal new heating. They estimated that the renovation of the courthouse would cost in the region of £120,000.  In addition compliance with the fire safety regulations would cost approximately £14,300 extra, all 1991 prices.</P>
      <P>It was at the request of the County Council that the courts moved out of the building.  The District Court now sits in the County Council offices and this arrangement is working well.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that a total of 26 other courthouses are in need of major repairs, a number of which would merit priority over Bantry.  Because it was not possible to give any undertaking as to when funds would be available to renovate the courthouse I was delighted to be able to react positively to a request I received from Bantry Town Commissioners that they be authorised to lease the courthouse to voluntary organisations who would renovate it and put it to use for the benefit of the public, rather than let it become further delapidated.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the supplementary welfare allowance operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  Participants on the Community Employment Development Programme which operates in the 12 areas targeted under the area based strategy of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> automatically retain their secondary social welfare benefits such as rent supplement.  However, this is not the case with regard to the Social Employment Scheme although participants on that scheme may also qualify if they meet the eligibility criteria, which are a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The Applied Research Scholarship Scheme administered by Eolas has not been discontinued. As I stated in a related parliamentary question on 1 July 1993, officials of my Department have been examining ways to maximise use of the funds available for this scheme. Decisions taken in the Estimates earlier in the year meant that funds available for <Col N="996" /> 1993 were largely committed to roll-over costs from previous years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the examination of the scheme has been completed and that funding for 30 places this year has been secured.  Eolas is in the process of making application forms available to prospective candidates.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that these 30 awards are in addition to some 35 places which Eolas plan to co-fund this year in association with Irish industry.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation, restrictions on the parking of vehicles on public roads are applied generally through the application of by-laws or temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, or through general traffic regulations made by me under section 60 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.

      <P>The person concerned was not an applicant under the 1992 or 1993 sheep headage schemes.  He applied for the ewe premium for the first time in March 1992.  In the normal course of events the application would have been processed for payment in July/August 1992 and payment would have followed without delay.  However, in this particular case, the person named did not have a flock number and it was necessary to issue one so that payment could be made.  Unfortunately, however, the issue of a flock number and processing for payment did not proceed as normal.  I am now arranging for immediate payment of the 1992 ewe premium. As regards 1993 ewe premium the position is that the person named was not entitled to an automatic quota as he was not an applicant under the 1991 scheme which was the reference year for quota purposes.  However, he has applied for a quota from the national reserve.  These applications are being processed at present.  His application under the 1993 ewe premium scheme will then be processed.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium in June 1993 on one animal.  The cattle identity card submitted in respect of that animal referred to a female animal whereas it should have referred to a male.

      <P>Under EC regulations payments in respect of the 1993 special beef premium scheme cannot commence until after 1 November 1993 and even then only a 60 per cent advance may be paid.  The application of the person named will be processed in due course.</P>

    <P>The following is a copy of the letter:</P>
    <P>28 September, 1993</P>
    <P>Eoin Faherty,</P>
    <P>Clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts,</P>
    <P>Leinster House,</P>
    <P>Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>Re: Tribunal of Inquiry &mdash; Beef Processing Industry.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir</P>
    <P>A copy of your letter dated 17th September, 1993 to the Accounting Officer, Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry regarding witnesses' expenses at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry has been forwarded to the Registrar to the Tribunal together with a request for material for reply.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Tribunal is engaged in the task of collating and evaluating the evidence, oral and documentary, adduced before it, it is regrettable that the work in this regard should be interrupted by the necessity to deal with queries raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in connection with expenses incurred by the Tribunal in connection with securing the attendance of witnesses before the Tribunal for the purpose of carrying out the Inquiry which both Houses of the Oireachtas considered of urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal fully appreciates the concern expressed by members of your Committee with regard to the costs of the Tribunal, including the expenses of witnesses attending before the Tribunal, and has decided to clarify the position in regard thereto by direct communication to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the attendance of witnesses before the Tribunal, the steps necessary to secure their attendance, and the expenses incidental thereto were the concern solely of the Tribunal and not of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or any other Department of State.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the Tribunal to discharge its obligations in this regard, funds were made available to the Tribunal by the Department of Agriculture and Food, but the disbursement of same and the reasons therefor were solely a matter for the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Detailed particulars of such disbursements and vouchers in support thereof were and are at all times available to officials of the Department of Agriculture and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The necessity and reasons for any particular payment were never given to the Accounting Officer of the Department of Agriculture and Food because these were matters for determination by the Tribunal only.</P>
    <P>It appears from your letter dated 17th September, 1993 that the Committee of Public Accounts required clarification of the following:</P>
    <P>(a) A breakdown of all payments made to Mr. Patrick McGuinness including professional fees and travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>(b) A breakdown of the 492 payments totalling £96,122.85 witnesses' expenses.</P>
    <P>While the Tribunal questions the propriety of the Committee of Public Accounts seeking this information at a time when the Tribunal is in the course of preparing its Report to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, it has decided in the public interest and to avoid any misunderstanding to give the clarification sought by the Committee.</P>
    <P>The expenses incurred by the Tribunal in connection with the attendance of Mr. Patrick McGuinness before the tribunal were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Vouchers and receipts in respect of the foregoing items of expenditure were examined by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and found to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Annexed to this letter is a schedule of payments to other witnesses in respect of expenses and, where appropriate, loss of earnings.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has sought in the case of payments to Mr. McGuinness, including fees paid to lawyers acting on his behalf a breakdown of these fees together with the reason they were met.  The Tribunal does not intend to make such information available to the Committee pending the presentation by it of its Report as it would be quite improper for it so to do, the Tribunal's obligation is to report to the Minister for Agriculture and it will do so in due course in respect of all relevant matters including the matters referred to in your letter and will not &mdash; indeed cannot &mdash; report to any other body.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton,</P>
    <P>President of the High Court,</P>
    <P>Sole Member of the Tribunal of Inquiry.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I share his concern in this matter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a random telephone survey by the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> in which it contacted a number of general practitioners on the question of stress in general practice.  Particular care is required in extrapolating from observations obtained in this manner and on this issue which clearly are not intended as a scientific study which follows generally accepted Protocols and methodologies.</P>
      <P>The practice of medicine carries with it a degree of stress which must be recognised and effectively managed by medical professionals, including general practitioners. The effective control and management of stress is multifaceted and involves personal factors, education and training, organisational, and environmental influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing education of practitioners which ensures that they are fully up to date in current trends and practices in medicine and skilled in meeting professional <Col N="1025" /> demands represents an important resource for practitioners.  I recently approved additional funding for the continuing medical education of doctors to ensure that a complete network of educational structures was in place and operating nationally.</P>
    <P>Under the current agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation a development fund for general practice was established which provides a number of important developments in general practice including: £4.5 million to be invested in additional allowances for the provision of realistic rostering and out-of-hours arrangements; £3 million towards practice developments; £1.5 million in addition to existing payments towards the employment of practice secretaries and/or practice nurses.</P>
    <P>Such targeted investment improves the support available to practitioners.</P>
    <P>In terms of organisation of general practice, my Department's blueprint document on <i>The Future of General Practice in Ireland</i> clearly identifies the fragmentation and isolation of general practitioners as a major difficulty in the effective organisation of general practice. The document sets out proposals for the development of group practices and multi-centred practices to provide support for individual practitioners in the delivery of patient care.  The establishment recently of General Practice Units at health board level is intended to assist the integration of general practitioners into the delivery of primary care services generally and thereby reduce the isolation of general practitioners.  The general practitioners employed within health board units are an important support structure for practitioners generally in terms of improving general practice and dealing with service issues of concern to individual practitioners.</P>

      <P>Overall drugs expenditure in the GMS rose from £57.6 million in 1982 to £134.8 million in 1992.  In the period between 1987 and 1992 the &ldquo;real&rdquo; increase in the cost of drugs is in the order of 11 per cent per annum when price fluctuations are ignored.  Control of this rise in costs was therefore a major component of the agreement reached with the Irish Medical Organisation in late 1992.  An analysis of the drugs expenditure in the scheme in 1993 to date, shows a marked reduction in these trend increases, because of this agreement and the other initiatives taken by my Department.</P>
      <P>All annual overruns in expenditure between 1982 and 1992 were met by annual Supplementary Estimates.</P>
