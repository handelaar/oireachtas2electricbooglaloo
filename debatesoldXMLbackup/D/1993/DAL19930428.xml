      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 3, 2, 5 and 11.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. In the event of the motion for either or both of the by-elections for Mayo West and Dublin South Central being moved, the following arrangements shall apply: (i) both motions shall be debated together; (ii) speeches, which shall be confined to a spokesperson for the Technical Group, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Government, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (iii) the questions necessary to bring the debate to a conclusion shall be put successively at the end of the debate. 2. Nos. 1 and 3 shall be decided without debate. 3.  The debate on No. 2 shall not exceed two hours and 15 minutes and the following provisions shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) the speeches of the Minister and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes; (iii) the Minister or Minister of State shall be called on to reply not less than ten minutes before the debate is due to conclude. 4.  The proceedings on No. 5 if not <Col N="1614" /> previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 6.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) the opening speech of the Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes. 5.  In the case of the resumed debate on No. 11, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes. 6. Private Members' Business shall be No. 14 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that many people applying for mortgages are being forced to pay extra because of secret commission being paid to building societies in respect of the insurance that must be taken out in order to get a mortgage, may I ask the Taoiseach when the legislation promised last year to govern the activities of financial intermediaries, which would presumably regulate this type of secret transaction, will be introduced in this House?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the problem in this case relates to commission paid by insurance companies to an agent, namely, a building society, and that this is adding to the cost of a mortgage?  Does the Taoiseach take the view, as I do, that such payments should be regulated and transparent and that there should not be a suggestion of secret payments capable of being made to individuals?</P>

    <Title>Issue of Writs for By-Elections: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the resignation of Deputy John O'Connell, a member for the Constituency of Dublin South-Central.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the rules of the House, only one motion may be moved.  The second motion will be moved when the first one has been disposed of.  I move this motion on behalf of Democratic Left.  We put down these motions because we believe the people of the two constituencies concerned are entitled to full representation in the Dáil and because of the reluctance of the Government to fulfil its constitutional obligations in this regard.  It is almost four months since the vacancy occurred in the Mayo West constituency and almost three months since Dr. O'Connell resigned his Dublin South-Central seat.  We have raised the matter with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.  When the <Col N="1619" /> matter was last raised before Easter, the Taoiseach said that the Government had no plans to move the writs.  Unless the writs are passed by the Dáil within the next few weeks it will not be possible to have the elections held earlier than three weeks following the resumption of the Dáil in full session after the summer recess.  This means that the elections could not be held before late October or early November.  At that stage the Mayo West seat will have been vacant for ten months and the Dublin South-Central seat will have been vacant for almost ten months.  There is no justification for leaving Dáil vacancies unfilled for such a long period.  Democratic Left believes that the end of May would be the most appropriate time to hold these elections, with the long evenings and before the holiday and examination periods begin.</P>
    <P>The principle of equality of representation in the Dáil is clearly enshrined in the Constitution and any failure to hold by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but there is an element of noise in the vicinity of the Chamber which is a source of disruption to our proceedings.</P>

      <P>Consultation with Ministers is underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of equality of representation in the Dáil is clearly enshrined in the Constitution and any failure to hold by-elections within a reasonable period of a vacancy occurring would be a breach of the spirit and, possibly, the letter of the Constitution.  Under existing legislation, there is no requirement that the Government should move a writ within a specified time and these two vacancies could, theoretically, be left open until the next general election is held.  This is clearly not satisfactory and this House should address the question of amending legislation so that all by-elections <Col N="1620" /> have to be held within a specified time.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the two Government parties have publicly indicated their intentions of opposing our motions to move the writs, but I hope even at this late stage that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste will reconsider the scant regard they are showing for the democratic rights of people in the constituencies concerned. Their refusal to consider holding these by-elections or even to give any date as to when they might be held is in stark contrast to the position adopted by both parties when in Opposition.  For example, when Kieran Doherty died on 4 August 1981, Fianna Fáil moved a motion for the writ on 21 October.  Following the death of George Colley on 17 September 1983, Fianna Fáil moved a writ on 2 November.  The following year Fianna Fáil waited only five weeks before attempting to move the writ following the death of Ber Cowen.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the elections may be deferred until 1994 because of Fianna Fáil's difficulties in getting a candidate for the Dublin South-Central constituency is particularly outrageous.  This will mean that both seats will be vacant for close to or more than a year.  Avoiding by-elections for party political reasons should not be acceptable in our parliamentary democracy.  In the past, Governments have, on occasion, opposed motions to move writs because they argued by-elections should be deferred and held in conjunction with general elections, local elections or European elections which were pending.  The next elections due to be held here are the European elections of summer 1994. Surely the Government is not contemplating deferring the by-election until then?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's comment about a by-election interrupting the work schedule of the Dáil could be taken more seriously if his Government had not forced through a motion for the Dáil to close for a full week simply because St. Patrick's Day fell on a Wednesday.  In fact by-elections would result in the Dail losing one sitting day only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> How can the Tánaiste reconcile the statement of his spokesperson to the effect that the matter is not even on the agenda with the lavish promises given in the Programme for Government under the heading &ldquo;Principal Objectives&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>...To restore confidence in the democratic process, by encouraging openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust, and by ensuring the highest standards in public life;</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the extent of the majority a Government may have in the Dáil or indeed its performance in office, there is a right to have Dáil vacancies filled within a reasonable period of time.  However, where the parties in Government within such a short space of time so spectacularly failed to live up to their pre-election promises there is a particular obligation to allow people to express their views on the record of the Government when vacancies arise.</P>
    <P>The sense of public disappointment with the Government, only 100 days after being elected with the largest majority in the history of the State, is virtually unprecedented.  Therefore, it is not surprising that this administration is already running for cover and afraid to put its programme to public test.</P>
    <P>The unemployed, who looked to the Government to honour its commitment to put the country back to work, have looked on in disbelief as the live register figures remained virtually static and the Government passed up the opportunity presented by the latest budget to introduce imaginative job creation initiatives. The disappointment with this Government has been compounded by the manner in which Labour Party Ministers have packed their Departments with advisers, managers and handlers drawn largely from the ranks of their party.</P>
    <P>Those on social welfare, who expeted the Labour Party to honour its promises to have the dirty dozen social welfare cuts reversed, feel betrayed as the majority of them remain in place and continue to cause hardship to those most in need.  The Labour Party, particularly the Minister of <Col N="1622" /> State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, has contested my statement that most of the cuts remain in place.  Perhaps she will accept the verdict of SIPTU, a union affiliated to the Labour Party, which pointed out in a statement on Friday last that four of the 12 cuts only had been eased and that two new cuts had been effected by this administration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the social welfare area, it appears that the Government will continue to insist that black is white. What else can we make of the statement of the Minister for Social Welfare in this House last evening on the Adjournment Debate?  He said:</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I want to emphasise that health boards have discretion to make payments in support of ESB and gas bills where they consider that circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>This is simply not so and the Minister knows it.  The McCreevy circulars have restricted the community welfare officers' discretion.  They cannot now help with ESB bills except in exceptional circumstances, as defined in those circulars, which severely restrict the previous discretionary practices of those same community welfare officers.  The Minister for Social Welfare and his Minister of State, Deputy Burton, know it, yet they continue to attempt to mislead the House.  They do so because they know, in their cynical calculated way, that the people affected are poor, unorganised and marginalised.  They have no power, no trade union and no protection in society.  If my party and a handful of welfare groups did not consistently raise the matter, their plight would remain unnoticed.  I intend to continue raising it because it is an injustice against the people already struggling to survive, who are being ignored by Government because they are poor and powerless.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Opposition told us they were opposed to hospital charges, yet one of the first things the Minister for Health did was to increase those same charges.  We were told the Labour Party was opposed to privatisation.  It has <Col N="1623" /> already agreed to the sale of the remaining public share in Irish Life and it would appear that Greencore is about to go the same way.  In addition, the equity injection so urgently needed by Aer Lingus is still being withheld.  Indeed it appears that at least part of Aer Lingus is being prepared for privatisation.</P>
    <P>If the Government has any confidence in its programme and performance surely it should be prepared to put them to the test in these two by-elections which would pose no threat to its majority in this House but would enable the electorate to pass judgment on their record to date.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the Democratic Left has a particular interest in the Dublin South-Central constituency where Councillor Eric Byrne, who was an outstanding Dáil representative for the people of that constituency, lost his seat by just four votes after the marathon recount in the last general election.  We want to see him back in this House.  More and more people in Dublin South-Central want to see him back in the Dáil to represent their interests.  We are confident that he can take the seat in the by-election.  Of course the parties in Government also realise that.  Perhaps that is the main reason they are so reluctant to hold the by-election in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Coalition Government, comprised of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, has the largest majority in the House in the history of the State. They have plenty of Deputies available to keep the House going even if there was a by-election very soon.  This issue &mdash; the availability of Deputies to keep the House going &mdash; is the only excuse offered by the Government to date for not holding the by-election.  If a Government, with a majority of 38, cannot keep the House going and, at the same time, arrange for its case to be presented to the electorate of Dublin South Central and Mayo West, it is a very poor Government. I do not believe any other parliament in the world would postpone a by-election because the Government <Col N="1624" /> wanted to keep its Deputies in the House. To advance such an excuse for not holding the by-election is a commentary on the laziness, smugness and emptiness of this Coalition Government.  Nobody but a Government as smug as this would advance such a lame excuse for not holding a by-election.</P>
      <P>This Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour may have the largest majority in this House in the history of the State but it most assuredly is not the Government for which the Irish electorate voted last November.  The people of Mayo West, Castlebar, Bangor Erris and Westport, and those in Dublin South-Central, Kimmage, Terenure, Drimnagh and Crumlin, deserve to be given a chance to strengthen the Opposition in the Dáil to this Government with a bloated majority.  They deserve to be given the opportunity to vote for a party &mdash; Fine Gael &mdash; which sees its role in this House, and in the next Dáil, as one of replacing Fianna Fáil in Government, not just providing them with an alternative partner because it is tired of its existing partner.  The only party that guarantees, through its votes in this House, to change the Government rather than simple provide it with a new partner is the Fine Gael Party.  All the other parties in this House, with the exception of Democratic Left, have indicated that they have been in the past or would in the future, be willing to coalesce with Fianna Fáil and put them back in office.  If the people of Drimnagh and Mayo West want to see a change of Government, as distinct from a new partner for Fianna Fáil, their only guarantee is through a vote for Fine Gael because Fine Gael alone is determined to replace this Government rather than simply provide it with a new partner. That is why I ask for an early test of this Government in a by-election, so that the electorate will be afforded an opportunity to elect two Deputies committed to change, to replacing this Government rather than simply propping it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Government of high taxation because it cannot make up its mind to do anything difficult.  The budget, which is still before this House, is the best possible <Col N="1625" /> example of the sort of political dynamic we will have in this Government because that budget imposed extra VAT on clothing, something that is essential to normal life, extra VAT on hotel rooms to deter tourists from coming here; it imposed a 1 per cent across the board levy which falls especially heavily on the PAYE sector and a 2 per cent tax on even the smallest amount of money, even a council cottage, or a corporation dwelling which has been purchased or handed over by a mother or father to a son or daughter.</P>
    <P>The reason all these items are being taxed is that neither party in a Government consisting of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party will be able to keep spending under control so a week to ten days before budget day they will take the only remaining option available, that of increasing taxation.  This year's budget is typical of the budgets we are going to have as long as Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party remain in Government together.  The people of Dublin South Central and Mayo West now have an opportunity to vote against a Government of high taxation and to replace it by voting for Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>This is also a Government which centralises power.  It does deals behind closed doors and sets a bad example for business by the way it conducts its own business.  The programme under which £8 billion of European money will be spent is being drawn up behind closed doors by officials and politicans who are not consulting this House or the democratically elected representatives throughout the country and who are not debating the options in relation to the way in which this money should be spent. The Government is going to come up with its own plan and will distribute the money to be provided by European taxpayers as if it was largesse from the tables of individual Fianna Fáil and Labour Party backbenchers in particular constituencies. In other words, we have a Government which is cultivating a culture of dependency on political patronage in relation to the way in which this money will be spent.  If we want to change <Col N="1626" /> this, to give power back to the people and create a culture of self-reliance instead of a spirit of dependency, then the way to do it is by voting for a party which is committed to cultivating a sense of self-reliance, namely, the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The people of Mayo West and Dublin South Central are as concerned as the rest of us about the ongoing tragedy in Northern Ireland.  I hope this combination of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party has the capacity to make a contribution towards solving that problem. However, I have the gravest doubts about this because they seem to be paralysed by indecision when it comes to making any major move by way of a generous response from people on this side of the Border in order to break the logjam in the talks process.  It seems that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are unable to make up their minds as to who is ultimately responsible for Northern Ireland policy.  They have effectively paralysed each other in regard to making any generous gesture and indicating a willingness to change Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, if there is a settlement, to get the talks moving.  As long as we have this coalition of paralysis in office we are not going to see movement or the urgency that should be shown on this side of the Border about the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House seem to think that the problem is now so serious that it cannot possibly get worse, but let me warn them that it can get much worse. I do not believe that either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste can see the gravity of the situation or have demonstrated to date the necessary generosity of spirit to reach an accommodation with the other tradition on this island.  This is another reason the people of Dublin South Central and Mayo West should be given an opportunity to send a message to this House and reduce by two the bloated majority of the Government.  They should send a message that they want leadership from the Government on the issue of Northern Ireland, not historical recidivism and revisionism, references to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, or <Col N="1627" /> the old, tired slogans more appropriate to party political platform in 1948 rather than in 1993.</P>
    <P>If we wish to see movement towards a Government which is not a Government of high taxation, which decentralises power and gives the people an opportunity to have a say in relation to the way EC money should be spent, and which is committed to progress in Northern Ireland because it recognises that both communities are of equal concern to us on this side of the Border, then the people of Dublin South Central and Mayo West can bring this closer by voting to reduce the excessive majority of the Government and, in particular, for the only party which is clearly willing to replace Fianna Fáil in Government rather than provide them with a new partner, namely the Fine Gael Party.  For those reasons on behalf of my party I confidently and firmly support the motions to have the writs moved and if the Government succeeds in defeating them on this occasion, I will be willing to support them whenever they are moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>The Progressive Democrats are happy to support these two motions and will vote for them.  If the Government opposes them &mdash; and I assume it will, although it has not yet spoken on the matter &mdash; with its enormous majority it will prevail, as it will on everything else in this House.  The size of the Government's majority, to which the two previous speakers referred, is one of the most relevant aspects in the attempt to have the writs moved.  The size of the majority is unprecedented and the Government can more or less get away with almost anything it likes in this House.  Its majority stands at over 30 and the fact that there are two vacancies makes no difference.  If the Government were to lose both seats when the by-elections are held it would make no difference, because the majority would still be the highest in the history of the State. The Government does not therefore have the excuse which would sometimes be used by a Government that it cannot <Col N="1628" /> spare the manpower to contest the by-elections. It has ample manpower to continue the normal work of Government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's explanation that they have much work to do and do not want to be diverted by by-elections has no foundation in fact or in reason.  It would be perfectly feasible to hold these by-elections and continue the normal work of Government.  Many previous Governments held by-elections when it did not suit them &mdash; in some cases at a time when they had a majority as small as one &mdash; and they were still able to conduct the affairs of the country.  It is entirely fallacious to suggest that in some way the Government would be diverted from the national tasks which must be faced. Indeed in the year I entered this House there were five if not six by-elections, and I contrast this with the fact there has not been a by-election during this or the previous Dáil, I think, during the Dáil prior to that.  We have gone through an abnormally long period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The size of the Government majority is very unhealthy and stifles meaningful debate in this House. Because of the numbers involved they can simply steamroll anything that is brought before the House irrespective of the merits of the arguments made.  In these two by-elections the people will get an opportunity to express their views on what has been going on over the past 100 days.  The people have very strong views on this matter.  They will not get the opportunity to change the Government &mdash; even though a majority may wish to reconsider what they did at the last general election where they were so notably misled as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;change&rdquo;, the buzz word on that occasion.  They will not get the opportunity to change the Government but they will get an opportunity to make a protest at the ballot box and at least change the membership of two of the seats in this House.</P>
      <P>Mayo West is the largest three seat constituency in the country.  It stretches over a distance of 110 miles, from a short distance north of Galway city right up beyond Belmullet.  This constituency is disadvantaged in a number of respects and therefore has a great many problems. At present it is represented by two Deputies only and no matter how hard they work, it is very difficult for any two Deputies to give the kind of attention that is necessary in a constituency of that size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution recognises that changes in population must be reflected in the make up of the constituencies.  The Constitution lays down that those <Col N="1630" /> changes must take place at least once in every 12 years, but the courts have since laid down that the changes in population and changes in respresentation must be reflected more frequently than that. Since that principle has been laid down &mdash; I do not think anybody could disagree with it &mdash; the same principle applies that equality of representation be given as widely and as fairly as possible throughout the country.  If circumstances give rise to a by-election, obviously it is not possible to fill the seats within a matter of weeks or even a month or so but it should be, and it is possible, to fill those seats within a reasonable period.  Almost four months have elapsed since these vacancies arose.  If these motions are not passed today it looks as if the earliest time at which the vacancies may be filled is next autumn.  The House would hardly have the opportunity of making the arrangements to fill them before October, which will be ten months after the vacancies arose.  That is a totally unreasonable period, particularly in a far flung and widespread rural constituency such as Mayo West, which is now represented by two Deputies only.</P>
    <P>It seems remarkable that a Government that has a historically high majority should be so unwilling to face the people in these two constituencies.  As I said already, Governments with a majority of one were prepared to take their chances in by-elections, sometimes where the very future of the Government was at stake.  The future of this Government is not at stake but it simply gives the people in these constituencies an opportunity to elect a representative so that they have the normal level of representation instead of being deprived of it for an excessive length of time.  The onus is on the Government to explain why it wants to deprive them of their representation for such an excessive length of time.  It does not interfere with Government work in any way or with the various problems facing the country.</P>
    <P>There is no valid reason that has been adduced to me as to why the by-elections should not be held.  For that reason I urge those in the House who have any <Col N="1631" /> democratic feelings &mdash; in particular I address some of my remarks to the members of the Labour Party &mdash; to support these two motions today.</P>

      <P>To allay the fears of people on the Opposition benches in relation to facing the electorate in by-elections in Mayo West and Dublin South-Central, I wish to clarify that the Government will be opposing these two writs.  The writs were moved, not because of any great conviction on the part of the Opposition parties that the people want to pass a verdict on the Government, but because it is becoming more apparent to members of the Opposition, particularly to members of the Democratic Left, that the policies of the Government are working and that it will succeed in tackling the very serious problems facing the country.  The Opposition realises that the public, even at this early stage, see that the Government is working and tackling the problems that confront us.  For that reason the Democratic Left and other parties opposite are afraid to wait a little longer for the by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the comments in relation to this Government having the largest majority in the history of the State.  The argument was made previously that, with such a majority, debate is stifled and Bills rammed through.  The public, and indeed Members opposite, know that is not the way the Government operates.  It has operated and will continue to operate within this House and with the social partners in a spirit of co-operation, <Col N="1632" /> dialogue and partnership. There is no threat to democracy or to the democratic institutions by the fact that we have such a large majority.  The threat arises only if the Government becomes arrogant, smug, as mentioned by Deputy Bruton, but that will not happen.</P>
    <P>While the Government welcomes full representation in constituencies, other matters must take priority.  At the start of a new session of the Dáil, which promises to be one of the busiest in recent years, with important legislation to be passed, neither the House nor the public needs the distraction of by-elections. With such a majority we have no doubt that we will more than adequately run the business of the House.  However, I have doubts about the Oppositions ability, if it is serious about holding the by-elections, to provide effective opposition during the course of such by-elections.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see in the coming week, about 15 to 20 Bills need to be discussed in this session, the principal ones being the Finance Bill and the Bill to implement the recommendations of the Culliton report.  These are two major Bills which must receive our full and undivided attention.  For that reason it would be wrong to agree at this stage to holding by-elections in the two constituencies concerned.  As regards the concern expressed in relation to the people in both constituencies being adequately represented, Fianna Fáil has always given a first class service to the people of Mayo West and Dublin South-Central, as proved in elections there over the years.  I have no doubt that the organisations and the public representatives in both these areas will continue to provide a good service to these constituencies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general points made about the budget and the performance of the Government, contrary to Deputy Bruton's remarks about the Government being paralysed, it has shown itself to be active and giving a lead in regard to change, as promised at the outset.  The argument was made previously by Deputy Bruton that the people did not vote for the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in the last general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> However, 60 per cent of people voted for Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies, fewer than 25 per cent voted for Fine Gael and fewer than 40 per cent voted for all other parties combined.  If the people did not vote for a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, my mathematics are wrong.</P>
    <P>On the point by Deputy Bruton about tired slogans being used by the Government in relation to Northern Ireland, the Government's policy has been enunciated time and again in this regard.  We all know from where the tired slogans <Col N="1634" /> come in relation to Northern Ireland, not from this side of the House and, in many cases, not from this side of the Border. The Government is committed to a programme of change and to tackling the issues of Northern Ireland and unemployment, the two major issues facing us. At this early stage of a new session we should not be distracted from our work and, for that reason, we will oppose both motions in relation to the writs for the by-elections.</P>

    <P>(23)  That no document received by the Clerk to the Select Committee, the Joint Committee or a sub-Committee shall be withheld, withdrawn or altered without the knowledge and approval of such Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee is a landmark.  It is many years since the idea of such a committee was first proposed; I am particularly pleased that it falls to me as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to present the terms of reference of the committee for the approval of this House.</P>
    <P>In the formulation of foreign policy, we confront issues of fundamental importance in our national life.  Through the values we espouse, the choices we make and the balance we achieve between competing priorities, we define ourselves as a people.  It is entirely right that an all-party forum should exist in <Col N="1646" /> which the full range of issues can be addressed and policy options weighed.</P>
    <P>The expertise and advice that such a committee can provide has rarely been more necessary.  I need hardly emphasise the pace of change in international life &mdash; accounts of the flashpoints and trouble spots around the world crowd our newspapers and television screens.  If there ever were easy choices in the foreign policy area, they are no longer available to us.  The slogans and clichés around which Cold War politics were built have become redundant but with East and West no longer able to define themselves in terms of opposition to the other, there is an urgent need for a new framework of reference within which international life can be structured.</P>
    <P>Despite much heralding, it is still difficult to discern anything like the beginnings of a new world order.  With an are of trouble spots around the world, the situation on our own continent gives little cause for reassurance.  Eastern Europe is fractured by ethnic tension while a degree of self-doubt seems to have taken hold in the West.  The situation in the former Yugoslavia is shamefully reminiscent of the darkest period in European history. The question as to whether more could and should have been done earlier to stop the spread of the poison is one that the international community &mdash; the EC, the UN, all of us &mdash; must confront.</P>
    <P>The challenge is to define the values which should guide Irish foreign policy at this time of radical change in the international environment.  There is no single formula which will serve for all situations, but we can at least seek to identify the central ingredients around which policy must be formed.  As we launch the Foreign Affairs Committee, it is important to suggest at least some of these key elements.  I will begin by identifying the following &mdash; knowledge, consistency and focus.</P>
    <P>The first of these, a basis of knowledge, may seem almost too obvious to deserve mention.  However, our credibility as a participant in discussion, in the European Community, the United Nations or elsewhere, <Col N="1647" /> rests on such a foundation.  We are not absolved by pleading small country status; our ability to influence discussion rests not simply on the strength of our convictions but on our ability to demonstrate that we are informed and worthwhile interlocutors. The first hand information on which policy is based comes primarily from our network of 40 or so diplomatic missions around the world: supplementing that, however, is the experience gained through a variety of other sources, including our involvement with UN peacekeeping and the overseas aid work being done by so many Irish volunteers around the world.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that many Members of the Dáil and Seanad have considerable foreign policy expertise, sometimes with a degree of specialisation in a particular area.  Through an effective use of the sub-committee system, I hope that the Foreign Affairs Committee will lead to a pooling and broadening of knowledge which will substantially strengthen the basis for policy formation.</P>
    <P>By &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; I do not mean a rigidity that effectively strait-jackets policy but it is legitimate and proper that the same questions are asked, and equivalent standards brought to bear, in differing situations around the world.  Exploitation and terrorism wear an equally ugly face in whatever continent they manifest themselves.  Historical and cultural contexts differ but the fundamental human rights are universally applicable and require universal respect.  In Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and South Africa, we can try to unravel the complexities of troubled situations by applying the same basic tests.  Even if the categories of aggressor and victim are not always watertight, there is rarely an equivalence of moral responsibility in conflicts.  Our instinctive concern must be with those whose rights are being violated, whatever the political orientation or international standing of those who seek to violate those rights.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, in taking an overview of foreign policy, the Foreign <Col N="1648" /> Affairs Committee will share my concern to ensure that these important threads of consistency run through our responses to different situations.</P>
    <P>In parallel with our examination of problems around the world, we should not refrain from holding the mirror up to ourselves.  By international standards our human rights record is creditable but we should frankly admit that we have not always shown ourselves enthusiastic in our implementation of corrective measures on the few occasions when international human rights tribunals have found this country to be in breach of human rights agreements to which we are party.  We are not immune from the illusion that international human rights norms apply only to others or from feelings of resentment at `outsiders' telling us that our laws or practices are in breach of international human rights standards. If the Foreign Affairs Committee feels it necessary to prod our conscience in this regard, I will certainly not discourage it.</P>
    <P>The third quality, which I have described as focus, is a little more difficult to define than the previous two.  We should not be &mdash; nor as members of the European Community can we be &mdash; selective in our knowledge or concern. But it is perhaps overly ambitious for a small country seeking an effective foreign policy role to attempt to be equally active on all issues on the international agenda. There are usually certain touchstone issues &mdash; in Irish foreign policy, for example, these have traditionally been disarmament, human rights and relations with the developing world.  Some problems around the world will also select themselves for our attention, whether because of an historical affinity, a peace-keeping or aid involvement or a human rights aspect which engages us.  Our contribution on these issues and problems will tend to establish the defining characteristics of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Affairs Committee will have an important role in providing a barometer of concern on the multiplicity of issues we confront.  I do not suggest that political leaders should always follow where public concern leads; it is essential <Col N="1649" /> however, that policy formulators should fully appreciate when a particular issue or situation has struck a chord with Irish people.  Conversely, it is important that politicians and the public should be aware when and why a particular issue may be felt to merit a special policy focus, even if it is not at the time dominating media attention.</P>
    <P>As all Deputies are aware, Irish foreign policy is increasingly formulated in partnership with other members of the European Community; this process will of course accelerate with the advance towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy under the Maastricht Treaty. Fears have been expressed that the distinctive Irish voice may become muffled within the CFSP; on the contrary, our ability to influence external events can be strengthened by vigorous and principled participation in the framing of Community positions.</P>
    <P>The architecture of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is established in the Maastricht Treaty; however, its vitality and effectiveness will be judged by its implementation in practice.  In the attempt to give shape and direction to the CFSP, it is important that we are clear-sighted about potential risks and pitfalls.  At one extreme, the attempt to define common positions could drift towards a lowest common denominator approach which would render Community policies anodyne and ineffective. At the other extreme, in seeking to avoid excessive dilution, there is a risk that the voices of some of the larger member states could predominate in establishing the tone and tenor of policy.</P>
    <P>For our part, we want a dynamic CFSP that ensures a coherent, respected and effective Community voice in the world. We want to see our national values and priorities reflected in the common positions adopted, while at the same time being prepared to make the necessary adjustment to the requirements of partnership that is incumbent on all member states.  The balance to be achieved will sometimes be a delicate one, requiring good judgment and a keen sense of perspective, and the advice and input of <Col N="1650" /> the Foreign Affairs Committee will be particularly important.</P>
    <P>So far I have spoken about the political rather than the economic content of our foreign policy.  But foreign policy is as much about our economic well-being as our political self-respect.  Indeed, it is where the two are potentially in conflict that the advice of the Foreign Affairs Committee may prove most valuable.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues we encounter at political level have a signficant economic dimension, and there is of course a large proportion of foreign affairs work which is essentially economic in character.  Our membership of the EC, on which so much of our foreign policy focuses, conditions every aspect of the economic life of this country.  The promotion of foreign earnings is a central preoccupation for almost all our overseas missions and a key consideration in establishing priorities for the further expansion of our diplomatic network.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, in the economic area especially, the committee's overview and investigative brief will extend well beyond the limits of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs; indeed, the effects of our European membership are so pervasive that there is hardly any Government Department which is not to some degree affected by EC activity.  I am confident that the committee can count on the full co-operation of all Departments in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>I would propose to turn now to some of the specific issues arising in the terms of reference of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Firstly, let me state briefly what I think is right about these terms of reference before I try to respond to what some Members of the House may feel is wrong with them.  In my view, among the very positive features are &mdash; the comprehensive mandate of the committee, the fact that it will be a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad, drawing on the experience and expertise which has been accumulated in both Houses, the scope for the establishment of sub-committees, the fact that all Members of both Houses will have the right to attend meetings and participate in deliberations, without <Col N="1651" /> having the right to vote, the important linkage with the European Parliament, with all Irish MEPs having the right to attend and participate and MEPs from other member states able to attend by invitation and the fact that the committee may produce such reports as it chooses, following its consideration of particular issues or policy areas.</P>
    <P>The principal focus of criticism has been the fact that there will not be a separate European Communities committee and that the new committee will subsume the existing Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I acknowledge also the concerns expressed about the earlier proposal that discussion on political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland would be held in private.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to the important amendment which has been made to the terms of reference in this latter respect.</P>
    <P>On the first point, I must confess to having some difficulty in understanding the basis for the concerns expressed.  It seems to me that two separate Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs would almost inevitably lead to overlap and duplication; it would be wholly undesirable that the energies and attention of Oireachtas Members should be frittered away in artificial boundary disputes between a Foreign Affairs and a European Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>As I have tried to suggest earlier, practically the whole spectrum of foreign policy issues is increasingly seen through the prism of our European Community membership.  To try to discuss our attitude to the Middle East, for example, in isolation from Community positions on the Middle East could hardly make sense. The same is true of practically any other issue in the international political arena. It is almost equally difficult to divorce discussion on economic issues from the wider context.  Any serious debate on EC agricultural, industrial or trade policies, for example, involves consideration of EC relations with the US, the developing world, its role in GATT etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> I understand there is also a concern that subsuming the existing Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities will overload the Foreign Affairs Committee with consideration of essentially technical issues. For my part, I would question such a dismissive attitude towards the very valuable work that has been done to date by the Joint Committee.  However, I feel that any genuine concerns on this score can be met by setting up a sub-committee specifically to deal with work previously dealt with by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I would have thought that, with a total Committee membership of 30, there is ample scope for the intelligent use of sub-committees.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to concerns expressed about the earlier proposal that discussion of political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland would be in private.  As Deputies will note from the revised terms of reference which have been circulated, these have been amended to provide that only security issues will now be dealt with in private.</P>
    <P>I would like to make my position on this security exception unambiguously clear.  Like others in this House, I share a belief in open government and a strong sense that, in principle, members of the public should have full access to discussions being conducted among their elected representatives.  I believe, however, that there are circumstances in which a departure from this principle is justified.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to emphasise the sensitivity of discussion on security matters relating to Northern Ireland. Security issues can involve, quite literally, matters of life and death.  We have an overriding duty &mdash; and I am sure that this is accepted by all Members of the House &mdash; to ensure that nothing in our proceedings or discussions can put at risk the personal safety of any individual or group.  The caution that would necessarily and properly be induced by the presence of the public and the media would in my view inhibit meaningful discussion on security issues relating to <Col N="1653" /> Northern Ireland.  I invite Deputies to consider, for example, the difficulties that would be involved for the Department of Justice in briefing Deputies on these matters in a public setting.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is now envisaged that the committee's discussions on political issues relating to Northern Ireland will be in public.  In initially suggesting private discussion on political matters, I had thought to encourage a depth and openness in exchanges that, given the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, might not be attainable in public.  On the other hand I fully recognise the importance of ensuring sustained public debate on the crucial political issues relating to Northern Ireland.  Indeed, since coming into office I have done everything possible to initiate and encourage such debate.  On balance, and having reflected carefully on the arguments advanced by various Deputies, I am prepared to accept that the value of having committee discussions take place in public is likely to outweigh any potential disadvantages. The terms of reference have been amended to reflect this.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to underline again how much I am personally looking forward to working with the Foreign Affairs Committee, as also is the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Tom Kitt.  I hope there will be an opportunity to participate in an early meeting of the committee, perhaps for a discussion on departmental Estimates as envisaged in the terms of reference.  I would emphasise also that this positive approach is fully shared by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who welcome the opportunity for indepth discussion that the committee will provide.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there is no monopoly of wisdom on the complex issues which arise in the foreign policy area.  To date the opportunities for serious debate on many of these issues have been limited.  While Question Time in the House is an essential and valuable part of the parliamentary process, the format lends itself to an adversarial approach and does not necessarily encourage the most considered statements <Col N="1654" /> by questioners or the most forthcoming attitude on the part of respondents.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Affairs Committee will provide an opportunity for consensus-building on a basis of shared knowledge and measured consideration of options. Inevitably, there will be situations and issues on which consensus does not emerge, and responsibility for decision-making ultimately of course rests with the Government; the fact that there are honest differences of opinion cannot be allowed to paralyse policy formulation. However, with a constructive approach all round, I am convinced that a considerable degree of agreement will prove possible; and even where it does not the committee discussion will be immensely valuable in helping to broaden perspectives, improve the flow of information and overall enhance the quality of decision making.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government Chief Whip, the Assistant Whip and the Whips of the Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrat and Democratic Left Parties for their assistance and co-operation in formulating the terms of reference of this committee.  I am sure similar co-operation on that committee will augur well for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle announced here today in regard to the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee. Many problems were experienced concerning the workings of the House during the past number of years because of the lack of an effective committee system to deal with particular issues.  Instead, we have had to rely on plenary sessions of the Oireachtas to deal with such issues.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to get involved in the nitty gritty details regarding the options open to the Foreign Affairs Committee. On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome the establishment of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> However, due to the wide ground that this single committee must cover, there are a number of issues with which the Government and the Foreign Affairs Committee should deal in the next couple of months.  The budget for this committee and its sub-committees should be put on a statutory footing, with a separate Vote to ensure that it can plan its own agenda and that its operation cannot be compromised by the Depeartment of Finance or by ministerial whim.  I am dissatisfied that all sessions on Northern Ireland issues will be <i>in camera;</i> but I welcome the change, at the suggestion of Fine Gael, that political issues will be heard in public session.  As the Minister stated, there should be openness in regard to issues pertaining to Northern Ireland as that will enhance the workings of the committee.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the establishment of a standing sub-committee on European affairs with its own secretariat and research capabilities.  There is widespread concern in the House at the fact that we do not have a separate European affairs committee.  I hope that an autonomous European affairs sub-committee will be given the necessary resources, research capabilities and secretariat facilities to make it effective.  As the Minister stated, Europe is intrinsically linked with many of the foreign affairs issues with which we deal.  Indeed, how we deal with the business of Europe in this House has been highlighted by the recent High Court decision regarding EC directives.  That shows how lax the Oireachtas has been in validating and scrutinising EC directives.  Through ministerial regulation and order such directives have been implemented by way of legislation in this House without proper scrutiny.  That creates a huge information deficit between what takes place in the European Parliament and the general public.  A European affairs sub-committee would provide us with information in regard to directives introduced in Europe and their impact on the lives of ordinary people.  Many examples of this have been aired in the media recently, <Col N="1656" /> not least the controversy in regard to a directive on food hygiene and standards which has been implemented by legislation here.  In general people are not aware of the impact such EC directives will have until they are enforced.  This difficulty has been experienced in regard to many Oireachtas committees in the past number of years.  Discussions at Oireachtas committees meetings have been of an historical nature and we have not had an opportunity to discuss a policy position before making a decision.  Committee members have not had an opportunity to influence those decisions.  I hope the Foreign Affairs Committee and other new committees will change tack in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure full participation of Ireland's MEPs in the work of both the Foreign Affairs Committee and its sub-committees.  There has been a huge information deficit in regard to the workings of the European Parliament and the contributions of members of that Parliament in regard to Ireland's case in Europe because of the holding of committee meetings during the week rather than at the beginning or towards the end of the week.  I am aware that most of the work of these new committees will take place on Mondays and Fridays, which will facilitate members of the European Parliament, and I will be seeking to ensure that this measure is implemented as soon as possible.  It is unfair also to members of the European Parliament that they do not have a link with the workings of the Oireachtas and directly to the people through this forum.  The committee will also need to secure adequate provision for seating in a public gallery during open committee sessions and to ensure that there will be broadcast coverage facilities for the committee and its sub-committees.  It is important that we get the message to those committees across to the general public through the widest possible coverage.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's priorities in regard to extra-European policy on this committee include a thoroughgoing review of Ireland's Overseas Development Assistance programme, including the possible <Col N="1657" /> linkage of aid with democratisation and respect for human rights in recipient countries.  Irish Government policy on South East Asia, especially in regard to Cambodia and Vietnam, is not well known.  In addition, following the recent visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to Sub-Saharan Africa, could we have a review of the developments in that region, especially the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, with a view to initiating an EC-wide emergency response programme to deal with famine and disaster relief in that region?   We would like to see a review of Ireland's commitment to the Rio Accords on the global environment and the implementation of recommendations for Ireland's compliance with the Rio final text.  Those are important foreign policy areas which we have not had an opportunity to discuss in this House over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>The lack of EC initiative has been brought home to us in regard to the position in Bosnia.  That has demonstrated a type of impotence on the part of the European Community in reacting to political issues, such as those occurring at present in the former Yugoslavia.  I hope negotiations will be possible at the first available opportunity.  The position in the former Yugoslavia should be the first issue on which the Foreign Affairs Committee should make a policy decision, particularly in regard to Bosnia.  I hope the Minister will submit a paper outlining the Government's position on this matter to the Foreign Affairs Committee at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on European affairs and regional development, I will seek to ensure appropriate coverage of European issues by the Oireachtas. With regard to European affairs, my immediate priority will be to ensure that a full scale analysis of our security policy is carried out, especially regarding our role in the common foreign and security policy area, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  I will also be seeking a review of our defence and security policies in preparation for the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  I will also raise the question of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> I should like the committee at the earliest possible opportunity to monitor our national plan for the disbursement of EC Structural Funds.  In accordance with the letter and spirit of the European Commission and Parliament, I am anxious to ensure that control of these funds and the projects which they support is exercised by local democratic institutions and not, as is at present the case, by civil servants in the Department of Finance and appointed boards of one sort or another. I am concerned that the Government has not yet articulated any strategic position in the event of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Danish referendum on 18 May.  It is imperative that we know the Government's position in the event of such an unfortunate result and are in a position to deal with it.  Irish national interests are badly served by a Government who does not know or is unwilling to tell the public what it intends to do.  I hope that the Foreign Affairs Committee will redress that information imbalance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on the major issues which should be looked at by the committee.  The biggest issue is the shape of the new European treaty which will have to be drafted after 1996.  One of the great deficiencies in the Maastricht Treaty is that it is essentially an administrative treaty; it is not a treaty which sets out fundamental rights of states, local authorities or European citizens; it is very much French-style administrative constitution building rather than fundamental rights style constitution building of the kind which exists in this country and the United States.  If we are to influence the type of constitution building in Europe post-1996, we need a fundamental debate on whether we should have a new type of European constitution.  There is no James Madison or Andrew Hamilton, great constitutional theorists, to advise the European electorate on the sort of constitution they should have; we have had a bureaucrat's treaty up to now and I hope the committee will be able to initiate a debate on the sort of treaty we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> It is very important that the new treaty addresses the issue of the democratic deficit in Europe, which is extremely serious.  If we are to have economic and monetary union, this means that financial and taxation policies and the level of borrowing for each member state will be determined in Europe, not in the member states.  It is unacceptable that this should be done by an unelected Commission. We need some form of European Government which is democratically accountable.  This must be provided for in the new treaty.  The issue of the democratic deficit in Europe will be at the very centre of the work of this committee.</P>
    <P>We will also have to look at the real choices which have to be made and on which the Government has not, to date, taken a view.  For example, if Britain cannot join economic and monetary union, is it possible for Ireland to join without it?  Given the level of our trade with Britain and that it is the only English speaking market near us, is it possible for us to be inside while their currency is outside, going up and down and disrupting normal trade flows?  This issue must be examined seriously, it has not been properly thought through, as the recent currency crisis showed all too clearly.</P>
    <P>We also must look at the legal basis for peace enforcement.  The CSCE, the body we are told is available for ensuring security in Europe, does not have an enforcement role.  The European Community and NATO do not have an enforcement role and the same applies for the United Nations unless its military Articles are brought into effect.  If we are to have European union there must be a means of peace enforcement as well as simply talking about it.  This must have a constitutional and democratically accountable basis.  If, because we find it embarrassing to talk about these issues, we fail to put a democratically accountable system of European defence into force we will have a system of European defence willy-nilly at the behest of other states which will not be democratically <Col N="1660" /> accountable, which will affect us in the decisions it makes and in which we will not have a say.  This is not an issue which can be postponed indefinitely.  I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has been willing to raise the issue of peace enforcement and I hope in his reply to this debate he will clearly state whether the Government will amend the defence Acts to allow Ireland to take part in peace enforcement under the aegis of the UN.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe should be taken into account in the work of this committee and that its members should be entitled to attend the committee.  The Council of Europe is now the only body representing all Europe on which Ireland is democratically a participant.  The UN Commission on Europe is not a democratic body.  The EC represents Western Europe only and is not likely to represent Eastern Europe until well into the next century.  The only democratic body with a treaty base which represents Europe, East as well as West, is the Council of Europe.  It is essential that the role of that body is enhanced.  Qualified majority voting should be allowed in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe so that it can make some decisions.  As long as we rely on unanimity in the Council of Europe, it will be possible for Liechtenstein to hold up the other 40 states in Europe from doing something, if that is what it decides to do.  Therefore, it is important to have some system of qualified majority voting in the Council of Europe to enable it to do its business.</P>
    <P>It is also important to stress that the only body which has a mandate in Europe as far as human rights is concerned is the Council of Europe.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs rightly referred to the role of this committee in regard to human rights.  The issue of human rights is not a European Community responsibility, it is a Council of Europe responsibility.  Therefore, it is important that the Council of Europe is <Col N="1661" /> involved in this committee.  This is another reason I put down my amendment.</P>
    <P>In the concluding part of his speech the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the need to build consensus on foreign policy.  I am all for consensus but not too much.  It is important that there is argument and difference of opinion about this issue.  We should not take the view, because people on this side of the House, or even the Government side of the House, differ from the Government on an issue of foreign policy that this is somehow inappropriate. There has to be lively argument, and I know there will be.  In regard to Northern Ireland, it is very important that we do not take a tribal view, that we feel we have to speak for our tribe.  As far as I am concerned, the issue of Northern Ireland is one in which both communities are of equal concern to us.  I am not suggesting that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has said any of those things; I am simply stating my view on these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to a few other issues which will be of particular importance to the committee.  I believe emigration will become the major issue in the early part of the next century. It will not be possible for Western Europe to simultaneously keep East European goods and people out of Western Europe.  We will have to let their goods or people in; we cannot keep both out, otherwise Eastern Europe will collapse. If we restrict emigration, very serious human rights issues will arise and if we restrict trade, quite serious human rights issues will arise.  It is very important to recognise that Ireland will be one of the biggest losers from any opening-up of either trade or emigration from Eastern Europe.  This issue cannot be dodged as it will cause a major problem for Ireland. Therefore, we need to have a considered position on it.  The East European countries will revert to Fascism or authoritarianism of some kind if they are not allowed to trade freely with Western <Col N="1662" /> Europe within a foreseeable time frame. But that is a matter with which the Minister for Tourism and Trade is concerned.</P>
      <P>Equally we have the issue of global indebtedness, a matter in which, through the International Monetary Fund, the Minister for Finance is involved.  As far as immigration is concerned, that is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  The Rio de Janeiro accords are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  It is most important that other Ministers, apart from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should be capable of coming before this committee to explain how their policy impacts on foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The first amendment I want to move concerns the reporting of the procedures of this committee.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (5) after &ldquo;House&rdquo;, to add the following:</P>
      <P>and in order to ensure that the Report Stage debate is a fully informed one, both Houses will make arrangements for the full computerisation and timely indexation of the report of the Committee's proceedings&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am availing of this opportunity to raise a matter of considerable importance in regard to the reporting of this House generally.  The system of reporting the proceedings of the House is a disgrace. The latest indexed report available is for as far back as 1985, producing indexes of things that are said in this House. Obviously, the index is the most important element of any report in that it enables one to find a particular debate in which one is interested.  Producing an index of the Official Report of this House seven years late is a waste of paper.  In my view we should be producing the Official Report and an index to it within a month of debates taking place.  That can be done if the reporting is computerised.  I believe that savings in printing of up to 40 per cent could be made if the reporting of this House were computerised.  At present people take down what takes place here; they go and dictate it to another person <Col N="1663" /> who types it, not into a computer but onto a typewriter; it is sent out to the printer in typed-up form, who then has to convert that into some form of print. There are three operations whereas, if one used desk-top publishing, one could have one operation only, one person taking the report, typing it in a form that can be printed.  Huge savings could be made in this manner.  We could have prompt reports and have reports indexed.  If we had indexed reports the Official Report of the proceedings of this House would be of much greater interest to people outside because they would have easy access thereto.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I have moved my amendment which would require, at least in so far as the Joint Foreign Affairs Committee is concerned, that the reports of its work would be produced in a computerised and timely fashion.</P>
    <P>If the House itself does not take a stand on this issue, in terms of the way its business is reported, we will continue with the present unsatisfactory position. I hope the Tánaiste will accept this amendment and, in so doing, give a signal that that should be the practice in regard to other committees and proceedings of this House.  Equally I am hoping he will be willing to accept my second amendment which states:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (17), to insert &ldquo;and Members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&rdquo; after &ldquo;(including Northern Ireland)&rdquo; and after &ldquo;European Parliament&rdquo; where it thirdly occurs.</P>
    <P>It seeks to add to Members of the European Parliament Members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe as persons who would be entitled to attend the committee from time to time when matters arise which are of relevance to their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the two previous speakers in welcoming the timely establishment of a Joint Foreign Affairs Committee.  It is something of a mystery <Col N="1664" /> to me how this House has functioned for so long without a committee in the foreign affairs area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes made in the terms of reference of this committee since the time it was first adumbrated in this Dáil session.  An earlier proposal that the committee be debarred from discussing matters on which Ireland was adopting a current international negotiating position was in my view untenable and made a bit of a nonsense of the committee.  I am glad to note that that stipulation disappeared at an early age.</P>
      <P>I am also glad the Tánaiste has seen fit to get Government agreement to the proposal that there should be liberty for the committee to discuss policy matters on Northern Ireland otherwise than in private.  In relation to the security issue, I take on board the points the Tánaiste made as to circumstances arising in which security matters could not be properly discussed in public.  Equally I make the point that, in Northern Ireland in particular, there is a very thin dividing line between policy and security.  I might mention one historical issue which has arisen from time to time &mdash; the &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policy that has been alleged to exist on occasions &mdash; and which obviously has security and policy dimensions to it.  All I will say in regard to privacy in relation to security matters is that it should be kept to the minimum, that a liberal view should be taken of the interplay and overlap between policy and security matters. I do not think that would in any way prejudice anybody's or the State's interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>This committee could transform the debate on foreign policy matters very dramatically.  The very fact that there is a group of people, even comprised of 25 Members of Dáil Éireann and five Members of Seanad Éireann, who have a special duty imposed on them by these Houses to be aware of foreign policy dimensions of what happens in Irish politics, and indeed in international politics, is itself a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste speaks in terms of developing an expertise and knowledge on which to base the affairs of the committee. <Col N="1665" /> I agree with what he said in relation thereto.  He could go somewhat further at this stage.  I suggest that the time has arrived for some university in Ireland to be the location for an institute of international affairs.  It could be done at very little cost; doubtless there is the academic expertise in our various universities to operate such an institute. Apart from having politicians speaking on international affairs, there should be a corpus of academic and research activity going on.  The absence of such an institution anywhere in Ireland, of which I am aware at any rate, holds back discussion of international affairs.  Of course, there is an Institute of European Affairs very active in one facet of our international affairs.  There is room for another institution, perhaps in one of our new or older universities, which could do for Irish international affairs debate what, for instance, the legal body based in Trinity College &mdash; founded in large measure on the initiative of our President &mdash; has done for discussion in the field of European law.</P>
    <P>I take on board also what the Tánaiste has said about this committee being one which will not be simply an outward-looking body but also be an institution in which, on occasion, we actually hold up the mirror to ourselves.  In that context it occurs to me that we have a habit in Ireland of being extremely smug in relation to preaching international standards, especially in relation to human rights issues, while not conforming to those standards ourselves.  In that context three issues occur to me where Irish law and practice is very deficient indeed.  One is in our treatment of aliens, on which our law is entirely antiquated and arbitrary in its nature, quite apart from its implementation. The second issue is in relation to our treatment of people claiming refugee status in this jurisdiction.  The third is an area in which we are happy to preach to others standards we do not apply ourselves. For example, we sent observers to inquests in Gibraltar.  We give out about rules in Northern Ireland relating to inquests but have here one of the most under-developed inquest systems which <Col N="1666" /> suffers from very grave infirmities.  When we preach to others standards of accountability and human rights we should hold up the mirror to ourselves.  The institution of a Joint Foreign Affairs committee will play a valuable role in doing that.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the opportunity to discuss the European and security aspects of Irish foreign policy in circumstances which are not adversarial and on which people do not confine themselves simply to making unilateral statements of view but must contend with the views of others.  It occurs to me on occasion, especially in relation to the neutrality issue, that we have never really addressed the substance of Ireland's historical policy on neutrality.  I am always struck, on reading accounts of Irish politics in the thirties, forties and fifties, by the extent to which Irish neutrality policy was not cast in the moral terms it is today. Countless Irish people today speak in terms of neutrality as though it were handed down forever with the 1916 Proclamation. If one looks at the extent to which during the Second World War and in the immediate aftermath statesmen such as de Valera and MacBride were willing to contemplate exchanging our overtly neutral position for other political considerations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one will find that the issue of neutrality is slightly more complex than is ever admitted.  In the context of the debate on neutrality, what influence does Ireland propose to exert on processes such as peace-making operations, given, as has been pointed out in the House, that our own laws prevent us from taking part in operations other than policing operations whereby the armed element supplied by Ireland carries out a gendarme role?  It seems &mdash; the Tánaiste hinted at this &mdash; that we must amend the Defence Act, 1954, and the subsequent amendments made in the early sixties to permit Ireland to participate fully in peace-making operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste dealt with the capacity of this committee to deal with the secondary <Col N="1667" /> legislation of the European Communities. I agree with him when he says that the numbers involved in the committee should permit a sub-committee to be established to fulfil a function in that respect.  I made the point in the past that I do not see the reason the matters to which Deputy Hogan referred, matters such as food standards, fall to be considered by a committee established to deal with foreign affairs.  While I accept the Tánaiste's analysis that the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities should be unified in one committee, I do not see the reason that technical matters, even if they are being imposed on us under our EC Treaty obligations, should carry some special badge whereby they can be investigated only by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Foreign Affairs being established under this motion will require from its members a considerable degree of commitment.  In giving them nominal control over the secondary legislation of the European Communities we are asking them to do too much.  We have fallen down in our duty to examine carefully European regulations made by the Government.  It is strange that we are speaking in a context where the mechanism has been struck down by a judge of the High Court.  The State has appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.  This House has a lot to make up for in terms of its role under the impugned legislation which is to be decided upon by the Supreme Court.  I welcome the fact that we are to have a prospective role in examining draft directives and regulations, because there is no point in examining regulations made under EC legislation as a matter of history.  It is about time this House put a mechanism in place to allow Members make some input at a time it might have some effect.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European Community, Deputy Bruton was correct when he said that the political debate in Ireland must now focus on the post-Maastricht <Col N="1668" /> Treaty arrangements that will emerge.  I listened to what he had to say about the emergence of a European government and accept what he had to say about the democratic deficit, but I have not yet heard any view clearly articulated on a set of institutions which might be appropriate in a further phase of development of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we do not have people who will write federalist papers for us, but we need a stronger debate on the emerging Europe, on whether federation and confederation mean different things and the extent to which when we use one term we mean the other.  I do not believe the member states of the European Community have an appetite for the establishment of a single executive along American lines to govern Europe in the future; but on the other hand I accept completely what Deputy Bruton had to say: that if we are to have European security forces which could engage in peace-making and peace-keeping operations on a European basis, they would have to be accountable to somebody.  I do not see to which institution they could be held accountable.</P>
    <P>Ireland has now observer status at the Western European Union.  While the Western European Union and NATO may not be the institutions at which European security policy in the future will be decided, Ireland must square up to its responsibility to take part fully in whatever security arrangements are made in parallel with those institutions to make some sense from an Irish perspective of decisions which are, effectively, made in our name and which effect our vital interests in a fundamental way.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to look at the constitutional role of the Council of Europe to establish a mechanism to uphold basic human rights.  The time has also come for Ireland to see whether it supports the idea of integrating those human rights in a constitution which reflects our European Community identify. This committee should hold such a debate.</P>
    <P>A multiplicity of views will be expressed from time to time at the Committee <Col N="1669" /> on Foreign Affairs.  However, I hope people will not participate on the basis of a quick fix sound by participation or look for an opportunity to posture on the latest atrocity or exhibit populist interest on individual issues.  We are great at seeing in foreign fields what we consider to be departures from human rights. For instance, many people in Ireland have concentrated attention on Central America, South Africa, South-East Asia and so on, but it is most important that the members of this committee should look on it as providing them with an opportunity to approach international affairs with a degree of uniformity and consistency.  This may mean that it will be less exciting from the point of view of the media but it will be more constructive from a national point of view.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that some people think they are detached from foreign affairs, but they are fundamentally mistaken. Foreign affairs are not detached from ordinary people's lives in Ireland any more.  The European Community is a clear example; and what happens in the Middle East and Yugoslavia will have a direct repercussion on our way of life, depending on what attitude we and our fellow member states adopt.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Foreign Affairs also has a role to play in relation to the United Nations.  It is about time that an annual report was submitted to this House on what Ireland has done in the United Nations and on what the United Nations has done on issues which affect Ireland.  In the past we regarded our membership of the United Nations as something we read about in the newspapers, but a change is required.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that the Department of Foreign Affairs and the two Ministers will be enthusiastic supporters of this committee.  I hope this will be the case because in the past there was a notion that foreign affairs were properly a matter for the professionals and that politicians, by definition, were transient amateurs who only got in the way in conducting Irish foreign policy.  The original suggestion that the committee should not be entitled to consider matters on <Col N="1670" /> which Ireland was adopting a negotiation position at an international level reflected that attitude.  I am glad to see that has evaporated and I take it on trust from the Tánaiste that a wholly different approach will characterise the formation and development of this committee.</P>
    <P>We as Members of a Parliament have shortchanged ourselves very badly.  We are unduly bound up with the Executive of the day and its affairs.  We are completely dominated by the requirements of the Executive and we are not &mdash; by comparison with other parliaments &mdash; an institution that has established and vindicated its own separate and independent existence.  I know we are not a congress on the American model and that parliamentary government requires an interplay between the executive and representative organs of government, but I believe that in this jurisdiction we have established a most unhealthy relationship between Parliament and the Executive. Parliament is totally dominated by the Executive even though its votes apply to it and it is denied resources for research which are appropriate to a proper, mature and hardworking parliament. Parliament acquiesces in being kept in what I would call a condition of almost permanent political pin down by the Executive in circumstances where that is wholly inappropriate.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to adequate resources to discharge our functions.  We are not obliged to accept that as being in the gift of the Department of Finance or of the Government of the day.  This Joint Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as all the other committees, is entitled as of right to resources that are substantial enough to make it work effectively.  The Executive, and in particular the public service which works under the Executive and is accountable to it, owes it to Parliament to give greater resources to the parliamentary process to make it independent of the Executive to a greater degree than obtains at present.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to ministerial accountability.  In West-minister if something goes wrong in the field of foreign, defence, transport or <Col N="1671" /> economic policy, Ministers are called before a committee of the Westminster Parliament to explain what has happened. In this jurisdiction that does not happen.  As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said we have a regime of parliamentary questions which is overly adversarial and is most uninformative.  It has been pointed out on another occasion by a tribunal that is sitting at the instance of this House that if there had been an adequate committee system and Ministers had been adequately forthcoming in the parliamentary process, there would not have been all this time, money and resources wasted on that institution.  The reason given to Deputy O'Malley by the Taoiseach for not making Ministers accountable to the committees this Dáil is about to appoint is that they are accountable to the Dáil as a whole and therefore not accountable to any committee of the Dáil.  This is paper thin and is obviously not based on a very good constitutional analysis.  Ministers already attend in the Seanad for questions. If they can answer questions in the Seanad, for which there is no constitutional provision, there is no reason that they should not on occasion answer questions before a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>When this Government took up office I made it clear that in areas where I disagreed with it I would relentlessly oppose it but I would support any matter that came before the House which I felt was a progressive development. I therefore have no qualms whatever in welcoming the proposal before us and congratulating the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, for bringing forward a proposal <Col N="1672" /> to establish a Joint Foreign Affairs Committee and for agreeing to some of the changes which those of us in Opposition sought to have implemented.</P>
      <P>Clearly the committee does not give those in the Opposition parties everything we were looking for but nevertheless I believe it is a good day for this Dáil that we are proceeding to establish a Joint Foreign Affairs Committee.  This is important for a variety of reasons. Clearly it is important that this House has the opportunity to address issues relating to international relationships in greater depth than it has traditionally dealt with them.  For the ten or 11 years I have been a Member of this House, foreign affairs have been dealt with in a very superficial way.  We have occasional statements made in this House when a crisis of some kind or other arises and we have restricted debates on the Estimates from time to time when we all get up and make set piece contributions.  We in the Opposition will challenge the Government position and the Government will respond.  The various parties on the Opposition benches will make individual points but there is rarely an opportunity for us to challenge each other's positions in any real way.  I believe the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will present that opportunity and I have no doubt that on some issues at least there will not be divisions by party.  We will probably have a much more real discussion and expression of views on the best ways forward on any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House is changing and how we conduct our business is changing fundamentally. That is inevitable if we are to come to terms with the modern world that exists outside this House.  Power in Irish society is not located in any one place and it is certainly not located in this House during the course of a debate. Certainly the Executive of the day has power and has control in certain areas and can set down its policy.  One of the most important developments in recent years was the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which was not negotiated in this House but by Government with the trade union and employer <Col N="1673" /> representatives.  We debated it after the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so did the Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we had an input at that level.  This House has to reform itself if it is not only to be seen to be relevant but to act effectively.  That is one reason I welcome the opportunity to participate in this committee.</P>
      <P>The committee will have a very heavy agenda.  Almost immediately there are issues that need to be debated urgently, and I propose to deal with a number of these in the course of my contribution. An important general point is that the committee will not be effective if it does not have the resources to deal with the job.  When I talk about resources for the committee I am also talking about the need for resources for Deputies to do their job.  I am not suggesting for a minute that there should be an open purse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;into which we can dip to claim expenses, but Deputies, particularly backbench Deputies and those in smaller parties, do not have resources for research or to produce documentation to support a position presented at a committee.  For example, in regard to the Employment Committee which met last year the making of an allocation to parties who participated to pursue areas of research was a worthwhile innovation.  Perhaps such an allocation will be considered for all committees.  I appreciate there is not an endless supply of cash but if genuine indepth discussion and consideration of issues is to take place those participating must be facilitated to present the best possible case.  I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs seriously to consider making available resources, perhaps not to individual Deputies or parties but for a research agency, which would be available to Deputies.  The Library of this House does its best to provide as much assistance as possible to Deputies but it <Col N="1674" /> is grossly inadequate for the job required of committees, only one of which we are discussing today.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the Foreign Affairs Committee is almost written by the current state of events in the world and, indeed, in Ireland.  Deputy Shatter mentioned Bosnia and the need for the committee urgently to address that issue.  The former Yugoslavia presents us all with a degree of concern and indeed confusion as to what precisely can be done.  When discussing the appointment of observers to Yugoslavia about 12 months ago I made the point that those demanding the break up of Yugoslavia might rue the day because of the forces that would be unleashed.  Unfortunately, that prediction has come to pass.  A myriad of factions and groups with religious, nationalist and ethnic labels has emerged in former Yugoslavia and the demands and counter demands being made for territory will not be easily resolved.  I have no magic solution, nor I am sure has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the European Community.  It could be simple to produce a scheme which on paper might work, but we all know from experience in Ireland that passions are released when national claims and counter claims are top of the agenda.</P>
      <P>I am not claiming to have a solution to the problem.  However, I caution against any escalation of military intervention by the United Nations.  I am not saying this approach may not eventually be necessary but it is a step which should be taken only as a very last resort.  We must try to ensure that the current sanctions &mdash; the earlier round of sanctions were half-heartedly implemented for a variety of reasons &mdash; will have some effect in deescalating the violence and the urge towards grabbing territory in that unfortunate land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not sit back and assume that is the only problem that exists in this regard.  There is potential throughout eastern Europe for similar problems. Unless the United Nations addresses the question of intervening at this point before the position in other areas descends to that in former Yugoslavia, <Col N="1675" /> unless it considers ways in which rights can be guaranteed to minorities, whether it would be advisable that UN forces move into areas where there is likely to be conflict in the future and try to mediate peaceful solutions, Europe generally will enter a period of severe crisis.  In these circumstances the Maastricht Treaty with all its supposed benefits will be of little use; it will be just hot air.</P>
    <P>It is important that we consider the operation of the United Nations and the contribution Ireland can make in proposing reform of the United Nations. This is an agency which is still by and large based on Cold War thinking and Cold War politics.  The Security Council clearly needs to be reformed.  I fear that to a significant extent that matter is being ignored, and that is not good enough.  If we are to have an effective body that is concerned about the resolution of conflicts between states and even between conflicting ethnic minorities within states, the United Nations needs to be reformed.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the question of Irish neutrality.  On a number of occasions in this House I made a point in relation to Irish neutrality which is not in accordance with the traditional view held by some parties.  I have long stated that traditional Irish neutrality is no longer a valid concept and that we will have to consider ways, particularly within the EC, as to how we can contribute to the development of a common security approach, based on disarmament in the first instance, certainly nuclear disarmament, on a peaceful reconciliation of differences and on ensuring that the people of Europe have a say in the development of Europe.  These are major issues which I do not have time to deal with in detail now.  I attempted during the Maastricht debate to present a position on that matter, which was to some extent distorted and misrepresented, but that is normal in referenda campaigns.  The Foreign Affairs Committee has a very significant role to play in defining precisely what our position is in the world and how we relate to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> I want to deal briefly with the question of Northern Ireland, a key issue with which this committee will have to deal.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of our proposal that at least the political aspects of Northern Ireland will not be dealt with behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>I can understand reservations about security but I do not fully accept the argument.  The question of security in Northern Ireland, in so far as it relates to day-to-day operations and operational matters, clearly entails risks but there is a need for us to openly debate the whole question of security and attitudes to the security forces, which is primarily a political concern.  There are still parties in Northern Ireland who refuse to accept the legitimcy of the RUC as a police force in Northern Ireland, I am not referring to Sinn Féin.  This is a question which we must consider dispassionately and we should not be afraid to acknowledge that we have to drop a lot of our traditional views on security.</P>
    <P>In the recent debate on Northern Ireland in this House I made the point that if we are to seriously address the question of peace on this island, we must drop the pretence that it is either feasible or desirable to seek to eliminate the political border.  That was a very deliberately crafted statement.  I am not pretending to be trying to eliminate the division between the people on this island, I am talking about a political border and the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  I agree with the Taoiseach that Articles 2 and 3 are not a formula for peace, but they represent a particular view of Northern Ireland and the relationship between this State, Northern Ireland and Britain which must be addressed.  It is based on the pretence that we have a right to impose our sovereignty on Northern Ireland and its people.</P>
    <P>What is most regrettable and what concerns me particularly about the current meetings between John Hume and Gerry Adams is that they stated they are seeking to establish an overall political strategy for Ireland.  Given the position of the Provos, that is an extraordinary <Col N="1677" /> statement.  It is a refusal, a failure to recognise the reality of the division between the people on this island and the need for compromise on national positions.</P>
    <P>We all want peace.  I am concerned that we are increasingly linking peace to words like &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; and &ldquo;with justice&rdquo;.  We all want peace with justice which will last but if I could get peace tomorrow without a guarantee that it will be sustainable or with justice I would take it.  I want peace.  When we have peace we can proceed, politically and democratically, to reduce the fears that exist on all sides in Northern Ireland, and realisticly discuss the claims and counter claims about how we can live together, how both economies can be developed and how the poor on both sides of the island can be lifted from poverty.  I appeal to people not to fall into the trap of saying that we do not want peace unless it is peace with justice and sustainable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government for introducing this motion.  In doing so the Taoiseach is implementing a commitment of his last Government to change and reform Dáil procedure.  As the Tánaiste suggested, a revamped committee system is essential to the efficiency and answerability of the Oireachtas.  It is important that in all areas of public policy, not only should the detail be examined, but also the premise that underlies and informs policy direction. This is the only sensible way in which the Oireachtas can legislate in a complete, informed and responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the proposal before the House, a Foreign Affairs Committee will enable the Oireachtas to establish and maintain a formal contact not only with the Civil Service, in this case, with the Department of Foreign Affairs, but also with those usually referred to as &ldquo;interested parties&rdquo;: those involved in Third World development, famine relief, neutrality and disarmament, emigrant welfare and assistance and so forth.  Such people, and the agencies whom they represent, <Col N="1678" /> are far more than &ldquo;interested parties&rdquo; to Irish foreign policy.  They are very involved in the presentation and projection of Ireland overseas.  One need only consider the trips made by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, alone and with the President, and the trips made recently by the junior Minister, Deputy Tom Kitt, to Somalia and other places in Africa, to realise how huge problems have been highlighted throughout the world.  I am sure the agencies who invited and encouraged them to go derived great support from those visits and they have gone a long way towards strengthening their role on the ground.  I hope the proposed committee will call on their experience and observations, especially to highlight the human dimension of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that in recent years Ireland has not developed the distinctive role within the United Nations charted by Frank Aiken, Freddie Boland and others.  Instead, we have embraced EPC as if this was inconsistent with expanding our role at the UN.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  Indeed, given Ireland's traditional involvement in both the UN and the Third World, as well as our policy of military neutrality, such a balance between the UN and EPC is vital if Ireland is to avoid being perceived as simply a seat at the table.</P>
    <P>However, over the past 20 years or so, we have moved from the UN, and the particular emphasis that this gave to our foreign policy.  As Deputy De Rossa said, perhaps it is not our fault we have changed.  Perhaps the UN, as he said, needs to be reformed.  That issue can be raised at the committee.</P>
    <P>One need only examine parliamentary replies to realise that our views on foreign policy issues often seem to be smothered by countries with an imperial past or a strong defence agenda.  At times one is hard put to understand Ireland's position. The challenge this committee faces is the need to make informed decisions on world issues.  As Deputy McDowell said, we have all been guilty of speaking without full information on popular issues throughout the world.  The real <Col N="1679" /> challenge of the committee is to make sure that when we issue statements on events we should do so from a properly informed position.</P>
    <P>In terms of their language and focus parliamentary replies often seem to be more concerned with Europe's political and strategic positions in international affairs than revealing how Ireland's unique role at the UN or in disarmament has qualified those positions, or heightened their human dimensions, as one would expect Ireland to do.  For example, where was Ireland's qualification when Germany recognised Croatia, with all the implications this had for splitting up Yugoslavia?  Why has it taken Ireland so long to speak out on the Bosnian atrocities when, on this issue above all else in recent years, we should have been giving a lead, not following the herd, and indulging the strategic interests of other Community countries?</P>
    <P>The answer lies in the fascination that we have developed with EPC over the last number of years, to the exclusion of everyting else.  Speaking out on Bosnia early and often is not inconsistent with being a &ldquo;good European&rdquo;, about which we sometimes appear to have a hang-up. Indeed, speaking out on human rights issues whether in Bosnia, Tibet, Kampuchea or East Timor, to name but four areas of such concern, is as important for the Ireland of today as pushing for the dismantling of apartheid in Frank Aiken's heyday.</P>

Would he accept that is not in our interest, if we are serious about tackling crime, to be the exception?

Whitaker, which reported in 1985 dealt with this matter and made a specific recommendation that there should be a criminal law review committee to keep our criminal law up to date?  Is the Taoiseach aware that, at the time, that report was accepted in principle without any equivocation? Is the Taoiseach also aware that in general terms our criminal law is the most unreformed and backward of any western European country?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the Department of Justice, which has retained the function of criminal law reform, has made very slow, painful and inadequate progress in keeping our criminal law up to date?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise that law has not kept pace with public behaviour?  Quite frequently the Garda complain that they are called upon to deal with situations for which there are no offences.  Certain behaviour causes havoc in the community but, because the law has not kept pace, the Garda cannot do anything.  It is necessary to create new offences to enable the Garda to deal with incidences of public behaviour which are causing havoc to the community.  I refer to gatherings of gangs and group behaviour of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that in taking its decisions the Government has full regard to the implications for women in each instance.  This policy is applied by <Col N="1688" /> Ministers and officials at departmental level.  One of the benefits of equality proofing is that it facilitates the development of a sensitisation to women's concerns and perspectives.</P>
    <P>Most day to day decisions are taken within the context of wider Government policy decisions and legislation. Implementation of the formal gender-proofing process is complemented by training courses and guidelines for forms of address and delivery of services to the public, all of which contribute towards a culture of equality in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us examples of exercises in gender-proofing in the various Departments since he took office?.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any specific examples.  The Government introduced gender-proofing earlier in the year and decisions are taking place routinely.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to have a formal equality proofing procedure for all day to day decisions.  On the wider policy decisions the Government has issued certain directives.  There will be a trickled down effect from that.  Major policy decisions are gender-proofed at Cabinet level by me, and all Ministers give an assessment of gender impact of policy and legislation matters when they are submitted to Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What overview does the Minister take of Government Departments to ensure that gender-proofing is carried out?  What steps have been put in place in, for example, the Leader programme to ensure that there is gender-proofing there and women are dealt with from a position of equality in the context of their involvement in that programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is primarily the responsibility of each Minister to ensure that equality applies down the line on the routine decisions that take place in his Department.  The Government's responsibility in the matter, which it has carried out, is to require gender-proofing <Col N="1689" /> to take place on broad policy matters and on legislative matters.  That it has done.  It is expected that that will sensitise senior officials in all Departments to have regard to gender-proofing issues and to ensure that it is carried out.  On the broader issues, obviously my Department and I have a particular responsibility to ensure that these matters are monitored and I will take considerable care to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the commitment by the Minister's party to open Government, will he publish the directives issued by his Department that apply to other Departments so that we may ensure gender proofing?  Will he make copies of such directives available to Deputies in the Library?  If the Minister does not have examples of where gender proofing has applied to date and can merely give the House a trickled down account, will he research that matter and inform Members of the instances in which gender proofing has in practice applied, as opposed to its being a matter of theoretical commitment in a Government programme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering an earlier question on this topic, I referred to the <Col N="1691" /><i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> which provided that the present scheme of civil legal aid and advice will be placed on a statutory footing and additional funding provided to facilitate an expansion of the scheme. The programme also undertakes to examine the possibility of extending legal aid to tribunals.  It is my intention that these commitments will be honoured.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the demand for services under the scheme far exceeds its capacity in terms of meeting the demands which are placed upon it and I am concerned to ensure that, within the constraints imposed by current budgetary circumstances, the scheme will be developed to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The present scheme endeavours to ensure that priority is given to the most pressing cases, for example, child abduction, child care and cases involving domestic violence.  However, in some areas, it is not possible to provide a priority service for all applicants who fall within these categories.</P>
      <P>One consequence of the priority system is that it leads to long waiting lists for all other applicants.  The current waiting times for an initial appointment with solicitors in relation to applications that are not given priority are as follows: Clondalkin (from Aston House), five months; Finglas, seven months; Gardiner Street, 12 months; Ormond Quay, five months; Tallaght, 12 months; Athlone, 12 months; Castlebar, six months; Cork North, nine months; Cork South, eight months; Dundalk, three months; Galway, three months; Letterkenny, nine months; Limerick, eight months; Sligo, six months; Tralee, three months; and Waterford, six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the report contained in the January/March 1993 edition of <i>FLAC News</i> that expenditure on civil legal aid in Ireland is significantly lower than the corresponding figures of expenditure in certain other European countries.  I am also aware of the study by the free legal advice centres on which that report was based.  While not wishing to appear to be attempting to justify the <i>status quo</i> or to <Col N="1692" /> suggest that the levels of expenditure on civil legal aid in Ireland are in any respect satisfactory, it is relevant to the comparison that the legal aid systems in those countries selected by FLAC for comparison purposes have been in existence in some form or other for much longer than our own.  According to the study, the French system has its origins in a scheme which was introduced as far back as 1851, while the Northern Ireland scheme, which is of much more recent origin, commenced in 1965.  On the other hand, the first law centres in this State did not open their doors to the public until August, 1980.  It was unfortunate that shortly afterwards, in response to a difficult budgetary situation, constraints on public expenditure were introduced which have continued in some form or other up to this day.  These constraints, which were of general application, severely hampered the development of the fledgling legal aid scheme.  Because of this the service has not expanded as speedily as was originally intended, or as we would wish.  I have made the provision of additional funding to facilitate the expansion of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice a priority.</P>
    <P>For 1993, the board's allocation is not sufficient to allow for the recruitment of additional solicitors or for the opening of new law centres.  However, I have succeeded in having the original allocation for 1993 increased by £100,000.  It is my intention that these additional funds will be used in order to reduce the length of the waiting lists at the various law centres by availing of the services of private solicitors.  I am conscious that this is only a small beginning but, as I have said on a previous occasion, I will continue to devote my best endeavours to achieve a significant and lasting improvement in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has its full complement of 12 members and a chairperson, whose terms of office are due to expire in 1995.  It is a cause of regret to me that none of those serving is a woman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the information he has read out to <Col N="1693" /> the House is an appalling indictment of the legal aid service?  Will he agree that the waiting lists are now worse than at any time since the service was established and have substantially deteriorated since this Government was formed?  Will the Minister indicate the areas within which there is not even a priority service, which results in women who are the victims of violence being abandoned by the Government's legal aid system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the level of service does not meet present requirements. I have given a commitment to try to secure substantial improvements in the service in accordance with the budgetary constraints that may arise from time to time.  The Legal Aid Board services priority and emergency cases and I have no information to the effect that that emergency status is not available in any of the special emergency categories.  I have had meetings with members of the Legal Aid Board and the Law Society and I will be meeting members of the Bar Council in the near future.  I have a number of proposals which I will be putting forward with a view to getting better value for the money expended.  However, we must have regard to budgetary constraints and £3 million, approximately, is being spent on the civil legal aid service at present.  That is not adequate to meet the present needs, but I have given a commitment to put the scheme on a statutory basis and to secure substantial improvements.</P>

Will he agree that it is outrageous that within his own constituency there is a year long waiting list in the Tallaght centre?  Will the Minister indicate how and when he intends to spend the £100,000 which he has secured for use by <Col N="1694" /> private solicitors in providing legal aid? Will he indicate also when legislation will be introduced in that regard?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the majority of those who seek this service are women and that it is unacceptable that there is not one woman member on the Legal Aid Board?  Will he agree that as this is not a statutory service and that as the numbers on the board and its members are determined by his Department there is nothing preventing him from appointing a number of women to the board until such time as it completes its term in 1995?  That would be a real example of gender proofing.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy rightly said, it would be open to me to increase the numbers on the board and to appoint women to it, I am considering that matter.  The problem is that this would reduce the very limited and all too restricted fund available to the Legal Aid Board to provide and deliver the services.  If more money was expended on members of the board there would be proportionately less money available to expend on the delivery of the legal services, the important part of the operation. Nonetheless, I can tell the Deputy and the House that when we reach the position where the scheme is put on a statutory basis&mdash;as far as I am concerned this will be as soon as possible &mdash; the present board will cease to be in office and a completely new board will be appointed on a statutory basis.  I assure the Deputy and the House that when that point is reached the new board appointed by me will fully meet the gender criteria already agreed by the Government in respect of all State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I complained about the lack of resources and the waiting times for civil legal aid, not only when Pádraig Flynn was Minister for Justice but also when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were in power together and Fianna Fáil was in <Col N="1695" /> Government with the Progressive Democrats. The resources are inadequate, and that has been the position since the service was set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24, 27, 37, 41, 45, 98 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have been entrusted with responsibility for articulating and co-ordinating the implementation of Government policy in relation to travellers.  My Department will not be involved in the provision of services directly to travellers, it will be responsible for planning and co-ordinating the work of the other Departments, local authorities and State agencies in providing services to travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the programme, I propose to set up a task force, which will be chaired by a member of the Oireachtas, <Col N="1697" /> to monitor implementation of measures in favour of travellers.  The task force can help to ensure that a fair share of the burden of providing halting sites is undertaken by local authorities and also within each local authority area.  It will also ensure that appropriate, co-ordinated planning is undertaken in relation to Government aims generally.</P>
    <P>With a view to setting up the task force, I have had preliminary discussions with a number of organisations which comprise and represent travellers.  Discussions have also taken place with statutory bodies which provide services for travellers.</P>
    <P>It is clearly evident that travellers experience many forms of discrimination and encounter many obstacles, especially in terms of access to accommodation, education and certain social services.  It is my intention to address these problems. Towards that end, I am exploring the possibility of bringing forward legislation to prohibit discriminatory treatment of travellers.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it would be naive to expect that the enactment of such legislation would, of itself, remove longstanding social prejudices or change people's attitudes in relation to travellers generally.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the Government can give a lead through legislative measures but much has to be done to break down barriers through non-legislative action. Past experience has shown that this whole issue has to be approached in a sensitive and carefully planned and balanced manner.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to invite the task force to draw up proposals and recommendations in this regard.  Towards this end, I shall provide it with wide terms of reference.  Its membership will comprise travellers, travellers' support groups, elected local councillors and individuals who have experience and expertise in promoting the welfare of travellers.</P>
    <P>I have committed myself to further discussions with relevant interests in drawing up the terms of reference for the task force and selecting its membership.  I hope to be in a position to engage in that <Col N="1698" /> process shortly.  Pending these discussions, it would not be appropriate for me, at this stage, to specify my own proposals, beyond the broad outline which I have given, in relation to the precise terms of reference, composition, structure, role, functions and budget of the proposed task force.  I have noted the proposal from Dublin County Council for a national plan and I will ask the task force to give early consideration to it.</P>
    <P>I have not conducted any investigation into the trading activities of travellers, nor have I received any representations in this regard.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for the regulation of casual trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his role seems to be one of articulating policy and that it is still the responsibility of someone else to implement the decisions?  Does he agree that this is unsatisfactory and that leaving responsibility for this matter with local authorities will solve nothing?  Can he say how the responsibilities and terms of reference of the task force will differ from the terms of reference given to the Travelling People Review Body set up in 1981 by the then Government who reported in 1983?  What has changed in the meantime to require a new task force?  Is it intended to set up the task force on a statutory basis?  Will the Minister confirm that the references in the Programme for Government to the task force having responsibility for monitoring and pursuing the implementation of Government policy will be put into effect?  If that is the case, what exactly will he be doing while the task force is implementing Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that the task force will be set up on a non-statutory basis, at least initially.  If it is found necessary to have it put on a statutory basis at a later stage that could certainly be considered.  I cannot say yet in what respect the terms of reference of the task force will differ from those of the review body as they have not yet been determined. The terms of reference will be <Col N="1699" /> wide-ranging and the task force will be given the necessary powers to examine the situation in the broadest possible way, to make recommendations and to monitor, with me and my Department, the implementation of those policies.  The task force will have very important functions and will be given the necessary back-up including a budget, as provided for in the Programme for Government. It will make recommendations and act as a monitoring body to ensure the implementation of those recommendations and that the interests and needs of travellers are progressed in accordance with their findings and recommendations from to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage that the task force will sit on a permanent basis or will it be a temporary task force?  Does he agree that there is a need to have members of the settled community on the task force?  Why has the 1983 report of the review body not been implemented?  Will he agree that until such time as a Minister of the Government has full responsibility for the designation of sites there will not be any change in the present situation in which many families are forced to live on the side of roads because local politicians will not make the necessary decisions? Establishing a task force that will simply report will not solve the problem which is the need to provide accommodation for travellers on a national and equitable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the objectives and needs described by Deputy Harney. The reason for establishing the task force is to advise and suggest solutions to those issues and to consider what should be the relationship between local authorities and my Department.  Clearly the ultimate work on the ground &mdash; subject to what the task force may say &mdash; must be left with <Col N="1700" /> local authorities who have the officials, engineers, road, sewerage and water experts and so on necessary to provide halting sites and to service and administer them.  The key issues raised by Deputy Harney should be addressed by the task force.  It will be my responsibility, and that of the task force, on an ongoing basis, to ensure they are dealt with and that the necessary moneys and powers are given to my Department and local authorities for that purpose.</P>

It is too early to say how the existing service will be affected and what the implications will be for persons living outside of Dublin.

      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for his guidance.  In relation to this question, would the Minister agree that at present there is tremendous inequity in that people living outside of Dublin are unable to avail of what is really a superb service &mdash; the Family Mediation Service?  Would the Minister agree that that service is now overloaded even though it deals primarily with Dublin people?  Would he agree that if divorce legislation, as is likely, is introduced next year, it is vital in terms of equality, that there be a mediation service nationwide? The service should be freely available to people, and it should not be the case that mediation and/or divorce is available only to those who can afford it?  Can the Minister give an indication of the structure he intends to put in place and the locations where we might expect to see such service being made available to people?  Can the Minister ensure the kind of flexibility and freedom of operation at present applicable to the Family Mediation Service will be continued, even on a statutory basis, because there is concern that there will be inflexibility built into the system if there is a change in the way it is structured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I pay tribute to the remarkable service provided by the Family Mediation Service.  Having seen that service in operation and heard of the work that is being done I was tremendously <Col N="1703" /> impressed.  It is regrettable that the service is largely confined to Dublin. However, so great is their reputation that many people avail of the service from as far afield as Cork and Galway.</P>
      <P>I cannot say exactly how the structure will evolve.  As the Deputy is aware, there are other voluntary groups doing some very important and valuable mediation work.  In addition, there are quite a number of professional mediators.  Many of them charge very high fees, and run that service on a strictly commercial basis.  Ultimately there will have to be a judicious mix between the State and the voluntary services.  They also have a very important role to play.  If divorce is introduced we will need a contribution from both sectors.</P>
      <P>The nucleus established by the Family Mediation Service is very valuable.  For example, there are in-house training courses for mediators.  I have discussed with the service the potential of their operating as a nucleus to expand that service to other parts of the country. They indicated that they would be very happy to do so and have the requisite expertise to do so.  We are extremely lucky to have them.  I cannot say exactly how the service will work out.  Much will depend on the availability of resources. It is my intention during the year to endeavour to ensure the maximum possible resources and to plan their best use. Whether the service should be preserved, without any charge in all cases, or whether there should be a fee charged to enable the service to be expanded, will have to be examined.  I can see both sides of the argument.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds needs somebody with some political sense of determination to make those systems work especially in view of the fact that, for instance, the Registry of Deeds, which was established during the reign of Queen Anne, works more efficiently than the supposedly more modern Land Registry system?

I do not know if the Deputy has in mind wide-ranging amendments to the law of real property similar to those made in the United Kingdom in 1925, or something more modest, but I will be happy to review the civil law, including the law <Col N="1705" /> of real property, when the family law legislation has been processed.  If the Deputy has any precise or particular changes in mind I would be interested in hearing from him.</P>

      <P>It is not sufficient to say that although this is a major issue it must take second place to other matters such as family law reform, which I accept is very important.  Will the Minister, who has responsibility for law reform, establish committees, even volunteer committees of experts in all the fields in question, to make proposals and draft the relevant legislation?  Will the Minister agree that there is no real prospect of progress in this area if, as appears to be the case, our attention during the lifetime of this Dáil is to be devoted to the family law and divorce issue?  Does this mean that he is not really the Minister for Law Reform but the Minister for divorce and that all other issues in relation to law reform are to be cast aside and left to some other Minister to deal with at another time?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is waxing lyrical, he knows that one can only operate within the available resources and that it is a matter for the Government to set its priorities in any Department or field of policy.  The Government has set its short term immediate priorities and has given priority to family law.  The resources allocated to my Department will be used in tackling those important issues and I hope we will receive the support of all sides of the House.  Other law reform measures are under examination and consideration in my Department and will be progressed from time to time as resources become available.  Deputy McDowell raised the interesting question of whether we should have committees of experts who would be prepared to serve and give their time.  If people would be prepared to do this, and it would be an onerous task, I will be happy to consider the suggestion but experience shows that it is not necessarily easy to obtain their services.  People have other commitments and calls on their time and expertise. <Col N="1706" /> Will the Deputy confirm that he is prepared to take the lead on one of these committees?</P>

The Minister should contact the Irish Association of Law Teachers, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society to inform them that he wishes to set up voluntary committees which would report to him to achieve progress in this area, given that his Department has limited resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McDowell rightly pointed out, our system of conveyancing and the law of real property has been in place for a long time.  Many Governments could have tackled this subject, including the one of which Deputy Bruton was a member, but they neglected to do so even though it was tackled in the United Kingdom as far back as 1925.  It is my intention to select specific areas of the civil law for reform when the family law legislation has been processed.  As I said, a large number of reports deal with certain aspects of the civil law, which I would dearly love to tackle, but there will be a process of selection to decide which are the most broadly based.  When this has been done I will make my assessment and set about the task of introducing reforms as resources allow.  When the time comes I will be happy to consult Opposition spokesmen on those measures and to discuss the issues with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23, 25, 26 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I would, first, refer the Deputies to my statements in the House on 26 February last on the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  As I indicated then, I am having the recommendations in the commission's report examined with the objective of deciding on priorities for implementation.  This work is well in hand and I intend, on foot of consultation with the other Government Ministers, to establish a programme for implementation of a first tranche or recommendations. I would envisage that a monitoring committee, with appropriate terms of reference, to facilitate implementation of the programme would be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alongside this process, the Government has taken the initiative directly on a number of equality issues.  For example, measures are being taken to achieve the <Col N="1716" /> objective in the Programme for Government that there be a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct Government nominees on State boards and to improve the overall gender balance of such boards.  Also, I hope to table a Bill on adoptive leave in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he envisages the appointment of a monitoring committee.  Will that be an outside committee and will it involve members of the commission that drew up this excellent report?  Will there be a role for the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Womens' Rights in relation to the implementation of the recommendations in this report?  As regards the Government's decision that 40 per cent of all members of State boards be female, does that requirement apply to visiting committees of prisons and other such Government appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to State boards and to appointments made by the Government.  Outside bodies make their own decisions on appointments. However, necessary pressure will be brought to bear on them to ensure that they too observe the 40 per cent gender quota.  I envisage the Joint Committee on Women's Rights as having a major monitoring role in terms of the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  I have not yet determined the exact composition of the monitoring committee which I envisage will be set up in the autumn.  That will allow a reasonable length of time to implement the first tranche of recommendtions.  The composition of the committee will be broadly based and I will consider that matter in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to legislation to provide for leave for adoptive parents, is the Minister aware that Deputy Bertie Ahern, when Minister for Labour, promised such legislation?  In his first budget as Minister for Finance in 1992, Deputy Ahern included provision for such legislation.  This matter was again <Col N="1717" /> mentioned in the context of the most recent budget and was flogged by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform as a Labour Party achievement at the recent Labour Party conference.  As it is two years since a Government involving Fianna Fáil announced that legislation would be introduced in this area, will the Minister indicate what the difficulties are and when the legislation will be published? Will all aspects of it be contained in the Bill to be published by his Department or will a further Bill be required from the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take no resposnibility for what was indicated in previous budgets by Deputy Ahern when Minister for Labour or by anybody else.  I will publish this Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, in the next few months.  I have been in office for 100 days and have undertaken immediate and urgent work on that Bill, as on a number of others. Amending legislation by the Minister for Social Welfare will also be required as a concomitant to that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter as thousands of adoptive couples are disadvantaged in this regard.  Is the Minister saying that in addition to this Bill &mdash; from what the Minister says it seems there is no possibility that the Bill will be published before the autumn &mdash; another measure will be required from the Department of Social Welfare?  Will the Minister indicate whether application of this measure will be back-dated to two years ago, to the time the Government first agreed to it after I pressed them to do so, or is it simply envisaged that this benefit will be available only in the year 1994?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Bill would not be published before the summer recess; I hope it will be published before then.  Amending legislation by the Department of Social Welfare will be required.  As regards back-dating the measure, it would be difficult to grant adoptive leave to somebody who adopted <Col N="1718" /> a child two years ago.  The Bill will be prospective in its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a social welfare payment.  Is the Minister aware that social welfare payments which it was decided should be made to those adopting in 1992 have not been made for one reason only, namely, that the Department of Equality and Law Reform and its predecessor failed to produce legislation governing adoptive leave?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is similar with all legislation that confers benefit.  I have been in office for 100 days and I hope to produce the Bill shortly.  I have no knowledge of the reasons for the delay in publication of the Bill by the last Government but since I took office I have regarded this measure as important.  It has been worked on consistently and I expect it will be published before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister regards the matter as important why was the social welfare aspect of it not dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill which passed through the House some weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister's Department did not produce the other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to explain the reason for that?  No, he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in relation to implementing the recommendations of the commission, one of the key aspects is the link between the Department of Equality and Law Reform and other Departments?  Will the Minister say what communication has taken place in this regard and what issues have been considered by the committee set up in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the House when we were debating the commission's report &mdash; we had a full day's debate on that matter &mdash; my programme manager has been given the task of communicating <Col N="1719" /> with all Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility for implementing the recommendations.  He has analysed the recommendations and will maintain constant communication with all Departments. In addition, the Joint Committee on women's rights will act as a monitoring body &mdash; a separate monitoring review body may be set up in the autumn.  Therefore, implementation of the recommendations will be very well monitored. Deputy O'Rourke indicated she would set up a monitoring committee in her Department and I have encouraged all other Departments to do likewise.  The matter is being closely monitored on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister prioritised certain issues for the various Departments?  For example, what are the priorities on child care and the setting up of a policy in the Department in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department will not set priorities in matters that come within the ambit of other Departments.  That will be a matter for each individual Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not trying to influence that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy can put down a question to each individual Minister as to their priorities in regard to the recommendations.  My Department is working with all Ministers and Departments who have responsibility in this area and the question of prioritisation will be a matter for individual Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I thought the Minister had an overall co-ordinating and monitoring role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to communications that the Minister may have had with Government Departments or State or semi-State agencies with a view to achieving equality objectives, has <Col N="1720" /> he or his Department received any positive response from any of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as specific replies have been received, the indications are positive.  It is Government policy that the Government supports the Commission's report, and it will be implemented over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking out on human rights issues whether in Bosnia, Tibet, Kampuchea or East Timor, to mention but four areas of such concern, is as important for Ireland today as pushing for the dismantling of apartheid was in Frank Aiken's heyday.  Moreover, the Single Act does not prevent us from this course of action.  Although the Act encourages the adoption of common positions, there is nothing to prevent Ireland from taking its own positions, or taking a lead on particular issues, at the United Nations.  The Tánaiste touched on this point and I hope the committee can use our unique position to take a <Col N="1775" /> lead.  This is why the premises which underline our foreign policy are as important as the details and as such, they will, I hope, be discussed in the proposed committee.  I hope that the Committee will be able to clarify where Ireland's position rests within the EPC, to clarify its relationship to the agreed community position, and to clarify whether or not such an agreed position has entailed an abandonment, or modification, of existing policy.</P>
      <P>Our participation in the CSCE should also be worthy of the committee's special attention.  In terms of how this country has been traditionally perceived, the importance of the Helsinki process cannot be overstated, even in the aftermath of the cold war.  Unlike other human rights fora, the process combines human rights issues with other East-West issues such as security and trade.  It establishes a reference-point, or a yard-stick, by which human rights and humanitarian provisions can be measured and judged. In this connection, I wonder why this process was not used in relation to the present situation in the former Yugoslavia. Maybe it is a question of commitment. In any case, within this CSCE framework, there is a natural role for Ireland, just as there was when UNIFIL was being established and developed through its early years.</P>
      <P>This is all the more important in view of the recent conferences on the human dimension, and the need that is felt to ensure that the agreements of the followup meetings, especially the most recent at Vienna, should be fully and completely implemented.</P>
      <P>Such a role is not inconsistent with developing bilateral relations with our two NATO neighbours, Britain and the United States.  Given that the CSCE has recently established a parliamentary tier within is framework, it is appropriate not only that the proposed committee examine its work but also perhaps that the members of the Irish delegation report to the committee on its deliberations and decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste touched on a new world <Col N="1776" /> order.  It was difficult to see where we would get a new world order.  Everybody is looking to someone else in this area. Ireland could take an initiative.  We are in a unique position to take an initiative on a world order within the UN and within the Community.  We cannot absolve ourselves from our responsibilities because of our status as a small country. Considering our history and our record in the UN since the foundation of the State, we have a unique position, a lot of credibility and a lot of respect.  We should use that to try to highlight issues which have not been highlighted in recent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy McDowell's suggestion that an institute of international affairs be established.  I see the committee as being a catalyst for other things, an institute of the kind the Deputy mentioned would be a good start.  The Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to Northern Ireland.  We need to constantly discuss the Northern Ireland issue and to challenge our own views.  I agree that the security issue will have to be held in private, for obvious reasons. It would be crazy to discuss many of the security issues in the public arena.  I welcome the setting up of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which is long overdue. Not alone will the Members of the Dáil and Seanad be better informed, the country as a whole will benefit.  Civil servants and members of the Government will benefit when there is a more open framework within which we can discuss our stand on problems around the world and we, as a small country, with a unique history in international affairs can take initiatives and discuss policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the Foreign Affairs Committee.  During the past number of years, including my time in the Seanad, I have expressed an interest in establishing such a committee.  Since 1989 I have asked a number of questions of various Ministers for Foreign Affairs as to when this committee would be established. This committee affords us an opportunity to discuss foreign affairs and issues <Col N="1777" /> related to it in a meaningful way because foreign affairs has been the cinderella in terms of debate in this House.</P>
      <P>There are many foreign affairs issues in which Ireland plays a major part i.e. relations with the Third World, Third World development and development co-operation.  If my memory serves me correctly, at least two years have elapsed since there was any debate worth talking about &mdash; even then it was not a lengthy one &mdash; on our relationships with developing countries.  It arose when we discussed our allocation to the IDA.  Now that we have a Foreign Affairs Committee we will have a formal structure in which foreign affairs issues can be discussed.  A number of Members in the House are interested in foreign affairs issues.  Indeed, the Minister in his contribution acknowledged that a number of Members are specialists in certain areas of foreign affairs but they have never had the opportunity, given the present structures and the fact that foreign affairs has been ignored in our debates, to express any new ideas in that area.  I am delighted to have been nominated by my party to be a member of the new committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various issues have been raised today in relation to the role of the United Nations and I would like the committee to address its role.  There are difficulties about United Nations' mandates in various parts of the world including Bosnia, Slovenia and other countries.  I went to Angola last October as an election observer.  The United Nations was involved in Angola in bringing about the ceasefire between the various factions which had been fighting each other for 17 years.  They were successful in brokering a ceasefire and in bringing the parties together.  The United Nations carried out a full register of electors in Angola, a country which did not have a census of population for ten years prior to 1975 when the Portuguese left.  One can imagine the difficult task that posed in a huge country and it did a very good job. All kinds of experts were sent in and at least 95 per cent of people eligible to vote were deemed to have been registered.  By and large they assisted in setting up an <Col N="1778" /> independent electoral commission and saw it implemented.  Ultimately these are the people who organised the elections.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of people like myself were invited from all over the world through the United Nations and other interested bodies as observers and to travel all over the country for two days during the election. I am satisfied that the elections were free and fair.  However, the losers did not accept the result in Angola and as happens in many countries they were armed.  Unfortunately the United Nations was not able to enforce the part of the agreement concerning disarming the various factions, although that was part of its mandate.  Afterwards an appalling civil war broke out and in the city of Huambo at least 12,000 civilians were killed.  Some people say it was one of the bloodiest battles ever fought in the continent of Africa.</P>
    <P>When the elections were over and civil war again broke out in that country the United Nations had to pack up and go because its mandate did not allow it to do anything about trying to stop the fighting between the various factions or ensuring the installation of a president and a proper parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the United Nations operating throughout the world and this country sending our peacekeeping forces, the Garda and observers to Angola and every country where there is trouble if they can go only 80 per cent of the way and if they cannot ensure that when a civil war breaks out the military articles cannot be put in to effect.  People can debate forever the morality of military interventions and so on but military intervention, with the sanction of the international community through the United Nations, to get between two warring factions in countries such as Bosnia, the former Yugoslavia, Angola or others, is moral, In our Foreign Affairs Committee we should discuss a stronger role for the United Nations.  I may have discussed the case of Angola at too great a length to illustrate my point.</P>
    <P>This morning some Deputies raised the issue of neutrality.  Certainly we could have a realistic look at our neutrality and <Col N="1779" /> what it means.  I was interested to hear Deputy Michael McDowell quote what Mr. Eamon de Valera, Mr. Lemass and Mr. Sean MacBride said and how in the late sixties we looked on Irish neutrality as something quite different.  It is interesting to note what Mr. Lynch and Mr. Lemass said in the early days when we applied for membership of the European Community.  In the mid-sixties we said that Irish neutrality would be tradeable. I have always been intrigued by the meaning of neutrality.  About what were we neutral?  I am old enough to remember and I have always had an interest in the geopolitics of the sixties, the Cold War politics.  There was a great movement at that time, the non-aligned or neutral movement.  Many major countries with whom we empathised were members, including India, the former Yugoslavia under Tito and Indonesia under Sukarno.  Was Ireland a member of this non-aligned movement when it was a great political force in the world in the sixties and seventies?  We would not have been found dead in any of their councils.  We did not send any delegates to their famous conferences that were held in those years, but we had this neutrality which had more to do with our relationship with Great Britain than with conflicts between the great powers.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a proper cross-party analysis at our committee of our neutrality in the modern world, of what neutrality is supposed to mean to us in the integrated Europe of which we are part and of what neutrality might have to do with the imperative that will be placed on us in relation to European security.  I am one of those who believe that if we are part of a European Community we certainly must take responsibility for the security of that union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of this Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It will improve the efficiency of the Dáil by increasing the throughput of legislation and allow for the processing of legislation in a more orderly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new Committee has wide-ranging <Col N="1780" /> terms of reference and will make a major contribution not alone to the working of this House but to our international relations, to our partnership in the European Community and, hopefully, to affairs in Northern Ireland.  The original terms of reference provided that political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland should not be considered by the Joint Committee.  When I spoke in the debate on 18 February I said that those terms of reference were too finite and I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, who is in charge of Dáil reform, to have another look at this.  It would be appropriate in certain circumstances to discuss issues pertaining to Northern Ireland.  It would also be appropriate to meet the British-Irish Parliamentary group from time to time.  I also suggested provision in another committee that we were discussing on that day, the Finance Committee, for private sessions where necessary.  I am pleased that the Minister has improved on the terms of reference of this Committee and I compliment him on that.  We will now be in a position to discuss in public political issues pertaining to Northern Ireland. Security issues will be discussed in private session because it is important to recognise the sensitivity of the very tragic and difficult situation that exists in the Northern part of our country and take it into account.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the many trouble spots around the world, the most topical at the moment being the former Yugoslavia. There are many other areas where there is not peace and justice.  In Ireland we are very much committed to disarmament and the establishment of human rights all around the world.  There are many economic problems in the developing world which we can make a major contribution to solving.  It is important that we recognise the contribution we make in many trouble spots around the world through our involvement with the peacekeeping forces in the UN.  The Irish army have distinguished themselves over the last 40 years and have brought great credit to this country. That is something we should never <Col N="1781" /> forget.  We should also recognise the contribution of so many Irish people who have worked in the developing world throughout this century in places like Africa and Indonesia.  We should recognise their contribution and the support that has been given to them by people in this country.</P>
    <P>This committee gives us an opportunity to reach consensus in this House.  The more often we reach consensus the better, particularly in regard to foreign affairs.  While the terms of reference of this committee are very wide, nowhere is that seen more than in our membership of the European Community.  There are many issues in the European Community that are of direct relevance to us including the ratification and implementation of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, the committee on the regions, the enlargement negotiations, with application for membership by the EFTA states, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Austria.  This is of fundamental importance to the Community.  Also important is our relationship with the other countries in Europe, with central and eastern European countries, and our support for reforms in Russia.  The free movement of persons around Europe under the Maastricht Treaty is important, as is the tragic situation that exists in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>This morning the Tánaiste referred to the economic aspects of foreign policy. This is very important.  Nowhere is it more important than in the context of our membership of the European Community whereby many of our day to day activities are the result of European legislation to which we are a party as members.  It is important that we give serious consideration to the implementation of the various regulations and legislation that comes from Europe.  It is also important to look at the implications of implementing legislation here that may not be implemented in other states.  We must look at what impact that might have on the economy.  The maintenance and creation of jobs is very important to us. It is important that there be uniformity in the implementation of regulations so <Col N="1782" /> that people in the Border towns are not put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts on the other side of the Border, particularly since the inception of the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Tánaiste that there is no need for a separate European affairs committee at this stage.  I appreciate the points he made about duplication and the difficulties of trying to have two separate committees working side by side.  The world has become a much smaller place and it would be almost impossible to deal with European affairs in isolation from affairs in the rest of the world.  The GATT and its implications for Europe and for Ireland is one question which is of great importance to us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the attendance of MEPs, including MEPs from Northern Ireland.  I hope they will avail of the opportunity to attend committee meetings because there are many areas of activity in Europe where the interests of the people of Northern Ireland are closer to the interests of the people here than they are to the people in Great Britain, who presently negotiate on their behalf.  For example, agriculture is one area where this would apply.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland is not mentioned specifically in the terms of reference and this is understandable. However, while speaking on foreign affairs I would not like the occasion to pass without commending all those responsible for the administration of the International Fund for Ireland and the tremendous contribution it has made to economic development on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this committee.  I believe it will help to develop consensus in this House which will be of benefit to us in our deliberations, particularly concerning international relations and the Department of Foreign Affairs generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers who have participated in this debate I too welcome the establishment of this Foreign Affairs Committee.  It reminds me a little of Val Doonican, who was <Col N="1783" /> singing for 20 years or so around the clubs of England and who suddenly became an overnight success after 20 years.  The Foreign Affairs Committee is now being set up following not quite 20 years &mdash; I am not a Member of this House that long &mdash; but certainly following ten or 11 years of aspirational desire for this committee. I thank the Tánaiste and I am sure he is pleased that it falls to him as Minister to introduce the terms of reference for a Foreign Affairs Committee.  The Labour Party, along with Fine Gael and other Opposition parties, have consistently requested this committee and indicated the need for it.  I agree that people were requesting a Foreign Affairs Committee even when we were in Government in the early eighties.  I was disappointed that we did not set up the Foreign Affairs Committee at that time.  In fact, the need and impetus for this committee has grown in recent years, particularly with the enormous changes that have taken place internationally.  It has been a matter of some embarrassment and amusement to members of parliament from other European countries, but especially to me and the Tánaiste and others, whom we have met during the course of our work over the past number of years, when they discover that we do not have a Foreign Affairs Committee in this House.  The lack of such a Foreign Affairs Committee meant that whoever visited this country with information to impart to us, with expertise to share with us and knowledge about their own country and about troubled spots in the world, had no forum at which they could address Members of Parliament here.  People such as myself, Deputy Connor and others who were known to have an interest in foreign issues had to be requested to get together an informal group of TDs and Senators to meet with these people.  Very often these people were Ministers of State from other countries or senior officials from organisations such as UNICEF and various UN and other world fora.  It was embarrassing, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Hanlon, I welcome the change in the terms of reference to ensure <Col N="1784" /> that this committee, now that it is set up, will be as effective, as open and as transparent as it possibly can.  I thank the Tánaiste for conceding to a number of suggestions put forward by Fine Gael.  I particularly want to thank him for agreeing to the removal of a word from section 11 of the terms of reference which says that:</P>
    <P>Any consideration by the Joint Committee, the Select Committee or a sub-Committee of security issues relating to Northern Ireland shall be in private session.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with that.  It is important that we do not put anybody's life at risk or highlight any security issue that might cause loss of life or limb.  The original terms of reference included the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;.  As a member of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary body, I know from our discussions that nothing can be discussed in relation to Northern Ireland without somebody describing it as political. I was concerned that if the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; was included in the terms of reference, various issues which needed to be aired in public might not be.  For example, a simple issue such as cross-Border interconnectors for electricity or gas, any issue of that type, would not be discussed becaue of the fear they might be blown up.  Even the most mundane practical issues could be labelled political and we might be forbidden to discuss them in public.</P>
    <P>It is important for the general public and the media &mdash; and I hope they will cover this committee widely &mdash; to listen to discussions and briefings on a wide range of issues which will break down further the barriers which exist between the two parts of this island.  I am happy that that word has been removed from the terms of reference.  There are many other elements of the terms of reference which I believe will help to make this a worthwhile committee.</P>
    <P>I wish now to address some other issues which other Deputies have dealt with so that the Minister will be aware of how we want to see this committee work.  It is essential that two standing commitees be <Col N="1785" /> set up immediately to deal with two major areas of foreign policy.  The first concerns EC issues, so that we can deal with the statutory instruments from the EC in a subcommittee.  This will mean that the main committee will not become bogged down with minor issues, such as whether or not one can put colorant E in homemade jam.  Those issues are important, but they can be dealt with in a sub-committee where they can be examined in detail.</P>
    <P>The other area which has been my main area of interest for a number of years is the overseas aid development issue.  The only form of Foreign Affairs Committee in this House was the Overseas Aid Development Committee, of which Deputy Connor was a member.  A number of members of the Tánaiste's party served on this Committee also and it is widely accepted as being one of the more successful committees.  At the time it was set up there was no rush to become a member of this committee.  However, by the time it was unfortunately disbanded many people wished they were a member of it because of the effective work it had carried out.  There is a need for an ongoing working committee examining Ireland's overseas aid development issues, proposing changes to our programmes and using the additional moneys, which are welcome, in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 14 of the terms of reference, if papers or information are requested and a member of Government decides &mdash; I assume that means any member of Government, not just the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; that the information is confidential and would be prejudicial, could I appeal to the Minister to apply this only on the rarest of occasions.  The hands of the committee should not be tied by being told that certain matters are prejudicial.  I understand that one or two issues may arise in any one year that would be prejudicial and perhaps be of danger to people if they were to be discussed.  But this section should be applied as seldom as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the referral of <Col N="1786" /> Bills.  This refers to Bills initiated by the Minister's Department.  However, from time to time Bills will be initiated by other Ministers that are relevant to the Foreign Affairs Committee.  For example, the Minister for Defence will introduce the Bill to allow Ireland participate in peacekeeping programmes around the world.  This is a crucial issue to be discussed by the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Perhaps the Minister could arrange for a Bill such as that to be discussed bilaterally, both in the committee dealing with defence issues and also in the Foreign Affairs Committee, because of the wider implications to our role in international fora, etc.  I cannot at present give another example of a Bill, but there might be one on the marine, fisheries or other such issues that would have an effect on our relationships with other countries.</P>

      <P>I am pleased our MEPs will be able to participate in this committee. For too long we have not been able to avail of their expertise and wealth of knowledge.  It will enable our MEPs to be more answerable to our people.  I am not implying that they do not wish to be answerable but we do not make it easy for them.</P>
      <P>I hope an examination will be made of the budget for this committee.  People talk about travel and other expenses in relation to committees, but if members of the Committee on Public Accounts can travel to examine public accounts systems outside of Ireland in order to ensure that there are good standard public accounts systems here, there may be occasions when this committee may wish to send one or two of their members to examine certain issues or attend some major conferences, etc.  I would like the committee to be able to work effectively and most Parliaments have seperate budgets in respect of their commitees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the incoming chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I gather it will be Deputy Lenihan, to consider <Col N="1787" /> the suggestion that invitation might be extended at an early date to ambassadors from the various countries represented here and those accredited to us in London to obtain a briefing on all the countries with which we have relations.  That briefing need not be long but should inform members and highlight sensitive issues for discussion, for example defence, neutrality, how we deal with the United Nations etc.  There are certain measures that can be taken in relation to those matters which I will discuss with the incoming Chairperson in the hope that we may have an effective and transparent committee and one which is a credit to this Parliament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have so little time I will refer specifically to the time when I, as Lord Mayor, invited 60 young people to the Mansion House.  They were attending an international co-operation peace group meeting hosted by an institution based in Limerick of which Brendan O'Regan is so much a part.  Tom O'Donnell, a former Member of this House and a former MEP, is also very much a part of that institute.  Of the 60 young people, 20 were from the then Soviet Union, 20 from the USA, 20 from this country &mdash; ten from the North and ten from the South.  They spent two weeks together.  They all looked similar.  Nobody could have picked out who was Russian, American or Irish.  Once again I saw the futility of war.  I thought if the superpowers could set aside 1 per cent of the moneys they spend on armaments to charter aircraft to fly those young people to each other's countries to meet on their own stamping <Col N="1788" /> ground, it could have made a contribution to peace in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste stated in his speech changes have taken place.  We no longer have the East-West divide.  We have seen the growth of nationalism in many of the former parts of the Soviet Union.  In eastern Europe we have seen happenings that are horrendous to all decent thinking people.  Questions in relation to enforcement of law have arisen and peace making as opposed to peacekeeping must be considered.  The bottom line in becoming involved in any foreign conflict is whether we would like any of our children, our sons and daughters, to be involved in settling a dispute in a far off land.  Unless we are satisfied that the peace of the world is involved and what we are doing is in the interest of making peace, we have to be careful that we do not get sucked into a great conflagration in which there are no winners.  I am very supportive of those people who say the Serbs who are carrying out policies of genocide must be restrained and punished. The people of the world can no longer stand aside and ignore what is happening.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have participated in this debate.  Their contributions which were both serious and reflective underline the seriousness with which we are approaching the establishment of the Foreign Affairs Committee of this House.  The tone of the contributions was constructive and will augur well for the future of the committee. As most Members have said, it is long overdue and has a very important role to play in the development of foreign policy.  It also has a role in ensuring that the Government will be well informed of the views of all Members, particularly the committee members who will have a particular interest in the many complex issues involved in foreign affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have outlined their views on the substantive issues of European union, neutrality, United Nations reform, development aid and the situation in the former Yugoslavia.  I agree with the view that these should be the main priority issues to be discussed by the committee as a matter of urgency. Some interesting points were made on the various issues and I am in agreement with many of them.  In regard to others there is room for some disagreement. Given the spectrum of issues covered I <Col N="1790" /> do not think that it would be appropriate at this stage to provide a substantive response in the context of this debate. There will be ample opportunity both at the committee and on the floor of this House for the issues to be debated and explored in a considered way.</P>
    <P>When I, on behalf of the Labour Party many years ago, called for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee I have never had any doubt that this would be an extremely burdened committee in terms of work.  There is an extraordinary workload for this committee.  Perhaps the workload is heavier because it is a new committee.  Our discussion today highlights many issues for the committee's urgent attention.</P>
    <P>A valid point was made by a number of speakers that the committee should have resources to enable it to deal with its extended workload.  I am sympathetic to the requirement in relation to resources but at the same time, as Deputies have acknowledged, there are definite budgetary constraints.  This has been acknowledged by most Deputies and the resources issue is one which must be looked into in the context of the committees of this House.  This did not arise today nor yesterday.  There has been a general level of dissatisfaction in regard to resourcing the committees and I will be willing to participate in discussions either at party level or with the Whips to ensure that the committees are not hampered by lack of resources.</P>
    <P>Various viewpoints were expressed on fundamental issues regarding Northern Ireland, touching on the future of the North and the proper objectives of Government policy in that regard.  Such issues need to be dealt with in a careful and considered manner and not in the course of the debate today.  I note Deputy McDowell's acknowledgment of the thin line that exists between political and security issues in the context of Northern Ireland.  This interlinking of the two aspects is one of the reasons I initially felt that both political and security issues should be discussed by the committee in private sessions.  It is important that the committee should show sensitivity and <Col N="1791" /> good judgment in deciding the political issues appropriate for public discussion and security matters requiring private discussion.  I hope there will be maximum flexibility in that regard and, as long as we all approach the matter constructively and with the right attitude, there should be no attempt to limit discussion on those issues.  It is important that there should be as much discussion as possible among the parties on the many complex and pressing issues in regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Bruton's frustration at the delays in the production of indexed reports of Dáil proceedings and the intention behind his proposed amendment to paragraph (5).  However, as he indicated, his amendment is relevant to all Dáil proceedings, not particularly to the Foreign Affairs Committee. That matter should be discussed between the Whips to come up with a satisfactory solution which would apply to the proceedings of the House and all its committees. We should have an overall solution rather than an <i>ad hoc</i> one for a particular Committee.  This matter must be addressed by the Whips.</P>

      <P>I agree it is a function of the House and it must be addressed in regard to all committees.  A particular committee should not be dealt with on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also proposed an amendment to paragraph 17 to give members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe the same rights of participation in the committee as Irish Members of the European Parliament.  I draw the Deputy's attention to paragraph 16 which provides that any Member of Dáil Eireann may attend meetings of the joint committee and take part in proceedings without having a right to vote.  Since all members of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council <Col N="1792" /> of Europe are Members of this House, the existing motion already gives them the rights proposed in Deputy Bruton's amendment.  In those circumstances, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment gives me an opportunity to underline the importance of our participation in the Council of Europe, a point well made by the Deputy.  That is a central element of our foreign policy.  The Council embodies the common commitment of its members to democratic values and to the vital role of human rights in any democratic system. Its importance to the new democracies of Eastern Europe cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that this committee should avoid a quick fix or sound bite approach.  In my opening statement, I underlined the complexity of many of the problems confronting us in the area of foreign policy.  If those issues were black and white we would not require a foreign affairs committee.  However, they are not, as Deputies who will be on that committee are well aware.  The issues are extremely complex and that is why the establishment of this committee is long overdue.  I assure the House that I will give every co-operation to this committee and I know that will apply also to the Minister of State who has had a long interest in foreign affairs and overseas development aid, as acknowledged by Deputy Owen.  I look forward to working with that committee, in the interests of everybody in this House, and establishing a concrete basis for the development of foreign policy for this country.</P>

It is true that members of the Council can attend meetings, but it is important that the Council of Europe is mentioned somewhere in the motion to indicate its relevance.  It is in that context I put down <Col N="1793" /> the amendment rather than for operational purposes.  In that context, will the Tánaiste accept the amendment?</P>

      <P>We have been standing together ever since.</P>
      <P>Oireachtas reform is a vital &mdash; and will continue to be a vital &mdash; part of our task as legislators, because we must ensure that our democratic institutions keep pace with the evolving needs of our society and the increasing complexity of Government work.  The section of the Programme for a Partnership Government, &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo;, outlined the range of measures, including a framework for a committee system, which the Government believes will develop the role of the Oireachtas as part of the process of reform.</P>
      <P>The new committee system is the most fundamental change in the way the House has conducted its business since the foundation of the State.  The existing system led to frustration for many Deputies because the contribution they could make to the legislative process was minimal.  The new system will go some way towards relieving this frustration.  It will increase opportunities for Members to participate in a meaningful way and will make better use of their expertise.</P>
      <P>All this is fine in theory but it requires one further ingredient, the wholehearted support and co-operation of all Deputies and a commitment by them to improve current practices as well as procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motions establishing the new standing committees were passed by the House on Wednesday, 7 April 1993.  The four committees were proposed in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and have now been established. The goals in establishing the system are: to enhance the role of all Members in the legislative process; to enable Members to perform their function of scrutinising Government Departments more effectively; to ensure careful scrutiny of legislation by all Members of the House; and <Col N="1795" /> to more evenly distribute the workload among committees to facilitate the effective participation of Members.</P>
    <P>The new system will let committee members come to terms with Government Departments.  They will learn as they monitor Department activities, and that very process should increase committee influence over Government policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new Dáil standing committees and the Foreign Affairs Committee, Committees on Procedure and Privileges, Public Accounts, Selection, Joint Services, and State Sponsored Bodies and the Irish Language have also been established.  The Women's Rights Committee will be re-established and the necessary motions have been agreed.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the programme, the necessary legislation to provide for the remuneration of the chairpersons is also being prepared as well as legislation regarding privilege and the compellability of witnesses.  The terms of references of the new committees mean that each committee will consider the Estimates for the Public Services relevant to the Departments mentioned in the terms of reference.  This is the first time the Estimates will be dealt with on a line by line basis.  Up to last year many Estimates were not fully discussed; indeed, in some cases they were not discussed at all. While last year was an improvement on the previous procedure, it still meant that the Estimates were not fully scrutinised. I am sure the Deputy opposite will be very happy with this new development.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the committees' terms of reference is the emphasis on equality.  The principle of equality should be a cornerstone in the consideration of all areas of public policy.  This is reflected in the terms of reference of the committees, who will have the power to consider the impact of each piece of legislation on equality.  The committees will consider the Committee Stages of Bills referred to them by the House.  To ensure that the members of committees have a better understanding of the issues involved in the legislation and the thinking <Col N="1796" /> behind it, a briefing session or sessions will be held between the officials of the relevant Department and members of the select committee or, if appropriate the subcommittee.  Consideration of a Bill by a committee should allow for greater examination by all members and a greater input by them.  It will also allow more time for the discussion of Committee Stages of Bills.  The first Bill to be considered by the Finance and General Affairs Committee will be the Finance Bill.  In general in the past when special committees considered Bills, amendments and ideas from backbenchers were accepted more readily than across the floor of the House, the atmosphere being less confrontational and less adversarial, with everybody making a contribution. The Government is anxious to build on this.</P>
    <P>In addition to the detailed examination of Estimates and the Committee Stages of legislation, the committees will consider reports referred to them by the House on subjects relevant to their terms of reference and will be required to report to the Dáil.  The committees will be independent, make annual reports to the Dáil on their work and, on their adoption, have the power to print and publish their reports and documents.  In order to keep the arrangements within the committees as flexible as possible and to allow for maximum input, a Member of the House may substitute for a member of a committee.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources, each committee will have the service of a clerk from the Houses of the Oireachtas. Departments will provide officials when the committees are dealing with legislation and Estimates which affect them. The committees will have the power to engage the services of people with a specialist or technical knowledge to assist them or their subcommittees and may invite submissions in writing from interested groups or individuals.  These provisions, together with the holding of briefing sessions by departmental officials, adequately demonstrate the Government's resolve that the committees should be effective in their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> It is not true to say that the committees will be ineffective because Ministers will not be answerable to them.  Ministers will be answerable to the committees in a real way.  They will have to bring their legislation before the committees for detailed examination and their departmental Estimates will be examined in a detailed way by the committees.  Constitutionally, Ministers are answerable to the House and not to a committee.  This is the practice and precedent in such matters. Reference has been made to the position in the UK.  Apart from the fact that our constitutional positions are not the same, it is not true to say that British Ministers can be summoned to and are answerable to a committee.  Ministers may be required to attend a committee and the Prime Minister decides who, if anyone, should attend.  Additionally, our committees will have much more access to Ministers than committees in the UK.</P>
    <P>The possibility of splitting the responsibilities of some Departments between the committees has been raised.  It is the intention that Departments with similar responsibilitis should as far as possible be examined by parallel standing committees. For this reason the subjects of Labour Law, Equality and the Gaeltacht were deemed to be more appropriate for consideration by the Social Affairs Committee and the issue of Law Reform most appropriate to the Legislative and Security Committee.  This makes pragmatic common sense.  If over the course of time it is felt that other arrangements would be more suitable, the Government is open on the matter and would be prepared to reconsider the allocations.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of these committees will largely depend on the effectiveness of the cathaoirligh and convenors.  They will play a key role in ensuring the effectiveness of the new system.  The task will be a difficult and time consuming one and for this reason they should be properly paid for it.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that there should be liaison both between committees and between the Government and Opposition parties.  Therefore the Minister of State has proposed that convenors <Col N="1798" /> should be appointed for each committee on the Government and Opposition sides and that these convenors should be paid.  Their work will be similar to the work of the Whips in the Dáil.  Before committees take business, consultations will be held to ensure that the matter is dealt with in an orderly way. The parties will have to agree on the taking of the business and the way it is to be taken.  As there are limited facilities for the taking of committee business at present there will have to be liaison between the committees to organise timetables. The convenors for each committee will also have to ensure that Members attend at committee meetings and will agree pairing arrangements for the meetings.</P>
    <P>The proceedings of the committees will be televised from an early date.  Work will begin very shortly on the equipping of a room in Kildare House for this purpose. The committees will meet in the Dáil Chamber and, subject to agreement, in the Seanad Chamber when the Dáil and Seanad are not sitting.  It is important that the House and the way it works should make sense to the people we serve, and I hope that the extension of TV coverage to the committee system will help to bring that about.</P>
    <P>The most radical overhaul of the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State has been tackled by the Whips of all the parties over the last few months in an open, positive way.  The Minister of State wishes to record his thanks to them for that attitude and approach.  All the Whips agreed that they may not get the new system exactly right initially and for that reason he suggested that we should be as flexible as possible until we are all reasonably satisfied that this system is working efficiently and effectively.  To ensure this he has agreed to a regular review of all the reform measures, particularly the committee system.</P>
    <P>The Whips have discussed arrangements for the coming session and agreed that committees may sit on Tuesday mornings from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and all day on Fridays.  Plenary sessions of the Dáil will take place from 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, all day on Wednesdays and all <Col N="1799" /> day on Thursdays.  These arrangements will remain in place until the end of this session.  Committees will also sit during the months of July and September and the Dáil will return for one day in each of these months to consider the reports of the committee cathaoirligh.  In the next session it has been decided to have plenary sessions of the Dáil for three out of every four weeks and the fourth week will be devoted exclusively to committee meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to welcome the establishment of the Select Committees on Finance and General Affairs, Legislation and Security, Social Affairs and Enterprise and Economic Strategy.</P>
      <P>In 1989 my party proposed exactly this type of committee structure for the Dáil. The essence of this structure is that, whereas in the past Committee Stage of all legislation was dealt with here on the floor of the House rather than in an actual committee, as were the Estimates, these two important items of business in future will be dealt with in a genuine committee. The importance of this is that, as a House, we will be enabled to do three and four times as much work as we could otherwise be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of criticism of this institution on the part of people outside who contend that we do not sit long enough, we do not sit sufficiently long hours, weeks or months in the year.  In my view the object of us in politics should not be simply to sit longer hours for appearances sake.  Rather our objective should be to <Col N="1800" /> do three and four times as much effective work as we are now doing; it should be to improve our work rate rather than simply our working hours.  This proposal to introduce a genuine committee system for the mainline business of the House is a means of doubling, trebling or even quadrupling the work rate of this House. That is why I welcome it.  That is why I may say, with no false modesty, I proposed it in 1989.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the parties forming the Government have adopted almost exactly the proposals I made, which were included in the Fine Gael Programme for Government forwarded to the other parties prior to the opening of the negotiations between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil, and which Labour and Fianna Fáil have now adopted as part of their programme.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points about the way in which this will work.  I fear that the committee work will not get the prominence in the media it deserves.  Publicity is the oxygen of politics in that, without a measure of publicity politics dies and politicians lose interest in their work because they are not seen to get the credit that is important to them for what they are doing.  One of the obstacles to publicity of proceedings in committees, particularly on live television or live radio, is that there is not clarity as to the privilege applying to things said in committees, particularly by witnesses who are not Members of the House.  One of the reasons RTE would not provide televising of committees was that they were not sure that they might not be sued if something said there was slanderous.</P>
    <P>That is the case because we have not passed the legislation to provide for the privilege and compellability of witnesses. I might remind the House that the requirement for legislation in regard to the compellability of witnesses before committees of this House dates back to 1970.  The need for compellability of witnesses arose from the fact that, I believe, a Member of this House refused to appear before a committee of this House which was investigating matters arising from the Arms Trial.  It is that long, 20 <Col N="1801" /> years and more, since committees of this House have sat without this power to compel witnesses.  The intention to introduce legislation to allow for the compellability of witnesses and, consequently, for the privilege attaching to witnesses who are compelled to attend, has been promised by Government after Government.  I say very clearly to the Minister of State that this experiment will not work unless that legislation is passed because the media will not be satisfied to give publicity of the type that this work will require.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something very definite about having that legislation introduced.  I might suggest that he set a time limit for its introduction by the summer recess this year.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome what was said on behalf of the Minister of State by Deputy Power in regard to the fact that henceforth Estimates will be examined line by line.  This will mean, for example, that one will be able &mdash; if, say, one feels that the amount that the Department of the Gaeltacht is spending on consultancy services has risen too quickly, that they are spending too much on consultancy services and not sufficient on grants to people who speak Irish &mdash; to raise a point about a particular subhead and say: &ldquo;there is too much being spent there and too little being spent somewhere else&rdquo;. That will be very welcome and will mean we will be able to scrutinise spending in the same way that a local authority would scrutinise the individual lines of a local authority estimate.  This House is most unusual, as a body authorising public spending within the Irish administrative system, in that it does not allow for line by line examination of Estimates.  In every other statutory authority where the spending of money is authorised, line by line examination is possible.</P>
    <P>There are two things that need to be done if this committee system is to work. First of all, the Estimates must be introduced in this House before the money begins to be spent.  At present we have not discussed a single Estimate for any Government Department for 1993 even though one-third of the year has already <Col N="1802" /> elapsed.  When we do eventually get to discuss whether a given amount should be spent on, say, consultancy in 1993 by a particular Government Department, the likelihood will be that half of the money, if not all, will already have been spent.  In other words, if we attempt to reduce the amount for a particular purpose, we shall be attempting to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. Therefore, if this committee system is to work it is essential that Estimates be published in September or October of the preceding year, which is the case in most other European countries.</P>
    <P>The other change that needs to be made if this is to work is that committees must be allowed to amend Estimates.  It is not sufficient simply to have an opportunity to make a comment, line by line, on individual Estimates.  If the debate in the committee on Estimates is to be in any way meaningful it must be possible for a member of the committee to propose that the amount, say, provided for consultancy should be reduced by £10,000, that that £10,000 should be transferred to grants for a particular purpose or whatever.  There has to be the capacity to introduce amendments to transfer spending from one subhead to another.  Of course, it should not be possible for the committee to increase the overall amount of any Estimate; that is clearly a matter which should lie solely within the discretion of Government. Within the overall Estimate, there should be a means for a committee to propose reallocations of expenditure from one subhead to another.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider those two changes, the first to ensure that Estimates are published in time so that their discussion in the committee will be able to influence what happens rather than after the event and second, that committees should have the power to propose amendments to the Estimates within the overall figure, the latter properly being a matter to be determined by Government and not by this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the committees will publish annual reports.  I question the division of equality and law reform <Col N="1803" /> between two committees, so that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will be responsible to two committees rather than just one.  The Minister of State, through Deputy Power, has said he wants to continue with this process.  I think he is making a mistake in that respect but that is really a matter for him and I shall not make an issue of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power's speech delivered on behalf of the Minister of State contained a statement to the effect that it was intended to have a regular review of the committee system.  I welcome that proposal, but I want to ensure that it is not just the usual well-intentioned statement that Ministers make whenever matters of this kind are being introduced.  I remind the Minister of State, if he is not already aware of it, that at the time the televising of Dáil Éireann was introduced, it was agreed that a broadcasting review committee would be established.  That has not happened.  I hope such a committee will be established &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the point &mdash; and that his statement that the operation of the committee system will be reviewed is a statement of intent which will be fulfilled and does not represent a token genuflection.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement on behalf of the Minister of State that legislation relating to the question of privilege for witnesses will be introduced.  It is important also that the House should make regulations governing the exercise of privilege by Members of the House.  Given that Members have absolute privilege they can say anything they like about people outside the House.  They can accuse them of any crime under the sun and the person outside the House has no right of redress; they cannot do anything to vindicate their reputation if a Member of this House chooses to abuse its privileges by making unsubstantiated allegations against somebody outside it.  It is clear from recent court decisions that the courts will not intervene to vindicate the rights of any person offended or whose reputation <Col N="1804" /> has been taken away by a Member of this House by an irresponsible statement.</P>
    <P>If the courts do not have jurisdiction in the matter then the House must have jurisdiction and must be willing to regulate the use of privileges conferred on Members.  It is imperative that the House should guide Members on how they should use privilege in regard to the statements they make about people outside the House and ensure, if Members manifestly abuse privilege by, knowingly, making false and irresponsible allegations about people outside the House, that it can discipline those Members for abusing their privileges in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer to matters which are currently <i>sub judice</i> or the subject of discussion elsewhere but it should be recognised that Members of this House who make the law should not be seen to be above it.  If Members can say anything they like about people outside the House who do not have a tribunal to whom they can turn to seek redress when an irresponsible and untrue statement is made by a Member of this House with the result that their reputation is taken away then, <i>de facto,</i> Members of this House are above the law.  This should not be the case and I hope this will be changed in the legislation.  I am dealing with this matter in general terms and not referring to any specific instance although I am sure many Members have a specific instance in mind.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the committee system is to work Ministers must be willing to accept amendments.  Like Deputy Rabbittee and Deputy O'Malley who was then Minister, I served on the special committee which dealt with the Companies Bill.  That was a very good committee but from one day to the next one did not know whether amendments would be accepted.  I got the impression on occasions that if Deputy O'Malley was in good humour he might be willing to accept an amendment whereas if his Minister of State was present and had not been given instructions it did not matter how good one's arguments were, an amendment would not be accepted.  This is an abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> The Cabinet Minister concerned who has the authority should attend or, alternaively, should make sure that whoever attends on his behalf will have the freedom to accept amendments.  Otherwise, Members will not bother with the committees. Given that they will not receive much publicity unless they feel they will be able to make an impact by having some of their proposals accepted the system will collapse.  It is very important, therefore, that the Cabinet colleagues of the Minister of State mut attend and be willing to accept amendments within reason or ensure that the Minister of State who will be attending on their behalf will have freedom to make decisions on the spot.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been in Government, we should be wary of the risk of hyper-caution on the part of officials who, because an argument is made by a politician and not from some other source, are slow to accept it.  I am aware that a strong Minister or Minister of State will pay no attention to this but officials should be advised that this is a very important experiment, that they should be willing to listen to the arguments by Members of the House and not be cautious in relation to any new idea which they did not think of themselves.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the payment to be made to conveners.  However, I welcome the fact that the Government proposes to pay Government and Opposition party conveners.  I have no doubt that the members of my party who will act as conveners for our group will be more than willing to accept anything the Minister has to offer in this regard and that the money will be divided on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  However, is it wise, from the point of view of public relations, to pay people to do what they should be doing in any event?  If one is a member of a committee and receives notice in the post he or she is expected to turn up for the meeting without having to be reminded by a telephone call.  We are all adult and responsible, we should consult our diaries to remind us of appointments. For instance, I know that I should be somewhere else now.  There is a meeting <Col N="1806" /> of my own party which I cannot attend, but I do not need a convener to tell me.</P>

      <P>There is one other issue that I wish to bring to the attention of the House relating to the way in which the proceedings of the committees and the House are reported.  As I said already we are in a very bad situation when it comes to the indexation of the reports of the proceedings of this House.  We are now producing indexes covering the subject matter of debates which took place in 1985.  No index is available in respect of any of the proceedings of this House since 1985.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that indexes for the period 1920 to 1985 are of historical interest and of no value or interest to Members of this House; they are of interest solely to historians.  On the other hand, an index of the proceedings of this House and its committees during the past two years would be of great value to Members.  We would then be in a position to check what was said about a particular subject, Members could avoid repeat questions and make relevant contributions. I do not believe there is another Parliament in Europe where the system of reporting of the proceedings is so outdated.  We are not producing authoritative final reports of the proceedings of this House until eight years later.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister of State will ensure that adequate arrangements are made for the reporting on time of the committee proceedings, for the indexation of the subject matter covered by them and that this be done simultaneously with the reports.  Perhaps he could arrange for a debate in Government time on the overall issue of the reporting of our proceedings both in plenary session and in committee so that we will be able to take this issue in charge and ensure that our proceedings are properly reported.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, an index of the proceedings of this House and the subject matters covered, if it were on a computer data base would be a marketable commodity and it would generate revenue if it were available on line to commercial operations.  Indeed, the marketing of this could make a contribution to our appropriations-in-aid which would be to our benefit and may enable us to do other things.  I suggest the Minister of State look at this urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and that the Select Committees so established shall have power to call Ministers and Ministers of State before them on reasonable notice to assist the Select Committees on matters of policy and administration, within the scope of their official duties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantive motions in regard to these four committees appear to have been passed on 7 April and it seems to me that what is happening today is largely a debate on these motions after the event, because the motion before us does not propose the establishment of these committees but refers to the fact they have already been established.  I think it is right that the additional powers which the committees do not have, but which I recommend in my amendment, should <Col N="1808" /> be granted to the four committees and indeed to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which was debated earlier today.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the establishment of these four committees, particularly because of the time they will save in the expeditious handling of business. This will allow business to be conducted simultaneously on two or three topics, something which cannot be done at present.  Having expressed that welcome, I now wish to express my severe disappointment that the powers of the proposed committees are in my view severely and unnecessarily curtailed.  The inability of the committees to examine Ministers or Ministers of State on matters of policy and administration means in practice that the committees have no more extensive powers than the Dáil sitting as a committee of the whole House has at present, because no greater powers are proposed for it than the Dáil sitting as a committee of the whole House currently has.</P>
    <P>For this reason I am proposing in my amendment that each of the committees should have this minimal power because without it no significant change takes place in the powers of the Dáil.  There may well be a change in the more expeditious ordering of the business of the Dáil and in allowing certain matters to go on in parallel or indeed even in triplicate on certain occasions.  The powers, however, are not changed.  Paragraph 7 of the motion of 7 April allows submissions to be made in writing, and only in writing, on the invitation of one of these committees.  I query why those submissions can only be made in writing? Since paragraph 8 of the order of 7 April compels the committee to hear the Government's side of the case on a Bill or another matter from officials of the relevant Department, it seems to me to be wrong not to allow people who have a contrary view to express their opinion in person and to be cross-examined on it in the same way that officials can be questioned.</P>
    <P>These four committees have no power to send for persons or papers or to take <Col N="1809" /> evidence except from departmental officals. Although both Standing Orders 70 and 71 of the Standing Orders relevant to public business envisage evidence being taken on a Bill or on any other matter, those two Standing Orders envisage a select committee being empowered to send for persons, papers and records. The most valuable contribution which these committees could make would be their ability to investigate matters which arise from time to time and to examine Ministers and others in connection with those matters.  I see only limited value in these committees if they do not have this kind of power.  At least one of the prolonged inquiries which we have had recently by way of public tribunal might well have been avoided if we had a meaningful committee system with meaningful powers and particularly if the committees concerned had the powers I am advocating now.  Without them they could not obviate the necessity for public tribunals afterwards.</P>
    <P>I regard it as unsatisfactory also that subparagraph (4) of paragraph 1 of the order of 7 April limits the committee's jurisdiction to matters which are referred to it by the Dáil and which are already the subject matter of reports &mdash; in other words, the committee has no power of initiative in regard to what it would investigate or report on and is dependent on an order of the Dáil being made; and, under paragraph 1 (4), the Dáil can only ask it to investigate something if a report has been carried out already on it.  Therefore, the committee is simply the second body reporting on it.  I do not see much value in that.  I think it curtails the powers of the committee completely unnecessarily. The jurisdiction that the committees have in this respect therefore is so limited as to be of little value.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that that should be the case.  It may be that the Minister of State, when replying, to what I and others have to say, will say that the reason the Government is putting forward these motions and has not included evidence from individuals is that the legislation to give them the complete freedom and privilege to speak has not yet been passed.  I <Col N="1810" /> would remind the Minister of State that Deputies have full privilege in these committees and there is no reason that the committees should not be fully reported, televised and broadcast so far as Deputies are concerned.  It seems to me that the appropriate time to bring forward legislation on the compellability and privilege of witnesses would be simultaneous with these motions.  It is a pity this has not happened.  If we do not see the legislation for a long time or if it is not passed for a long time, these committees will languish with very limited powers indeed.  They will be of only partial value and will do very little other than expedite the business of this House, even though that in itself is valuable.</P>
    <P>In the speech read by Deputy Power, he said:</P>
    <P>What about the suggestion that the committees will be ineffective because Ministers will not be &ldquo;answerable&rdquo; to them?  Not true: Ministers will be answerable.  Answerable in a real way &mdash; they will (i) have to bring their legislation before the committees for detailed examination and (ii) will have their departmental Estimates examined in a detailed way by the committees.</P>
    <P>Ministers have to do both those things in the Dáil at the moment.  There must be Committee Stage of Bills in the Dáil. The fact that these debates have been guillotined regularly in recent years and therefore are shortened is regrettable but at least in theory Bills have to be examined in detail in Committee.  Therefore, what is new about Ministers going to a committee with legislation?  The fact that departmental Estimates will have to be examined by the committee is no different, in theory at least, from what happens in the House.  No doubt if the committee does not have time to deal with them they will be passed in the same way as they are passed when the House has not time to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power made the following point that is questionable from a legal or constitutional point of view: &ldquo;Constitutionally the position is that Ministers <Col N="1811" /> are answerable to the House not to a committee &mdash; this is also the practice and precedent in these matters&rdquo;.  Apparently in saying that the Government is relying on a statement in the Constitution that Ministers are answerable to Dáil Éireann.  However, that does not preclude them from being answerable to committees of Dáil Éireann, which is the assumption.  If this matter was interpreted by the courts I would be surprised if they decided otherwise.  If we were to take that phrase literally, a Minister would not be answerable to this House while in committee.  This House spends much of its time in committee of the whole House.  In my experience I have never seen Ministers demur in regard to answering to the House when in committee or say they are in a different position from that when the House is sitting as Dáil Éireann proper.  Most Members would not even know whether the House is in committee at any given time.</P>
    <P>If in practice Ministers are answerable, as they are, to a committee of the whole House, how can it be claimed they are not answerable to a committee which consists of only 30 Members of the House?  That argument is entirely fallacious and I deeply suspect the Government simply does not want to be answerable.  It does not suit Ministers, collectively or individually, to come in and answer questions. If they did so, many difficulties and delays would be avoided.  If there was a proper system whereby Ministers could be made answerable for matters arising in the course of their duties and matters of public policy there might not have been a Beef Tribunal, which to date has sat for 198 days.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech a comparison is made with Britain.  The constitutional position is not the same there as it is here, in that in Britain Ministers attend only if the Prime Minister decides they should do so.  I do not think that is a very strong argument because there are certain instances of committees in the House of Commons in recent years at which Ministers who did not attend and answer in respect of their policy decisions <Col N="1812" /> and so on would have suffered very much politically.  It is most unlikely that the Prime Minister of the day would prevent Ministers from attending committees because it is in their own interests to do so.  Ministers here shelter behind an illusory constitutional protection, which I do not believe exists.  If there was a genuine commitment to transparency and to answering on matters of public policy, Ministers would be both willing and anxious to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of Deputy Bruton's remarks.  The Deputy is carried away with the significance of this matter, but it is much less significant than he believes it to be.  I agree with him in that much will depend on the attitude of the Government in practice, whether it is anxious to protect itself under the precise terms of the motion of 7 April or whether it is prepared to enter into the spirit of this system, as it and others have enunciated it here.  If they are prepared to enter into the spirit of it, this system could work quite satisfactorily and could be improved greatly in a short time with the passing of legislation regarding the privilege of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the unwillingness of some Ministers to accept amendments in committee, and he instanced the Special Committee on the Companies Bill over which I presided for two and a half years and of which many lengthy meetings were held.  If the Deputy looks back over the records of that committee he will find that I accepted not only dozens or scores of amendments but almost hundreds in the course of that very long and complicated Bill.  I never sought to make an ideological point against any valid argument. That Act of 1990 has literally hundreds of changes from the Bill as it was originally introduced in 1987.  That is the correct approach to take in respect of Bills.</P>
    <P>Committees have a great deal more to do than consider Bills in detail.  One of their most valuable functions should be to examine people in regard to events and public policy.  Instead of exclusively looking at what happens in Westminster we should more properly look at what <Col N="1813" /> happens in Washington where committees of this kind are very powerful and useful instruments in the examination of public policy and the investigation of scandals or alleged scandals.  The fundamental system in Washington is different from that here, but that does not mean we cannot adapt a system of that kind to our requirements.</P>
    <P>Because of the necessity to call Ministers and Ministers of State and to ensure they are examined and answerable to committees and because there is no question of privilege in regard to Ministers since they are already Members of the House, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Keogh so that these powers can be added to the powers and jurisdictions of the committee.  If one reads through the 15 headings of the motion passed on 7 April one will find that the jurisdiction of the committee is quite limited in many respects.  It does not extend beyond the jurisdiction of a committee of the whole House at present and it does not allow the committee to take initiatives.  Interpreted literally it means the Government will continue to dominate committees in the same way as they dominate the House. That would be unsatisfactory and would not relieve the frustration referred to by Deputy Power, which is the wish of many of us as legislators.  The Minister should give the fullest consideration to this amendment which would immeasurably improve the effectiveness and value of these committees.  They will certainly perform a valuable function in terms of expediting the business of the House and allowing it to be carried out more fully and more rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on managing to pilot through this package of Dáil reform, but I am critical of it because to a large extent the jury is still out on how effective the new package of reforms will prove to be.  I can understand that Deputy Bruton, who has come to be associated with pushing the need for Dáil reform, would feel especially enthusiastic.  But I cannot believe that all will be changed and changed utterly, that <Col N="1814" /> we can impose this new system on the old and expect that there will be far wider participation by the House and automatically much greater productivity and quality legislation.  However, I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State in progressing the matter this far this quickly.  I regard the Whips as being a bit like personnel managers.  The personality of a personnel manager often determines whether or not progress can be made. This personnel manager has managed to persuade the other Whips, almost by stealth on occasion, of the reality of Dáil reform, in so far as the Government sees it, in advance of this package.</P>
      <P>There has been a marked reluctance among Members of the House to appreciate the extent of progress made and the necessity to address the implications of these changes.  The Whips generally &mdash; and perhaps I should only speak for myself &mdash; did not appreciate that this was such a high priority for the Government. If one looks at the last term, which was the first term of this Dáil, reform was probably its major achievement; or it was the major achievement as sold to the people by the Minister of State, which is almost the same thing in politics.  The Minister of State has been especially successful in convincing the public and the absent press corps that we have profound radical, fundamental and complete change.  I congratulate him on that.  We will all be the winners in this House as a result of his public relations job.  As a Member of this House and Whip for one of the groups in the House I am entitled to look behind it a little bit deeper than has been probed so far by some of our critics in the media who have been calling for this for such a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes and look forward to seeing how they work in practice. I welcome the Minister's commitment to review them regularly and I hope to take on board improvements as the need manifests itself.  It is regrettable that in the public mind, Dáil reform has come to be equated with the setting up of new committees.  It is not as simple as that. Dáil committees alone do not constitute Dáil reform.  Many questions must be <Col N="1815" /> asked about how efficaciously the committees will work.  I expressed the view privately and at Whips' meetings that, for example, this House cannot be taken as another version of the &ldquo;mother of parliaments&rdquo;, the House of Commons, where committees have a very long history and where in some cases they have worked very well.  There are, after all, 166 Members of this House and there are 650 Members of the House of Commons. When one takes 30 Ministers from this House and the Front Bench spokespeople, one does not have endless scope for drafting Deputies onto more than a dozen committees.  In the House of Commons there is a very wide range of skills, interests, experiences and backgrounds from which to draw.  There is proportionally a great deal less in this House.  When one takes on board the fact that there has never been any great enthusiasm expressed in this House by the Deputies outside the front benches to become fully involved in the legislative process, one has some idea of the hill we have to climb.  It cannot be automatically assumed that because the committees are now in place and the participation of all Deputies is invited, that it will be forthcoming. The Minister in his speech indicated that committees are very fine in theory but he said that they required a further ingredient which was the wholehearted support and co-operation of all Deputies and a commitment by them to improve current practices and procedures. I endorse that.  It is a salutary word of warning from the Government Whip, because our last state will be worse then our first if it emerges after a reasonable period that the system is not working.</P>
    <P>I see the main defects in the performance of the Dáil as being capable of being summarised as follows.  There are, and have been, too few sitting days. There has been an inability to address urgent topical issues.  Too few legislative measures have been enacted in each term.  One could add that there have been inadequate and ineffective procedures to make the Government accountable.  This <Col N="1816" /> is an especially major defect in a parliamentary system that tolerates a situation where the Executive dictates the decision making process rather than the Dáil.  The combined effect has been to diminish the remnants of the Dáil and to have questions increasingly raised about its capacity to respond to the challenges of modern society.</P>
    <P>I agree that theoretically the existence of legislative committees ought to free the Dáil Chamber to get on with other business while the detailed work of line by line examination of legislation will preoccupy the committees.  If the committees are to work as intended it will require the participation of a majority of TDs as legislators and not merely in the fashion that many backbench TDs have conducted themselves up to now.  This will be a culture shock to the system.  Up to now a majority of backbench TDs have left the drudgery of legislation to their front bench colleagues and have concentrated on being re-elected.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be presumed that this tradition &mdash; in the old hallowed sense of that term &mdash; can be expected to change automatically.  Indeed, one of the most remarkable features of the present Dáil is the number of Deputies presenting regularly in the division lobbies for votes. There was a clamour for this debate. Perhaps the cart is coming after the horse, as Deputy O'Malley said, in the sense that the motions have been put through already.  We have not had Deputies jumping up and down in their seats indicating a wish to get in on the debate at this stage.  It would be far more injurious to the reputation of this House if, because we are in the unique position of a Government that dominates the House in terms of numbers, many Deputies felt that the traditional obligation on them to present for divisions in the House were to diminish.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of resources.  As I recovered from the late equaliser I turned on my monitor and I thought for a moment that the world had stood on its head when I heard Deputy Power dispensing largesse and announcing what he would do to make this Chamber <Col N="1817" /> work more effectively.  I thought there had been a coup close to the heart of Government.  I listened carefully to what he said about how chairpersons and conveners would be paid a modest stipend. What Deputy Bruton has said about Opposition conveners being involved is news to me and I do not think it will get as far as the smaller parties in the House.  However, it raises an important question in as much as we have discussed the necessity to resource these committees adequately if they are to function.  That is especially important having regard to the imbalance which exists as between the resources available to the Executive and those available to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Traditionally Governments have arrogated to themselves not only the expertise of the entire Civil Service but increasingly a panoply of special advisers, whereas the Opposition are expected to contribute meaningfully to complex legislation without access to similar resources. It is especially exacerbated in the case of small parties like my own, the Green Party and Independent Deputies, where an arbitrary figure of seven Deputies is fixed before any financial assistance is available.  I would be quite satisfied to forego any bite at the cherry, so to speak, that may or may not be in prospect for me or my group, in return for some modest resources for my group to equip itself to cope with the new situation.  It is not acceptable that Independent Members of the House and small parties have no access to any such resources.</P>
    <P>I refer approvingly to the section of the Minister's speech where he makes the point that he expects all Members of this House to play their part in making the system of Dáil reform work.  If that is to happen and we are seriously and genuinely expecting all Members to participate fully, then the Standing Order that prevents a group such as mine from having any access to resources to enable them to cope with that challenge is unfair. Deputies who are subjected to that unequal treatment are expected to participate fully.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley proposed an amendment <Col N="1818" /> on the answerability of Ministers. That is an argument that we have heard in the past and I presume the Government will vote down the amendment.  The Minister said the process will be subject to regular reviews.  Another important and critical aspect of Dáil reform, if it is to be meaningful, is the extent and quality of accountability in the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister appears to be prepared to introduce the kind of schedule whereby there will not be any significant diminution of plenary sessions of the House and opportunities to the Opposition parties to raise pressing issues of the day.  However, the quality and style to which we have become accustomed and the standards we accept, for example, at Question Time, leave something to be desired.  Deputy O'Malley has argued that if Ministers were answerable it might obviate the necessity for certain tribunals of inquiry and so on.  The chairman of the only tribunal sitting at present has made the explicit point that if certain questions, over a certain period, had been answered fully there would not have been any necessity for that tribunal.  It is frustrating when the Ceann Comhairle gets up and says: &ldquo;I have no responsibility for how Ministers answer questions&rdquo; when Ministers patently evade questions or give minimal information.  For example, in the papers which were open to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry a senior civil servant congratulated a junior civil servant on how expertly he had managed to put the questioning Deputy off on the wrong scent.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that one needs to know precisely the form and the nature of the question to be put in order to get important information in the public interest.  The transfer of questions needs to be examined.  There has been a growing practice recently of transferring questions, particularly from the Taoiseach to Ministers.  These questions can only be answered by the Taoiseach because they relate to things which he said or did, yet they are transferred to other Ministers. There are examples of questions being transferred where in any reasonable <Col N="1819" /> assessment it would appear that the Minister to whom the questions were addressed should be required to reply.</P>
    <P>The media too have obligations.  Some sections of the media have been very vocal in criticising, often from an uninformed position, the performance of Members of this House.  Competition and rivalry between parties and politicians being what it is, unless the committees are assured of a reasonable amount of fair coverage that will be a further bucket of cold water on top of the efforts that have been made.</P>
    <P>One of Deputy Bruton's hobby-horses is the question of the privilege of Members of this House.  I am not sure why he is so agitated about this because there is already a system in this House whereby Deputies are made accountable for any transgression or abuse of privilege conferred on Members of this House.  If any member of the public is fearful of losing his employment or of sanctions being taken against him as a result of coming to a Deputy of this House, purely out of public interest and with no other motive, with information of far reaching importance, then the system of parliamentary democracy would be at risk and the citizens would be the losers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Open parliamentary debate is a cornerstone of democracy and legislators have a vital role to play in this important process.  However, if this process is to take place in an effective and open manner it must be supplemented by modern and efficient procedures.  Idealism alone is not sufficient.  Our society is changing rapidly and our democratic institutions must reflect this change if they are to have a meaningful function.</P>
      <P>The new committee system marks a major advance in attaining this greater democratic effectiveness, particularly in comparison with the old system which was often the source of much frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four new committees proposed in the Programme for Partnership are an <Col N="1820" /> integral part of the ambitious proposals of this Government.  They will involve all the Members of this House in a wide-ranging legislative agenda.  There will be many positive aspects to the new committees which will greatly enhance the democratic function of this House.  They will monitor the activities of the various Government Departments.  This process should increase the influence of Members of this House on Government policy.  The fact that the committees will have the ability to consider the Estimates for the public services represents a major improvement given that up to at least last year many Estimates were not fully discussed, indeed some were not discussed.</P>
    <P>Another commendable aspect of the new committees is their emphasis on equality and that they will have the power to consider the impact of legislation on equality.  Equality should be an integral part of our democratic system and the committees will make a major contribution in ensuring that this vital principle is respected and enforced.</P>
    <P>All too often the Members of this House, occupied as they are with constituency work, do not have as much time as they would like to study other issues. For that reason I welcome the fact that briefing sessions will be held between departmental officials and the committees. This will allow for a more indepth awareness of the issues concerned which will enrich the level of debate in this House.  This is a very important aspect of the whole new procedure and I want assurances from the Minister that we will have the co-operation and support of officials in the relevant Departments because that is not always the case.  The success or failure of these committees will depend on the goodwill of the Minister and, in turn, of his officials, irrespective of the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a major change.  It will, for the first time, give Deputies an opportunity to participate in a meaningful way.  Most legislation that comes before us is drafted by civil servants and, while they have served the State well, I welcome the new procedure whereby we can invite persons <Col N="1821" /> who prepare reports and who have a positive impact and input in advance of legislation being introduced.  For that reason I want the Minister's assurance that full co-operation and support will be forthcoming. To give an example, the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, was dealt with in committee and the Minister showed great flexibility in relation to the contributions made by Members on that committee. That resulted in very good legislation and I compliment the Members of the House on their involvement and contribution at that time.</P>
    <P>Debate is at the heart of the democratic process, these new committees will allow Members to examine Bills in greater detail and to have a greater input.  In addition there will be more time for discussion on Committee Stage of Bills.  This new system will allow for more open and positive discussion as opposed to the more adversarial system which can often be counter-productive.  It provides a forum in which all are free to make a constructive contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that co-operation was needed on all sides of the House.  I endorse that because there will be teething problems.  It will take time to get used to the new system.  It is up to all Members to ensure the success of this reform for which they have called for years and which gives us the opportunity to participate fully.</P>
    <P>I understand that a clerk and other assistance will be available to the committees. That is important because they must have the necessary backup to ensure success.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of this House, I have been a member of all party committees, some of which were very successful and others which were not.  I would like to pay tribute to the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism which prepared 14 or 15 reports, some of which have been acted upon in this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal before us.  I compliment the Minister and all the parties who worked out the proposals to ensure that we all have the opportunity of participating in a more meaningful way <Col N="1822" /> on behalf of the community.  We have heard repeated criticisms of the antiquated systems in the Dáil, and of the ineffectiveness of Deputies and backbenchers. This is our opportunity to make this system work.  It is in all our interests and if we are successful we will do a service, not alone to this House, but to the community at large who look to us to bring in good laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Labour Party Whip and one of the people involved with the Minister of State at the Taoiseach's Office in promoting, since the new Government came in, the concept of change in the format and running times of this House, I commend the Minister for the patient manner in which he dealt with this matter through the Whips' meetings.  Although it was a commitment by the two parties in the partnership Government, and one of the items documented and publicised as being a welcome change, the Minister has taken the unusual step of coming back to the House on two occasions: first, in a consultative way and then reconvening special meetings of the Whips which dealt specifically with the format in which these new committees would come into operation.  He did that in the knowledge that there was a widespread demand among all parties in this House, as well as among the public and in the media, that changes should be made in the way this House carries on its business.  This privilege does not rest with Deputy John Bruton or with anybody in particular.  Indeed, the Minister's patience at Whips' meetings confirms that there was initially a reluctance on the part of people, reflected again today by Deputy Rabbitte, to make these changes because the implications for the smaller Opposition parties were unclear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parties change from one side of this House to the other, from being in Government to being in Opposition and <i>vice versa.</i> Any changes we make, therefore, should be formulated in such a way that they will be fair to all Members of this House regardless of their party.  They should be able to use the legislative arm of the State to the best of their ability and <Col N="1823" /> ensure that the electorate they represent are served in the best way possible.  There is a perception in the minds of the public that we do not use this House to the best of our ability, but these committees represent a step towards changing that. They are not to be confused, as Deputy O'Malley has obviously done, with other committees of the House.  He referred to them as if they would have the same standing orders as exist for Oireachtas joint committees, such as the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, the committee on financial affairs, the services committee and other standing committees of the House.  These committees we are debating now are select legislative committees and their role will be to examine all legislation in detail on Committee Stage.  Legislation will first be dealt with in a plenary session of the House in a Second Stage debate, during which Deputies who have an interest in the legislation will be involved. Individual items of legislation will then be referred to the relevant select legislative committee to deal with the detailed work that takes place on Committee Stage. This will include, as the Minister said, the line by line examination of all legislation and particularly of Estimates.  This will represent the real work of these committees. They will sit initially on separate days from the plenary sittings of the House.  The Minister has indicated that we can review their operation and, if we make errors in our suggestions now, they can be considered at a later stage.  In the interim the committees will sit on Tuesday mornings up to 1 p.m. and all day on Fridays in both this Chamber, which will not be in plenary session, and the Seanad Chamber, if agreement is reached with their Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The committees will also sit in other suitably equipped premises within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas and will be televised by the media.  This will highlight the important work that takes place on Committee Stage of a Bill.  When a Bill concludes on Committee Stage it will return to a plenary session of the House for final <Col N="1824" /> approval of all Members of this House. That is how legislation should be dealt with efficiently here.</P>
    <P>The benefit for all Members of this House, particularly the Opposition, is that it will make available the plenary sessions of the House for other important work which might be delayed under the existing process.  Plenary sessions of the House can then be used for Second Stages of Bills or for debates on topical matters.  This would be in contrast to the present fiasco that takes place daily on the Order of Business.  It will make the Taoiseach and Ministers more available for questioning.  It will eliminate the problem of time running out on priority questions, when some Members because of time constraints never get an opportunity to put their question despite all their work.</P>
    <P>The Government is trying to ensure that this House is more relevant to the needs of Members.  It will also give to Members appointed to these committees a greater input into legislation.  They have been criticised in the past, by the media in particular, for not attending to their legislative work because of the demands of their constituents.  This new procedure will represent a blending of our legislative role with our constituency representation. Let us hope that these committees will operate efficiently and that the media will highlight their work.  The media often criticise the operations of this House and occasionally that is brought to their attention by Members of this House.  When trying to reach agreement on the Adjournment of the House, or on the number of sitting days in a particular week, normally agreed between the Whips, Members &mdash; for obvious reasons &mdash; often accuse the Government for not sitting more frequently and call votes on the matter.  That immediately attracts media attention. The House then criticises the media for criticising the House, when we, so to speak, invite them to do so.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is fully committed to this committee procedure.  It is part of the Programme for a Partnership Government and we feel it is a welcome <Col N="1825" /> change.  However, it should not be confused with the other committees of the House such as that covered by the earlier motion today, when for the first time, a Foreign Affairs Committee was established. The terms of reference of this committee have been agreed and the Tánaiste has conceded to most of the demands of the Opposition in this area. However, we reserve the constitutional right that a Minister in that type of committee is answerable only to the House and not necessarily to the committee.  I am sure that all Ministers will want to avail of these committees, but the legislative committees will have to be used by Ministers because their legislation will have been initiated in the plenary session of the House on Second Stage.  The committee will be chaired by another Member of the House.  The Minister will be present for the debate on amendments to concede them or otherwise, and there will be votes.  The Bill will eventually return to a plenary sitting of the House for the Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>What could be more appropriate and effective than the proper use in this way of the committee system?  The Minister has said this could not be successful if it was imposed on top of the existing system.  He is trying now to accommodate all views by separating the two systems initially.  It can then be reviewed and hopefully we can make better use of our time in the four or five days a week that the House will sit.  In this way we hope to be able to deal with the affairs of the State while looking after the needs of our constituents also.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House this evening in relation to the committees is probably the most important work the House will do during the lifetime of this Dáil.  It is important to consider the committee system in its totality. We should look on members of committees <Col N="1826" /> as not just having the right to debate but to make suggestions.  During the last Dáil I was a member of the EC legislation committee which did more work than it received credit for.  There were a number of reasons for that, for instance, it was not subject to the glare of publicity that is focused on the Dáil Chamber.  Many of the reports prepared by that committee went unsung and, in many cases, unread by the media.</P>
      <P>Members of the general public whose lives were affected by some of the recommendations of that committee did not realise the reports were available.</P>
      <P>I am sure everyone accepts that the new committee system will have teething problems but I expect that within 12 to 18 months they will be very efficient. They will give Deputies an opportunity to play their role as legislators.  In the past Deputies have been unable to make full contributions in regard to legislation because of time constraints or because of being a member of the Government party.  A Deputy might be unpopular if following the Minister's contribution he or she put a point to a full plenary session of this House.  In establishing these committees we are modernising this House and bringing it to a new level.  The committees will operate a system whereby all legislation introduced in this House will be fine-combed on Committee Stage. This will help to eliminate some of the defects in legislation passed in this House, some of which have had enormous consequences for the Government. Yesterday, it was necessary to introduce a Bill as previous legislation was not watertight.  If legislation is to be subject to examination by the courts and the best briefed barristers here, it is important when drafting it that the same backup service should be available as to those outside who may wish to contest any action or process in regard to enacted legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These committees provide an opportunity for backbenchers to play a major role in this House.  They enable Deputies to represent what they see as their role. For too long much of our time has been taken up, not working as legislators, but <Col N="1827" /> as public representatives or semi-ombudsmen dealing with constituents. They wish Deputies first to represent them and second to work as legislators. These committees will provide Deputies with a new opportunity to combine both roles to great effect with regard to the future development of democracy.</P>
    <P>I hope these committees will receive the media attention they deserve in the years ahead.  In the past, meetings of the committees of this House rarely received media coverage.  This is an opportunity for the media to highlight the role of the Oireachtas for the ordinary citizen. People are of the view that we do very little work here but that is not true.  We do a great deal of unrecorded work which, to many people outside the House, might appear irrelevant which is not the case.</P>
    <P>These committees mark a new beginning for the House and a new role for its Members.  If they are operated properly and to full effect they will portray a new vision of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the elected representatives to the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagah</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the many valid criticisms by visitors to this House is the small number of Deputies present.  They assume that because 166 Deputies are elected approximately 100 should be present at any time.  They do not realise that Members work ouside the Dáil Chamber.  I have been a Member of this House for 24 years and served on various committees of the House.  Those committees have operated outside this Chamber in Setanta House and elsewhere without much notice being taken of their activities.  The work of those committees often went totally unsung.  Deputies do not continue in this business if they do not receive publicity.  However, it is unfair to criticise Deputies for not being in this Chamber, especially when the people in the press gallery are aware of the position but are not prepared to report it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that select committees are being set up to deal with legislation. Every party in the House, particularly in Opposition, has called for this and my <Col N="1828" /> party is no exception.  The committees will now be established and it is up to Members on all sides to ensure that they work.  As Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier, there may be a reluctance on the part of backbenchers to participate in committees because they may have got into the habit of not participating in debating legislation.  I do not think that will be the case.  I participated on Committee Stage of the Roads Bill and there was always a full turnout.  I welcome the committees and I am confident that all parties will participate.  Backbenchers realise that it is also important for them to participate. They will not have any excuse for not participating.</P>
    <P>I hope the committees will be televised and receive media coverage so that the general public can see that their elected representatives are participating fully in debating legislation.  The new committees are particularly important for backbench Members of the Government Parties.  With the operation of the guillotines in previous administrations and in this Dáil backbenchers rarely get an opportunity to participate in debates, they may have to share time and may be allocated only five minutes which is not adequate, one requires longer than that to make an effective point.  The establishment of these committees will create an opportunity for those members to contribute. When a general debate is introduced in the House by the Taoiseach or a Minister, a Deputy from all other parties is allowed to contribute before a member of the Labour Party.  Indeed, the four members of the Democratic Left have fared better in contributions to the House than the 22 backbench members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to have that tested with my colleague, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy McManus any time.  The quality of contributions from Wicklow Deputies has been very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way the proceedings of this House are operated.  The Government <Col N="1829" /> has 100 members, the Opposition has 60 and Opposition Members are allocated 50 per cent of the time of the House. That leaves very little time in which backbenchers may contribute.  Therefore, I welcome the establishment of the select committees of the House where we will have an opportunity to contribute more frequently.  Nobody wants to come in here and listen interminably to another speaker.  Members want an opportunity to contribute themselves.</P>
    <P>Staffing of committees has not been given sufficient consideration.  The House is operating with a limited staff and because of Civil Service rules, staff numbers cannot be increased to an acceptable level.  Constraints also apply in regard to the money we may spend on staffing, as outlined in the Estimate for the Oireachtas.  While there will be not be any great increase in the amount of money allocated for increasing staff levels, there will be a huge increase in the staff's workload from those at the top down to the ushers, our secretaries and so on. Deputies will be spending much more time in the House and will require more staff, but there has been no mention of increasing staff numbers.  If we require more time from our staff for the select committees, the joint Oireachtas committees will suffer.  Those committees are already experiencing difficulties in regard to resources &mdash; staffing and financial resources.</P>
    <P>While being enthusiastic about increasing the number of sitting hours and the various committee meetings of the House, we must remember that such committees require people to staff them, record the proceedings and so on.  The question of staff is important.  I hope the Minister will indicate that finance will be made available to increase staffing levels so that the work of the committees can be carried out efficiently.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his concern in regard to Dáil reform.  He genuinely wants to see reform take place and this House operating more efficiently; none of us should have a quarrel in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> My concern relates to the accountability of Ministers to the committees. We have put down an amendment which we will be pressing, to ensure such accountability.  Those committees will sit in various rooms of the House which means the work of the House will be more streamlined.  However, the committees will have no greater power than the House dealing with the Committee Stage of Bills.  That is my main criticism in regard to the new committees.  We are merely window dressing this issue.  I am not being offensive to the Minister in that regard because I am aware of his commitment to Oireachtas reform.</P>
    <P>If we are genuine about reform we should be talking about root and branch reform.  We should completely reformulate the way this House operates, but unfortunately that is not what is happening. We are putting a little oil on the hinges and stopping the place from creaking and that is not genuine and comprehensive reform.  Committees should be able to call Ministers to account and request that they attend and explain elements of policy in greater depth than they do at present in the House.  That would go some way towards proper reform.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the role of backbenchers on the committees and said that they believe they will have a greater role to play.  I welcome that, but unfortunately it is not enough. They will be participating only on the Committee Stage of Bills and will have an input in Estimate debates.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate. I thought more Deputies would have been in the House for the debate, but they may be otherwise engaged because of the event taking place today.  I thank Deputies who have thrown a number of bouquets in my direction in relation to Dáil reform.  Deputies have stated that I am committed to Dáil reform.  That is true and I hope during the lifetime of this Government that that will become more apparent.  I will begin by throwing a <Col N="1831" /> number of bouquets around in acknowledgement of the role played by the Opposition Whips in regard to Dáil reform and to my colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Ferris, who is an assistant Whip on the Government side.  I thank all the Whips for their co-operation in this regard.  It is not easy to get messages across to members of parliamentary parties, Leaders of parties and so on, who are busy with many other aspects of their work.  The Whips have made my job much easier by being open and willing to discuss change and we have put forward a good package.  It is a start and I would like to see it continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly address a number of the major points made during the debate. Members are getting somewhat hung up about Ministers being answerable to the committees when what they mean is that they want the committees to have the power to summon Ministers to attend. Ministers will be answerable in that they will have to attend the committees when legislation and Estimates concerning them are being debated.  It will be up to members of the committee to question Ministers about expenditure in their areas of responsibility at those meetings. As Deputy Ferris pointed out, these are legislative committees and we have other committees &mdash; for example, the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and the Women's Rights Committee &mdash; who will have an involvement in the area of policy, etc.  Ministers will be answerable to the committees in so far as they will have to attend meetings, answer questions in regard to the Estimates for their Departments and deal with the Committee Stages of Bills. Members may be somewhat confused about the question of the answerability of Ministers to committees and the right of committees to summon Ministers to attend meetings.  The primary role of the committees is to deal with legislation.  If they summon Ministers to attend meetings on a regular basis or cause conflict, Members of the House may adopt an adversarial stance towards them.  This <Col N="1832" /> would reduce the effectiveness of the committees in terms of dealing with legislation.</P>
    <P>There is room for the expansion of the role of the committees at a later date. However, we cannot expand their role and leave all the other committees in place.  It is important that we see how this small movement forward works in practice and over a period finalise logistical problems such as the running of the committees and timetables.  We can discuss the expansion of the role of the committees when these issues are finalised and the system is working effectively. I will be open to doing this.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Estimates and the detailed questioning of Ministers by the members of the committee.  Ministers will have to justify the expenditure of money under their Departments' Estimates. Deputy Bruton referred to the scrutiny of the Estimates and asked that Estimates be introduced before the money is spent so that they can be discussed by the committee. Due to other events, the Estimates for this year were not published prior to Christmas.  I am sure that Deputy O'Malley and other Deputies in the House will be aware that during the lifetime of the previous two Governments &mdash; I think going back as far as 1987 &mdash; Estimates were produced prior to Christmas.  I hope that the committee system and the debates on committee reports once a month will enable us to discuss the Estimates before any money is expended.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputies about the need for more resources.  I have taken this matter on board previously and will continue to do so.  I also agree that Opposition parties need more resources than Government parties.  I do not think any of the Deputies opposite will find me wanting in my efforts to secure the maximum amount of resources in terms of money and staffing. Members of the staff of the Oireachtas will act as clerks to these committees.  I have insisted on this as these people are held in very high regard.  The various Departments will appoint people to liaise with the committees and give them <Col N="1833" /> back-up.  This will be of some assistance to the committees.  The Joint Committee on Employment was the best example of how this system works in practice.  I hope that this system works well in the future and, as I said, I will seek more resources if they are required.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and the Whips for the various parties for their co-operation <Col N="1834" /> in dealing with this matter.  I believe this fundamental change in the way this House conducts its business will be welcomed by the public and Members of the House.  I repeat my commitment to keep the matter under review and to change any aspect that is not working or is not seen to be working.</P>

      <P>I understand from my own Whip that that is the case.  However, I think I have one minute left.</P>
      <P>There is irrefutable evidence that the increase in the rate of VAT from 16 per cent to 21 per cent has already led to substantial job losses in the manufacturing sector of the clothing and footwear industry.  This is unacceptable.  The increase in the rate of VAT is anti-jobs, but it is not too late for the Minister to rescind his decision to increase the rate to 21 per cent.  If he fails to do so it would be a cruel blow for this indigenous industry upon which so many jobs in the manufacturing and retail sectors depend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> The Minister made the point last night that a substantial portion of the goods manufactured in this country are exported.  This is true to some degree, but we should not forget that the companies concerned would not be in a position to export goods to foreign markets if they had not first gained a strong foothold in the domestic market.  It is because they are so strong in this market that they are in a position to seek markets abroad. Therefore the point the Minister made last night is unsustainable.  On that note I ask him to rescind his decision to increase the rate of VAT from 16 per cent to 21 per cent and to accept the motion this evening.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion and to compliment my colleague, Deputy Yates, for introducing it.  It is timely, and having spoken to Members of the House today, I feel it has the support of a majority of Deputies, but this may not be reflected in the vote later tonight.</P>
      <P>I speak on behalf of retail traders and manufacturers in the Border region who will be devastated by this hike in the rate of VAT from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. It is unsustainable.  In my own county of Cavan one excellent manufacturer was forced to close towards the end of last year because of the bungling of the Government during the currency crisis when it failed to take action in time.  That industry manufactured ladies' fashions and 30 jobs were lost.  Many other small retailers in my constituency and along the Border will suffer the same fate because the effects of this increase in the rate of VAT to 21 per cent will be particularly felt in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People will be encouraged to travel to Northern Ireland where the VAT rate is 17.5 per cent.  If the Minister felt it was <Col N="1838" /> necessary to increase the rate, he should not have increased it beyond the rate prevailing in Northern Ireland, which is in direct competition with us.  Despite all the talk about harmonisation of VAT rates and the need to create a level playing pitch, people will, as I said, be encouraged to travel there.  Indeed, despite all my protestations in this House, it took years to get the message across to the Government that the rates of excise duty on petrol were encouraging people to travel to Northern Ireland in huge numbers to buy petrol and, needless to say, other household items with the result that many small businesses in the Border region were devastated.  Small clothing retail outlets in my constituency will suffer the same fate on this occasion. I ask the Minister to back off, to accept the good advice that is being given to him and not to be stubborn.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that this increase is necessary to create jobs, but there is no point in creating jobs at the expense of others.  It may look well in Government statements that a certain number of jobs have been created but we also have to consider how many jobs have been lost as a consequence.  Indeed, yesterday the Minister said that it was necessary to increase telephone charges by 300 per cent to create jobs.  However no account has been taken of the effect this will have on people.</P>
    <P>Small retail outlets already face severe competition from the multinationals. These multinationals generally provide a poor service.  The customer picks the items he wants from a rail and then goes to the cashier to pay for them, whereas in the small retail outlets one can have five or six assistants to assist a customer choose their clothes or footwear.  This is a specialised job and it is an ideal position for a bright young girl or boy.  The Minister need be in no doubt that these young people will lose their jobs as a result of his proposal.  If one is out of the business for even a short time it can prove difficult to get back into it.</P>
    <P>I wish to allow my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, contribute to the debate.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to what <Col N="1839" /> the people are saying and take heed of the advice he is being given.  He will be admired for that.  I hope this appeal does not fall on deaf ears.  From talking to Government backbenchers who are involved in business I know this increase is devastating.  They should vote for this motion because they know where the benefits will be reaped.</P>

      <P>One of the hallmarks of any Government's understanding of the people's problems is how it responds to pressure where the retention of jobs is at stake.  If one reads the measure introduced by the Minister for Finance in the budget it will become obvious that the claims by manufacturers in the clothing and footwear industries are real and substantial.  If the VAT rates proposed are introduced there will be increased clothing imports and substantial job losses in both the retailing and manufacturing sectors.</P>
      <P>Many of the jobs in those sectors were established a number of years ago by family enterprises and Government organisations.  Many jobs are located in the remote parts of the country where businesses have to contend with transport charges, poor infrastructure and related problems.  It is obvious that the cashflow advantage to those who import will lead to a genuine reduction in jobs.  One of the pillars of this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government is not alone the creation of new jobs but the retention of existing ones.  Speaker after speaker at the recent Labour Party Conference condemned the VAT increases as being out of hand. As a junior partner in this Coalition Government, the Labour Party has the opportunity this evening to vote against these increases which will result in a reduction of employment and general economic activity in their constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from speaking to manufacturers in the west, in Westport, Erris, Tourmakeady and other districts in Mayo, that if the Government does not reduce the rate of VAT and the employers' PRSI contribution in manufacturing enterprises many of these hard <Col N="1840" /> won jobs will be lost in areas that cannot sustain themselves even at the best of times.  The Minister for Finance, and the Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies, should recognise the veracity of the claims made by manufacturers in their constituencies that jobs will be lost in the local towns and villages due to imports from Northern Ireland and other parts of the EC which are to the detriment of our economy.</P>
    <P>If the hallmark of this Government is to be the retention of existing jobs and the creation of new ones, it is ridiculous in the extreme that a budget that is being portrayed as being advantageous to the country should strike a mortal blow at the heart of an industry that has been fundamental to the creation and sustenance of the fabric of rural life. The Minister for Finance should drop this increase in VAT and the Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies should put pressure on him to do so.</P>

      <P>It is important to put this VAT increase in context.  Fianna Fáil is committed to creating sustainable jobs and ensuring well-founded economic growth.  This necessitates firm control of <Col N="1841" /> our public finances.  In order to increase spending in some vital areas it was inevitable there would have to be some increases in taxation.  Budget formulation must maintain a careful balance between prudence and economic growth. Members opposite seem to have forgotten this important principle. However, recalling their attempts to introduce budgets in the past, it would seem they never took that principle on board.</P>
      <P>With regard to VAT on clothing, certain factors have to be taken into account such as our obligation arising from our participation in the Single Market and the overall budgetary situation.  The EC Directive on VAT rates adopted last October obliges member states to have a single standard rate which must be at least 15 per cent.  Clothing and footwear must ultimately go on the standard rate of VAT.  Are Opposition Deputies suggesting that we have an <i>à la carte</i> approach to our membership of the EC? I doubt if they are.</P>
      <P>Where member states had to increase the rate of VAT on goods and services which were previously at a reduced rate, the Directive gave the option of applying, as a temporary measure, a parking rate of at least 12.5 per cent until the end of 1996.  All the products which were at the 16 per cent rate prior to the budget were destined for standard rating as a consequence of this Directive.  The Minister signalled this very clearly in the 1992 budget.  He had to decide in this budget whether to move these goods to the standard rate on this occasion or to what extent, if any, to avail of the parking rate option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the decisive factor was budgetary.  While a limited application of the parking rate was possible for labour intensive services&mdash;thereby benefiting in excess of 50,000 jobs&mdash;a wider application to the remaining commodities such as clothing, footwear and telecommunications simply could not be afforded.  I would like the Opposition to bear the following figures in mind&mdash;a reduction from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent for clothing and footwear alone <Col N="1842" /> would cost the Exchequer almost £48 million in lost revenue this year alone and £77 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for those involved in the clothing industry because of the difficulties they face.  I said this at the meetings I attended.</P>

      <P>Those industries share these difficulties with many other branches of Irish industry.  Such budgetary decisions are not taken lightly.  On the contrary, they are taken only after a very careful process of consideration. Opposition Deputies have languished on the benches opposite for so long they no longer have any real concept of the responsibilities and difficult decisions that are part and parcel of being in Government.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that the clothing sector is labour intensive at both retail and manufacturing levels.  The Government must, however, decide what is best for the economy as a whole in terms of promoting economic growth and the sustainable jobs that flow from that. Concern has been expressed that the higher VAT rate would encourage retailers to import cheaper supplies and this would adversely impact on clothing manufactured here.  Unfortunately, high import penetration is already a well established feature of the Irish fashion trade with almost 80 per cent of the total clothing on the market being imported before the budget.  This figure has not changed much in recent years.  May I remind Opposition Deputies that the standard rate of VAT applies to all clothing sold here, regardless of country of origin?  Would Opposition Deputies suggest that we adopt some form of protectionism against foreign clothing manufacturers?  Up to 65 per cent of Irish manufactured clothing is exported and that will not be affected by the VAT changes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find most amusing about this motion is its attempt to portray Fine Gael as a champion of the clothing industry when the opposite is true.  Fine Gael's <Col N="1843" /> credibility in this area is non-existent as Deputy Yates knows.</P>

      <P>In case he has forgotten, let me refresh his memory by taking him back to 1982 when he was a newcomer to this House.  His Leader, the then Minister for Finance&mdash;the only one who did not succeed in steering a budget through the Dáil&mdash;attempted to slap a punitive 18 per cent rate of tax on footwear and clothing.  I remind Deputy Yates that this was 13 per cent more than the prudent 5 per cent imposed by the present Minister for Finance.  In a notorious insensitive move, Deputy Bruton also attempted to introduce VAT on children's clothing and footwear.</P>
      <P>The memories of the Members opposite are short.  There can be no doubt that this was the most objectionable budget in the history of the State.  Fortunately it was thrown out by this House and I have no doubt that the Irish clothing industry breathed a collective sigh of relief that it was free from the VAT happy clutches of Deputy Bruton.  No doubt Fine Gael would like us to forget this particularly ignoble period in their history but I think it is worth recalling when we see them leap to the defence of a clothing industry they once tried to bury in VAT.  If there was an award in politics for having a brass neck there is no doubt Fine Gael would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a leading contender, having put down this motion, in spite of its deplorable attitude to the clothing industry.  Fine Gael's credibility regarding the clothing industry amounts to nothing, or to use a clothing analogy, the Fine Gael emperor has no clothes. This motion amounts to humbug of the <Col N="1844" /> highest order, and there is consensus in this regard throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The bottom line for the Fianna Fáil Party is careful, structured growth.  We are determined to persist with this productive strategy.  Part of this process entails listening very carefully to the concerns expressed by all branches of Irish industry.  In the case of the clothing industry we will listen to the concerns with the utmost consideration.  Proposals on cost competitiveness are currently under consideration.  This is the way Fianna Fáil proceed, by way of consensus and consultation, in direct contrast to the leadfooted approach characterised by Fine Gael led by Deputy John Bruton. There is no doubt in my mind as to what is the most productive approach.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer some words of advice to Deputy Yates and his party.  I realise they are in dire straits over there but I suggest that before they put forward such opportunistic motions they jog their collective memory regarding their past actions and temper their outbursts accordingly.

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a tax on labour, and I will explain that.  I cannot understand the logic behind this motion. Let us look at the manufacturing side of this business.  Clothing and footwear manufacturers have been decimated since 1973 and one of the greatest causes was that they could not compete with importers.  If the blunt instrument of VAT reduction&mdash;it is a very expensive blunt instrument&mdash;is used to stimulate growth, of every pound spent 80 per cent will go towards importers while only 20 per cent will go to manufacturers.  There will be no cost competitive edge for the native manufacturer over the importer. Neither will there be any advantage for exporters &mdash; 65 per cent of clothing manufactured here is exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made very strong representations to the Minister for Finance to put back into the clothing industry some of the money taken by way of the VAT increase.  This must be done in such a way as to ensure a maximum effect on jobs, not as in this proposal which would favour the importer.  There should be a bias in favour of native manufacturers and incentives such as PRSI exemption <Col N="1846" /> should be given to help manufacturers compete with importers.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a depressed clothes market here but the extent to which that is due to the VAT increase is questionable. I accept also that by using the blunt instrument as proposed in this motion, to stimulate sales we would be helping the multiple stores who have a big turnover because assistance would be given on a turnover basis.  Small retailers in country areas have great difficulty competing with multiple stores.  We must find a way to eliminate the poverty trap for low paid workers and direct assistance in such a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As somebody who has fought consistently for more than 20 years for a radical overhaul in this area and who believes that much of what the Progressive Democrats said in their early days makes little sense, I am more than disappointed at their attitude to this matter.  More money is needed for this industry but it should be properly directed.  I spearheaded the equalisation of west coast costs with east coast costs. For example, the west was penalised in transport and telephone costs, and it was that fact rather than the cost of goods that determined the extent of sales.  This is the point the Opposition parties have missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> I hope the Minister will ensure that extra money is made available, particularly in view of reduced interest rates, for the clothing industry.  This money should be directed towards job creation in the retail sector, which is an area with a high labour input.  We should ensure a competitive advantage for the manufacturing sector, while not forgetting exporters. Imports should not be subsidisied&mdash;that surely must be the most regressive suggestion ever made in this House.</P>

A budget has to be framed taking into account what is envisaged for the 12 months ahead.  The budget was framed on the basis of Government requirements which will not change very much in the coming 12 months.  We all regret the decision that had to be taken to increase VAT on clothing and footwear in the interests of all our citizens.</P>

I have a particular interest in this matter as my family has had a lifelong involvement in the manufacturing and retail trade. Together with four of my brothers we employ about 300 people in the west of Ireland in the clothing trade, right through from high fashion knitwear to protective clothing.  In the retail side we have been involved in approximately 12 retail outlets throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>With some trepidation I rise to defend the Minister's imposition of the 5 per cent VAT increase, hoping that he will take on board in the Finance Bill the comments that were made in this debate last night and tonight.  I welcome the assurances that measures will be introduced in the Finance Bill to encourage and protect existing employment and to create new employment.  I do not envisage the wholesale closing down of factories or retail outlets.  The Irish industry is stronger than that.  We cannot fly from Ireland and set up in far eastern countries or in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of the VAT increase has led to a partial examination of the industry and all its facets.  There will have to be an ongoing examination of this industry which comprises diverse parts. In the main the roots of this industry are in Irish hands.  The industry was originally established behind tariff walls about 50 years ago.  A large portion, up to 50 per cent, of the output of the industry is sold on the Irish markets, and in some instances that percentage is considerably higher, especially for niche markets.  The whole output of some manufacturers is sold on the Irish market. <Col N="1850" /> This is the output of many small operators who would not have the marketing skills or the financial resources to develop markets overseas.  We must be concerned about all facets of the industry, not only with large operators or the large retail multiples.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has explained the background to the VAT increase, having indicated in the 1992 budget that the industry was destined for standard rating as a result of an EC VAT rate Directive.  I am sure that the people in the industry did not know what that meant at the time or realise that it would mean going from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Since the 1992 budget the industry in the retail sector had to cope with some terrible shocks which were not apparent when the 1992 budget was framed, for instance the currency crisis, the continuing strength of the Irish pound, interest fluctuations and a creeping recession in consumer spending power. On top of this, the campaign of at least one large retail operation who enjoy a dominant position on the Irish market has sucked up the spending power of those consumers, and that, above anything else, has damaged the traditional retail scene.</P>
    <P>Wages in the clothing trade are approximately 14 per cent higher here than they are in England.  A qualified machinist in England starts at a rate of £107 sterling as against £122 in Ireland. Employers in Ireland pay 6 per cent higher PRSI than employers in England. This total of 20 per cent makes our industry 20 per cent less competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our English counterparts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of this uncompetitiveness was overcome when our currency was at 90p against the pound sterling.  Now that we are near parity a further 10 per cent cushion in costs is gone.  The challenge facing Government is to ensure that costs to industry are reduced.  With improving economic indicators I hope that the Minister can find the necessary flexibility to carry out some <Col N="1851" /> improvements.  I am satisfied that the Minister is giving serious consideration to these matters as a result of the efforts of the Apparel Industries Federation.  I know that the Minister will consider reducing employer's PRSI so that Irish manufacturers can effectively keep their price points to retailers at a level that will overcome consumer resistance. This measure would immediately give a competitive edge to Irish manufacturers, as against a VAT reduction at the point of sale which would be of greater benefit to concerns who import a large amount of their present retail stocks.</P>
      <P>In general, I accept the figures which indicate that approximately 80 per cent of retail sales in Ireland comprise of cheap imports from low cost far eastern countries. Through wage moderation we must try to bring our wage structures into line with those in Britain.  The question must be asked whether joint labour committee wage agreements are relevant post the Single Market.  If we are operating in an open economy, market forces must be allowed to prevail.  These joint labour committee agreements oblige manufacturers to pay a fixed wage, which is reviewed each year and takes into account the cost of living etc.  I know of one operator in County Mayo employing at least 100 people in a clothing concern who will be obliged to break the law and refuse to pay the joint labour committee rate if he is to survive.  If he is obliged by law to pay the joint labour committee rate he will be forced to close down or move to a cheaper manufacturing environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the clothing industry is made up of knitwear manufacturers who produce a fashion garment for the Irish market but increasingly for our tourist visitors.  In the main they are small operators situated along the west coast from Donegal to Kerry.  During the currency crisis and the period of high interest rates a number of these operators had to <Col N="1852" /> lay off some of their workers, while others had to lay them off on a part-time basis.  The prospect of obtaining alternative employment in these areas is remote.  That sector of the industry was hammered at the end of last year when the main buying season, namely November to January, coincided with the strength of the Irish punt.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that the industry, during the past 12 months, has used a large amount of its own capital, with the assistance of the Irish Trade Board, to carry out an effective campaign called &ldquo;Look to Your Own&rdquo; to increase awareness of Irish-manufactured goods and to encourage the public to buy Irish.  It was sold on the strength of quality rather than at a price.  I would hope that the Government in considering the submission from the industry will encourage the furtherance of this campaign and, apart from paying lip service to it, devote resources to ensure that a similar type campaign can continue to enhance job prospects and job protection measures to the industry.</P>
      <P>The market development fund was successful in protecting jobs during the currency crisis.  The experiences gained from that initiative should be closely examined and I would ask the Minister to look favourably on suggestions made to him by representatives of the industry on a replacement type vehicle which would provide working capital at attractive interest rates to small companies in the labour-intensive indigenous sector.  Any new type of market development fund will have to be carefully structured to ensure that it is not only directed to companies orientated towards markets abroad but to those retailing on the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retail trade has suffered badly, especially small retail operations.  In what was once a well structured portion of the retail scene there is a chaotic situation of near everlasting special offers and sales. Sale periods are not only twice a year but more frequent, due to increased pressures on retail operators.  The time has come for legislative interference in this area to restrict genuine sale periods to <Col N="1853" /> twice a year.  Present consumer legislation is not effective and is extremely difficult to police and implement.</P>
    <P>I support the industry's submission in the main and ask the Minister not to allow statistics produced to him concerning the level of clothing imports to be his sole guide in introducing measures in the Finance Bill which can give a fillip to the industry.  I know from experience, being involved in the trade, that any help the Minister can give will be much appreciated by all involved in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to support the motion for two reasons: first, the adverse implications for jobs and, second, the fact that the actual increase does not affect the well off and the poor in our society equally.  In relation to jobs some considerable information and back-up has been supplied to us by the Apparel Industries Federation and others during the course of this controversy.  I find it difficult to accept that Deputy Hughes can support the content of these submissions as well as the increase in VAT which taken over a period of two years, is an exceptionally stiff one, that he can still blithely vote for that and say he is fully behind the submission from the Apparel Industries Federation.  I find that mesmerising and it is typical of some of the statements from Government backbenchers that have been made during this and other debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution last night the Minister <Col N="1854" /> effectively accepted the arguments that have been advanced.  He explained that because of European trends on VAT harmonisation and so on there was little room for him to manoeuvre.  The bottom line was that he accepted that it was a matter for budgetary cost and the amount of revenue he can expect to bring in.  He quantifies the loss if he were to reduce the current rate to 12.5 per cent as being £48 million.  I note the Minister availed of the opportunity to range far and wide and well away from the net point of this motion&mdash;the VAT increase on clothing and footwear.  He ranged over what he sees as further miracles in the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exceptionally difficult to see evidence of these miracles. In fairness to the Minister I will restrict my comments to the area of interest rates where there has been an improvement. We all welcome that improvement.  I am sure the Apparel Industries Federation and other employers welcome it also in terms of confidence, investment potential and so on.  For the Minister to say that this is because of the intrinsic merits of his budget is absurd.  It is because of the more realistic assessment of the valuation of the pound.  As one of the few Deputies in this House who raised this matter as early as 1 December 1992, I am entitled to say it is clearly the impact of devaluation that has brought about the situation where confidence has been restored, funds have flowed back and interest rates are moving in the right direction, as well as developments in Europe and specifically in Germany.  It is nonsense for the Minister to hang his hat and claim there is no necessity to change the increase in VAT because interest rates have improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to dwell on his general range through the economy in more detail but I am sharing time with my colleagues.  The point should be made that the Minister chose to increase the VAT rate to 21 per cent on clothing and footwear at the very nadir of the fortunes of the industry.  He claims that the <Col N="1855" /> interest rate position has improved and is an excuse for not making any alteration, yet he made that negative decision at the lowest point of fortunes in the industry when jobs were already being lost and when, in the midst of the devaluation crisis, almost all sections of this industry were most seriously impacted on by the weakness of sterling.  A great deal of the output of these manufacturers is exported directly into the sterling area. As a result they were most adversely impacted upon, nevertheless, the Minister went ahead in order to raise this £48 million in revenue.  Why the obsession with raising that?  It escapes me because even conservative economists agreed in the aftermath of the budget that the EBR at the end of the year was a good deal lower than many expected and, having regard to the employment crisis, it would have been reasonable to be flexible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and his colleagues have a very selective approach to the information with which we are providing them.  I cannot say whether the projection that 1,200 jobs will be lost in the manufacturing sector and 2,000 jobs in the retail sector is accurate.  The arguments seem cogent.  However, it is natural for people with vested interests to put forward their best case, and I do not know whether the situation is that bad. However, confronted with 300,000 people unemployed, we cannot afford to lose even one job, not to mention the number of jobs predicted in the submissions made to us.  I cannot see how Deputy Hughes can support the case, but not the purpose, of this motion.  It is amazing that Deputy Hughes's argument &mdash;with which I suppose many employers in the industry will agree&mdash;is the question of wage moderation.  I am not long enough out of the trade union movement not to recall that the rag trade is a very low paying industry.  Whereas labour unit costs may be difficult in the competitive environment in which the employers must function, wages received by workers are exceptionally low.  I cannot understand how Deputy Hughes can advocate the abolition of joint labour <Col N="1856" /> committees in this industry as a solution rather than adopting the proposal before the House.</P>
    <P>The unity on both sides of the industry is unusual.  Employers and trade unions are agreed on the objective enshrined in the resolution.  I have discussed the matter with some of my trade union colleagues and they assure me that they are extremely concerned at the possibilty of the jobs fallout resulting from this measure.  If wage levels are to be squeezed more it would be utterly unpalatable to people who work in the industry.</P>
    <P>There is another good reason for supporting this motion which has not been adverted to during the debate, the impact of these increases on the consumer. Deputy Ellis was concerned that Deputy Cox would only, quite properly, present his body to the top end of the market to be suitably garbed, which is proper and fitting for a Deputy of Deputy Cox's standing.  A great many of my constituents would not be able to avail of the same kind of tailoring as Deputy Cox and yet are subject to precisely the same 21 per cent standard rate of VAT on everything they buy.</P>

      <P>It seems callous indifference to the poorest sector of the community that this is also imposed on them. It is also interesting that it is imposed with effect from 1 March, whereas the social welfare increases do not take effect until the end of July and the increases in children's allowances do not take effect until the end of September.  Those of us who work on the ground, as most of us do, know that many parents depend on accumulated children's allowances to buy the necessary clothing for their children, the distinction between small adults, as we know from another era, and adult children is minimal.  God be with the days when Deputy Kemmy would bring down a Government on an increase of VAT on footwear and clothing.  The situation seems to have changed and I regret that because the immediate impact of this <Col N="1857" /> measure on the poverty ghettos will be extremely severe.</P>
      <P>Even if the job losses predicted are not realised, there is no doubt that the implications will be adverse.  Most sections of this industry compete with British manufacturers in particular, this measure will increase the level of import penetration which has already been achieved here.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister held out virtually no hope last night.  The package of measures he is promising and that have been so much promised in the last few weeks in the Finance Bill are not likely to tackle any of the problems of this industry.  I do not think this extreme and punitive measure is necessary in the short term.</P>

      <P>The budget proposal to increase the rate of VAT on clothing and footwear from 16 per cent to 21 per cent will disastrously suppress the already extremely depressed manufacturing and retailing clothing trade.</P>
      <P>This will lead directly to additional unemployment within these sectors estimated yesterday evening by Deputy Yates as an extra 3,000 on the unemployment register.  The clothing and footwear industry which is still a major employer in this country, is currently going through one of the worst periods in its history due to unacceptably high exchange rates and recession at the retail level.  The exchange rate has totally destroyed the industry's competitive edge for sales into Britain and sales on the home market or the rest of Europe relative to British clothing manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly we are seeing company closures every week with a consequent rapid rise in unemployment and this will continue at an accelerating rate unless this budgetary <Col N="1858" /> proposal is withdrawn, amended, or compensated for.</P>
    <P>The situation is particularly critical in my own constituency in a county where over 14,000 people are registered as unemployed, probably the highest <i>per capita</i> in the whole country.  The clothing industry has been and still is a major source of employment in Donegal.  Many of the companies there are brand leaders &mdash;Fruit of the Loom in Inishowen, Magee's of Donegal, Molloy's and Bonners of Ardara, Clubman Omega Shirts of Buncrana and Nena Models of Stranorlar to mention but a few.  Magee &amp; Company employ 320 people in Donegal town and 210 in Northern Ireland and they are doing their utmost to maintain employment in both centres but this Government's policy is making it increasingly difficult for the Donegal centre.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done here to lessen the PRSI burden on labour intensive industries such as the clothing industry.  As an employer Magee pays 12.3 per cent in Donegal relative to 8.5 per cent in Northern Ireland, so the Northern Ireland unit has a clear advantage as far as PRSI is concerned.</P>
    <P>The income levy of 1 per cent also introduced in the last budget will inevitably, lead to wage demands to compensate, at a time when statutory wage rates in the clothing industry are already 7.5 per cent higher here than in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>IDA assistance in the form of plant aid and capital investment is, I understand, legally banned here unless a company is expanding and, therefore, increasing employment.  No consideration is given to job maintainance which is in stark contrast to the IDB's policy in Northern Ireland, who will grant aid up to 40 per cent established companies, to assist such a company to maintain its competitive position with the use of advancing technology.</P>
    <P>That is the story of one company on this island, a unique company with centres North and South.  That story is an eloquent indictment of the adverse and negative industrial climate and conditions here <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> Retailing provides employment in every town and village in the country. The imposition of 21 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear will have serious implications for this sector, particularly in Border counties.  The lower VAT rate of 17.5 per cent across the Border will certainly boost retail clothing sales there at the expense of our outlets and will further exacerbate unemployment here.</P>
    <P>Cheaper production costs in Northern Ireland and the UK generally make their products more competitive.  Much of the production of small and medium sized factories in Donegal is sold in the Republic and is now much more likely to be replaced by cheaper imported clothing. Retailers do not have to pay VAT on imported clothing purchases until such purchases are sold while they do pay VAT on domestic purchases on normal credit terms.  There is, therefore, a cash flow advantage in replacing domestic production with imported goods.</P>
    <P>I listened with some dismay to the Minister's contribution last night and his blank refusal to withdraw or amend this disastrous proposal.  The Minister will have a final opportunity to retrieve the situation in the forthcoming Finance Bill. It is imperative that immediate concessions are granted to the clothing and footwear industries if we are to avoid further job losses in an already battered industry.  If nothing is forthcoming in the Finance Bill and if the Government does not take steps to alleviate the almost impossible situation that these indigenous industrial sectors are in, companies will go out of business resulting in more redundancies and additions to the unemployment register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available to me I wish to concentrate on the wording of the Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion calling for a reduction in the VAT rate.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann welcomes the overall thrust of the Financial Statement of 24 February in terms of its <Col N="1860" /> potential to generate and sustain employment and its financially responsible and balanced nature.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be further from the truth because having listened to the contributions of Government representatives tonight, particularly Deputy Hughes, and attended meetings against the VAT increases organised by the clothing and footwear industries around the country, it is obvious that the Government is embarrassed by the proposal which will directly result in job losses.</P>
    <P>It is important to record the contribution in terms of employment by the clothing industry, both retail and manufacturing. Approximately 35,000 people are employed in the industry of whom 16,500 are in manufacturing.  While the lobby groups may exaggerate figures for job losses it is obvious that there will be substantial job losses, a figure of 3,000 has been mentioned.  The reality is that people have lost their jobs and if this measure is retained in the Finance Bill the job losses will accelerate to the 3,000 figure mentioned.</P>
    <P>This is a tax on jobs and, given that employment is a scarce resource here and this Government's overriding objective to resolve the unemployment problem&mdash; indeed, we were told this was the primary function of the budget&mdash;it is nonsense to tax an intensive job creating industry such as the clothing industry to this extent.  The increase in VAT cannot be absorbed by the manufacturer or retailer and must be passed on to the consumer. Given that the only variant available to both retail and manufacturing is labour costs, then, inevitably, we will see job losses.</P>
    <P>If Deputies vote against this Fine Gael motion it will represent a suppression of democracy.  While the ultimate test for the Government will come in the Finance Bill it would be foolish to disregard the extent of the concern and anxiety that is shared not alone by all Members but by people employed directly in the industry.</P>
    <P>This is not an irresponsible motion because we accept that the Government must work within certain financial constraints. Fine Gael believe that the <Col N="1861" /> Government have room to manoeuvre. The recent reduction in interest rates has left considerable leeway in terms of debt servicing which was not included in the arithmetic of the budget.  The relief promised to mortgage holders in the budget will not now be necessary in light of the significant interest rate reductions. That again is an opportunity for the Government to reconsider the VAT issue.  If necessary cuts in public expenditure and, in particular, an increased tax on special savings accounts should be considered in order to protect employment in this industry.  It is important also for the Government to bear in mind that revenue from VAT will not be as anticipated given the reduced sales and, more important, the cost of paying unemployment assistance to those who find themselves unemployed as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>I read with interest reports of a Cabinet meeting to the effect that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, is considering the implementation of some 40 recommendations of the Culliton report.  Ministers are propagating the county enterprise boards and yet we are turning our backs on an employment intensive industry and forcing 3,000 people onto the dole queues.</P>
    <P>An important element of any policy to resolve unemployment must be job preservation.  The logic of the Government's proposals on VAT increases seems to fly in the face of its overriding objective to resolve the unemployment problem.  There are some straws in the wind that the Government intends to adopt an approach of divide and conquer in terms of the campaign organised by the clothing and footwear industry and that some relief will be made available to the manufacturing sector.  I would caution the Government against doing this as VAT is a single policy issue which deserves recognition on its merits and should be reduced.  Any incentives to those involved in the manufacturing sector will be welcome in their own right but not as a sop to dissipate a campaign which has its own merits.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in supporting Deputy Yates' motion.  The Minister, in his response to the motion last night, gave us his global view of budgetary policy and what he felt was happening here.  He omitted to deal in any specific way with this industry.  He did not mention the effect of the 1 per cent levy or other charges in the budget. He spoke about budgetary strategy and how the Irish economy would lift.  I suppose the boats were to be used again&mdash; he did not use that metaphor but it was implied&mdash;and that we could expect Ireland to become the land of milk and honey as a result of the 1992 budget.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies argue that it was necessary to introduce this measure.  Why does the Minister not stand back and review this matter now that there have been changes since the budget took place?  That is the most disappointing aspect of the Minister's speech.  He has not said that because interest rates have fallen he can review the matter.  He has thrown out a sop by saying he might reconsider something in relation to the manufacturing side.  The Minister might not have taken note of what I said last night because I was a little disorderly.  I will repeat the point that the Minister is asking those who work in the retail drapery industry, which does not enjoy the greatest of margins to pay an additional 1 per cent charge on their earnings. He wants those employees to pay half their week's salary to the Exchequer to bail out the Government.  The worst feature of this was that all the Labour Deputies and delegates who attended the Labour Party convention in Waterford to hear the Messiah, Dick Spring, were ashamed of this measure, yet throughout this debate no Deputies have been present on my right&mdash;even if it is the excommunicated side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has arrived and has not said anything about this motion.  That is the contribution of the Labour Party to the proposals in relation to employment outlined by Deputy Creed.  What are the public to expect of this Government? Will they steamroll legislation through <Col N="1863" /> this House because of their large numbers? They are all complacent tonight. None of them is concerned about their constituents, shop workers or textile industry employees.  The motto of the new Coalition for change made up of Labour and Fianna Fáil is to let the textile industry go to the wall.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity in the Finance Bill to review this matter and he might withdraw the insulting amendment he has put down tonight.  He might have intimated in his speech last night that he will do something about VAT but he has proceeded with this insulting behaviour to this industry.  I do not believe in the long run he will make any change.  That is most disappointing.</P>
    <P>I was employed in the textile industry for 20 years.  I saw a textile firm grow from employing 40 to 1,000 people and then saw it demolished.  As Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned earlier, there were successive Governments from 1973 onwards which did not look after the textile industry.  People who work in the textile industry are aware of the camaraderie that exists in the industry, even though it does not provide large incomes. People in the industry dislike inactivity on the part of the Government who have shown such insincerity to the plight of these people.  In the mid-west region which I represent, Lanaknit in Shannon closed, Crescent, Donovan's and many other firms in Limerick City closed and Burlington closed in Clonlara.  The Government is penalising the industry out of existence.  I am ashamed that nothing concrete can be done for this industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Yates.  This debate has served to highlight the Government's hypocrisy in their policy on job creation. It has served also to unite the people involved in the footwear and clothing industries.  They are a more cohesive group now and they will be a stronger lobbying group for the future.  To gauge by the success of the hairdressing, motor and photographic industry lobbies it <Col N="1864" /> would appear that those who lobby hardest have the most success.  Representatives of the clothing and footwear industries will realise it is very important to apply as much pressure as possible on their representatives when it comes near budget time.  The forthcoming Finance Bill is the only saving mechanism available to those people.  If the Government is sincere in its policy on job creation, especially in the indigenous sector on which they have placed so much emphasis, they will react to the case being made tonight by Fine Gael and the other parties. They will also react to the very serious concerns of the manufacturing and retail industries.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over ground which has been covered effectively by my colleagues, mainly due to the good briefing we received earlier.  We are aware of the facts involved and the threat to the 3,000 jobs mentioned.  I would like to refer especially to the 3,500 retail outlets.  We hear much about the decline and the demise of family farms.  I would remind the Minister that we will witness the demise of several of these retail outlets. My wife's family is involved in the footwear industry in Tralee and I am aware of the pressure being applied to the people in that industry by this cruel imposition that defies logic on both the clothing and footwear industries.  It is obvious that they were easy pickings.</P>
      <P>The Government thought that they would get away with its ludicrous decision which runs contrary to their policy on the development of the indigenous sector. Culliton emphasises the need for a strong Irish manufacturing base.  If the clothing and footwear manufacturing industries are to be strong in their export markets, they need a strong core market here before they can launch forward.  If that is taken away from them because their products are less competitive then further firms will collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the tourism industry.  As spokesperson on tourism, I realise that many Italians come here to combine recreation with shopping.  Some of the major stores in Dublin are experiencing a fall-off in the number of Italian <Col N="1865" /> customers this spring.  That is as a result of the increase in costs here and also because we have lost competitiveness due to the devaluation of the Italian currency. Tourists who come here this year will see an increase in prices.  That portrays a bad image of Ireland from a cost base point of view and from the point of view of attracting tourists here, who purchase high quality products.  The way forward for our clothing industry is to produce high quality, well designed branded products that can compete in Europe.  It will be difficult to compete with countries from the East who mass produce products at low labour costs which are imported here.  However, we can compete by producing high quality and well designed products.  This debate has exposed the Government's hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the speeches from the other side and to dismiss the opportunism of Deputies Lawlor and O'Keeffe as this debate coincides with the appointment of chairpersons to committees. Another plethora of appointments to salaried positions will be made which will increase the £6 million per annum already being paid in respect of special advisers, programme managers, assistants and so on.  I will ignore their opportunism because I realise their ambition is to try to get on.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was singularly pathetic.  It was a rambling discourse, a rehash of the budget and not even a good one.  It was also insidious in so far as it sought to divide and conquer the unified lobby in the clothing and footwear sectors between manufacturers, designers and retailers.  It presented the manufacturing sector with a glimmer&mdash;nothing specific or definite&mdash;of PRSI reform but nothing for the retail sector who are being thrown to the wolves between the multiple chain stores, on the one hand, and the Minister who is happy to see them go out of business, on the other.  A dishonest argument was put forward from that side of the House in regard to the EC alibi.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government blames the EC for this high VAT rate.  We have the second highest standard rate of VAT in the EC and there is no obligation on us to have a 21 per cent standard rate of VAT.  A rate of 17.5 per cent applies across the Border and in the UK.  We are only compelled to have a standard rate of 15 per cent or higher and we should drop the pretence that anyone outside <Col N="1867" /> this country is forcing the Government to act wilfully in regard to this sector.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's figure of £77 million.  Detailed surveys have been carried out on the decline in retail sales. If one takes a unit of sales in 1990 at £100 and disregards inflation and the depreciating value of the pound, in 1993 that £100 will be down to a net turnover of £81.  There has been a systematic slump and decline in sales as VAT rates increased.  In 1990 the VAT rate was 10 per cent, it was then increased to 12½ per cent, then to 16 per cent and now to a rate of 21 per cent in an effort to squeeze the remaining life out of that sector.  We are talking about a particularly vulnerable sector, especially during the currency crisis.  The first sector to be affected by the currency crisis and to put workers on short-time was the clothing sector.</P>
      <P>The first effects of this VAT imposition will be an exodus across the Border.  The tills in Dundalk and Letterkenny will not be ringing but they will be ringing in Newry and Belfast because of the Government's decision to price our clothing and footwear goods out of the market.  The independent retailing sector will be thrown to the wolves.  If an indigenous clothing manufacturer sets up operations the big multiples will not stock his goods but the independent retailing sector will be put out of business by the imposition of this VAT rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our principal argument relates to the jobs which will be lost because of more sales through the black economy&mdash;a sector which will not pay the VAT&mdash; and to job losses in the manufacturing industry.  An impromptu survey spontaneously carried out on ten ladieswear manufacturing companies reveals that 171 people have been laid off and that 66 are working short-time.  Clerys department store, which employs 400 people, are letting 60 people go.  Last night I outlined an endless list of footwear and retail outlets which have closed since January of this year.  Boylans closed eight of their shops, Nova Shoes closed three shops, Vive Shoes closed three shops and many others have closed outlets in Finglas, <Col N="1868" /> Walkinstown, Bandon, Cork, Kildare, Limerick, Laois, Wexford, Monaghan and other towns.  There is no end to the litany of failures of this Government.  It believes in high spending and high taxation that will squeeze real jobs out of the economy, not the make-believe jobs that are supposed to be created from the £25 million allocated to the county enterprise boards and not the make-believe jobs that will come from the Minister for Arts and Culture who splashes another £10 million per annum on behalf of the hard-pressed taxpayer every time there is a development in the area of arts and culture.  We know that at the end of the day all those make-believe schemes must be financed by the competitive sector who cannot bear a burden of 21 per cent consumer tax.  It is not possible to pass on this increase in VAT to the consumer.  Instead, companies will have to absorb £48 million out of their own margins because they know if they increase their prices further they will not get a turnover on their goods. Anyone in the clothing industry will say that they must turnover stock three times a year in order to break even and it is important not to have unsold stock on the premises.</P>
    <P>Any Member of this House who walks down the main street of a provincial town or city will see signs for special offers, sales and cut price discounts.  This is April, not January.  These shopkeepers cannot get rid of the stock on their shelves because of the impact of this tax.</P>
    <P>The big lie perpetrated by the Government in this debate and by the Taoiseach on a continual basis in America and in this House is that in some way the economic miracle has occurred, interest rates are coming down and all is sweetness and light.  We have to get rid of this big lie. While the upturn in the economy is due in part to the success of the devaluation of the punt, it is mainly due to the appreciating value of sterling and the international decline in interest rates. This upturn has not been brought about by the Government.  In fact, the underlying trend in the budget was to increase borrowing by £400 million.  Nobody <Col N="1869" /> believes the Government myth in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another insidious point was that we have not been prepared to say how we will finance this reduction.  It has been clearly stated in the debate how this can be done.  It is wrong that we do not have adequate scrutiny and control over the expenditure of £10.5 billion in order to ensure that we get value for money. Leaving that aside, it is wrong and reprehensible that the level of tax on special savings accounts, which will not be put into any sort of productive investment and which are not linked to any conditions, is only 10 per cent.  It is lower than income tax, VAT or any form of corporation tax.  What reward does a person who invests his lotto winnings or <Col N="1870" /> retirement lump sum in business&mdash;it may be one of the three out of ten companies which succeed&mdash;get for creating jobs? He has to pay 40 per cent corporation tax.  That is a distortion of the tax code.</P>
    <P>The Government has shamefully and wilfully neglected the clothing sector which employs approximately 37,000 people.  We will not let this matter rest, we will raise it again during the debate on the Finance Bill.  There will be no escaping the reality that the 3,000 jobs being destroyed by the Government through this measure can only be saved if the Government reverses its decision and reduces VAT on clothing and footwear to 12.5 per cent.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tullamore, Offaly, Television Reception.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this matter of very great concern in my home town.  I should like to thank my neighbour, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, for coming into the House to respond.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago a cable company was licensed to provide a cable television system to the greater part of Tullamore town.  This at present provides a number of Irish and British channels in addition to a number of satellite channels.</P>
      <P>The original company given the licence no longer operates the system but was taken over a number of years ago by another company operating from Dublin which supplies a similar service to other towns in the midlands and the south east. As I understand it, that company faced technical difficulties when they took over the system as a result of which they had to undertake a lot of recabling.  Additionally, they experienced financial difficulties in collecting many of the bad debts which had been allowed to accrue by their predecessor.</P>
      <P>I do not believe such excuses, from the customer's point of view, justify the unsatisfactory nature of the service which has continued for well over one and a half years.  The main difficulty arises because this company has no staff located in the town.  This means that, if and when customers have a technical complaint, they are compelled to endeavour to contact the company by telephone, which is done by way of an answering machine located in Athlone, or sometimes in Portlaoise or in Carlow, resulting in grave delays in reporting problems and having them resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, there is much confusion and difficulty in regard to accounts.  People are not very sure how they stand financially with the company and obtain <Col N="1873" /> conflicting information with regard to the level of fee they may owe the company.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Department by way of correspondence about this time last year.  To give them their due, the Department did investigate the matter and expressed their reservations to the company concerned.  We experienced an improvement in the system for about three months thereafter.  The matter was raised also through the urban district council which met the cable company concerned.  When the company opened an office in the town for a certain number of hours each week a much better customer service was provided.  People were happy that at least they could contact someone in the event of difficulty.</P>
    <P>I regret to say however, that the position has got worse since last autumn when the office was closed and people once again encountered difficulties in contacting the company regarding service and accounts.  As the Minister will be aware, residents in the town are very frustrated.  Indeed, large numbers of subscribers were cut off recently, some unfairly.  It has also been alleged that the company trespassed on people's property. In general, people believe that their representations have not resulted in any improvement in the service.</P>
    <P>Allied to this, greater use is being made of the MMDS system in the town.  As a cable television licence has been issued for the town, in effect the MMDS system is illegal but people believe that they have to avail of this option to obtain the service to which they feel they are entitled.  It is dearer than the cable system but people are prepared to pay the extra sum of money involved if they can be assured that they will receive a better service.</P>
    <P>People in the area want a choice. Because it is cheaper, some are prepared to put up with the cable system despite the difficulties in regard to service and their accounts.  However, others would prefer to have a choice and are prepared to pay extra for a better service.  It is my understanding that certain difficulties would have to be overcome before both systems could be provided in the same area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> I appeal to the Minister to allay the concerns of the people in Tullamore, to ask the Department to make inquiries and ensure that a satisfactory multi-channel service is provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to respond.  I will begin my reply by outlining the statutory position in relation to the issue of cable relay licences and MMDS licences.  First, cable relay licences are issued, on an exclusive basis, under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wire Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974.  Each licence is granted to a licensee in relation to a particular urban area and its immediate environs.  MMDS licences on the other hand are issued, on an exclusive basis, under the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989. Each MMDS licence is granted in relation to a particular cell &mdash; generally covering a radius of 30 miles &mdash; and MMDS licences specifically do not include areas for which a cable relay licence already exists.  Cable systems are a natural monopoly and the fundamental economics of the cable industry suggest that you cannot have competing systems. From a strictly pragmatic point of view it makes no sense to have homes cabled twice.  Apart from the planning difficulties and the sheer waste of resources it would reduce the potential homes available and make any systems unviable. Similar considerations apply in the case of MMDS accommodating disaffected cable subscribers.  I firmly believe that instead it is in everybody's interests in the long term to encourage the growth and development of cable to the point where a first class service is available to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this stage to place the cable industry in Ireland in some context. The cable sector has an annual turnover of in excess of £35 million and has over 500 people employed.  It also contributes a significant amount to the Exchequer each year in VAT, PRSI, and corporation <Col N="1875" /> tax.  The Government is committed to a policy of growth and development in this area and a number of policy initiatives over the past few years have underscored that commitment. The Government will continue to encourage private investment in these systems to ensure that a top quality reliable service is available to subscribers throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish also to say a few words specifically about Tullamore.  When the current licensee took over control of the cable system in Tullamore the network in the town, as the Deputy said, was found to be in a very poor technical state.  Overall design left a lot to be desired and some of the equipment and cabling in use was sub-standard.  It was also reported to me that many of the problems with the system were created by interference in the home through signal splitting.  Over the past year or so the company has embarked on an extensive capital investment on the system.  In excess of 90 per cent of a projected investment of £500,000 has been spent.  Over 75 per cent of all trunk lines have been replaced and the entire complement of head-end equipment which pick up the broadcast signal has been replaced.  I understand, however, that the upgrade received a setback in so far as the new equipment twice suffered heavy damage from severe electrical storms last autumn.</P>
    <P>The company has informed me that it has now completed the final phase of its upgrade in the area.  The system is transmitting 13 channels and has a channel capacity far in excess of that.  The level of services calls per day is now in line with other similar systems.  As part of the final phase of the upgrade the company inserted advertisements in local newspapers requesting subscribers with reception problems to contact them.  A special group of technicians were located in the town to deal with any problems and the position did improve.  The calls which resulted from the placing of the advertisements numbered fewer than 30.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy for the area, I am aware that there is continuing anxiety and concern <Col N="1876" /> about the standard of service. However, I am satisfied that the cable relay licensee in Tullamore has invested much needed capital investment in the system to bring the network up to what is expected of modern cable systems.  I ask the subscribers with particular problems to contact the company directly in the matter.  I am also satisfied that it continues to be in the best interests of both subscribers and the industry that exclusive licences in cable areas remain in place.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the company is not located in Tullamore I will take the matter up again with it to see if the good community relations, which existed when an office was located in the town, can be restored.  It might be best if this office was reopened in the immediate future.  I intend to have a detailed discussion with the company to ensure, given that technical improvements have been made, that a good service is provided and that the remaining problems are dealt with.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I have nothing against the Minister of State but this is an indication of the way in which the matter is being treated.  Last June I received a letter from the management board of St. Patrick's Cheshire Home, Tullow, County Carlow, in which it pointed out that its staff who carry out the same work as their counterparts in the health board are not in receipt of health board pay rates and are not paid for working weekends or bank holidays. The letter continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have raised the matter with the South Eastern Health Board who have acknowledged that the staff have a <Col N="1877" /> legitimate grievance.  The funding for premium pay however must come from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>They concluded: &ldquo;We feel that our dedicated and committed staff are entitled to adequate remuneration for their work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the residents of the Cheshire Home are special and need special care and attention.  For this work we need dedicated people.  It is unacceptable that they are treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>On 16 June 1992 I wrote to the then Minister for Health, former Deputy O'Connell who acknowledged on 27 June 1992 that he had received my letter and said he would reply as soon as possible. As I had not heard from him I wrote to him again last September and he replied: &ldquo;I wish to acknowledge receipt of your further letter and I will be in touch with you again about this matter as soon as possible&rdquo;.  Because of the vagaries of political life whereby Ministers come and Ministers go, he disappeared.  I wrote in February to his successor, Deputy Howlin, and outlined what happened when his predecessor was in office.  He replied on 26 February stating that he wished to acknowledge receipt of my recent letter regarding the status of St. Patrick's Cheshire Home, Tullow, that he was having this matter looked into and that he would be in touch again as soon as possible.  Two months have elapsed since I received that letter; the workers are still being treated as second class citizens and I do not think I can be accused of rushing in to make a fuss about something that is happening.  I received three acknowledgements from two Ministers but nothing further has happened.</P>
    <P>I might add that on 4 March I had a letter from the management board outlining a further development.  The workers were advised by the Department of Enterprise and Employment that the matter may be referred to the office of the Chief State Solicitor to consider the institution of legal proceedings &mdash; in other words the workers should sue the board of management.  The health board will not provide the money to pay the premium rates they should be getting &mdash; the Eastern Health Board is paying the staff of the Cheshire Homes in its region <Col N="1878" /> the standard health board rates.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment, instead of contacting their colleagues and asking them to pay the standard rates, told the staff that they may sue the board of management.  The board of management is a voluntary body who Sunday after Sunday raise funds for this institution.  Each year £50,000 has to be raised to keep the Cheshire Home going.  That home caters for people who properly should be looked after by the health board.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that I have to raise this matter on the Adjournment, having spent 12 months trying to get it sorted out.  In fairness to the Minister who is absent, he was a man of vision and eloquence who showed great concern when in Opposition.  I would hate to think that he would have lost any of those qualities since going into Government.  The buck stops at his desk and rather than have civil servants looking into space and telling me that the Minister will come back to me as soon as possible &mdash; which is never &mdash; I would like to be assured that there will be concrete action to ensure that justice is done to the workers who are giving of their time to look after those in the Cheshire Home in Tullow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to apologise for my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, who cannot be present to take the Adjournment because he has an important appointment elsewhere.  He asked me to reply for him.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health is well aware of the excellent work being done by the Cheshire Homes around the country.  The Cheshire Foundation has made an outstanding contribution to the development of residential accommodation for people with physical disabilities in Ireland.  The first Cheshire Home was established in Ireland in 1962.  Thirty years later, there are nine homes providing some 264 places.  Two new homes at Sligo and Letterkenny are almost complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with all the Cheshire Homes, St. Patrick's, Tullow, is an independent voluntary body over which the Department of Health has no direct control. <Col N="1879" /> However, in recognition of the valuable services it provides to people with disabilities, St. Patrick's Cheshire Home receives grants from the South-Eastern Health Board under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.  I understand that in 1992, the running costs amounted to £328,000 of which the health board contributed £280,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the claim by staff at the home for parity with health board rates, the position is that neither the health board nor the Department of Health is involved directly in the recruitment, pay or conditions of employees in any of the Cheshire Homes.  This is entirely a matter for the management of homes concerned. I understand that this was fully explained to representatives of the homes, including St. Patrick's, when they were met by officials of the Department of Health in July 1992.  I understand that a claim for parity which has been submitted to the management of another Cheshire Home in County Limerick has been referred to the Labour Court.  Negotiations on this claim which are progressing at the moment may have implications for all Cheshire Homes including the Tullow home.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for the Department of Health to intervene in the course of these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to object to the way this matter is being treated by the Minister.  If the Chair considers a matter to be of sufficient significance to be discussed on the Adjournment, the Minister should have the courtesy to attend or to ask the Minister of State at his Department to represent him.  That is no reflection on my constituency colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine. It is significant also that a script has been prepared in reply to what I will say.  It is obvious that the prepared script that will be read is a report that has come from the Southern Health Board.  The Minister's representative tonight is acting as a mouthpiece for the health board in responding to me.  The response has been <Col N="1880" /> prepared even though the Minister, or his representative, does not know what I will say.</P>
      <P>As a member of the health board I tried to resolve this matter locally and I regret having to raise it on the Adjournment this evening.  A man aged 51 years saw a consultant in the Cork Regional Hospital on 29 March who adjudged his condition to warrant a CAT scan.  This cannot be done until 2 June 1993.  This man is in severe pain, at home in bed much of the time and when out of bed has to walk with the aid of a stick.  I got the run around from the health board when I raised this case.  I contacted the manager of the Cork Regional Hospital and I was told by the staff to ask his GP to write or phone them but when his secretary phoned the radiology department, she was told that she should not be wasting their time.  That is the treatment I had from the department.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse when I raised the matter publicly in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> a faceless spokesman, a PR person I presume, stated that my statements were at variance with the facts and that my comments were a slur on the staff of Cork Regional Hospital.  The staff of Cork Regional Hospital are working under extreme pressure, and the lack of resources and pressures of work are putting them under extreme pressure.  My comments were no slur on them. However, this is the type of activity that the health board engages in.  I wonder if managements of health boards, and specifically the management of the Southern Health Board, are acting as apologists for Government policies?  Are they covering up for the inadequacies in the services by employing professional PR people to rubbish claims made by health board members and public representatives? The public, and their representatives, deserve better treatment.</P>
      <P>This is no reflection on my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan.  I have no doubt I will receive a reply which is the line being taken by the health board.  May I ask the Minister to take an independent line and have the circumstances of this case investigated fully because this is only a symptom of what is happening to services in the Southern Health Board region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> There is a waiting list from two to four years for orthopaedic surgery.  Indeed, I could spend all night speaking about the inadequacy of the services.  The programme managers, and the manager of the hospital involved, should answer questions raised by public representatives rather than responding through professional PR consultants. They are being paid well to do the job and they should respond to valid complaints.</P>
    <P>In this case, the man is a medical cardholder. Would he be treated differently if he was prepared to pay?  I believe he would.  That is a grave injustice and shows the inadequacies and defects at present and the way these inadequacies are being covered up on a daily basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I apologise again for the absence of my colleague who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the facts that have been given to the Department.  The Adjournment Debate is all about ascertaining the facts and presenting them to the House. The facts are as presented to the House and if there is a change in the position Deputy Allen should inform me and I will put the matter to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that hospital appointments are scheduled having regard to medical criteria and the urgency attached to the case.  The question of deciding on the urgency of a case is purely a medical matter.  The Minister for Health had inquiries from the hospital authorities concerning this patient and received a report from them regarding the matter.  The Minister would not normally consider it appropriate to discuss the medical details of individual patients but in view of the Deputy's evident concern, I propose on his behalf to outline the background to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital authorities have informed the Minister for Health that the patient's consultant requested a non-urgent CAT Scan from the radiology department on 31 March 1993.  Accordingly, the patient was given an appointment date for 2 June 1993.  I know that the Deputy would not wish to see a non-urgent appointment being given priority over other more pressing cases.  If there were medical <Col N="1882" /> reasons indicating that the patient required an earlier appointment, it would be a matter for the consultant who requested the CAT Scan to contact the radiology department in this regard.  It is, of course, also open to the patient's general practitioner to contact the consultant concerned to discuss any aspect of the appointment.  If Deputy Allen is further concerned about this matter he should inform the Minister who has said he will be available to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter.  I will preface my remarks by saying I am sorry the Minister for Health is not here, although I have great regard for the Minister present.  This is such an unusual matter that I hope the Minister takes it extremely seriously.  From what I hear and see the health services are deteriorating at an alarming rate, despite recent assurances by the new Minister for Health that money is being made available and waiting lists are reducing. However, when the House hears my story it will realise there is something terribly wrong in the health service.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the health service that are disgraceful.  A few weeks ago part of the ceiling of one of the operating theatres at University College Hospital in Galway, formerly known as the Regional Hospital, collapsed just after a serious operation was performed on a patient &mdash; fortunately the patient and the operating staff had left when this happened.  I consider that an insult to the patient and also to the surgical team and nurses working there.  The roof of the operating theatre became waterlogged, causing it to collapse. I hesitate to think what would have happened had the roof collapsed during the operation.  This is a fault that should have been identified sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the only problem in the Western Health Board area that results from underfunding.  The CAT scanning machine in this hospital, which is used to identify cancerous growth, broke down a couple of months ago and as the money was not available to repair it patients now <Col N="1883" /> have to go to Cork or Dublin for this scan. This is something about which people in the Western Health Board area are very annoyed.  In addition, consultants have informed me that the number of cancelled consultations was never higher and that on several occasions patients have to come back for the fifth time for interviews. In other words, nothing is being done for these patients.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed that one of the most modern wards in University College Hospital is closed.  On a number of occasions in the last couple of weeks people had to wait up to 11 hours in the casualty department for a bed.</P>

I am not blaming the Western Health Board which is underfunded and finds it extremely difficult to provide a service in the three counties for which it has responsibility.  I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister for Health that we regard this incident as an insult.  There is a very good case for extra funding for the Western Health Board.  I sincerely hope that what happened in this operating theatre will never happen again in any hospital in the State.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for his kind remarks at the outset of his contribution.  On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I would like to thank the Deputy for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  The Minister has been in contact with the Western Health Board which is <Col N="1884" /> responsible for the management of services at University College Hospital, Galway.  The facts of the matter, as reported to him, are as follows.</P>
      <P>The operating theatre concerned is housed in a prefabricated single story building and has a flat roof.  Following torrential rain on Saturday, 17 April it appears that water lodged on the roof causing some leaks.  The health board maintenance staff were immediately notified and attended to the necessary roof repairs on Sunday, 18 April.  On Monday, 19 April while the operating theatre was in use a wet patch was noted in the ceiling in a corner of the theatre.  When the operating list for the day had been completed the maintenance staff were called and proceeded immediately to repair the ceiling damage which had been caused by an undetected lodgment of rainwater arising from the leaks which had occurred two days earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has been assured by the health board that contrary to what the Deputy has stated no part of the ceiling collapsed.  The theatre concerned is now back in full use.</P>

In relation to improvements generally at University College Hospital, the Deputy probably will be aware that a joint working party of the Western Health Board and the Department of Health is currently examining the feasibility of a range of capital developments at the hospital to provide improved accommodation for, among other areas, the operating theatre department.</P>
      <P>In regard to overall funding for the health services I would like to restate for the Deputy's information that this year under a Labour Minister health spending will increase by 12 per cent representing an increase of £183 million to the highest figure ever of over £1.7 billion.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government there is a commitment to a major programme of family law reform.  Since the programme was published the report of the Second <Col N="1721" /> Commission on the Status of Women was presented to Government and it also includes a number of recommendations in this area including the enforcement of maintenance awards.</P>
      <P>I am happy to tell the House that the Court Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments Bill, 1993, which will enable Ireland to ratify two international conventions will be introduced in the Seanad tomorrow.  When these conventions enter into force, Irish judgments, including maintenance orders, will become enforceable in all EC and EFTA states.</P>
      <P>In addition, work is advanced on the Family Law Reform Bill which is along the lines of the scheme of the Family Law (No. 1) Bill contained in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  Provision is made in the Bill empowering the courts when ordering maintenance payments to order at the same time that these be made by attachment of earnings.  This will represent a significant improvement in present procedures in that in many cases it will no longer be necesssary to take separate court proceedings to seek enforcement of maintenance orders.</P>
      <P>I have also directed that priority attention be given to the reciprocal enforcement of the maintenance Bill which will provide for significant improvement in existing arrangements for the recovery of maintenance payments within the EC.</P>
      <P>Proposals which will give effect to further improvements in procedures for the enforcement of maintenance payments, including the question of automatic enforcement, will be carefully considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>In my speech to which the Deputy refers, I outlined the history of previous efforts to provide increased employment for people with disabilities. I pointed out that in 1977 the Government introduced a 3 per cent quota for those with a physical or other disability for employment in the public service. Many people have been recruited on foot of that quota even though the target of 3 per cent has not been reached.</P>
      <P>With a view to remedying this shortfall the Government intend to give a lead by honouring the 3 per cent commitment in relation to employment in the public sector.  They will also give serious consideration to the possibility of legislation specifying a quota throughout the economy. I intend to have this issue included in the agenda for future talks between the Government and the social partners.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to ensure that disabled people receive every possible support during the present difficult employment situation and have taken steps to improve job opportunities for them.  These include setting a target to double the number of people placed annually under the employment support scheme.  This scheme enables subsidies to be paid to employers based on the productivity of the individual worker.</P>

      <P>As indicated in a reply to a question on 6 April, 1993, the Government, in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government, has decided to establish a minimum of 40 per cent representation of each gender in direct appointments to the boards of semi-state bodies.</P>

      <P>The situation with regard to the boards of the semi-State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, that is, the Employment Equality Agency and the Legal Aid Board, both of which I inherited when I became Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is as follows, viz.,</P>

    <P>The board comprises a Chairman and ten ordinary members.  The nominating bodies are the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Congress <Col N="1727" /> of Trade Unions, the Council for the Status of Women, and myself as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  All appointments are made by me.</P>
    <P>Nine of the members of the board, including the Chairman, are women.</P>
    <P>There are two vacancies on the board of the EEA that have arisen since I became Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I shall be appointing replacements to those vacancies.</P>
    <P>Legal Aid Board</P>
    <P>The board comprises a Chairman and 12 ordinary members.  The nominating bodies are the Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance and myself as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  All appointments to the board are made by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In calculating means for Irish non-contributory pension purposes, British pensioners' Sterling income is converted to Irish Pounds.  In order to reflect a reasonable pattern of exchange rates, an average exchange rate system is used for converting all European Community social security pensions to Irish Pounds. For this purpose, the Department uses figures which are provided by the Administrative Commission of the European Communities on Social Security of Migrant Workers.</P>
      <P>The Administrative Commission figure is the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of the previous quarter. This rate is then applied by the Department to all new pension claims made throughout the succeeding quarter.  This has been the method used by the Department for many years for converting pensioners' Sterling income to Irish Pounds, including during recent months when wider than usual exchange rate fluctuations have occurred.  The average exchange rate basis used avoids the need for frequent reviews of existing entitlements. It also gives an important degree of security to persons who qualify for a Non-Contributory Pension from the Department by protecting them to a large extent from short term movements in exchange rates.  The impact of the 1992 exchange rate fluctuations was reflected in the latest EC-supplied average exchange rates now applicable to new claims and to claim reviews.  The recent devaluation of the Irish Pound together with further movements in the exchange rate have considerably restored the income position of existing non-contributory pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to pensioners to apply for a means review at any time where they have reason to believe that their assessments should be changed.  Any means review would, of course, include a reassessment of the person's total means. Persons who have already applied to the Department for a review of their means <Col N="1734" /> as a result of exchange fluctuations will have any warranted adjustment in their pension rates made.  The reviews will have to include any increases in their British pension since the last means assessment was made.</P>
    <P>In tabling this question, the Deputy makes specific reference to a couple both of whom are in receipt of reduced rate old age non-contributory pensions.  The persons concerned were assessed with means of £56.38 per week in January 1992.  Their means were derived solely from a combination of four pensions payable in Sterling.  Their entitlements are being reviewed at their request.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to notify the persons concerned of the revised assessments and new rates of entitlement to pension.  Revised payment books will be issued to them as soon as possible.</P>

        <i>Wexford):</i> Under the EC STRIDE Operational Programme for Ireland, 1991-1993, my Department has commissioned a study into the reuse and recycling of large plastic sheeting arising from activities in a number of sectors of the economy, including the building and commercial sectors, but particularly in <Col N="1742" /> the agriculture and horticulture areas. The study will take into account technical and economic barriers to recycling including the markets for recycled material.</P>

      <Col N="1743" /> The laying out and use of land as a golf course, incorporating parking space for not less than 24 cars, is exempted development for planning purposes by virtue of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1977.

        <i>Wexford):</i> Under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, protection of waters, including ground-waters, from pollution is the responsibility of the local environmental authorities concerned.  Recent regulations under these Acts provide for specific controls to prevent groundwater pollution arising from the discharge of harmful substances.</P>
      <P>Information on the quality of groundwater is being gathered by local authorities as part of the regime being put in place to implement an EC Directive concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not have detailed information on particular protection measures being prepared or implemented by local authorities in this area.  However, I am aware that a research study on groundwater assessment and the development of aquifer protection plans for counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon is being undertaken by Sligo Regional Technical College, the Geological Survey of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin with assistance under the EC STRIDE programme. <Col N="1746" /> The study is due for completion in February 1994.</P>

Where single accommodation in use is not up to acceptable standard, steps are being taken to improve it progressively within the limits of resources available for the purpose.  A board has been established to examine the whole question of married quarters, including the condition and grading of quarters in the Curragh Camp.  The board is due to submit its report and recommendations by 31 July 1993.</P>

      <P>The boards/bodies under the aegis of the Department of Defence are the Army Pensions Board, Coiste an Asgard and <Col N="1748" /> the Irish Red Cross Society.  The current male/female composition of the management of these boards/bodies is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Army Pension Board consists of a chairman and two ordinary members.  Since January 1993 both ordinary members are female.  The position of chairman is vacant at present.</P>
      <P>(2)  Coiste an Asgard is a company limited by guarantee and is established for the management of the Sail Training Vessel Asgard II.  The Coiste currently has a board of 14 Directors, three of whom are female.  In addition to one current vacancy on the Board, two further vacancies are anticipated shortly.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Irish Red Cross is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the Central Council.  The Council consists of members elected by the Society's areas and members nominated by the Government.  It is statutorily prescribed that the Government's nominees must comprise not less than one third of the total membership of the Council.  At present there are 22 Government nominated members of the Central Council and of these nine are female.</P>
      <P>In the cases of the Army Pensions Board and the Irish Red Cross Society the level of female members of the State nominees is 40 per cent or higher.  In respect of Coiste an Asgard, full consideration will be given to increasing the level of female membership of its management body when the next appointments are being made.</P>

The weed has no agricultural implications so the question of any action under legislation for which I have responsibility does not arise.</P>

      <P>The job creation potential per unit of area for different types of land use is difficult to determine as it depends on many factors such as the quality of the land, market access, capital investment requirements and consumer preferences.  It would be very difficult to take all these variables into account to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the employment potential of different land uses.</P>
      <P>Statistics in the area of agricultural employment concentrate mainly on existing employment in each type of farming. Given that the reformed Common Agricultural Policy aims to restrain production in some sectors the option of increasing primary production may not be practicable in many cases though there are, of course, other options for increasing farm income.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting with interest the study by the ESRI on the Impact of Forestry on Rural Communities.  I understand that this will contain data on employment in forestry and agriculture in areas with relatively poor land.  This report is expected in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the greatest potential for job creation in the agriculture and food areas lies in increasing the value added to our products.  This is one of the recommendations in the report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry which was published last week <Col N="1751" /> and which contains recommendations on how to develop the food industry as well as their broad estimates on job creation potential.</P>

      <P>The House will appreciate that I have no function with regard to how other Government Departments and Agencies spend their advertising budgets.  I would expect, as with my own Department, where an advertising campaign is considered necessary, that Departments endeavour to get the best value for the money at their disposal and the media mix selected is tailored to the particular campaign.  My Department has not made use of any radio advertising in the years mentioned in the relevant question.</P>
      <P>I have no function with regard to charges made by RTE for advertising time on any of their services.

      <P>In the second project a budget will be allocated to a number of schools to cover the estimated cost of substitution for a range of absences in each.  The budget will be credited to a school, and substitute teachers will continue to be paid by my Department.  Any unclaimed balance at the end of the year will be allocated to the school in the form of a grant.</P>
      <P>A committee has been established comprising officials of my Department, representatives of the INTO and managerial authorities.  This committee has been asked to recommend areas and schools for inclusion in the pilot projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any particular grounds for concern in relation to racism in our community.</P>
      <P>The underlying educational ethos of our schools is one that regards tolerance and the acceptance of minorities as values to be cultivated.  Because this is a general feature of that ethos, it has not expressed itself in the specific form of programmes such as the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>In fact, it may be doubted if a specific anti-racism educational programme is the way to proceed.  There are demands for the inclusion specifically of so many different topics in the curriculum that there is risk both of overloading the curriculum and of producing a curriculum which is an unco-ordinated amalgam of diverse elements.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is the body established to advise me in curriculum matters.  I am happy to pass on the Deputy's suggestion to them for consideration.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that the Teacher's Handbook for the Primary School Curriculum, in dealing with civics, states that &ldquo;The main concern is not, however, with the rights and duties of citizenship but with the development of social and moral attitudes which take into account the rights of other members of society&rdquo;.  It also states, in relation to national pride, that &ldquo;it is essential that this pride should be national and balanced. Anything which savours of chauvinism or any form of excessive nationalism, tends to blur the child's awareness of the common bond of humanity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary schools, relationships with and attitudes to one's fellow human beings and the world community, together with an understanding and acceptance of the kinship of people are features of the civics course, which is compulsory for all junior cycle pupils in post-primary schools.</P>
