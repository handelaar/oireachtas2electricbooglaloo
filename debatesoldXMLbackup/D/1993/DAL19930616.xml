      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to raise the subject matter of item No. 7 on today's Order Paper &mdash; Estimates for Public Services, 1993, Vote 18 &mdash; Transport, Energy and Communications (Revised Estimate).  Aer Lingus employees, their families, the tourism industry, ordinary customers and all of us who are shareholders in the company want to know when the publicly accountable board's plans for this company will be published.  Can we have an assurance that the unions will be given the full picture at their meeting today and not an edited or coloured version of what the <Col N="867" /> board and the Government have in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ruled on this matter yesterday morning and advised Members that there are ample ways and means of raising matters appertaining to Aer Lingus.  Indeed, tomorrow's debate on the National Development Plan will afford Members such an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With every deference to your office, may I submit that tomorrow's debate on the National Development Plan will not provide the Government with an opportunity to declare its position on this issue and there is no assurance that it will?  I have asked if the Government would be prepared to take Vote 18 in the House at the earliest opportunity to set the cards on the table because so many livelihoods depend on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us put the matter in context.  The recovery plan for Aer Lingus was presented to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on Monday and the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation policy met yesterday evening.  The management and unions are due to meet today at 2 p.m.  We have already made it clear that we are determined to ensure that Aer Lingus continues as the national airline and remains viable and that certain actions are required on the part of all the parties concerned.  We are determined to play our part in relation to the recovery plan. As I said, management and unions are due to meet today to start the process to work out a solution.  This matter has been put down for discussion at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies on Tuesday and if the parties opposite so wish I can arrange for the Minister to meet them later this afternoon to brief them on the details.  I <Col N="868" /> am sure that parties opposite will appreciate&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>What about both parties over there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte, please allow the Taoiseach to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not worry; they will also be briefed.  I am certain that each party in the House fully appreciates that there is certain information in this report which could not be presented as this would only help the competitors of Aer Lingus which finds itself in this grave and serious position. On the question of providing the information that people need to know we are prepared to brief the Opposition spokespersons this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we are more than willing to accept that offer but I put it to the Taoiseach that the public need to know at the earliest date what is being proposed because we do not want suspicions to arise or coloured information to influence opinion.  People need the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We, too, will be happy to co-operate with the Taoiseach and to receive a briefing from the Minister but if the Government wants the goodwill of the Opposition in this regard &mdash; everybody is concerned about Aer Lingus &mdash; it owes it to us, to the unions and workers to publish the report so that we can judge from its actions whether it is implementing the plan that is necessary to save Aer Lingus into the future and that it is not a short term plan to get us over the next 12 months.  I do not think the Taoiseach's comment that this would suit the competitors of Aer Lingus is appropriate; rather it is an excuse.  Every journalist in town seems to have a version of this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to dissuade <Col N="869" /> Members from embarking upon a debate now; that is out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's offer to brief the parties in Opposition on this matter and I accept it on the basis that any information given to me which is not detrimental to Aer Lingus would be made public by me.  I have no intention of being bound by or tied into any secret or consensual approach to this crisis.  I accept the Taoiseach's offer on that basis, but I urge him to formally make available to the public, a well as the Opposition parties, the outline of what is being proposed.  This matter concerns everybody in this country, not just the board and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be adequate, Deputy.  There is no need to elaborate any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are all sensitive to the situation and I appreciate the Government's difficulty in publishing information which is commercially sensitive, but I do not think this would apply to the recommendations which are going to be leaked all over the place.  I put it to the Taoiseach that if he publishes the recommendations the <Col N="870" /> requirements for information would be satisfied and he could hold back the commercially sensitive information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consider that aspect.  I am hopeful that the Opposition spokespersons will be happy with the information they will receive.  I have no doubt that full and complete consultations will take place between the unions and management in relation to the gap that has to be bridged to restore this company to viability and, indeed, the airline industry so far as this nation is concerned.  That is the objective of the Government and I am certain it is also the objective of everybody in the House. It is a question of how we can reach that objective.  In so far as the Government, as a shareholder, has a role to play it will play that role.  I do not think anyone would suggest that I should release commercially sensitive information which could damage the airline which finds itself in a precarious financial position at present.  This would only help its competitors and I have no intention of doing that no matter how much pressure I am put under in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this House should condemn the attack which took place last night at Brussels airport on a Member of this House, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice to pursue the matter with the Belgian authorities to see to it that parliamentarians are properly protected and their attackers are dealt with accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Under the 1991 Local Government Act local authorities are entitled to set up advisory committees. The annual general meetings of most local authorities are due to take place shortly but these advisory committees on such matters as rural development and agriculture cannot be set up until the Minister for the Environment signs the commencement order under the appropriate section, either section 15 or 16&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assist the Deputy but the matter he has raised is not strictly relevant now and it can be dealt with in so many other ways, including by way of question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the legislative programme before us is so threadbare that we are barely able to keep the lights on in this House?  For example, the Presidential Elections Bill has no relevance or urgency in the times in which we now live.  I ask him to ensure that the Government send one piece of major legislation to this House during this session.  I am referring in particular to the long promised juvenile justice Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he will raise at his meeting with the British Prime Minister the concern which has been expressed in this House at the continuing detention of John Matthews on spurious allegations of involvement in the London bombings?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that he is rightly concerned about the possibility of commercially sensitive information being made available in the public arena, may I ask the Taoiseach if he has inquired into how very commercially sensitive information was leaked by his Cabinet?  The leaking of this information has severely damaged the prospect of 1,214 jobs being created in Clonmel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When does the Government intend to introduce the promised legislation on the amnesty for tax cheats?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Government's legislative programme, may I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that, as a result of the Frankevitch judgment of the European Court, the State is now liable to pay damages to anybody who suffers loss because of the State's failure to implement an EC directive? Is the Taoiseach aware that Government Departments are not proceeding to implement directives because of advice from the Attorney General arising from the Supreme Court case concerning angel dust?  Is he aware that failure to enact these EC directives, either by way of legislation or regulation, is leaving the taxpayer open to very large claims for damage?</P>

      <P>This motion seeks the approval of Dáil Éireann for the terms of the TREVI Ministers Agreement which was signed by the 12 TREVI Ministers in Copenhagen on 2 June 1993 and which enables the first phase of Europol &mdash; the Europol Drugs Unit &mdash; to be established.  A note which outlines the main provisions of the agreement has been prepared and circulated to Deputies for information.  Copies of the agreement were laid before the Dáil on 9 June 1993. Drug trafficking is a crime of the most serious kind which has wreaked havoc all over the world.  I am glad to have the opportunity of making a statement on it here today.</P>
      <P>First, however, I want to say a few words about Europol, which is the specific issue before the House.  The Europol Drugs Unit will be a permanent inter-governmental co-operation body for the 12 EC member states.  Under the terms of the agreement the EDU will come into force immediately after a decision has been taken on the location of the unit. At the Copenhagen meeting on 2 June the TREVI Ministers emphasised the importance of deciding on the location as soon as possible and we invited the European Council to decide on a permanent location for the EDU at its forthcoming meeting in Copenhagen on 21-22 June.  However, if a permanent location is not decided by the European Council at that meeting, the TREVI Ministers have decided to hold a special meeting in Copenhagen on 29 June to decide on a temporary location for the EDU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications for policing which arise from the removal of internal frontiers in the European Community have <Col N="878" /> been under examination by the TREVI Group for some time.  This group was set up in 1975 when the European Council decided that Community Ministers of the Interior and Ministers for Justice should meet to discuss matters arising in the area of their responsibilities &mdash; in particular matters relating to law and order.  The first such meeting took place on 29 June 1976 and Irish Ministers for Justice have participated in the work of TREVI from the start.</P>
    <P>A special working group of TREVI was set up in 1989 to study the implications of the proposed removal of border controls within the EC at the end of 1992 and the action to be taken to deal with terrorism, illegal drug trafficking and international organised crime.  This group drew up a programme of action on measures to strengthen police co-operation among EC member states after the implementation of the Single European Act.  The programme was approved by the TREVI Ministers at their meeting in Dublin in June 1990.  It included specific measures designed to reinforce and build on existing co-operation and to speed up and intensify sharing of information and expertise about illegal activities.</P>
    <P>In accordance with this programme, member states were requested to study the need for a European drugs intelligence unit.  Subsequently, the European Council decided that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for drug-related information between member states.</P>
    <P>When signing the agreement which is before this House today I stated that, in my view, it represented the most visible manifestation of the co-operation we are seeking to promote among the police services of our respective member states in the fight against international organised crime in the context of the Single Market. The ministerial agreement represents a very significant milestone in the new European order, as well as creating a new body which, I am sure, will be of great practical benefit in combating the international trafficking of drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> There is little doubt that the dramatic increase in drug abuse and in the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics, constitutes one of the most serious issues confronting the international community today &mdash; this scourge has left few nations untouched.  There is little doubt either that powerful international criminal organisations will exploit the new freedoms we seek to put in place at European level and that we have a duty to protect ourselves in any way we can from them.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I take a very serious view of drug-related crime, and the prevention and detection of such offences is already treated as a matter of priority by all the relevant State agencies. Legislation governing the misuse of drugs here provides very severe penalties for drug offences, including a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for those convicted of the most serious offences. Very substantial prison sentences have been imposed by our courts for such offences in some cases.  Some offenders now in our prisons, have served several years for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective measures that can be taken against drug traffickers is to deprive them of the profits gained from their illegal activity.  Work on legislation dealing with this matter is proceeding as a matter of priority in my Department.  It is a complex measure which is why it has taken some time to prepare, but it is virtually ready and I expect that there will be full support in the House for its enactment this year. The main drug of abuse in Ireland is cannabis resin, which accounts for about 75 per cent of all seizures of drugs.  Cannabis is usually brought into Ireland in consignments in the region of 100kg.  All the indications are that it is, for the most part, intended for consumption on the home market.  Notwithstanding seizures of up to 500kg on a few occasions in the past &mdash; and a larger seizure in the past week or so &mdash; the advice I have received from the Garda and Revenue authorities, is that Ireland is not part of an international drug trafficking route.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> The amounts of heroin, cocaine, and ecstasy imported are small by international standards and are, according to my advice, invariably for consumption on the Irish market.  As Deputies may be aware, drug law enforcement efforts here are co-ordinated by the Garda National Drug Administration Office which was set up in 1990 and is located in Garda headquarters.  It comes under the control of a Garda superintendent, who acts as a national co-ordinator for drug-related crime.  He has overall day-to-day responsibility for drug-related matters in the force, and supervises the work of the specialist drug squads operating throughout the country.</P>
    <P>One of the more frequent criticisms expressed in relation to enforcement measures is that there is not sufficient manpower or equipment to deal effectively with the problem.  The numbers of personnel attached to the drug squads throughout the country are as follows: Dublin, 34; Limerick, four; Cork, 15 and Galway, three.  This is a total of 56 officers but this is not the whole picture.  Every member of the Garda Síochána has a role to play in relation to the drugs problem. To date approximately 3,500 members have received training in this field at drug courses.  All student gardaí now coming on stream received drug training, and are attached for short periods to the drug squad.  In recent years week-long courses have been introduced dealing with drugs issues at the in service training school, Harcourt Square, and four weeks secondment periods are provided to members to obtain operational experience at the drug squad in Harcourt Square.</P>
    <P>There is no shortfall of Garda transport or equipment required for the fight against drugs.  Technical surveillance equipment is readily available as required.  The services of the dog unit are also available full-time in Dublin, Cork, Rosslare and, indeed, elsewhere if needed.</P>
    <P>Of course, the first line of defence against illicit imports of drugs into this country is the Customs service, whose staff are strategically placed at ports, airports and in the vicinity of our land and <Col N="881" /> sea borders to carry out the necessary checks to intercept such illicit consignments. Following the completion of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, the Customs service of the Revenue Commissioners has increased its efforts to protect our national borders and shoreline &mdash; which also comprises a part of the European Community's external frontier &mdash; against illegal imports of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the completion of the Single Market has underlined the importance of maintaining and intensifying co-operation with other Customs services both in and outside the Community in order to ensure a constant flow of intelligence about suspect movements.  Such co-operation within the EC, is being undertaken by the Customs Mutual Assistance Groups (MAG).</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also recently established a national drugs team with more than 70 staff consisting of intelligence units, maritime units and sniffer dogs units, which are based at import and export points throughout the country.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is excellent co-operation between the Garda and Customs authorities which facilitates a co-ordinated and effective effort against drug trafficking nationwide, and which has resulted in many successful joint Garda and Customs operations.  Effective co-operation is, of course, something that needs to be worked upon and developed constantly and I know that senior gardaí from headquarters have gone to take a special look at the arrangements in Cork &mdash; following recent major seizures there &mdash; and to assess whether Garda-Customs co-operative arrangements can be intensified.</P>
    <P>As evidence of this inter-agency co-operation, more than £26 million worth of drugs have been seized by the Garda Síochána and Customs officers in the past two years and so far this year.  This involves the seizures I referred to earlier of almost £7 million worth of cannabis resin over the past week in swoops in Cork and a separate seizure of cannabis resin amounting to £1.5 million in Cork <Col N="882" /> three weeks ago.  These are extremely encouraging results and should be welcomed. I am sure the House will join with me in congratulating those concerned in their recent successes.</P>
    <P>To complete the task of tackling illegal drugs trafficking more effectively, the Minister for Finance is pursuing with the European Commission the possibility of obtaining Community funding in the region of £12 million to enhance the existing Customs infrastructural resources allocated for the prevention of drugs smuggling through our ports, airports and land and sea borders.  The Taoiseach referred to this matter earlier this week, when he spoke in Cork in the wake of the west Cork drug seizures.  In doing so he was emphasising the role that the EC has to play in helping us to protect our coasts from drug imports, and the European dimension to the problem.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again, as I did in last Wednesday's Adjournment Debate in this House, that despite what has been recently said and written in the media, there is no evidence that Ireland is an international drug trafficking country.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities and the Revenue Commissioners that while last week's seizures were in themselves significant, they were nevertheless of an isolated nature and do not, as such, suggest that our country is being used as a base for the onward transmission of drugs to other countries in the context that we generally understand drug trafficking to mean.  The Garda authorities are in frequent contact with their counterparts in the UK and other EC member states who have confirmed that there is no evidence to suggest that drugs seized in their countries were transmitted through this country.</P>
    <P>Having said that, however, it would be complacent in the extreme for anybody in authority to pretend the size of some of the recent drugs seizures is not a matter for the most serious concern.  The highest degree of vigilance is clearly called for and I have been reassured by the Garda authorities that drugs smuggling will continue to be the subject of priority attention. One of the immediate benefits of <Col N="883" /> establishing the European drugs unit will be to facilitate access to more intelligence on illegal drug trade activities, and this should assist the law enforcement authorities here in identifying the origins and destinations of drug shipments.</P>
    <P>Among the most effective weapons of all in the fight against the insidious growth in drug trafficking is intelligence. Effective intelligence gathering is the one ingredient which law enforcement agencies the world over require to defeat the architects of crime.  That is why it is so vital that those who have any hard information should assist the authorities by passing it on to the relevant authorities. Spreading rumours and half-baked information to others, including the media, serves only to create public unease and put criminals on their guard.  What we need is hard information.  There is no use in pretending either that we can arrest and detain people on the basis that their alleged involvement in criminal activity is the subject of common knowledge.  There must be evidence but, despite the fact that the activities of certain suspects are kept under very close scrutiny &mdash; contrary to some recent suggestions &mdash; it is notoriously difficult to secure evidence against the principal players involved.  That is the experience all over the world and that is why it is so vital that everybody who has information or who observes anything suspicious in this area should report it immediately to the gardaí.  It is vital for this reason to recognise that law enforcement measures are not enough.</P>
    <P>Action on a wider scale has been a feature of Government policy, for some time.  A National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse was set up in 1984 to advise the Government in relation to the effectiveness of law enforcement and the treatment of drug abusers.  In May 1991 the Minister for Health launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  The intention is to tackle the drugs problems on every front.  Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction both in the supply of and the demand for, drugs.</P>
    <P>Every member of society in fact has a <Col N="884" /> role to play and this role can be just as important as the law enforcement response. In particular, I am thinking of the role that teachers and parents can play in influencing young people and raising their awareness of the evils of drug abuse. Education and persuasion are absolutely vital because that is the way to limit the market for drugs and thereby remove the incentive for criminals to use every means at their disposal to breach the barriers placed in their way by law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit consideration can then be given by member states to the question of widening its scope so that the experience gained in establishing the European drugs unit can be applied to other forms of crime which pose a threat to member states.  Criteria would have to be developed as part of that process to enable decisions to be made as to which forms of criminality, other than drug trafficking, should be dealt with by Europol, and in which order.  That is for the future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn very briefly to the main features of the agreement which sets out the way the Europol Drugs Unit will work.  Information necessary for the work of the unit will be exchanged by liaison officers sent to the unit by member states.  This will take place within the limits of national legislation, in particular data protection legislation.  The transmission of personal information to non-member states or to international organisations by the liaison officers will not take place.  The unit will comprise a co-ordinator, an assistant co-ordinator, liaison officers sent by each member state, analysts and technical and support staff. An early decision will be made in relation to the assignment of a liaison officer from Ireland in connection with the unit's work.</P>
    <P>The draft agreement proposes that certain costs will be borne directly by member states, principally the cost of liaison officers and other officers &mdash; including the co-ordinator and assistant co-ordinators &mdash; and their equipment. Other costs, including support staff, heating, <Col N="885" /> lighting and so on would be paid jointly by all the member states, with contributions in proportion to the GNP of member states.  The cost to each member state will depend on the location selected for the Europol Drugs Unit and the date of establishment thereof.  A very rough estimate of the cost to this country in 1993 is £4,000, while the estimated cost for 1994 has still to be assessed.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent events have shown that there has been a marked increase in the level of drug smuggling along the coast of west Cork.  Congratulations are due to our Garda and Customs officers for their success in foiling major drug smuggling operations in recent weeks.  The sheer bulk of the haul and the market value of the drugs concerned indicates the level of the operation involved.  These are not petty troops but powerful international criminals, cartels, who will stop at nothing in order to ply their ruthless trade.  Drugs are big business, and the potential profits to the criminals are even bigger.</P>
      <P>On the international black market drugs are an extremely lucrative commodity. Those involved in the drugs trade are well organised, determined and have significant resources at their disposal. They are not constrained by the normal ethics of business.  They will use every method at their disposal in order to fulfil their objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of the drug trade in other countries should leave us in no doubt as to what these methods are &mdash; murder, brute force and extortion.  This trade leaves a trail of misery in its wake.  We have witnessed the damage caused to communities in cities and other parts of our country resulting in broken lives and broken homes.  Those who ply the drug trade are now poised over the southern coast of this country.  They have already begun to use its inlets and bays as a means of smuggling drugs into Ireland and from here into the wider Europe.  They see Ireland as being the exposed and vulnerable underbelly of Europe &mdash;&mdash; a country they can invade, colonise and <Col N="886" /> establish as a major drug distribution depot for Europe.  This is deeply disturbing and has grave implications for Ireland as a whole and for County Cork in particular.  The Garda and Customs officers have been doing an excellent job in tackling this menace.  Their success in recent times is indicative of their determination, dedication and sheer hard work.  It is also a testimony to painstaking and professional detective work. However, this is not simply a national problem; it is one of international proportions. It involves Ireland and our fellow members of the European Community and such is the problem that action is demanded at EC level.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a well organised and powerful international criminal campaign. To respond to this with an <i>ad hoc</i> collection of unco-ordinated international actions is to play into the hands of the drug barons.  What is needed is tough action at EC level.  For this reason the recent resolution regarding the establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit is most timely.  The proposed unit will act as a non-operational team for the exchange of analyses and intelligence in relation to illicit drug trafficking, the criminal organisations involved and the associated money laundering affecting two or more member states.  The objective of this unit is to aid effective action by the police and other law enforcement agencies within and between member states against the criminal activities referred to.  Information is the most valuable currency in the fight against the drug trade.  It is a key strategic element in the fight against drugs.  This unit will provide for such an exchange and will allow for a proportion of general situation reports and criminal analysis on the basis of non-personal information supplied by member states and from other sources.</P>
    <P>In a broader context I welcome the establishment of the European central criminal intelligence office, Europol. This is a prerequisite in the fight against international crime.  I hope this is the beginning of an ongoing process of co-operation between the member states which will strengthen in the coming <Col N="887" /> years.  It is vital that the Community tackle head on the problem of the international drug trade.  It is a problem that concerns all of us and is most effectively tackled in a concerted fashion.  However, the decision making process of the Community moves at a very slow pace.  I am concerned that while the Community trundles along at its own pace, the international criminals will further consolidate their position, making it all the more difficult to dislodge them in the future.  As a result I urge the Minister to use every opportunity to impress upon our Community partners the need for effective co-operation sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>From the national perspective it is clear that Ireland faces a major international threat from the drugs trade.  We are in a position of great vulnerability.  At present the most pressing need is for more manpower and resources for the Garda Síochána, who have the responsibility of safeguarding the southern coast of this country.  I realise we are living in a time of limited resources.  However, the nature of this problem is so serious and its long term implications so grave that urgent action is needed.  If we neglect to take action now future generations may reap a terrible harvest.  We have a major responsibility to our children and to our children's children to protect them from an Ireland which might become the stomping ground of the drugs trade, with harmful drugs freely available and criminal overlords holding sway.  We ignore this danger at our peril.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for her commitment here this morning to ensure that every resource possible will be made available.  This is a very difficult problem. It is very sad that in our towns and cities drugs are pushed on children in all sorts of ways which their parents are not aware of.  There is a responsibility on all of us. We would want the message to go out loud and clear to drug pushers in our own communities that every effort and every resource of the State will be used against those people.  I welcome the Minister's commitment this morning.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time and you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on this extremely important topic.  The drug warlords are waging a war against our society. Obviously everything that can be done must be done to ensure they are apprehended and that this practice is eradicated. Every one of us has seen the devastation it has caused to our young people who have succumbed to drugs and, indeed, the families in despair.  The establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit is timely.  This agreement will help to alleviate the problem.  We welcome the fact that liaison officers, who will be located centrally, will co-operate with each other by way of intelligence relating to illicit drug trafficking and other related crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past number of years, and now particularly in the light of events in the past few weeks, we in Cork have had a particular interest in the establishment of a Europol Drugs Unit.  It is important to give credit where credit is due.  I congratulate the Minister and her Department on setting up the international drugs squad.  Since they have been put in place there has been a massive improvement in the level of detection.  I pay tribute also to the Garda Síochána.  A greater level of co-operation and co-ordination of activities with their colleagues abroad, particularly in Europe, has resulted in major finds of drugs.  I am glad to hear that Garda reports to the Minister suggest that drugs are not coming into his country in the quantities we suspected. However, having hauled in £20 million worth of drugs during the past few years, particularly in the Cork area, one is tempted to agree with the State solicitor in Cork when he said that this is perhaps the tip of the iceberg.  It is important that we bear that in mind and that the Government take any other internal measures open to it to deal with the problem. I am glad the Minister is not under-estimating the difficulties Ireland will face by the dismantling of the barriers, a development that will afford an opportunity <Col N="889" /> to the drug barons to use Ireland as a base for Europe.</P>
    <P>A number of issues must be examined in regard to the drugs problem including the relationship, liaison and co-ordination between the Garda Drugs Squad and the Garda Síochána.  Media reports last weekend suggested that such co-ordination is not as good as it might be and that in certain cases there may have been some vying and jockeying for positions. That must be ruled out.  In view of the seriousness of the drugs problem, will the Minister examine the powers vested in the Garda Drugs Squad?  Will she examine the possibility of increasing the powers of Customs officials, of further integration of the activities of the Customs officials and the Garda Drugs Squad so that both units know exactly what their powers involve?</P>
    <P>Rumour is rife in Cork regarding a suggested £4 million scam.  It is rumoured that some of that money was used for the purchase of drugs and that difficulties arose when certain seizures took place. Will the Minister indicate the veracity or otherwise of that rumour so that once and for all we can either scotch it or examine the problem?</P>
    <P>We must have co-operation with our European partners.  It is in the interest of all of Europe to ensure that proper controls are in place in every member state.  It has been suggested that we would need major funding to police, in particular, the west Cork and Kerry coastline which is regarded as ideal for drug trafficking. It has been suggested that we would need high powered boats, helicopters, a sophisticated radio network and plans for surveillance.  In an Adjournment debate in the Seanad more than a year ago, I recall asking the Government to examine the possibility of receiving Structural and Cohesion Funds to stem the tide in this regard. It is in all our interests that additional funding be made available.  Therefore, in the light of the excellent work that has taken place in regard to drug detection and with an eye to the future, will the Minister ensure that we and our European partners work together to make <Col N="890" /> absolutely certain that Ireland will not be a base for drug trafficking to the rest of Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that we are facing the worst flood of illegal drug trafficking since the early eighties when, from a relatively low base in regard to a drugs problem, we were faced with a serious heroin problem overnight and it took the Legislature, the Government and the Judiciary some time to catch the criminals involved.  After a number of years we got on top of the problem and a number of drug barons were given severe sentences.  However, those drug barons or their replacements have reorganised themselves and are back on top in regard to drug trafficking.  A major effort is required both nationally and within the European Community to tackle the problem and I do not share the Minister's view that the prevention and detection of such offences is being treated as a matter of priority by the relevant State agencies. The resources which have been allocated to resolve the problem both here and in the European Community do not constitute the required response because of the seriousness of the problem.  In addition, I suspect that at least one European Community member state, far from giving this problem the priority it deserves, is probably the warehouse country for drugs distribution throughout Europe.  There is strong evidence to suggest that the traditional problem with cannabis and heroin will be added to by the introduction of cocaine on a large scale on to the European and Irish markets because of the glut of cocaine which has been produced in countries which turn a blind eye to the export of illegal drugs.  We must address the problem at that level as well as providing, as it were, a fire brigade service on the ground to quench the fire once it has started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> It is fair to say that, to some extent, a degree of tolerance is being shown to people who sell drugs openly on the streets of Dublin.  Two areas, in particular, come to mind.  On a recent visit to a flats complex in the city I was shown a shopping centre where I was told that drugs are sold openly.  Apparently, there is a perception that if drugs are sold openly it is easier to tackle the problem. I do not want to see drugs sold openly anywhere in this city or country and anybody who does so should be dealt with severely.</P>
    <P>Much of the crime here and in Europe is related directly to the unlawful supply of drugs, which has become an industry. An authoritative source was recently reported as saying that a particular drugs baron &mdash; to give him the title used &mdash; is bringing one tonne of cannabis worth £10 million into this country every month. The recent haul in Cork could have a street value of approximately £7 million. Burglaries, car thefts, handbag snatches, hold-ups, muggings and shop thefts are part and parcel of the process of acquiring money to pay for an expensive drugs habit.  I do not share the Minister's view that Ireland is not used as a route for drug trafficking.  In the mid to late eighties on a visit to Great Britain as vice-chairman of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, I was told by police sources there that Great Britain and Ireland is a common area for drugs trafficking. On some occasions people bring drugs into Britain and then on to Ireland and on other occasions they bring them into Ireland and on to Britain, changing routes to avoid detection.  The regular changing of routes is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Europol Drugs Unit is a welcome development but it can scarcely be taken as a serious response to a problem which is at epidemic levels and when the Minister's Department estimates the cost of such response to the Exchequer this year at £4,000, with no figures available for next year.  What sort of a response is that to a problem of this level?  A fully empowered drugs enforcement <Col N="892" /> agency at EC level with a sub-agency at British-Irish level is required to prevent the importation of large quantities of drugs.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister and the House in congratulating the Garda and Customs authorities on recent seizures.  However, I strongly suspect that this is but the tip of the iceberg.  Drugs could be landed at any point on this island and here was one discovery.  What other large quantities have not been discovered?  There must be large quantities not discovered when we see the extent of the problem on the ground.  That is why I believe we need a joint drugs enforcement agency within these islands.  There is no point in thinking that if the drugs get to Scotland and across to Northern Ireland that we can stop them at the Border.  That is daft.  In the context of smuggling generally, the same Dáil committee saw warehouses straddling the Border.  Once the drugs get into Northern Ireland they will come in here; once they get in here they will get into Northern Ireland.  We need a joint effort within these islands and within the European Community.  If we are serious about tackling this problem we need a drugs enforcement agency at European Community level with a sub-agency at British-Irish level.</P>
    <P>In addition &mdash; and again I would be critical of the European Community &mdash; I believe that the European Community must take a diplomatic offensive against those countries which continue to manufacture and export illegal drugs as well as those countries which register vessels that transport those goods and those countries which warehouse them.  There is a strong suspicion that many of these drugs are warehoused through Holland, a member of the European Community, particularly at the port of Rotterdam.</P>
    <P>I have to ask are we really serious about tackling this problem?  It would be in our interests to give European aid to countries such as Colombia, Pakistan and other exporting countries to stop exporting these illegal drugs.  If we are to give them financial aid it would be cost effective because we would save money by not having to deal with this problem when <Col N="893" /> the fire is very much alight on the ground and the situation out of control.  If aid to these countries is not acceptable as an inducement to behave as they should, then the European Community should take a collective diplomatic offensive against these countries.  Everybody knows the countries in which these drugs are manufactured and exported from.  It is time the European Community took action at Community level.  It is not good enough simply to wait until people's lives are destroyed, until families have been destroyed and people are in the later stages of HIV or AIDS as a result of drug abuse.  It is too late then.  The problem needs to be tackled at that level, but it also needs to be tackled at European level, and at international level. However, it is not being tackled effectively at international level.</P>
    <P>Welcome and all as this response from the European Community is, it is a feeble response.  Why is this response so feeble? Have the sinister influences got a grip on the EC?  Why is the response not stronger?  It should be stronger.  The problem is crying out for action at European level.  Why is there not agreement between the member states for stronger action?  Does somebody have the inside track on one of the member states?  I am not suggesting it is Ireland.  Certainly it is sinister that this response is so feeble. When will we see some real action being taken?</P>
    <P>It is ironic that this Europol Drugs Unit is being given powers to pursue illegal money laundering activities associated with drug trafficking between two or more member states at a time when our own Government is proposing to allow the repatriation of laundered money, some of it surely related to illegal drug trafficking.  This is a multi-million pound holiday bonanza for the drug barons courtesy of the legitimate citizens and honest businessmen.  Where is the consistency between Government proposals on repatriation of so-called hot money and this EC attempt to combat the activities of criminal organisations involved in money laundering activities?  The Government is making a nonsense of the <Col N="894" /> law by allowing hot money to be brought back to this country irrespective of how it was raised.  Lack of action on money laundering is in direct conflict with existing EC law.  Every penny brought back to this country should be investigated to see if it meets the requirements of this new Europol Drugs Unit in relation to criminal activities and, in particular, drug trafficking activities.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a Europol Drugs Unit head office, I hope the Minister will put in a bid to have that office located here and, specifically, to have it located in Dublin.  I believe that we are far too laid back in pushing our case to have more and more European agencies located here &mdash; I do not associate this just with the existing Government.  If this were to prevent us from having a major agency located here then I would not be pushing this case because we do need a major agency.  We should be looking for our share of EC agencies to be located in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of the most effective measures that can be taken against drug traffickers is to deprive them of the profits gained from their illegal activities.  In the last few years a number of drug barons have been imprisoned but, as far as I am aware, no substantial amounts of money have been seized.  I understand that under one of the Finance Acts of the early eighties it is possible to seize or to impose a very penal tax on income derived illegally or immorally.  If that is the case, why has such a tax not been applied to the income of these drug barons?  Presumably it is because the Revenue Commissioners do not know the whereabouts of these large bank accounts which many of them must have. Is that because these accounts are located abroad?  If so, are we now in the process of allowing those funds to be brought back here tax free or for a very small penalty?</P>
    <P>This whole question of allowing the repatriation of these funds, particularly funds which I will go so far as to say are held abroad because they were raised in criminal circumstances related to drugs and to the drugs flood into this country <Col N="895" /> in the early eighties, is questionable. How can we justify the repatriation of any of that money?  It should all be seized and penalties imposed, not small amounts of tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the amounts of heroin, cocaine and ecstasy imported are small by international standards.  By international standards this is a small country but if one looks at the amount of seizures in recent times, which I suspect is simply the tip of the iceberg, then I do not believe that the importation of illegal drugs into this country is any less than that into Great Britain or comparable countries.</P>
    <P>We will be supporting this motion but I do not think that it goes far enough.  I hope the Minister has noted some of the points I made and that she will take up with her colleagues at EC level the suggestions I have made about a diplomatic offensive and the possibility of a full drugs enforcement agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two clear proposals to the Minister arising from our debate here on drugs.  First, there is a strong case for the establishment of the headquarters of the new Europol Drugs Unit in Ireland.  Second, a national coast watch service should be established in Ireland.  Those specific proposals need to be addressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As yet there is no agreement on the location of the new unit.  It will be decided at the EC Summit in Copenhagen next week or at the meeting of the Justice Ministers of the Community the following week.  There are two principal reasons why a strong pitch can be made for the location of that headquarters in Ireland.  The fact that no EC institution of consequence is located in Ireland should put this country at the head of the queue in regard to the location of this unit. Secondly, my area in west Cork has recently been established as a major gateway for the importation of drugs.  This label is unwelcome, but it reinforces the case I am making for the establishment of the unit in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> It is essential that a coast watch service be established here.  It should be the eyes and ears of the Garda Síochána and the Customs officials along our coastline.  I am sure more Deputies have visited west Cork and know there are hundreds of miles of indented coastline, dozens of coves and bays and hundreds of islands there.  It is impossible for the relatively small number of gardaí and Customs officials to constantly watch that stretch of coastline and therefore, we should have a national coast watch service.  There is a growing demand for the establishment of this service and I am disappointed that to date neither the Minister nor any member of the Government has responded to this serious proposal.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion about the extent of the drugs menace. The Minister in her speech implied that the drugs problem here is not enormous. Furthermore, she stated that the indications were that the landings of cannabis were for the most part intended for consumption on the home market.  She also says that Ireland is not part of an international drug trafficking route.  Those statements must be questioned and I would ask the Minister to reflect on some additional points I wish to raise in connection with this matter.  It is my view that the extent of the importation of drugs may be far greater than originally realised and that landings in Ireland are being made for onward transmission to the UK.</P>
    <P>A report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday states that Irish authorities have confirmed that an estimated three tonnes of cannabis with a street value of £30 million is being landed in Ireland each month.  That is a serious problem and the Minister should respond to the suggestion that drug landings are of that level. That report alleges that the bulk of drugs imported end up in the UK, mostly through Northern Ireland.  There appears to be some corroboration of that report in a report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on Tuesday on comments by the Taoiseach on his visit to Cork on Monday.</P>
    <P>He referred to the need for EC funding and insisted that the EC provide £13 million <Col N="897" /> to seal off the west Cork drugs gateway. To support his argument he claimed that the problem of the importation of drugs was a &ldquo;European crisis&rdquo;.  Who is correct in regard to the level of drugs imported to Ireland?  The Minister would lead us to believe that it is a relatively modest problem mainly related to the domestic market but is there a European wide problem with substantial landings being made and areas like west Cork being used as a gateway to Europe, particularly to the UK?  What was the Taoiseach referring to when he talked of a European crisis?  The Minister should clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the points raised by the Minister in her speech.  She referred to the equipment used by the Garda Síochána.  It is not acceptable, in the context of points raised on that issue, to merely say that &ldquo;technical surveillance is readily available as required&rdquo;.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment last Wednesday.  The Minister should tell us whether the most modern equipment is available to the Garda Síochána.  The Minister did not respond to my question last Wednesday in this regard.  There is a need for such modern equipment, specifically high powered binoculars. Surely they are an obvious requirement for people guarding the coastline.  There is a need also for night-sight equipment, infra-red cameras and scrambler radios. The Minister may think I do not know what I am talking about but I would remind her I come from west Cork and I have talked to the people there who are dealing with the drugs problem.  I accept the gardaí and Customs officials have equipment but do they have the most modern equipment to defeat the drug smugglers?  The Minister should revise her approach and make moneys available to ensure such equipment is available.</P>
    <P>On scrambler radios, what good is a radio system into which the smugglers can tune?  The purpose of a scrambler radio is to ensure that such interception does not take place.  I will not go into detail on this point as it might be a sensitive issue.  The most modern equipment <Col N="898" /> should be available and money should not be spared for the provision of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to co-operation. There is a degree of friendly rivalry between the Garda Síochána and the Customs officials.  While they have a common objective there is a slight difference in how they approach this problem. The job of the Customs officials is to prevent landings or seize the drugs already landed but the job of the Garda Síochána is to apprehend the people involved.  Perhaps there should be further discussion to ensure that the lines of communication between those two are cleared because there is a slightly different approach by both.  It is the Minister's responsibility to resolve this matter and she should do so quickly to ensure that this friendly rivalry is channelled towards a common objective.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's views in regard to intelligence gathering.  It fits neatly into the point I made regarding a national coast watch service.  I am glad the people of west Cork have been providing the authorities with information.  I am pleased telephone calls have been made.  There is a tradition here going back to O'Flaherty and &ldquo;The Informer&rdquo; that people should not give information to the Garda Síochána.  I am delighted at the maturity of the people in west Cork that they are supplying information to the Garda and the Customs officials.  I would ask them to continue to do that; but often it is only a chance reaction where somebody notices, for example, a suspicious looking yacht and a telephone call may be made.  It is a responsible reaction, but it must be done on a co-ordinated basis, that is, through a national coast watch service.  Otherwise, we are relying on chance.  That is the answer to the point raised by the Minister regarding intelligence.</P>
    <P>The question of the extent of the problem here is not the real issue.  I was a member of a ministerial drugs committee back in the early eighties when there was a crisis, particularly in relation to the heroin problem in Dublin.  I am glad that the steps we took at that time achieved useful results.  It is obviously an area that <Col N="899" /> must be continually monitored. However, the issue before us now is not so much that aspect of the problem but our reaction as a country to drug importation and how we cope with that.  It involves also our reaction as part of the Europol Drugs Unit and how we can both contribute to that and avail of the pooling of intelligence with our neighbours in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a major problem on her hands.  It is a much bigger problem than what is implied in her speech.  The growing menace of drug smuggling along our coastline is reaching epidemic proportions.  One cannot be absolutely certain, but I am aware personally of landings that took place which where never traced and landings which were only partially traced.  That is common knowledge in west Cork.  We must have a committed response at national and European level.  Unless this is forthcoming I fear that the problem will continue. As a legislator I have a particular interest in the problem from the national point of view, but particularly because of the unwelcome &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; in my area of west Cork.  West Cork is the premier tourist area in the country &mdash; I see the Minister does not totally agree with me on that &mdash; but these are &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; we can do without.  Even though the tourist season may not be at its height we must put up the warning signals to these people.  We must stop this activity.  It is unwelcome from the west Cork point of view, and the national point of view and the European point of view.  I ask the Minister to seriously take on board the points I have raised because unless she does this the problem will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit.  It is regrettable that it has taken so long for this unit to be established because, as the Minister said in her address, it was during the Irish Presidency in 1990 that the mechanism was put in place for the establishment of an agency to exchange intelligence and so on in relation to drug trafficking.  No one <Col N="900" /> country, particularly a small country such as ours, can deal on its own with the problems that arise from drug trafficking. Co-operation and intelligence are, as the Minister said, the key to law enforcement in this area.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Single Market, where thankfully we now have the free movement of goods and persons, it is important that that freedom is not abused; and where that freedom leads to the growth of organised crime, racketeering or drug trafficking, we must have the measures in place to deal with those problems.  We must harmonise our laws on indictment and ensure that our extradition legislation is in order.  We must co-operate fully with all member states and not become paranoid in regard to confidentiality and secrecy.  We must assist in the fullest measure possible with the detection of crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister made available figures in relation to the amount of drugs that have been seized here in the past two years. This is estimated at £26 million.  I agree with others who say that is an under-estimation. For example, if we look at the prison population in Mountjoy, one-third of the prisoners there are intravenous drug users.  The statistics for juvenile crime indicate that 40 per cent of crime is committed by juveniles.  Many experts believe that much of that crime, perhaps 80 per cent, is drug related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the problem in Cork, for example, it is only a year and a half ago since the State Solicitor there, Mr. Barry Galvin, said that Cork was being used to smuggle drugs into Ireland.  The then Minister for Justice, the Minister's predecessor, dismissed that statement saying it was inaccurate.  We do not have sufficient information with regard to this problem and in quoting statistics of any kind we are probably only tipping the iceberg.  The problem is much greater than we realise and this will be the case as long as those who are engaged in drug trafficking can make money from their crime.  If crime pays there will be people engaged in it.  That is a simple fact. Removing the incentives for money to be made from crime will go a long way <Col N="901" /> towards substantially reducing not just drug trafficking but organised crime generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to tax those who make money from illegal activities.  It seems extraordinary that it was only in the eighties we gave the Revenue Commissioners powers to tax the earnings of criminals.  Until that time not only was the money made from crime not seized but one was not required to pay tax on it.  That was obviously an appalling loophole in our tax legislation.  Al Capone was not apprehended for racketeering, but for tax evasion.  This is often the most effective way to apprehend those involved in serious crime.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Revenue Commissioners have raised substantial moneys by way of tax collection from those involved in crime, but unfortunately that is not sufficient. As a matter of urgency we must introduce legislation here, not just minimalist legislation but broad based comprehensive legislation to allow for the seizure of the assets of those involved in crime.  That means it would not be sufficient for somebody to have to prove that the money was made from criminal activities.  If particular individuals who have not worked for a number of years have a large number of houses &mdash; and in one case eight or nine cars, I understand &mdash; and if they cannot explain how they acquired that wealth, it should be sufficient grounds for those assets to be seized.  I would not like to see legislation being introduced which would make it difficult for the authorities to prove that the earnings were derived from criminal activity.</P>
    <P>I realise our law is based on the presumption that one is innocent until proven guilty, but in relation to the accumulation of assets, if someone cannot explain how they acquired those assets and if there are reasonable grounds for believing they were acquired through criminal activities, that should be sufficient to have those assets seized.  Those moneys could then be applied, for example, towards criminal injuries awards, because the amount allocated for <Col N="902" /> this is appalling &mdash; a total of £1 million is indicated in the Estimates this year. Those who are the victims of crime get nothing for pain and suffering.  All they receive are out of pocket expenses and they must wait as long as three years to obtain those.</P>
    <P>There is much we can do by way of helping the victims of crime, the people who suffer.  The greatest measure any Minister for Justice could introduce, not just in relation to drugs but to many crimes, such as racketeering and so on, which are so rampant in our society, would be to seize the assets of criminals.</P>
    <P>We need also to change our education system.  The Minister is right in that if we limit the market for drugs we will go a long way towards restricting the powers and control of drug barons.  Our education system needs to be much more value-based.  Many of the values people grew up with in the past no longer exist. The concept of right and wrong must be a much stronger element of our education system.  It is appalling that young children commit serious crimes, deface property and have no respect for their own property or that of their neighbours or their communities.  In the context of the reforms that are under way in education and the consideration being given to the submissions on the Green Paper, I hope there will be a move towards a more value-based education system, which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the G7 countries established a task force to help them co-ordinate and exchange information on the proceeds of crime.  The purpose of the group, known as the international Financial Action Task Force which was set up in Paris in 1989 by the G7 countries, the world's seven leading industrial powers, was to co-ordinate action to recover and control the proceeds of crime.  I will quote from the group's first report in 1990 because it puts in perspective what we are talking about this morning.  It states that the proceeds from drug trafficking in Europe and the United States then waiting to be laundered were approximately <Col N="903" /> $85 billion and that there is no shortage of places to put that money.</P>
    <P>When Gacha, one of the leaders of a Colombian cartel involved in the illicit drug trade, was finally tracked down and caught by the Colombian police it was found he had $130 million in 82 different bank accounts in 16 countries.  I refer to that matter in the context of the proposed tax amnesty to be introduced here.  I cannot stress strongly enough that if this country is to be used to launder money from drug trafficking and organised crime it would be an appalling reflection on society.  I ask the Minister for Justice in particular to ensure that in drafting legislation dealing with the tax amnesty, people who made their money from illegal activities, particularly drug trafficking, are excluded.</P>
    <P>What would stop Gacha and other drug barons around the world laundering their money through Ireland?  I understand it could be done in a matter of seconds. The report states that electronic transfers and satellite links can shift money around the world several times in 24 hours, from the Cayman Islands to Jersey to the Isle of Man, or wherever, in a matter of minutes.  It could be laundered through this country by the use of an address here or by way of an Irish resident.  When the tax amnesty is introduced the Government should not allow anyone who has made money through organised crime to launder it through Ireland.</P>
    <P>In regard to the resources at the disposal of the authorities here the Minister of State chairs the National Drugs Co-ordinating Advisory Group which is about to make recommendations in relation to changes in the legislation.  We need to co-ordinate the forces that are at work here such as the Naval Service, the Garda Síochána and the Customs officers.  There is a plethora of agencies and bodies in Ireland and we are very good at setting up new quangos, but unless there is co-ordination and people work together in a particular unit there will not be effective action and controls. We saw an example of this yesterday in relation to the Department of the Environment. <Col N="904" /> When nobody has charge of co-ordinating matters mistakes are made. Lack of co-ordination and a failure to bring people together can often be very costly, particularly in terms of the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the request to the European Community for £13 million to assist in the upgrading of radio equipment, the supply of a naval patrol vessel, new computer equipment, aerial surveillance, sniffer dogs and so on, which are required by the Customs authorities, perhaps the Minister would say under what heading an application is being made to the Community for this money.  The Taoiseach referred to that matter in Cork in the last few days.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy O'Keeffe's comments in regard to equipment at the disposal of authorities such as the Garda Síochána, Customs officials and so on. Greater use should be made of the helicopters and aerial surveillance generally. It has been shown in the United States that this is a much more effective and cheaper way of detecting crime because a helicopter may have a radius of 25 miles whereas a ground vehicle has a radius of about a mile at the most.  While it has been discovered that this is a much more effective and cheaper way of detecting crime we rarely if ever use helicopters in the direction of what were regarded as non-terrorist crimes &mdash; I do not think the Garda Síochána has at its full-time disposal helicopters or aerial equipment. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that matter.  We live in an age in which crime has become so sophisticated that unless the Garda Síochána has the necessary equipment it will not be effective in detecting crime.</P>
    <P>A conference was held in Dublin earlier this year by the MAG information system, a group of maritime countries who came together to exchange intelligence in relation to crime, particularly drug trafficking.  Will the Minister say how the Europol Drugs Unit will fit in with the maritime organisation?  Crime detection should not stop at European level; we must go much further because the drugs boundary does not end at the <Col N="905" /> boundary of the European Community. There needs to be much more widespread co-operation than simply between the 12 member states.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say from what rank the Garda Síochána liaison officer will be appointed &mdash; for example, will it be above or below the rank of inspector?  I know a final decision has not been made but I would like an idea of the rank of the officer who will do that job.  I would also like to know whether the officer will be appointed on a full-time basis.  If the cost for the remainder of this year is only £4,000 presumably that relates to travelling costs.  Will the liaison officer be located at a temporary location or will he have occasionally to travel to meetings? I would like the Minister to clarify how the unit will operate.</P>
    <P>The ongoing disputes between various member states about the location of new agencies are regrettable as they delay the introduction of many fine measures.  A dispute between Italy and France on whether the Europol police office is located in Strasbourg or Rome has delayed the establishment of that office and that is most regrettable.  I would like to think that at heads of Government meetings, Ireland would make a very strong case that until such time as disputes between member states are resolved these bodies should be established in Brussels &mdash; the location of the European Commission and centre of European activity generally &mdash; as soon as decisions are made, rather than long-fingering proposals for many years.  That happens in relation to the European Environment Protection Agency and many other bodies.  It is regrettable.  It delays much excellent work and makes a farce of many of the fine Council meetings if the measures adopted cannot be put in place because a location cannot be agreed between competing countries.</P>
    <P>We need to increase the powers of the Customs officers to give them the same powers of arrest and detention as the Garda Síochána have in regard to persons found with drugs.  We need to give additional powers to prison officers.  Prisons are used for the sale of much of <Col N="906" /> the illicit drugs.  Already this year two prisoners have died.  A 17 year old prisoner in Wheatfield hanged himself after a drugs overdose and a Greek prisoner died in Mountjoy as a result of an overdose. I wonder why so many drugs are getting into our prisons.  There is no point in having health programmes in the prisons to rehabilitate offenders if they can get drugs.  Visitors for example, should not be allowed to bring bags or presents to prisoners.  Money can be left for the purchase of goods.  In Cork prison some time ago a person was arrested, convicted and given a suspended sentence for bringing a tennis ball with 20 grammes of cannabis into the prison.</P>
    <P>In order to stop drugs coming into the prisons we need to stop visitors bringing in bags or gifts.  We could also introduce random searches, although that method involves some danger, and we can give prison officers the power to arrest and detain visitors found to be carrying drugs, until the Garda arrive.  We could also, perhaps, punish inmates by banning for a length of time visitors who have brought in drugs.  Whatever method we adopt we must root out the drugs supply into prisons. It costs on average £110 per day to keep a person in prison.  For some prisoners at least it should be an effective way of making sure that they will not commit crimes when they are released. If a person is in prison for drug-related offences he will not be cured if the drugs supply is there.  Those who supply drugs to prison inmates are not doing the prisoners any service and one must question the motives of such visitors.</P>
    <P>We need to place heavy emphasis on health education.  Drug barons are destroying society.  Many young people become hooked on drugs at a very early age.  I understand from Garda sources that young people are given drugs free in order to get them hooked and when they become dependent they have to rob to feed the habit.  That is appalling.  It destroys the health and lives of families of many of our young people.  Much of the crime in urban areas is committed to feed a drug habit.  If we root out the drugs problem we will solve much of the crime <Col N="907" /> in this country.  Drugs experts tell me that it would cost a minimum of £60 a day to feed even the mildest drug addicts and the cost goes much higher depending on the quantity and nature of the drugs needed.  No person can afford that and certainly a teenager cannot get his hands on that kind of money without committing serious crime.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the new directive issued to the Garda Síochána under which they may now take somebody to a Garda station, question him and let him off with a summons to follow, will further increase the number of crimes committed in order to feed a drugs habit.  Bringing a person to court is a deterrent and it indicates the grave nature of the crime. When a person is allowed walk out again the crime will not be considered very serious.  This directive is a mistake.  I heard Mr. P. J. Stone speak about that this morning and any garda to whom I have spoken has felt strongly that this will escalate crime and will lead to many difficulties.  This directive is not directly related to the debate this morning, but if we want to be effective in combating drug trafficking and abuse we will have to make sure that our criminal jurisprudence and procedures are effective.</P>
    <P>Will the Europol police office be given additional powers over and above powers in relation to organised crime, racketeering and drug trafficking?  This morning we are simply giving approval for the establishment of a drugs unit and somewhere down the road a European police office will have powers to deal with racketeering and organised crime.  Is it intended to go further?  Is it intended to have a European police force to deal with particular crimes and will the members have powers to cross boundaries in order to apprehend those who are engaged in serious crime?  The boundary limit and the fact that nobody can cross a boundary provides a loophole that will allow criminals to walk free.  We need a European police force.  Is that on the agenda and, if not, why not?  It would be of invaluable help in combating crime.</P>
    <P>Was a promise made in relation to the <Col N="908" /> seizure of assets of criminals?  I know that most member states have ratified the Council of Europe Convention in relation to the seizure of assets.  Will the Minister clarify that for me?  Regardless of European requirements we need that sort of law.  I could give the Minister chapter and verse about organised crime in this city where many business people have to pay high insurance premiums because of the protection racket operating in the city.  It initially affected the north inner city but now it affects the south inner city.  If traders do not pay protection money their premises will be burnt and their staff threatened.  In one case to which I referred here before, a young businessman was shot.  It is appalling in this day and age that it is not an offence to pay protection money.  If we want to prevent crime we must make it an offence to pay protection money. Will the new public order legislation deal with that?  When I moved a public order Bill in the House in February the Minister said that there was no need for changes in the legislation, that the Garda had not told her there was any need to change the law.  Has the Minister consulted with the Garda since and does she now realise the urgent need to change the law in this regard?</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to have a debate here on these matters.  I know that the justification for the debate was that the Attorney General advised that under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution where there is a charge on public funds, approval must be given in the Dáil.  Even where the approval of the Dáil is not required, I believe that as a matter of course we should debate such agreements in this House.  In fact, in some European countries &mdash; for example, in Denmark &mdash; before any Minister of the Government can agree to sign or participate in conventions or agreements at European level, he or she must first obtain the approval of the national Parliament.  I know many Ministers, particularly when they chair Council of Ministers meetings, often feel that that procedure leads to long delays, that the Danes delay everything because they must first seek the <Col N="909" /> approval of their Parliament.  I believe the Danes are right.  I believe there is greater accountability within that type of system and that it strengthens the hands of a Minister if he or she has first obtained the approval of their Parliament or, as in our case, the Houses of the Oireachtas. The pattern and experience here has been that sometimes we cannot even discuss what happens at European level but are merely treated to statements after important Council meetings have taken place.  Rather than seeking in advance the advice, assistance and support of the Members of Parliament who represent the public, these statements amount to merely telling us what went on.  If the European Community is to act, if we are to deal with the great democratic deficit about which everybody speaks, then we must have more accountability, more debates, more consultation and greater participation by the Members of national Parliaments.</P>
    <P>This is a good measure &mdash; a small step, but one in the right direction.  No one country, particularly one of our size, can fight drug trafficking alone.  It is particularly in our interest to have the strongest possible support system in place at European level and indeed beyond.  We need that because, as the Minister herself has said, it is through intelligence and information that enforcement can take place. I hope that this measure we are agreeing today for the establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit will not be delayed any further and that at the end of the meeting in Copenhagen at the end of this month the Justice Ministers will agree to the establishment of this unit at a temporary location, even if there remains dispute about its permanent location.  Its establishment is important and urgent, particularly within the context of the remaining EC barriers having been removed at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>It is most important that that which we all sought &mdash; a free and open market, the free movement of persons and goods within the Community &mdash; is not abused and/or used for the greater perpetration of crime, the supply of drugs and so on, with more people throughout the world <Col N="910" /> being made even wealthier.  It is in all our interests to ensure that this is not rendered more easy.  Drug trafficking in this small, island country on the periphery of Europe can be very easy, since there are so many places on our shores where somebody can land a boat and import large quantities of drugs.  It is crucial that we have a mechanism in place to ensure that such does not happen.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Harney in a number of the sentiments she expressed, in particular when she began by saying that the drugs problem is indeed much greater than many of us realise.  In my view probably it is our single greatest social problem today after unemployment.  That is definitely the case in Dublin city, where one-third of our population now live.  I cannot say whether it is the case nationwide in other towns and cities.  I am sure other Members who represent those areas will be able to so indicate.  But I am in no doubt that if the drugs problem spreads as quickly and as devastatingly to other cities and areas nationwide as it has done in Dublin city, the same will apply there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the authorities vested with the responsibility for dealing with the problem realise its seriousness. It is my belief that, certainly in Dublin, the authorities have adopted a policy of containment, of acceptance, that this is something that is happening in particular areas and is part and parcel of modern society, that if it can be confined to those areas with minimum pressure, they believe they can proceed on that basis.  That is a disastrous approach to adopt.  If that is the approach of the relevant authorities, I predict that the problem will continue to fester, that it will get totally out of control and reach <Col N="911" /> crisis point, when it will be extremely difficult to deal with or counteract.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Harney also in her remarks about the proposed tax amnesty, to which I am fundamentally opposed in any shape or form.  If and when the Government propose introducing legislation allowing for its introduction, the very least they can do is ensure that organised criminals, particularly those who ply the heroin trade destroying so many young lives, should not be enabled to avail of that amnesty to launder their illgotten profits.  I fear very much that, no matter what shape or form such a tax amnesty takes, that is what will happen, that people who have amassed considerable fortunes here from their drugs trade will avail of the opportunity to launder such money, render it respectable and invest it for their long term benefit. That was one reason I was particularly disgusted to hear that the Government had decided to propose such a tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>As one of the elected representatives of an inner area of this capital city, one that has been devastated by heroin abuse in particular, I welcome the decision of the 12 TREVI Ministers in Copenhagen to establish a drugs intelligence unit constituting the first phase of a European criminal intelligence office.  Despite the lack of detail with which we have been furnished about this development and the almost laughable allocation of £4,000, which does not make much sense to me, the fact that the Europol Drugs Unit is being established, is in itself an indication of the seriousness with which the problem is being approached at European level. Indeed, its establishment is evidence of the increasing seriousness of international drug trafficking in Europe and its effects on our society, not that we are in need of any such evidence.  Certainly nobody representing Dublin city should need to be reminded of the dreadful problem already obtaining here.</P>
    <P>While the events of recent weeks might appear to highlight the timeliness and necessity for the establishment of this Europol Drugs Unit &mdash; I am thinking of <Col N="912" /> the seizure of the cargo of cannabis in west Cork &mdash; I regret having to admit that I see a much more deadly reason for its establishment day in day out in Dublin's inner city than is necessitated by any discovered cargo of cannabis no matter how large, no matter how many millions of pounds it may have yielded for those involved.  There is a very real danger that high profile discoveries of tonnes of cannabis can have the effect of diverting attention from the real scandal and deadly damage that hard drugs trafficking is doing in this country.  As I have done on so many previous occasions in this House over the past 11 years, I refer to the dreadful social problem of heroin abuse in Dublin, not merely within the inner city but in many other working class areas of the city and its suburbs.  Perhaps some ten years ago, because the problem was in its infancy, it was perceived as a major problem, referred to as the heroin bush fire devastating particular communities. It was so dramatic it received huge coverage on the part of the media and much time was devoted to its discussion in the House here.  However, the problem is much worse today because it is no longer confined to particular areas of the inner city; it is now rooted in virtually every working class area and suburb of the city.</P>
    <P>I have raised this problem at Question Time, on the Adjournment, in the debate on the Misuse of Drugs Act and other debates but I regret to say that at ministerial, departmental and senior Garda level the seriousness of the problem has yet to be recognised.  Lip service has been paid to it and every reply to every Dáil question is full of the usual cliches.  I exempt the Minister from this criticism as she is not long enough in office to be included.  I hope, however, that she will tackle this issue and ensure that it receives the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>During the past 11 years there has been no decisive response at senior Garda and departmental level to the hard drugs problem.  I do not blame gardaí at local level.  Indeed, with inadequate resources, they have made great attempts to wrestle with the problem despite the limitations <Col N="913" /> imposed because of a lack of direction at ministerial and departmental level.</P>
    <P>There has been the odd, sporadic success, such as the recent yacht cargo which was uncovered.  I do not want to take from that achievement but it seems that it was a group of people on a picnic on a beach who dug up the first consignment of hash or cannabis.  The final consignment was uncovered in a drain or bog by a local farmer.  Nonetheless, this was a significant find.  However, as so many others have said, it was just the tip of the iceberg in relation to the cannabis trade between this country and Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>The much more deadly problem of heroin trafficking has been allowed to fester and ruin thousands of young people in Dublin city.  If this is not sufficient evidence, all we need do is consider the many treatment centres and drug treatment projects which have been undertaken.  Recently we were circularised with information on the Merchant's Quay project &mdash; a drugs-HIV service in the inner city &mdash; which is run by the Franciscan Friars who are doing tremendous work, like so many other groups.  However, for the unfortunate people who attend these centres it is far too late.</P>
    <P>The official attitude seems to be that as long as the heroin problem is confined to the poverty-stricken, disadvantaged areas of Dublin there is no need to take the necessary steps to deal with it.  This is almost what one would expect given that no remedial action is taken by the Government to tackle any social problem in acutely disadvantaged areas, including the lack of access to second or third level education which is a parallel problem in areas where there is a serious drug problem.  In my own area, approximately 1 per cent of young people go on to third level education.  This has been the subject of far more reports than those relating to the drugs problem but nothing has ever been done about it.  No one should be surprised, therefore, or wonder why so little has been done about the hard drugs problem in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am not going to stop at education; the <Col N="914" /> deplorable housing conditions go hand in hand &mdash; these lead to young people abusing drugs such as heroin &mdash; with massive unemployment and serious welfare problems.  If anybody stops to think why so many young people abuse a devastating horror drug such as heroin the answer lies in these social problems.  The lack of a Government response to tackle the hard drugs problem and other social problems has led to young people going down the <i>cul-de-sac</i> of heroin addiction.</P>
    <P>I do not say lightly that during the past ten or 11 years no one at Government level appeared to care enough to confront the problems, and it is not as if they are not familiar with them.  As we are aware, members of the Government also represent these areas.  I am not the sole representative in this House of a disadvantaged inner city area; the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Gay Mitchell, spoke strongly about the problem on the south side of Dublin where it is equally horrifying.  However, little or no action has been taken to deal with the problem. I would love to know the reason.</P>
    <P>I hope in the coming weeks and months, when decisions are made on the way the Structural Funds should be allocated, someone at Government level will stop and think and suggest that some of this famous £8 billion should be spent in the devastated areas of Dublin's inner city, just around the corner from O'Connell Street.  We should think of the damage that is being done to one of our more important industries, the tourism industry, even in strict economic terms. Nine times out of ten, when a tourist is attacked or bludgeoned, it is a young person who is desperate to feed his habit who is involved.  Each time this happens another nail in the coffin of the tourism industry is hammered in.  Millions of pounds have been spent in Temple Bar to turn it into a tourist haven while literally across the street, off O'Connell Street, we have one of the most, if not the most disadvantaged urban areas in the country. This does not make sense.  No concerted effort has been made at interdepartmental level to deal with the social problems in that area.  Even now it <Col N="915" /> is only a handful of young people who are involved in drug-related crime. However, it is not too late to deal with it; what is required is the political will.</P>
    <P>I have no axe to grind with any Government, but during my time in this House no Government has ever had the political will even to think about confronting this problem.  Indeed, I would go a step further and suggest that there has been a consistent refusal by the Government even to recognise that a problem exists until such time as it reaches crisis proportions, at which stage there is the usual inadequate fire brigade response from the Government in an effort to create the impression that something is being done about the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to give the impression that I am in the business of making wild, unfounded or unsubstantiated accusations. I wish to give a specific example of the Government's inaction and refusal to accept that this problem exists.  On 4 February last, two medical doctors at the National Drug Treatment Centre published a report in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> which stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Figures available at the [Drug Treatment] Centre for 1991/1992 indicate that the level of opiate abuse both illicit and prescribed is again on the increase.</P>
    <P>Illicit heroin abuse which had previously stabilised shows a marked increase in 1991 and 1992.  This is in keeping with Garda Drug Squad figures which confirm this trend.  In 1991, 161 grams of heroin were seized whereas in 1992, 450 grams were confiscated.</P>
    <P>I thought that article might be of interest to the Minister for Justice, and I tabled a priority question on this matter on 17 February last.  My question asked the Minister for Justice her views on whether the availability of heroin, in particular, was again on the increase in view of the worsening crime problem in Dublin city and the high incidence of drug-related crime, and whether more specialised and increased Garda resources were necessary to confront this serious problem. <Col N="916" /> The first three lines of the Minister's reply are very interesting, particularly in light of my quotation from the article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> written by people dealing with the problem on the ground. The Minister said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest any significant increase in the supply of heroin to this country.</P>
    <P>That is what I mean when I say the Government refuses to accept the extent of the problem.  In fact, that type of statement regularly features in replies to parliamentary questions about heroin.  It is as if there is an official policy that the Government do not want people to know that holy Catholic Ireland has a major heroin problem.  I cannot think of any other reason for giving such replies.  It should be possible for the Minister to say that the Garda and the Department are dealing with the problem, etc.  A reply to a subsequent parliamentary question in March gave the lie to the Minister's original reply in February &mdash; I received an apology from the Minister at a later stage. Nobody should think that I am exaggerating the position in any way &mdash; a deliberate lie was told to cover up what was evident to the Garda who are dealing with the problem at local level, the community workers who are dealing with the victims at local level and all those concerned about the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her reply to my question in February went on to back up her statement that there was no significant increase in the supply of heroin to this country by saying:</P>
    <P>The preliminary 1992 figure, in fact, equates with the 1990 figure</P>
    <P>When one throws around statistics one can fool whomever one wishes to fool.</P>
    <P>and is 20 per cent less than the average heroin seizure figure for the decade concerned.  In fact, the Garda authorities have indicated to me that factors such as the very low percentage of pure heroin contained in the quantity seized and in the increasing usage of heroin <Col N="917" /> substitutes would normally suggest a limited supply of heroin.</P>
    <P>She went on to give the usual platitudes, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Garda authorities are keenly aware that there are some heroin dealing activities associated with certain areas of Dublin and very special attention is being given to these areas.  Specific measures have been taken by the Garda to counteract such activity and these measures have resulted in a considerable number of detections of drug related offences.</P>
    <P>It has to be put on the record &mdash; this matter has to be dealt with at some stage &mdash; that when a Member of this House puts down a parliamentary question on the extent of the drug problem in this country the replies always refer to Garda seizures.  The logic behind these replies is that if there are only a few Garda seizures there is no problem, but if there are many Garda seizures then there is a lot of heroin on our streets and there is a big problem.  I must have a twisted attitude because I have a reverse approach to these matters.  My approach is that if there are many Garda seizures then something is being done about the problem and we can be satisfied about this, but if there are very few Garda seizures and there are queues to get into drug treatment centres, then there is a major problem.  We are continually told that there is no problem if the number of Garda seizures is down.  The number of Garda seizures seems to be the only criterion used for assessing the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>This gets away from the fact that it is exceptionally difficult to catch people with heroin on them.  Heroin is available on a widespread basis.  The Garda, through their intelligence work, know exactly who is involved in supplying drugs and the extent of the problem.  However, they can have great difficulty in catching people with a significant amount of heroin on them to make it worthwhile bringing them to court and having them convicted, thus getting heroin off the <Col N="918" /> streets.  I make this point in defence of gardaí working in local units.  I am not criticising these people.  Rather I am criticising the policy pursued in the Department at ministerial level and, presumably, at very senior Garda level also.  I am fed up with the approach that if the number of seizures is down then there is no problem.  Other criteria should be used to determine the level of the problem and we should not attempt to cover up what all Members who have spoken in the debate regard as a major social problem.</P>
    <P>A standard response is given to parliamentary questions on the extent of the heroin problem in this country &mdash; I have tabled most of these questions over the past ten years.  It is a highly questionable if not a laughable basis on which to make an assessment of the level of our drug problem, particularly as the replies appear to indicate that the number of Garda seizures is the sole criterion used to assess the extent of the problem.  The logic is that if the Garda are effective and succeed in taking possession of large quantities of heroin &mdash; according to the reply, apparently this has to be pure heroin &mdash; then there is a serious problem. Deputy Harney and Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the laughable lack of resources available to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>One local drug unit which was attempting to carry out a very serious operation to get heroin off the streets of Dublin could not get the use of a second Garda motor cycle or car to carry out the operation. That is indicative of the resources available to the unfortunate Garda, who show great commitment in trying to deal with the problem at local level.  It is going a step forward to talk about the electronic surveillance equipment they should have, but the joke is that the pushers are far better equipped electronically, mechanically and in every other way than the unfortunate gardaí who are trying to confront the problem in the inner city and other parts of Dublin.  The local Garda drug units were set up with such drudging resentment that by the time the official policy to establish them was put in place <Col N="919" /> the problem had grown way beyond what a small local unit could deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quite a lot to say, but I will not be able to say it all in two minutes.  To the best of my knowledge local drug units &mdash; I tried to tease this out further in parliamentary questions &mdash; are not solely and specifically assigned to drug related crime.  As soon as there is another serious crime in the area I represent, the gardaí assigned to the local drug unit &mdash; probably the most effective gardaí in the area &mdash; are taken off drug related activities and sent to investigate the serious crime, whatever that might be.  Since I referred earlier to a further reply from the Minister, I want to put on record that when I refused to accept what I knew to be a false and misleading reply, I persisted on further questioning and on Tuesday, 23 March, I received the following reply:</P>
      <P>In regard to 1992 I indicated in a reply to parliamentary questions on 17 February last that the preliminary Garda figure for 1992 equated with the 1990 figure and was 20 per cent less than the average annual heroin seizure over the previous ten years.  More up-to-date figures, which are, however, still provisional, have since been supplied to me by the Garda authorities which indicate that the 1992 figure will be somewhat higher than they previously anticipated.  The preliminary figures given to me by the Garda for the purposes of my reply on 17 February did not include a substantial amount of heroin which came into the custody of the Customs Authorities in late November last.  I regret that the Deputy and the House were given inaccurate information on this matter and I will ensure that definitive figures are provided as soon as they are available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if the definitive figures have <Col N="920" /> since become available, but I have not seen them and I am very interested in doing so.  However since I received that reply there have been further and even larger seizures of heroin in the Dublin area.  I welcome the action the Garda are taking which has resulted in those seizures, but too little by way of man-power and resources is allocated to this task.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not present to hear my comments &mdash; I accept that was not her fault &mdash; but perhaps she will consider the criticism I have made at a later stage. I have great respect for the present Minister for Justice.  I believe that if the proper information is made available to her on the extent of the problem and the inadequacy of resources in terms of man-power and equipment available to the local drug units in the front line dealing with the very serious heroin problem in Dublin city, she will take the necessary steps to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Government recognises that we have a very serious drugs problem.  I came into public life approximately two years ago and since that time I have been campaigning to convince people of our very serious drugs problem and particularly about the importation of drugs around our coastline.  The establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit is very welcome and represents the coming together of police and other law enforcement agencies in the EC member states to form a non-operational team to exchange and analyse information about illicit drug trafficking. The major drug seizures off our south coast in recent weeks highlights the need for increased surveillance by and search powers for the Naval Service, in particular, and the Drugs Squad.  As a former member of the Naval Service I have quite a lot of experience of patrolling our coastline.  We need to establish a crack force to tackle the problem.  I know that in the not too distant past special drug units were formed, but I believe this is not working properly.  I suggest that a team comprising of Garda and Customs personnel should come <Col N="921" /> together as a separate body with its own headquarters.  The obvious place to locate the headquarters of such a force is at the naval base at Haulbowline, Cobh, County Cork, as the facilities are in place there for fast craft.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service polices our waters, but we have the ridiculous situation at present where it does not have the power to board or arrest trawlers or private craft off our coastline unless crew are accompanied by a Garda or Customs official.  One of the ships in the fleet is fitted to take a helicopter on board, but to date the ship has not got the helicopter which was promised at the time of her construction ten to 15 years ago.  On a recent visit to Haulbowline I was amazed to see that five of the ships were tied up in the naval dockyard, and only one was at sea to protect our coastline.  I call on the Minister for Defence to recruit staff to the Naval Service immediately so that our ships are fully manned and can be sent to sea at the one time to prevent drugs being smuggled into the country. The Minister for Defence, Justice and Finance should co-operate to ensure that our Naval Service has the power to board ships when it suspects that drugs are being smuggled into the State.</P>
      <P>The role of the Customs and the Garda will have to be defined.  The staff in the Customs service have years of experience of dealing with people coming through our ports and with the importation of goods.  In the UK the Customs service deals with all imports and the police deal with the internal matters of the State relating to drugs and other matters.  The UK Navy have responsibility for patrolling their coastline and I believe the Irish Navy should have total responsibility for goods coming in through our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times we have spent a great deal of time speaking about tax amnesties and repatriating moneys that have been taken out of the country.  Drug barons can take money out of the country.  As we know, £180,000 was taken out of the country in the last number of weeks and nothing can be done about it.  I appeal to the Minister to enact laws to confiscate money that is taken out of the country <Col N="922" /> illegally, because this money can be used to buy drugs in Holland and elsewhere. We should confiscate the money at the time it is leaving the country instead of trying to conficate the smuggled drugs, because those fat pigs are getting fatter at the expense of our youth.  It is a disgrace that drug barons can walk around freely and buy up property in the State. In the not too distant past one of my constituents, who was used by drug barons to carry drugs into the country, died on a flight from England to Ireland, a tragedy that has wrecked the lives of his family.  Their young son died because we in this House were not doing our job properly.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government got its act together, put money into the type of crack squad I have proposed and gave them the facilities they require to prevent drugs coming into the country.  I am informed by some of those involved in the search that resulted in the first big find off the Cork coast that the lack of night surveillance equipment hindered their search completely.  I am told that with proper equipment, they could have captured some of the culprits.  It is time the Government recognised that we must fight this drug problem which is affecting so seriously the youth of Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister to take those remarks on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for concerted action against the growing threat of drug misuse and abuse is widely recognised by the international community.  The nineties have been designated by the United Nations as the decade against drug abuse. Traditionally the developed countries of western Europe, North America and Australasia were the consumers of narcotics produced in the developing countries of Asia and Latin America but these countries are now suffering from very high levels of addiction also.  Reports indicate that 20 per cent of the world's 40 million illicit drug users live in these developing countries.  Obviously drug abuse and misuse leads to increased crime, lower economic productivity and <Col N="923" /> social deprivation.  Corruption leads to rows between rival gangs and this has threatened the political security of some countries and has caused general political unrest.</P>
      <P>The Europol Drugs Unit now being set up is important and is a first step.  If a major godfather of a drug ring were to read the contribution of the Minister for Justice he would undoubtedly give a measure of credit where credit is due in terms of seizures and minor activities, but would treat it as a joke because their operation in getting drugs here and in using this country as a conduit for other countries is a much bigger and very sophisticated operation with a degree of ruthlessness we find difficult to match legally.</P>
      <P>There are five main areas of attack in dealing with this issue.  First, there is the measure itself.  The Europol Drugs Unit will promote international co-operation in order that there might be a reduction in quantities of supplies being brought in here from abroad.  Second, there is the effectiveness of the Customs, police enforcement and controls.  Third, there is the necessity for effective deterrents and tight domestic controls.  Fourth, there is the necessity for education and for publicising prevention.  Last and unfortunately there is the necessity for treatment and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The then Pompidou group in the Council of Europe did much analysis and preparatory work on the kinds of problems countries face as a result of drug abuse. Literally there is available a mountain of material for our drug squad and for the new Europol Drugs Unit when set up. There were several UN conventions in 1961, 1971 and 1972.  Perhaps the most important was the 1988 UN convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which required States to establish criminal offences relating to illicit trafficking in these drugs and that money laundering be outlawed. Legislation was also required to track, to freeze and to confiscate profits resulting from the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Afghanistan in terms of the crop <Col N="924" /> substitution programme the profit from opium is five times that of wheat.  When internal wars and restrictions reduce the economic level of activity of any country, naturally those involved in this area will go for the cash crop.  Under the 1988 UN convention there is an EC requirement that this country should introduce legislation against money laundering.  That is critical in terms of an extension of the drugs unit being set up.  Every major drug baron understands that a proportion of drugs will be lost or intercepted on the way to the consumer but, even allowing for that the profit margins are huge.  What is required is an effective rate of detection of organisers &mdash; the Minister referred to this in her contribution &mdash; for the presentation of hard facts and for clear intelligence.</P>
    <P>It is possible to identify high level drug dealings through financial arrangements. Traffickers will, of course, exploit the confidentiality of banks and will use the modern very sophisticated financial operations to do their dealings.  In Ireland we do not have legislation to deal with money laundering, yet we propose to introduce an amnesty to bring money back into the economy.  Who is to say that some of the money which may come back, if the amnesty is introduced, was not made, in the first instance, through the unfortunate sale to drug users of drugs imported illegally?  It is necessary, therefore, that we have intelligence in a legal sense and also in a tracking sense. If the amnesty is introduced and if drug traffickers have money in bank accounts the full rigours of the law should apply. The traffickers should be nailed to the cross and any such money confiscated should be used for the rehabilitation and treatment of unfortunate drug users. From that point of view it is absolutely necessary that the legislation on money laundering be introduced quickly.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's proposal to set up the Europol Drugs Unit.  Calls have been made for the international headquarters to be sited in Ireland, that may or may not happen.  It is fine to speak about the successes in detecting drug trafficking but in a national sense there are <Col N="925" /> thousands of miles of coastline where trawlers of any description can come in at the dead of night.  For example, in a little bay in Mallinbeg, County Donegal, a number of weeks ago, locals reported to me that a car and two trucks drove there at 4 a.m.  Following headlight signals a boat landed at the pier.  Garda investigations took place but I am not sure what type of illegal activity was taking place.  On the west coast from Killala to the northern tip of Connemara there are numerous bays which cannot be patrolled and where in small boats coming off bigger trawlers, any quantity of drugs can be brought in at night.  While the equipment referred to by the Minister may be valuable and workable it is not state of the art equipment.</P>
    <P>Why have the Garda Síochána and the drug enforcement officers not got night scopes, listening devices and state of the art tracking facilities?  Helicopters have been referred to; these, too, are important. The objective of the Department of Justice, in the context of this European development, in the next half century should be to make this island a drug free haven so that western Europe and every other country would recognise that if you deal in drugs in Ireland you will not get away with it.  The Department of Justice, the Minister and the Government will have the backing of every Member and party in this House in nailing drug suppliers and traffickers and in providing treatment for those unfortunate enough to need rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit is a small but important step in dealing with the drugs problem.  When the drug godfathers in Italy, France, Germany, North and South America and Asia read the Minister's speech they will conclude there is still no problem in using Ireland as a conduit to other countries. We must use the authority of this House to emphasise the case being made by the Minister, and her Department, to our European counterparts that we need financial assistance to provide a proper coast watch system and that if, unfortunately, drugs are imported illegally the matter can be dealt with by the Customs <Col N="926" /> authorities and the Garda.  The rigours of the law should apply and be seen to apply to any drug traffickers.  I wish the Minister, and her Department, well in their endeavours in this regard and I hope the Minister, and the Minister of State, are serious in their intent regarding this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that the abuse of drugs has destroyed many lives, broken up families and wreaked havoc here and throughout the world. Drug trafficking is big business and we must recognise that people are in it for profit.  Drug pushers have significant resources but very few scruples and will go to any lengths to achieve their end, namely, to make as much profit as possible. The importation of drugs to this country hit the headlines in the past few weeks because of the seizures along the west Cork coastline.  I congratulate the gardaí involved in those successful seizures.</P>
      <P>There has been a number of illegal drug imports through the inner harbour in Cork covering areas such as East Ferry, Aghada and Whitegate.  The Garda made a number of requests for an inflatable dinghy or a suitable craft to carry out searches around the inner harbour area, but such a facility has not yet been authorised.  Will the Minister reconsider that request because it is important that that facility is provided? The manning of lighthouses in the past provided a watchful eye on all traffic around our coastline but that source of information is no longer available. Therefore, a national coast watch service is required and the Minister should examine that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remit of the Navy should be extended.  Much of its time is taken up with protecting our fishing waters but it could play a greater role in the control of smuggling and so on around our coastline. The legislation which requires that a garda accompany Naval personnel when boarding another vessel should be reexamined. I appreciate the provision of such services would require more funding but as the drug problem is an international <Col N="927" /> one and drugs are smuggled here <i>en route</i> to Great Britain and other European countries, the EC should be asked to fund our increased protection costs.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners should examine the excessive prices which are being paid for land and businesses here. It was reported recently that the economy of a region in northern Spain was adversely affected by money laundering. The Revenue Commissioners should home in on excessive expenditure in this regard.  I welcome this motion.  It represents a step in the right direction for our country, our children and grandchildren. I am glad it has the agreement of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to sign this agreement as there is a serious worldwide drug problem.  The dismantling of EC borders created further difficulties and I agree with Deputy Enda Kenny in regard to the potential for major drug barons to use Ireland as a warehouse for drugs.  Deputy Kenny referred to the tax amnesty.  I voiced publicly my concern that the drug barons around the world might exploit the amnesty.  The Minister for Finance must put definite safeguards in place in the forthcoming legislation on the proposed tax amnesty.  If such safeguards are not put in place the drug barons will have no problem exploiting that amnesty.  Those people are anxious to launder their money because they are dealing in big sums.  Illegal drug exporting is big business in South America and elsewhere. Large sums of money are being made from drug trafficking in many parts of the world and such money must be laundered by those people.  Therefore, we must be extremely vigilant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs hauls in Cork and Rosslare demonstrate that we are exposed to the possibility of large drug barons smuggling their drugs into Ireland <i>en route</i> to the European scene.  I welcome the Minister's proposal to introduce stringent legislation in the autumn to confiscate the property of those suspected of drug dealing and who cannot prove the source <Col N="928" /> of their income.  It is important that resources are made available to us but, more importantly, because drug trafficking is a huge business, the countries of Europe, and not just those in the European Community, should combine in a more cohesive manner than that proposed in this agreement in an effort to have the best, most sophisticated state of the art technology and expertise available to take on the wealthy, ruthless and immoral operators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides for a most stimulating debate.  I assure Deputies that I have noted carefully the many excellent suggestions they made and they will be taken on board as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>Deputies Liam Fitzgerald and Enda Kenny referred to the exploitation of the proposed tax amnesty by people laundering the proceeds of crime.  I thank Deputy Fitzgerald, and others, for bringing this to our attention publicly.  That is a pitfall in introducing a tax amnesty. Nevertheless, I assure the House that the detailed legislation dealing with the tax amnesty will be designed specifically to deal with that matter.  In addition, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to deal with money laundering and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime before the end of this year.  I assure Deputies that anyone seeking to use the tax amnesty as a means of laundering the proceeds of crime will have plenty to worry about.  I hope people try to do that because I would love to see them getting caught and convicted which is what will happen if the tax amnesty is used in that way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe requested better co-ordination between the Garda national drug administration office and the Garda Síochána.  That matter is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to coast watch, extra facilities for the Navy and the use of helicopters, Deputies will be aware that the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Defence Forces can be used as an aid to the civil power.  At present the Minister <Col N="929" /> for Justice is having discussions with the Minister for Finance to see how we can make more use of the Air Corps and the Navy.  I expect that a decision will be made on that very soon and we will then be speaking to the Minister for Defence with a view to making the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also wanted to know if the £4 million scam in Cork city, which I understand relates to the activities of an unofficial insurance broker, is linked to the drug trade.  It is the subject of a criminal investigation.  If part of the money was used to purchase or deal in drugs, I have no doubt that the Garda Síochána will uncover that in their investigation. Since the rate of interest being given was 110 per cent, I would not be at all surprised if it was linked to drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Keeffe, Harney and Gay Mitchell mentioned the possibility of giving the Customs authorities more powers.  This matter was raised at the National Drug Co-ordination Committee, of which I was chairman.  The people in the Customs authority want powers, similar to those the Garda have under the Criminal Justice Act of 1984, to detain and question suspects and to draw inferences from the non-communication of information that suspects are requested to give.  We have been in discussion with the Office of the Attorney General about that and we are extremely worried about the constitutionality of such a proposal.  During the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, the question of the constitutionality of giving those powers even to the Garda was raised.  We were satisfied at the time and we are still satisfied that it is not unconstitutional to give those powers to the Garda.  However, our advice is that we could face serious constitutional problems in trying to extend those powers to Customs officials.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that there is a need for a clearer demarcation and more co-ordination between the National Drugs Squad and the Customs authorities, because their functions are basically different.  The function of the Customs officers is to <Col N="930" /> prevent the landing of materials and the function of the Garda Síochána is to apprehend and prosecute to conviction the people who are trying to import drugs into the country illegally.  We are alive to the need for more co-ordination and clear demarcation and are working on it.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have raised the possibility that Ireland could be used as a route for international drug trafficking. That is a very real danger, because EC borders have been removed since 1 January. The source of many illicit drugs on distribution throughout the world is Asia, South America, particularly Colombia, and, to an increasing extent, the United States.  There is the possibility that Ireland, as an island country on the western borders of Europe and with a large coastline, could be used in trafficking drugs.  Some Deputies are of the view that this is happening already.  The Minister for Justice does not fully subscribe to that view.  All we in the Department of Justice can do is consult the Customs authorities and the Garda authorities to see if this is happening.  Before they could reply to us our Garda and Customs authorities had to speak to their counterparts in other EC countries.  They have done this and have come back to us with a detailed report.  The conclusion is that we have not arrived at that situation yet in this country and it is our intention as a Government to ensure that we do not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe made the point that the headquarters of the Europol Drugs Unit should be in Dublin and that we should be looking for this at the Copenhagen Summit on 21-22 June.  Deputy O'Keeffe said that as we do not have a major EC agency located here we should be at the head of the queue for this.  That is a fair point.  However, we will not be pressing very hard for this because it would be of far greater economic benefit to the country to have the proposed European Medicines Agency located in Dublin. That will be our priority.  We may have to fall back on something else if we do not get that.  There is severe competition from Barcelona and other potential locations.  Substantial economic benefits <Col N="931" /> would flow to the country with the location of that agency rather than the Europol agency and that is what we will be fighting for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell and others said that the £4,000 towards the cost of the Europol Drugs Unit was a paltry sum. Let me explain.  The salary of the liaison officer that we will be sending to Europe is not included in that £4,000.  It is part of the cost of providing the Europol agency with desks, equipment, personal computers, telecommunications equipment etc., which we understand will be about £300,000.  Our proportion of the cost is about £4,000.  Deputy Harney wanted to know if the liaison officer will be in Europe fulltime or will be commuting back and forth.  Initially the liaison officer will not be there fulltime, but it is envisaged that in the not too distant future the liaison officer will be working fulltime in Europe.  Deputy Harney also wanted to know what rank in the Garda Síochána the liaison officer would be.  That is not agreed, but discussions are taking place with the Commissioners.  I understand it will be an officer of fairly senior rank and that it will depend to a certain extent on the rank of liaison officers in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Enda Kenny raised the question of the sort of equipment available to the Garda and to the Customs authorities.  We have been in touch with the Garda about that and all the drug squads throughout the country that we have contacted, including the Cork Drug Squad referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe, tell us that they are satisfied with the equipment they have at the moment.  If they want more up-to-date equipment they will inform us of that. We will keep in touch with them and respond quickly and generously to any request they may make.  I am not speaking just about personnel but resources and equipment, particularly technical equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney had a number of technical questions.  First, she wanted to know when we are going to introduce the legislation to allow us to seize the assets <Col N="932" /> of those involved in crime.  That will be in place this year.  Deputy Kenny suggested that such funds should be used to fund drug treatment centres and Deputy Harney suggested they should be used to fund compensation for the victims of crime.  She mentioned specifically the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. I agree with both suggestions.  I have suggested myself that part of the proceeds relating to drug trafficking should be used to fund drug treatment centres.  I understand that that happens in certain states in the United States and it is a good precedent to follow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney wanted to know under what heading the £13 million was requested from Europe.  It was not under any specific heading.  I understand that the European Community provides funds to protect our external borders.  It was for that purpose that we made the request for the £13 million.  The request was first made two years ago.  So far it has not been acceded to, but it has acquired a new urgency now and we are going to press very hard for it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the request for more aerial surveillance.  Deputy Harney wanted to know if there would be a link up between the various maritime organisations and Europol.  I would say that ultimately there will be.  We are setting this up, hopefully, on 21 June and it will develop from there.  Deputy Harney also wanted to know what our position was in relation to a European police enforcement squad that could cross borders.  This was advocated for some time by the Germans, because Chancellor Kohl sees Europol as something akin to the FBI that can cross borders to deal with particular types of crime.  There is resistance to that from various member states.  Indeed, we are not exactly in favour of it ourselves because we have particular problems in relation to the Border, and the question of hot pursuit, is a very sensitive topic. Naturally, we have some difficulties with the principle of non-Irish police forces having powers to cross over here and pursue criminals.  It was agreed in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty to include a statement in the declaration <Col N="933" /> that there would be a meeting no later than 1994 to increase co-operation, but there is no question at the moment of an international drugs enforcement agency along the lines the Deputies have suggested.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to deal with all the points made.  Again, I want to thank Deputies for their contributions.  The setting up of the Europol Drugs Unit is only the first step in international co-operation to combat the scourge of drug trafficking. In specific reply to Deputy Harney, it will deal not just with drugs but with other areas.  It will extend to international terrorism and various types of racketeering, and at the end of the day the sky is the limit.</P>

    <P>In a meeting with the Tánaiste and myself, the Prime Minister outlined his intentions, at this stage, on the conduct of that meeting and I set out the views of the Government as to the priority items for discussion.  Prime Minister Rasmussen and I were fully in agreement on the need to give priority at the Copenhagen <Col N="934" /> meeting to Community action to stimulate economic growth and to promote job creation.

At the Edinburgh Summit, the Finance Ministers met, and produced a growth initiative which has been put into operation. I would be the first to admit it is only a contribution towards addressing the major problem that exists.

      <P>We had a general discussion with the Danish Prime Minister in relation to matters that could contribute to growth in the Community.  We are all aware of the recession that has hit many member states, including Germany. We are also aware of the need to reduce interest rates as low as possible to encourage investment from which jobs will flow.  We are conscious of the need for a world initiative to be taken bringing together the United States, Japan and Europe.  The Danish Prime Minister exchanged views with me in regard to discussions he had in the United States similar to those I had in March.  We are all aware of what is needed to increase consumer demand and create more jobs. We are also aware of the need for a GATT agreement to release world trade. They are the items we discussed.

I wish to bring to his attention a number of points.  In relation to the concept of head of household, it is time we dealt with terminology which reflects the way people live and not out-dated concepts.  Would the Minister accept that the emphasis in the census form is on the car owner, the person who is at work or at school?  It pays scant regard to the person who is unemployed despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of people unemployed at present.  For example, there is no question relating to how people travel to the dole office.  Questions are asked about how people travel to work but it is important to ask people how difficult or otherwise it is to get to the dole office.</P>
      <P>There are no questions about how women carry on their daily lives, whether they are at home, how long it takes them to get to the supermarket or how far they are from their doctor.  Those are simple questions that relate directly to the way people live.  Does the Minister not feel that the census provides an opportunity to ascertain the complexity of modern life rather than concentrating on the traditional, the man at work?</P>
      <P>Finally, while we are asking people whether they speak the Irish language there is an opportunity to assess how many people here speak a European language, apart from Irish or English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The question concerning the head of household is simply to ensure that somebody takes responsibility for filling out the form.  I accept there may be other ways of referring to that person. An alternative formulation used by the labour force survey is &ldquo;reference person&rdquo;.  This suggestion could be examined in relation to the next census which is due to be carried out in 1996.</P>
      <P>With regard to car owners, workers and the position of women, it would be more appropriate if those questions were handled in a detailed way such as that carried out by the labour force survey.  It would be difficult to cover every possible question raised by the Deputy in relation to the census form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> In regard to the unemployed, Question No. 19 relates to a person's status, whether one is at work, seeking regular work or unemployed.  It is difficult to include all of that detail in this survey. Part of the process of carrying out these surveys is to compare them with previous surveys to determine what changes are taking place.</P>
    <P>In regard to European languages, I would be happy to pass on that and any other suggestions the Deputy may have to the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise there are detailed questions already on the census form concerning people at work or at school?  That emphasis implies that certain people matter sufficiently to have their lifestyle queried and assessed while others do not.  If we really want to know about Irish life through the census &mdash; which is not a survey &mdash; we must treat people equally and understand the way they are living now.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; is not intended to denigrate other members of a household.  It is a term of convenience.  It is difficult to answer all of the Deputy's concerns.  I understand totally many of those concerns in relation to the head of household.  The use of those terms could be examined and I will pass on the Deputy's views to the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he is being somewhat disingenuous to refer to the term &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; as simply a term of convenience? Would he agree it implies a particular status of one person in that house as being superior to the other whether that be male or female and, therefore, is inappropriate for use in official documents?  In relation to the Minister's argument that too many questions on the census form make it over complicated, would he not consider dealing with some aspects of what is being proposed in a census for information other than on a five yearly basis? In other words, particular aspects could be selected on a year to year basis and a census carried out on those issues.</P>

      <P>The information obtained is of tremendous value.  The head of household can be any member of a private household present on the census night who would take responsibility for filling up the form.  I accept the Deputy's point in relation to the possibility of using other terminology.  As I have said, the term &ldquo;reference person&rdquo; is used in the labour force survey.  I will certainly take the Deputy's view on board.</P>

      <P>The question relating to a survey versus a census is an important one.  Virtually everybody agrees that the labour force survey is inadequate because it is simply a random survey whereas a census seeks information about every single adult in the State.  Most people dealing with labour force matters are urging that a census of the labour force be carried out on a regular basis rather than merely having this survey.  If a change is to take place it should be on that basis.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to take suggestions on board in relation to the preparation of the next survey to be carried out in 1996.  As I said, one of the problems is comparability with the last survey and in changing some of the terminology we may not have the correct mechanism to compare the existing census with the previous one.  However, the Government is open to any suggestion regarding the compilation of the next census.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5, and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare amnesty which I announced recently is designed to add impetus to the ongoing successful drive by my Department against fraud and <Col N="942" /> abuse of the system.  It offers people who may be defrauding the social welfare system a final opportunity to come clean and pay up what is due to the taxpaying public.</P>
    <P>This amnesty will apply to employers, people claiming social welfare payments and self-employed people.  It will apply in cases where the person or organisation informs my Department of their failure to pay PRSI due.  It will also apply to people who admit receiving social welfare payments to which they were not entitled, or that they received or are receiving payment at a rate higher than that to which they were or are entitled.</P>
    <P>People who disclose this information and who make arrangements to regularise their position will not face criminal prosecution.  No interest will be charged on PRSI arrears which employers report and for which they agree appropriate payment arrangements.  Special arrangements will be made for claimants to repay by instalment any money dishonestly obtained.  In cases of genuine hardship my Department will take a sympathetic approach to people.</P>
    <P>Anyone who applies for this amnesty but subsequently defaults on agreed repayment arrangements will no longer qualify for the benefits of this amnesty and their liabilities will be pursued in the normal way.  Similarly, employers who do not continue to operate the full PRSI system will be prosecuted for offences. Decisions in relation to prosecutions, recovery of payments claimed illegally and recovery from employers of sums received fraudulently by employees, are administrative.  There is no need for additional legislation for these matters.</P>
    <P>I took enabling powers by way of regulations in the 1988 Act to waive interest payments in respect of PRSI arrears.  I will shortly be making the necessary regulations for the purpose of this amnesty. The current amnesty is already in operation and will continue until the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>The 1991 amnesty to which Deputy De Rossa refers operated in the context of special control of abuse measures which were initiated by me during that year.  It <Col N="943" /> is not possible to provide details of returns to the Exchequer arising from the 1991 amnesty.  The Deputy is aware that the collection of PRSI arrears is primarily a matter for the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Payments of PRSI arrears made directly to the Revenue Commissioners as a result of the amnesty provision cannot be identified separately from other PRSI receipts.</P>
    <P>The major effect of the amnesty was a more compliant response by employers when the Department's investigators called.  In 1991 the investigators visited five times the usual number of employers and they encountered much less resistance and evasion than had previously been the case.</P>
    <P>Based on experience in previous years, the number of cases failing to co-operate would have been about 200 in 1991 if the amnesty had not been in operation. Preparing cases for prosecution is time-consuming. Accordingly a significant benefit of the amnesty is that the investigators were freed from having to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions in more than 200 cases.  This allowed them carry out a higher level of visits.  As a result employers generally became more aware of the need for compliance.</P>
    <P>An important outcome of the 1991 operations is that employers who were not operating the complete system have been identified, warned of the consequences and are now being scheduled for revisits to ensure that the co-operation promised has continued.  In addition some 522 people claiming social welfare payments regularised their position with my Department.  The 1991 amnesty was part of a package of control measures introduced by me.  As a result of these measures and the amnesty which I am now introducing some £200 million in social welfare savings will have accrued to the Exchequer by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the measures which we have undertaken to improve compliance and ease the burden on the general taxpayer can best be seen in the increase in PRSI collected from the estimate of £991 million in 1988 to £1,486 <Col N="944" /> million in 1992.  The penalties for fraud have been progressively increased by me since 1990 and the procedures for taking legal action and prosecuting those who are caught have been successfully streamlined, codified and strengthened.  Those caught face tough penalties of fines up to £10,000 and up to three years in jail. Employers not operating PRSI are also liable to repay benefit fraudulently received by their employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since social welfare fraud is a criminal offence, how can the Minister take it upon himself to pardon criminals? Would the Minister agree that the proposed amnesty is a second amnesty for a number of people but is a kick in the teeth for the PAYE sector and self-employed who make their commitments to the State in a responsible way?  Would he agree that the £200 million mentioned in his reply shows serious incompetence in his Department in collecting money due to the State?  As the Minister has been in that Department for many years surely this is a matter on which he should resign. Would the Minister agree that the perception among responsible business people &mdash; I know of a 70-year-old woman who is being challenged this week by the sheriff to give up her personal belongings &mdash; is that the white collar criminal and brigand receives total absolution because they have the ear of people in high places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In 1987, the taxpayer had to contribute 31 per cent of the social insurance fund whereas this year the taxpayer has to pay only 11.6 per cent.

      <P>I thank the Minister for issuing this fact sheet which provides most of the information I require.  The proposed social welfare amnesty is politically and morally acceptable to the public because it is compassionate towards those who find themselves in difficulty in terms of the social welfare code and is an opportunity for them to regularise their affairs.  Any effort to tackle <Col N="946" /> fraud is to be welcomed and I welcome some aspects of this measure which is saved from political disaster by the fact that arrears have to be paid and people are not being let off scot-free.  They are absolved from liability in terms of prosecution but not from liability to pay the moneys which were fraudulently or incorrectly drawn from the State.  That is what makes this amnesty more acceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that to portray a reduction in the expenditure by way of general taxation on social welfare from 30 per cent to 10 per cent as an efficiency flies in the face of reality which is that the support of the social welfare system from general taxation has declined to a point where the commitment from taxation is now a disgrace? Does the Minister agree that it would have been better to maintain the contribution from taxation and thereby increase the benefits that would be available to those who are unemployed or sick?  Can the Minister tell us where he got the figure quoted in a newspaper on 7 June 1993 that this amnesty could bring in up to £200 million, particularly in view of the fact that the Comptroller and <Col N="947" /> Auditor General in his last report in November pointed out that social welfare fraud could be estimated at no more than £6.8 million?  I put it to the Minister also that the last amnesty brought in only 17 employers who admitted to defrauding PRSI.

      <P>I am not treating them all as fraud.  I have been very careful to say that we are talking about fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming.  Fraud is something which is proved in court.  If we were to bring every person who makes an unwarranted claim or abuses the system to court it would amount to huge numbers of people.  We do not do that. We get the money back for the taxpayer. We collect money from employers, as do the Revenue Commissioners, for the taxpayer.  That is the kind of money we <Col N="949" /> are talking about.  It is very expensive to take a case to court in the first instance and it is mainly done to demonstrate that if people do not comply they can be brought to court.  Compliance and collection is what it is all about.  Earlier I mentioned the increase in collection. There are a couple of specific elements in that but beyond that there is a very substantial increase in the total collection of PRSI.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That can only be accounted for by a greater contribution and by compliance.  It is difficult to measure it exactly.  I can discuss that at some other time with the Deputy if he wishes.  I gave the Deputy the figure for the start and the end and I can give figures for what came in the meantime but that has nothing to do with reductions in any benefit.</P>
      <P>I have explained that fraud is a specific item.  The Comptroller and Auditor General talks about fraud and consequently everybody is confused because that is the description in his field of work.  I am talking about something else.  As Minister for Social Welfare I am in the management business managing money.  I am not in legal business and I do not want to be.  We would have perhaps 350 cases going to court.  We have only 500 staff in the country.  If they were tied up in court cases it could be of no great benefit to us in our general collection which would fall behind.  That is why I emphasised in my reply that we are carrying out a substantial programme currently.  I tried to make it as clear as possible.  We are currently visiting 10,000 employers and we need the staff to do that.  We are getting compliance and we are giving a boost to that compliance with the amnesty. Recently a person who received dole on a forged document was sentenced to two years.  Many prison sentences have been handed down.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not address the point I raised in regard to the reduction in the contribution from general taxation towards the social welfare system.  I would appreciate if he would address that.  What proportion of the increased income from PRSI is accounted for by the fact that since 1988 the self employed have come into the PRSI system?  Will the Minister agree that a significant proportion of what he is claiming came in as a result of the tax amnesty came in as a result of the self employed being brought into the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nearly £400 million extra, not accounted for by increases or anything else.  I want the House to be clear about one thing: when we talk about the reduction from general taxation we are talking about a percentage.  The numbers on social welfare increased very substantially in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we have 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The money expended now amounts to £3.7 billion, which has risen enormously.  I take the Deputy's point about the numbers having increased, but we are spending the money.  The percentage position has changed; that is, of course, as far as the fund is concerned. It consolidates the position of the fund, which is what we have done.  It had been my objective to render the fund as solid as possible.  However, as the Deputy knows, there are others with different views about that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 11, 25, 38, 60 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The response to the scheme has been very positive.  Almost 2,000 students had registered by the original closing date of 4 June, which I have now extended to 25 June.  This will allow students who are committed to examinations sufficient time to register.  Interest in the scheme has continued to grow and applications from students now total some 3,216, with over 1,450 sponsors offering in excess of 6,600 jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy to wait and we would have the results for him. The jobs are being offered mainly by voluntary, community and sporting organisations.  Application forms and fact sheets are available from all local offices throughout the country and are also available on request from PO Box No. 3840.</P>
      <P>A list of the participating sponsors is being drawn up for all counties and will be supplied to all eligible student applicants. My Department will be happy to supply Deputies with lists of sponsors on request as soon as they are completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will approve applications from students and from sponsors and reimburse sponsors in respect of payments to students.  It is the responsibility of each student applicant to seek employment with an approved sponsor. Arrangements for payments to students <Col N="954" /> are a matter for sponsors.  Employment under the scheme will be insurable at PRSI class J1, which gives cover for occupational injury benefits.  This cost will be borne by my Department; any other insurance is a matter for sponsors.</P>
    <P>Students living at home who cannot get work under the summer jobs scheme and whose family is dependent on a social welfare payment(s) can avail of special arrangements which allow payment for up to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that about 12,000 students claimed unemployment assistance last year.  I am confident that the arrangements put in place this year under the summer jobs scheme will be of substantial benefit to third-level students who otherwise would not have been entitled to any payment.  I see this scheme as a very positive development, of benefit to students and the community generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister mentioned 3,000 students having applied, he failed to list the organisations that have indicated willingness to participate in the summer work scheme.  Since the numbers with which the Minister has now furnished us are more like Lotto numbers and since most of the 12,000 students have as much chance of obtaining a job as winning the national lottery, would the Minister say whether students who cannot obtain work within their immediate vicinity, who are forced to travel to obain work under the scheme but who must live near their places of work, will be allowed supplementary welfare allowance under the provisions of the scheme? If not, I would deem that to be a serious defect in the scheme.  Since there will be at least 9,000 students who received assistance last year but who will not receive such assistance this year, will the Minister now admit that the scheme is a massive cock-up and is an enormous burden on the PAYE sector and families experiencing difficulty in putting their children through third level education?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 17, 23, 31, 34, 35 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The review in question is being carried out by officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  The review will involve an assessment of the extent to which existing PRSI arrangements may have an adverse effect on industry, either generally or in specific sectors.  In the light of this review the Government will consider whether specific action needs to be taken in this area.  Any such action would have to be taken within the framework of the Government's commitment to the social insurance system and bearing in mind that other sources for financing social insurance are not readily available.  The review will examine the scope for alternative methods of financing this, and their likely effects on industry and employment.</P>
      <P>I expect the review to be completed before the end of this year, in time for its recommendations to be considered in the context of the 1994 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to the House the time limit within which this review is to be concluded?  Is he aware that as a result of the recent VAT increase on the clothing and footwear industry some companies have already closed?  Furthermore, is he aware that the Minister for Finance at budget time indicated that he would look sympathetically at the clothing and footwear industry in regard to the PRSI concession to be given to employers?  Would he comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister for Finance has had a number of meetings with representative groups in the clothing and footwear sector in relation to the impact on firms in that sector of the application of the standard rate of VAT.  This proposal was just one of the issues that arose <Col N="960" /> from those discussions.  Other issues are at present being examined in addition to other possible measures which might be taken.  Generally it is one proposal on which we are not particularly keen because there was not much evidence of improvement in the uptake of jobs when we did so previously.  For instance, there is a free PRSI scheme in operation for employers.  When a similar scheme was operated previously it had little impact in terms of employment.  However, it could have an impact on this industry.  That question is being examined so that it can be taken into consideration in the medium-term.  In the meantime, the Minister for Finance is considering a number of other measures which could have a more immediate impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, those involved in the clothing and footwear industries were bitterly disappointed when changes were made in the rates of VAT.  In discussions which the Minister for Finance later had with IBEC he stated that he would consider granting a concession to this industry.  I asked the Minister earlier to indicate when the review is likely to be completed.</P>

      <P>As I said in my initial reply, I expect the review to be completed before the end of the year in time for the recommendations to be considered in the context of the 1994 budget.  The matter can be approached in different ways. Hence there is a need for a comprehensive review.  The Minister for Finance is considering other measures which may have a more immediate impact in this area.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it would be much better to introduce a minimum wage in low pay industries rather than exempt employers from their obligations under the PRSI system?  Will he indicate whether the student workfare scheme, whereby students will not be covered by the Department of Social Welfare and will be obliged to sign a form which makes it clear that they recognise that they will <Col N="961" /> not have any protection when they take up these so-called jobs that the Minister is providing, will be considered as part of the review?</P>

Otherwise there would be a conflict in terms of the payments we make and low wages.  This is one of the reasons the family income supplement was introduced.

      <P>I am glad to hear that a review is under way but for many small businesses which find themselves in difficulty to wait until the end of the year is a long time.  Can the Minister say if, as part of the review, the procedural difficulties which small firms face in employment creation will be considered? I understand that many small firms feel they are hounded rather than helped by the State when they try to create jobs.  It is in everybody's interest that jobs are created.  However, many small firms encounter administrative difficulties in regard to the PRSI system in job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I first became Minister for Social Welfare I have been constantly seeking ways of improving the quality of service to our customers.  I set up a regional management structure in 1991 with the objective of giving a more localised service.  In many instances customers can have their inquiries dealt with and their claims processed immediately without the need for inspectors to call to their homes.  Although much progress has been made in this area there are still many people who live in remote areas or due to other reasons who find it difficult to make their way to the local social welfare office.  In such cases it is necessary to have social welfare inspectors call to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspectors of my Department are trained to be courteous and helpful. When a home visit is necessary it is the usual practice to notify applicants of the intended visit.  However, sometimes it is more efficient, in terms of customer <Col N="964" /> service, to make a visit where it was not practicable to issue a prior notification.</P>
    <P>Instances can arise where an inspector is visiting a locality and receives claims from that area too late for prior notification of the customers concerned. Inspectors cannot predict the time required for each interview which means that it may not always be possible to notify customers who might be visited in the late afternoon.  I would be most reluctant to introduce changes which reduced the flexibility which currently means that the inspector is not forced into rushing one interview so that a notified visit can be fitted in.</P>
    <P>There are other instances where discretion must be left to local inspectors as to how they will deal with any particular case from the point of view of control or abuse.  This does not mean that any customer who does not receive a notification of intended visit, is suspected of abusing the system.  From what I have said earlier, it is clear that there are several reasons of a service nature for not sending prior notifications of intended visits.</P>
    <P>Leaflets on my Department's schemes are available in all public offices and are issued free on request.  Trained information officers are available to explain matters fully to callers to the local offices. This is especially important in the case of any person making a claim for the first time and who may not be familiar with procedures.  My Department also publishes a comprehensive booklet called &ldquo;A Guide to the Social Welfare Services&rdquo; which is updated regularly and may be issued to anyone on request.</P>
    <P>Any person who makes a claim under any of the schemes administered by my Department receives a decision with the least possible delay along with information regarding his or her right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.  I am at present examining ways of giving more comprehensive information to our customers in relation to these decisions.  This will enable them to have as full an understanding as possible of their entitlements and of the decision given in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a lengthy reply but it is hardly relevant. Does he realise that in the majority of cases when an applicant in a rural area is visited by a social welfare officer he or she is presented with a questionnaire containing at least 22 questions relating to individual items of expenditure in the previous year on their small farm?  An elderly person who applies for old age pension may not recall accurately all the facts which are germane to their interest in these investigations.  Would the Minister agree that leaflets should be sent out to all applicants, particularly old age pensioners, informing them that the details of all expenditure on, say, their farms or small shops will be demanded by the social welfare officer when he calls and that they will need to have all these details accurately assembled in order to protect their interests?</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a rent supplement <Col N="966" /> may be paid to those whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.

In order to establish that a valid accommodation need exists health boards may request evidence from the applicant's parents as to the availability of accommodation in the family home before payment of a rent supplement to a young person.  A health board will consider a supplement where in all the circumstances it would be unreasonable to expect the applicant to live at home.</P>
      <P>I am having the guidelines for rent and mortgage supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme reviewed at present in consultation with health boards and I expect to have the results of their review shortly.</P>

To expand on the Deputy's point, not only are students looking for places on the summer job scheme in between years &mdash; the time it applies to them &mdash; but they are also looking for places on it when they have finished college. They should not be doing this as they are entitled to unemployment assistance. This raises an interesting point. Some students may prefer to obtain a place on the summer job scheme after they finish college while they work out what they will do, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Maternity benefit is payable to women in employment for a period of 14 weeks, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions. The rate of payment is 70 per cent of the claimant's reckonable earnings in the relevant tax year, up to a ceiling of £154 per week.  A minimum payment of £60 per week is provided in cases where a claimant has no earnings in the relevant tax year or where her earnings are very low.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget I increased both the minimum and the maximum weekly maternity benefit payments.  From next month the minimum payment will increase to £65 and the maximum payment will increase to £159.  As a result the earnings ceiling for maternity benefit will increase from £11,000 to £11,380.</P>
      <P>The maternity benefit scheme is currently under review in the light of the EC Directive on the Protection of Pregnant Workers.  The earnings ceiling is one of the issues being examined in that context. Further increases in the ceiling would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank God for the European Community.  If it were not for the European Community we would probably still not have maternity leave.  I think the Minister agrees that a ceiling of £159 is inadequate in view of the changing status and salaries of some women who thankfully have made it to the higher levels in the workforce.  This ceiling is not fair, given that many of these women have to pay mortgages, car loans etc.  I am glad this matter is being looked at. There is an anomaly under the present system because if a second period of maternity leave is taken within two years, the amount paid in maternity benefit is not included in the assessment of total earnings.  In view of the fact that we have introduced taxation on disability benefit, should benefits not be allowable when <Col N="971" /> assessing income?  Does the Minister understand the point I am making?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I extended maternity benefit to part-time workers.  Some 27,000 women will now become eligible for maternity benefit at the minimum level.  The question arises as to whether unemployment benefit is combined with maternity benefit, which is very similar to the question raised by Deputy O'Donnell, and this has to be considered in the context of the interaction of the two payments. This shows how substantial the impact of those relationships can be.  I will take note of what the Deputies have said and I will ensure that their points will be considered in the review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 22, 37, 39 and 48 together.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to examine intensively the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems, in consultation with the social partners and the National Economic and Social Forum.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare has been given special responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>He intends to establish an expert working group to carry out this examination. A considerable amount of preparatory work has been done in this regard and the Minister of State intends to announce the composition and terms of reference of the working group later this month.  It is intended that the group will produce an interim report later this year with a view to possible changes in the context of the 1994 budget.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate what he regards as the most important benefit that will derive from the integration of the tax and social welfare systems?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation recommended that the two systems be integrated and simplified as far as possible.  In integrating the two systems, income and welfare payments will be considered as income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the issues that have been touched on today come into play.  The commission considered the question of child benefit and how it can be targeted effectively but, if I recall correctly, they did not reach a conclusion on that.  The poverty traps which are inevitably created by going some distance and then stopping apply to social welfare as well as to taxation and even though a tapering off is provided at the point at which it stops there are difficulties.  A wide range <Col N="974" /> of issues have to be tackled by the expert working group and I am interested in what their findings will be.  We may find that it will be very difficult to bring all the aspects together and make a theoretical model that will meet all situations without creating other kinds of hardship.  That is the purpose of the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We look forward to the establishment of that group who will produce an interim report this year.  Does the Minister envisage that the Revenue Commissioners will merge with the Department of Social Welfare to ease the existing complicated arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Increasingly we work with the Revenue Commissioners and there is an exchange of information on areas that affect both Departments.  However, I do not envisage a situation where the two Departments would come together.  The Deputy mentioned the complex nature of social welfare but as long as you put people first the system will be complex. If the system is put first, it is easy to simplify it.  While we are trying to simplify the system in a number of ways we put people first and we have to deal with the complexities of people's lives, starting from an early age right up to their old age, whether they are at work or out of work, lone parents or people with disabilities. You cannot apply the same system to everybody.  A classic example is that the elderly, almost by definition, need more heatand consequently their requirements are different.  Over the years Members have tried to respond to that and consequently this has created more complexities.  I make no particular apologies for the complexity of the system.  Everywhere I visit, I find that social welfare systems are complex, even though they do things differently from the way we do in many cases.  This comes from trying to meet the needs of people and by being what I like to call &ldquo;customer oriented&rdquo;, which is putting the people first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the system is complex.  Does the Minister <Col N="975" /> agree that the only long term way to solve the poverty trap and to remove the disincentives to many of those on social welfare to take up employment &mdash; in particular a married man with two or more children &mdash; is to integrate both systems? Because of the way in which the system operates, if you are employed and seeking a medical card gross income is taken into account, whereas if you are on social welfare net income is taken into account.  There is no incentive to take up a job because the differential between being working and not working is so small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly look closely at anything that emerged from the point of view of the people I represent. While the exact proposals for integration differ from country to country, there is a number of common arguments put forward in favour of integration.  For example, taxation and social security are seen as two sides of the same coin rather than as two separate entities for policy and administration.  Those are the views put forward by the technical people who examine the differences from country to country.  Conventional social security systems are seen as unable to cope with the overlaps between the tax and benefit systems &mdash; the incentive problems and the poverty traps.  On the tax side, taxes need to have incentives, we want to have something else, therefore, there are overlaps from that point of view.</P>
      <P>Social security systems have become extremely complex for the administrator and claimant alike with consequential problems of high administration costs and low take up of entitlements.  The reason we have administrators is to deal with complex situations.  We have to simplify them and go as far as we can in that regard.  I would enter the caveat that at the end of the day the person being served is the one who counts, not the system, the computers or the administrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, insurance based social security systems are not seen as being efficiently targeted as income support to households <Col N="976" /> and not closely related to income needs. I do not agree with that because I happen to be a believer in the social insurance system for peoples' sake.  I believe in an insurance system whereby a person makes a contribution and has something as a right at the end of the day and the tax system will even it out as at present. If one happens to have a good social insurance pension and from the job a pension which may be good, medium or poor, the tax system levels it out afterwards. Those are the reasons put forward for that type of integration.  Obviously it is logical to integrate the two systems as far as possible.  The Commission on Taxation highly recommended integration of the two systems.  I should state that I am a customer's man and I am there on behalf of the social welfare customer. At the end of the day I want the system to serve the customer rather than the other way round.  That may sound like a simplification but it is an important caveat in any of the studies which will be done in relation to that whole area.</P>

      <P>While it sounds very nice to be wedded to the insurance system, with its tremendous value of awarding people entitlements as of right, is it not a reality that many of the rights under insurance have been cut back?  I have heard workers say that if they had paid into a private insurance scheme the money they had paid into the State scheme they would be able to meet all their crises, whereas on the State scheme they had to cut back on what was due.  I do not expect the Minister to acknowledge that, but in the context of the integration of the two systems is the support of children not one of the critical issues? Is it not a fact that our social welfare system acknowledges children and awards extra payments for children, whereas our tax system gives absolutely no recognition?  Is this not a vital issue in the context of integrating the two systems?</P>

      <P>I do not think one could be critical of social welfare on that issue. There is a need to find a balance between <Col N="977" /> the two systems.  It is done in social welfare because the incomes are needed. Earlier Deputy De Rossa talked about the need for minimum wages, the wage structure, and the whole wage problem. The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to examine intensively the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems. I would emphasise it is not a simple situation.  I would like to see something solid before I would be prepared to depart from the social insurance fund because it is a valuable support to workers generally.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not identified the specific poverty traps which he thinks might result from an integration of the tax and social welfare codes.  Does he foresee such an integration eliminating the anomalies that exist with regard to the family income supplement?  Will it eliminate the anomaly whereby a person who is working gets mortgage relief on his mortgage, but as soon as he becomes unemployed loses that relief and has to go to the community welfare officer at whose discretion he will get assistance?  I could continue to list anomalies.  Does he foresee that those kinds of anomalies would be eliminated? When does he expect the expert group will be established and working?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 is to enable the Minister to complete his review of the classification of national roads before the National Roads Authority is formally established.  As drafted, <Col N="1026" /> the Bill would have required the Minister to establish the National Roads Authority first.  He would then have to consult it before completing his review of the national road classification.  Having considered the views of the National Roads Authority he would then make a formal national roads order and only at that point could the National Roads Authority become responsible for these roads.</P>
    <P>I have already formally consulted the interim National Roads Authority on the national road classification and it has made a detailed submission to me.  In the near future I will complete my own review taking account of the submissions made to me by the National Roads Authority and others.  When I am establishing the National Roads Authority I will also make a national roads order.  This will ensure that the Authority will take over responsibility for these roads from the day it is assigned the functions set out in Part III of the Bill, rather than having to await completion of the national roads review after its formal establishment.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the National Roads Authority will take over statutory responsibility for its national road functions from 1 January 1994.  This is the most appropriate date since it is the beginning of the financial year and provides a reasonable lead in time to prepare for the transfer of functions.  In effect, therefore, these amendments are a means of preserving the Minister's power to classify national roads in the intervening period before the National Roads Authority is formally established.</P>
    <P>The amendments also provide that the Minister will have to consult the Authority when he proposes to make any future changes to the national road classification.</P>

      <P>What type of exercise is involved in the national road classification? We discussed this matter in <Col N="1027" /> detail in the special roads committee and I brought to the Minister's attention a specific secondary route along the estuary in County Limerick, an area for which the Taoiseach has projected large scale industrial development in the future. That route is regarded as a national secondary one.  At that committee, the Minister stated it was not his intention to reclassify any further routes on the basis that he did not have sufficient funding to conclude works on the national primary route.  What is the big deal in regard to reclassifications?  While I accept the logic of doing that before establishing a National Roads Authority, what is involved in this exercise?  Are we talking about upgrading secondary routes to national primary routes?  If so, how much road and time will be involved?</P>

I have recently been stressing reclassification in my own county.  The interim National Roads Authority is in place and has given its views to the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>I hope decisions will be made, but they will be made on the basis of the submissions made to the Minister by the National Roads Authority, the Minister's own views and, most important, the submissions made to him by Deputies and local authorities.  The whole purpose is that if roads are to be reclassified that would be done immediately rather than waiting for the National Roads Authority to be put in place.  I certainly hope the Minister will make decisions soon.</P>

In reply to a submission from Limerick County Council about the N69 from Limerick to Foynes and Tarbert, which carries a huge amount of transport, the Minister pointed out that he could not seriously consider upgrading it because there was no <Col N="1028" /> finance and his priority was national primary routes.  Is the Minister now considering reclassifying some of those routes as national primary routes?  If he is, that contradicts the impression I got during a meeting of the Special Committee dealing with the Roads Bill which met during the summer recess last year.</P>

    <P>In response to the debate in the Seanad, which emphasised the need for regular quality audits of the National Roads Authority's operations, I introduced an amendment to section 18 dealing with the preparation by the National Roads Authority of its medium term plan.  The amendment will oblige the Authority to have regard to the need for efficiency, economy and quality in the construction and maintenance of national roads and will also require it to include an independent assessment of these matters in its medium term plan which must be prepared at least once every five years and reviewed annually.  The amendment places the stress on efficiency, economy and quality in the construction and maintenance of national roads, the core function of the National Roads Authority, and ensures that these elements are fully assessed in the Authority's medium term plan.  The medium term plan is the Authority's strategic mission statement and is the proper vehicle for the type of quality assessment proposed.  A number of Deputies and Senators stressed the need for some pressure to be put on the National Roads Authority to have quality built into the review.  That is why I am moving this amendment.  The assessment will be independent, which is what most people want.</P>

We alluded to the Tallaght by-pass where not only did we spend money on providing the by-pass but had to provide moneys for shoring it up because of the very bad <Col N="1030" /> quality of workmanship.  From that point of view I welcome this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister was not quite so generous in this House in relation to some of the amendments that we put forward at that time.  We did talk about who pays the price for all of this but I do not see any amendment dealing with that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment such as this is to be welcomed but this is another example of aspirations going into the legislation and imposing obligations on local authorities without backing them up with adequate finance.  We are copping out and passing on the responsibility for proper maintainance to the local authorities, but how can the local authorities maintain anything when they are not given the resources to do so?  We could all quote examples in our own local authority areas, including the standard of public lighting and the repair and maintenance of roadways.  The Minister will drive down the Shankill by-pass on his way home to Wexford most weekends and will see the lack of quality for the residents adjoining these roads simply because we, as a country, have opted out of maintaining any standards in the context of noise emanating from major roads.  Quality, from the point of view of the public, is quality of life and in this context completion of our national roads leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could argue that the Authority should not have regard to efficiency, economy and quality in the construction and maintenance of national roads, but there is not much point in saying this unless we are prepared to spend the money and there is no evidence that that is the case.  We had an example here recently when we passed the Homeless Persons Bill and imposed obligations on local authorities to house homeless people.  Dublin County Council are now putting homeless families into one bedroomed dwellings constructed for old people.  I know I am straying from this amendment, but it is just another example of the Dáil passing legislation and telling local authorities that they <Col N="1031" /> must do this or that.  Unless we give them the resources there is no point in doing that.  I want to go on record as supporting the concept of the amendment but I am sceptical that we will have the resources to do what is contained in the amendment. I would like to hear the Minister say he will be giving the necessary finance for the achieving of the aspirations contained in this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is important that we should have good quality roads.  In the case of many new roads the work is contracted out to independent contractors. In my own county, the new Rathkeale by-pass which was opened was an excellent job.  However, I would like to know what mechanism exists for checking quality. Is this done shortly after a new road is constructed or is it done after the contractors have been paid?  If, afterwards, a particular section of a roadway is found to be defective, can the local authority revert back to the original contractors and ask them to rectify that part of the road?  What about roads which are part of national primary routes, such as the one from Limerick to Killarney where it does not seem to be possible to rectify constant bumps?  Where does a quality audit feature in relation to this?  Will a quality audit recommend that a certain amount of money be expended in retrieving part of a national primary route which is regarded as defective?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Regarding Deputy Keogh's queries, when the Bill was discussed in the Dáil it was agreed that some of those matters would be considered in the Seanad.  That is what happened in relation to some matters and officials then had more time to consider those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Barrett's comments, I agree there are difficulties with local authorities in relation to road construction. At the request of Deputies Barrett and Keogh, who spoke about noise levels on the Shankill by-pass, an amendment was tabled in respect of the noise issue.  The Deputies' views were <Col N="1032" /> taken on board in that regard.  I am hopeful that economies will be made in regard to road works when the National Roads Authority take over responsibility for the maintenance of national roads on 1 January 1994.  An amount of £360 million is being spent on our national roads this year.  With better management better quality roads and facilities could be provided when new roads are being built. People around the country, not just in Shankill, are dissatisfied with the condition of the area alongside the road after road construction.  Given the powers the National Roads Authority will have, it will be in a position to provide a better standard of road and, more importantly, a better quality of road for residents who live adjacent to the road.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Finucane's point relating to the construction of roadways, the contractor builds the road but during its construction residents, engineers and representatives from local authorities and the Department of the Environment keep tabs on the road construction until its completion.  I agree with the Deputy that in certain circumstances the end product has not been of a satisfactory standard.  In my area a road is being reconstructed which was built five or six years previously.  Taxpayers' money is being used for that construction which could be allocated to other necessary road works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I hope that the National Roads Authority in conjunction with the road constructors, whether the construction is the responsibility of the local authorities or private contractors, will produce better standard roads in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Barrett stated, there is a need to consider the condition of the areas alongside the road following completion of road works.  Money is always a problem.  However, from 1 January 1994 I hope moneys previously allocated to local authorities for national road construction will now be allocated to the <Col N="1033" /> National Roads Authority who will be responsible for the efficiency and economy of road construction.</P>
    <P>One of the main points raised in the Seanad and previously in the Dáil concerned the quality of roads following construction. The National Roads Authority must be accountable in regard to the quality of road they produce and for that reason there will be an independent assessment every five years in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board my suggestions and those of Deputy Keogh on Committee Stage in relation to noise levels.  This is a move forward.  I ask the Minister to follow up on his generosity by incorporating a provision in this regard in the legislation. Noise levels on the Shankill bypass are causing a major problem.  The issue of noise levels affects everybody.  We have written to the Department of the Environment on a number of occasions seeking the provision of double glazing for residents living close to the Shankill bypass. I am convinced that if those residents had available resources, both Dublin County Council and the Minister would be in the High Court.  Unfortunately, those people do not have resources and they depend on their public representatives to resolve their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding road quality and standards, it would be an example of goodwill if the Minister took on board the problem in relation to noise levels on the Shankill bypass.  The problem is affecting a small group of people.  Their lives have been transformed by this nuisance.  Various studies have been carried out.  There are contradictory surveys in respect of noise levels.  However, the best noise level survey that could be carried out would be for a person to call to those houses adjacent to the Shankill bypass and consider if any ordinary person would be comfortable living in those houses when heavy traffic is passing.  The quality of life of the people in that area has been reduced by high noise levels.  Their lives would be transformed by the Department, through the county council, allocating a small amount of money to ensure <Col N="1034" /> that double glazing is provided in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>I recommend, in relation to the Shankill area, that double glazing be provided in cases where it is evident that such a measure is the only solution to the problem.  There is not much point in talking about the road surface if the people living beside the road find their lives adversely affected by high noise levels. The quality of one's lives is what is important.</P>
    <P>Safety features, noise levels and the quality of life enjoyed by people living beside the roadway are important considerations. I would be prepared to travel five miles an hour slower to provide a better quality of life for residents adjacent to major roadways.  There is no point in talking about good road surfaces and and grand lamp standards if the quality of life enjoyed by those living near the roadway has been reduced or that adequate safety precautions are not provided. Since the Minister accepted my recommendation and that of Deputy Keogh in relation to inserting a provision on noise level standards, I would ask him to consider people whose lives have been affected as a result of the construction of a major national road such as the Shankill bypass.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will sympathetically consider this and allocate a small sum of money to eliminate this nuisance for the residents living near the Shankill bypass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Barrett stated, we raised the question of noise levels along the Shankill by-pass and I now remind the Minister of this matter.  When the Minister talked of the control of noise in an earlier debate he said that provisions in that regard &mdash; for example, in respect of those who were affected by noise levels on the Shankill by-pass &mdash; could not be retrospective.  As a relatively small number of people are involved it might be inferred that this is a small problem, but it is not a small problem for those involved.  Life is very difficult for them.  It is a matter that could be easily rectified.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter his attention.  This would <Col N="1035" /> avoid further representations being made in relation to that problem.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment, it is good to achieve a quality audit.  We are concerned to obtain the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark and that the National Roads Authority would attain the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; mark standard.  It would be useless obtaining an audit which indicates that a road is disintegrating if the resources are not available to repair it. That is the main point with regard to funding as raised on Report Stage.  We can have all the independent assessments we like, which probably only tell us what is obvious from driving along the road but they are irrelevant unless specific resources are allocated.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment requesting that a percentage of EC funds be allocated for the maintenance as well as the construction of those roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to noise levels, the modernisation of our national primary route involves the construction of by-passes.  Many people who built a house adjacent to what they regarded as a peaceful country road are now living beside main national motorways.  Two people who contacted me in this regard had a valid point to make.  Those people were living beside a national primary route and their whole lifestyle was disrupted. I made a simple request at the time to compensate those people for the disturbance caused by noise levels, for example by the provision of double glazed windows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to any proposed roadway a significant capital acquisition cost is set aside to compensate adjoining land owners for their land.  However, it is often people living in a cottage who find themselves located beside a national primary route.  Such people are not taken into account in the compulsory acquisition of land.  It would cost only a small amount of money to compensate those people for the disruption to their lifestyle by the construction of those routes.  It would engender good-will if they were <Col N="1036" /> compensated.  Such a provision should be contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The stretch of road from Limerick to Adare should be completed.  More than £1 million will be spent this year on compulsory acquisitions and in the preparation of designs and drawings.  A small amount of money should be allocated from those funds to compensate people, who will inevitably complain after the road has been constructed, for the intolerable noise levels that will affect their lifestyle.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The amendment suggested will solve the problems raised by Deputies.  I appreciate the difficulty in Shankill and I should like to tell Deputies Keogh and Barrett that I have not forgotten about the matter.  It is still a live issue and we are considering how to resolve the problem without creating a precedent.  If we were required to compensate people for all the roads that have been built it would amount to a substantial sum of money.  While the amount of money being allocated for Shankill might seem to be small it would add up to a considerable sum if we were to address other problems in a similar way nationwide.  I pass the Shankill houses every day and I appreciate the difficulty there.  We are examining how to resolve the problem for that small number of residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Finucane's comments, compensation is available for farmers whose land is acquired by the Department of the Environment or the local council.  In some instances, if a house is too near a road the council will purchase it and relocate the family.  The fact that the amendments were made to the Bill setting up the National Roads Authority concerning sound levels will overcome the problem in future.  In my county the Department of the Environment, and the local authority, went out of their way to facilitate as much as possible people living alongside a roadway which was to be extended.  I hope that will continue to be the case.  Problems arise but, with the help of the resident engineer and the county engineer, <Col N="1037" /> they can usually be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone.</P>
    <P>Another problem can arise where business people living on or near a roadway are not compensated when a new road is constructed.  I am unhappy with that position because if business people lose much of their business due to the construction of a new roadway they should be compensated. Farmers, and others are compensated if their land is acquired.  This is a problem I intend to discuss with the EC and the Department.</P>
    <P>On noise levels, the amendment to the Bill should solve that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that farmers are compensated when their land is acquired and that if a person's house is situated near a new roadway that person is relocated.  However, I am referring to the person who in many cases lives adjacent to that road.  I am aware of cases where this has happened.  When these roads are being designed it is obvious which houses will be affected.  Those people cannot be ignored and their good-will is required in this regard.  There is much merit in compensating people for the effect of noise levels.  Money should be set aside to ensure that if those people require double glazing to reduce the noise levels caused by the motorway traffic that will be provided.  That would avoid confrontation at a later stage when they complain to the council about the problem of noise and are told there are no funds to deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case being made by Deputy Finucane and I take on board what the Minister said in relation to compensation.  It is not a straightforward matter of acquiring land from a farmer and stating that land valuations are so much.  One must look at the farm and the enterprise and determine what <Col N="1038" /> possible inconvenience will be caused by dividing the farm.  A dairy farm may be divided down the middle.  A grazing field of ten acres may be divided and cattle will have to be driven across the highway. Acquiring land that is needed to build a road is not the end of the problem.  The Minister, who is a rural Deputy, will be aware of that factor which should be taken on board.  I fully subcribe to the notion of compensating business people. Too often I have seen family businesses, which had been built up over many years, being destroyed following the construction of a ring road or a by-pass.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>In regard to petrol filling stations, if a new road is being constructed which bypasses that facility there should be an onus on the local authority to provide a site for the person concerned to develop a similar business near the new road. Either a cash compensation should be offered or the owner should be provided with an alternative site for the business. This would be a reasonable course to follow and it would reduce the need for compulsory purchase orders.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider extending the funding by his Department to local authorities for the maintenance of national primary route lighting?  This matter relates to the efficiency, economy and quality of the construction and maintenance of roads.  At present the capital cost of national primary route lighting is funded by the Department and Structural Funds.  However, the ongoing maintenance cost of national primary route lighting, which is a very heavy burden, has to be met by local authorities, who have no financial base.  It seems ironic, given the high standards that must be met to ensure safety and efficiency on our national primary routes, that responsibility for maintenance of national primary route lighting does not rest with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to consider the question of compensating businesses who find themselves cut off as a result of the construction of new national roads.  I am sure the Minister is <Col N="1039" /> very conscious of the problems in Barntown in our constituency of Wexford where two commercial premises will experience major difficulties with the realignment of the N25 and at Ballinaboola where several business will be cut off.  As matters stand these businesses will not be entitled to compensation.  A reasonable and rational approach should be taken in these cases.  I urge the Minister of State to pursue the matter with the Minister and any other authority as may be necessary to ensure an equitable resolution to these difficulties.  I welcome the fact that we are receiving more and more European money to spend on upgrading and realigning our national primary and secondary routes.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As soon as the National Roads Authority is set up discussions will take place on that matter. I appreciate there is a difficulty for the local authority in Wexford in trying to maintain national route lighting.  On the <Col N="1040" /> question of compensation it is difficult to find a balance.  In the area of land acquisition, landowners sometimes agree with local authorities on the amount of compensation to be paid.  When agreement cannot be reached the matter goes to arbitration where the market value is agreed.  In deciding the value, questions such as disturbance and whether cattle have to cross a road are taken into account.  However, this system does not always ensure a happy ending, particularly in regard to underpasses and roadways. Difficulties arise in that in some cases the Department refuses to grant underpasses while in others they allow them to go ahead.  For example, in New-townmountkennedy underpasses have been approved, whereas in Enniscorthy and other parts of the country they have not been approved.</P>

There seems to be a discrepancy in terms of the granting of permission in these cases.  I understand that underpasses will be approved for the N25 at Barntown although they were refused in Enniscorthy.  Farmers in that area find they have split holdings and must bring animals from one side of a Euroroute to another.

I ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the National Roads Authority the debates that have taken place on this matter.

How can that be explained to people who are up to their ears in potholes, people who do not come within an asses roar of my county?

This man parks in a very safe place.  I accept that it should be a condition that a person does not just pull up on the hard shoulder.

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the regulations formalise in national law the processes associated with the directive, they also complement a wide range of statutory and voluntary measures promoted by the Government in recent years to increase the availability of information and encourage quality and consistency in this area.  National legislative and administrative systems for <Col N="1047" /> physical planning and environmental control contain provisions for public access to environmental information. Information is made available in a generally standard and comparable manner through systems of registers, for example, registers of air and water pollution licences, and planning applications, which, from the public point of view, are a source of consistent and readily understood data and, from an administrative point of view, are well-established and practical.</P>
    <P>The procedures put in place to implement the 1985 Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment &mdash; EIA &mdash; have also, of course, brought about enhanced openness on environmental issues.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> A developer seeking development consent for a project covered by the EIA procedures has to prepare an environmental impact statement setting out the project's likely effects on the environment.  This statement has to be made available for inspection and purchase by members of the public and interested bodies who are then entitled to put their views to the authority making the development consent decision, which has an express legal duty to take account of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence to date suggests that Ireland requires a comparatively high proportion of development proposals to undergo EIA.  Research by the Environmental Research Unit of my Department shows that over 280 environmental impact studies have been prepared to date.  This is clear evidence of our commitment to transparency and extensive <Col N="1048" /> public information on the environmental implications of development.</P>
    <P>Other opportunities to extend statutory access to information have also been availed of.  In particular, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, contains the most comprehensive set of obligations ever imposed on any organisation to make information available on the quality of the environment.  In addition to section 110 of that Act &mdash; under which these regulations are made &mdash; there are at least 18 other sections in that Act where there is specific provision for publication of information and, indeed, the duty in most cases is mandatory rather than discretionary.  Of particular note are the requirements to establish an environmental quality data base with public access to the contents &mdash; section 69 &mdash; and the requirement to provide public access to monitoring carried out under the provisions of the Act.  The new regulations do not affect these existing statutory provisions and, in fact, are an addition to them.</P>
    <P>Outside the framework of statutory requirements, national and local authorities actively disseminate data on the state of the environment or make it available to interested parties.  The Environmental Information Service &mdash; ENFO &mdash; established in 1990, provides an extensive data base and library on the environment and is a source of easily accessible, appealing and authoritative information. ENFO is now well advanced in the provision of a national network for the distribution of educational awareness material on the environment through the public county library service.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the county library service being more fully utilised by local authorities as local information centres, to provide the public with the full range of reports and information generated by the authorities and to participate more actively in the promotion of local educational, awareness and cultural activities. I will be exploring the opportunities here &mdash; which are already available and waiting to be exploited &mdash; with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department has developed a policy <Col N="1049" /> of increasing environmental publications and reports.  Reports have been published on the state of the environment and on specific aspects of the environment. Detailed data on surface water quality are contained in the report Water Quality in Ireland 1987-1990 recently published by the Environmental Research Unit.  Ireland also has one of the most informative drinking water quality publications in the European Community.  Extensive data, generated by local authority monitoring programmes, has been published, again by the Environmental Research Unit, for 1989 and 1990.  A 1991 report, incorporating a review of trends over the three years, 1989-91 will be published this year. As a more general digest of up to date information, my Department regularly publishes an Environment Bulletin detailing developments in environmental protection at local, national and international level.</P>
    <P>New developments at EC level, which will increase awareness as well as promoting better quality information, include the Eco-labelling scheme for products and the Eco-management and auditing scheme.  While these are voluntary, they have particular significance for the public in assisting the identification of environmentally friendly products and companies.  I would like to see Irish companies taking a lead in participating in such initiatives; as well as informing the public, they have the potential to promote Ireland's green image in a well defined and focussed manner.  I would like to see the private, as well as the public sector taking a more pro-active role in the publication of data on environmental aspects of its operations and activities.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with some aspects of the regulations.  The public authorities to which they apply are defined in the Directive as any public administration at national, regional or local level with responsibilities for the environment and possessing information relating to the environment, with the exception of bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity.  In making the regulations <Col N="1050" /> we were conscious that it would not be practical to formulate a comprehensive list of organisations to which the regulations would apply, given the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Public authorities must have public administration functions and responsibilities and possess information relating to the environment.  The definition includes persons or bodies under the control of a public authority holding environmental information.  It is quite clear that the regulations apply to a number of Government Departments, local authorities, the National Radiological Protection Institute, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, the Marine Institute, regional and central fisheries boards and the soon to be established Environmental Protection Agency.  Information held in connection with, or for the purposes of, any judicial or legislative function, including processing of determinations by Ministers and other public authorities such as An Bord Pleanála is excluded from the scope of the Directive and regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department has produced guidance notes for the assistance of public authorities in implementing the regulations. This publication is freely available to the public.  We have also produced a shorter public information leaflet.  The guidance notes have placed considerable emphasis on a climate of openness in responding to requests under the regulations. Public authorities are advised that information should be refused only where there are significant and substantial grounds for refusal.</P>
    <P>I am urging public authorities, in processing requests, to respond positively and promptly, and to offer assistance to members of the public so that requests for information are clear, specific and understandable.  Public authorities are advised not to refuse information without implementing an internal review procedure. This will ensure that refusals are kept to a minimum and made only in accordance with justified grounds.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations the bulk of circumstances under which information may be refused are discretionary.  &ldquo;Commercial <Col N="1051" /> and industrial confidentiality&rdquo; is one discretionary ground which has caused some misgivings particularly among individuals and organisations concerned with environmental pollution from industry.  The notes make it quite clear that a request by any person or company for information to be treated as confidential does not automatically classify it as such.  The fact that a release of information relating to a pollution incident might damage the reputation of a company is not an adequate reason for withholding this information.  It would also be very difficult to cite commercial/industrial confidentiality as a ground for refusing to make available information on the composition of emissions, including volumes, to the environment.</P>
    <P>In dealing with another discretionary ground for refusal, that is &ldquo;material still in the course of completion&rdquo; the guidance notes come out strongly in favour of availability.  Ongoing monitoring of environmental emissions could not be considered as unfinished, and public authorities should arrange for the periodic publication or release of such results.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the bias towards making information available, public authorities are required, under Article 7, to separate from material which is being refused information which is not covered by the grounds for refusal.  Where it is not practicable to separate out material public authorities are advised to consult with the applicant on some other mutually acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>While the regulations enable public authorities to charge for the supply of information it is not the intention that this provision should lead to the imposition of charges for information that might have been freely provided in the past.  There should be a presumption in favour of providing information freely as long as costs are not significant.</P>
    <P>A decision to refuse information is not the end of the road for the applicant.  In the first instance it is open to a person to ask the public authority to reconsider its <Col N="1052" /> decision.  If the public authority concerned &mdash; for example, Government Departments, local authorities and health boards &mdash; come within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, the decision may be reviewed by the Ombudsman.  In all cases the applicant may seek a judicial review by the courts of a refusal by a public authority to make information available.  The regulations are introduced against a backdrop of changing attitudes to the role of information in relation to environmental protection and the increased efforts in recent years by public authorities to make more information freely available.</P>
    <P>In many cases the regulations in practice give statutory effect to an existing open door policy.  While this has been operated by some public authorities, in others changes in practices will be required.  The regulations must be given a chance to work.  I would ask for some time to see the whole process at work, but the way forward is clear: information is a powerful instrument of environment policy and it must be given full scope to develop as such in the Irish situation.</P>

      <P>I wish to make an explanatory statement on behalf of Deputy Noel Davern, who is away at present.  The statement reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to certain remarks which I made in the House on 9 June last.  On that day I made certain remarks which were highly critical of the Law Reform Commission, its members and staff.  I very much regret having made those remarks and I unreservedly withdraw them and apologise to the members of the Commission. The remarks which I made were unwarranted and unjustified.  I accept <Col N="1053" /> that the members of the Law Reform Commission are persons of unimpeachable integrity.  I deeply regret having caused upset to the members and staff of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The consultation paper prepared by the Commission on the subject of occupiers' liability was, at the time I made my remarks, being printed and has since been published by the Commission. I look forward to considering its contents.  Having regard to the complexity of the issues involved in occupiers' liability and the length of the consultation paper which has now been published I can well understand why its publication and preparation took approximately 15 months.  I have no doubt that its publication will now assist and stimulate widespread and useful discussion which will lead to the clarification and reform of the law.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I deeply regret having made the offensive remarks referred to.  I apologise wholeheartedly for them and I withdraw them without reservation. I would like to add that I have full confidence in the Law Reform Commission and its personnel and I wish them well in their work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome the fact that Government time has been made available to discuss these regulations, which were published on 20 May last and laid before the Dáil the following day.  However, the refusal of the Government to take my motion annulling the regulations in Government time is a negation of democracy and is all the more serious when one considers that more and more important legislation is being implemented by way of regulation, thereby denying parliamentary debate on the issues involved except in Private Members' time.  As there are now three parliamentary groups sharing the Opposition benches, the division of Private Members' time could prevent and <Col N="1054" /> exclude an annulling motion being taken within 21 sitting days, as required by law.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked, as Ministers assume for themselves more and more delegated authority and the regulation procedure becomes a frequently used tool of legislation, whether the use of Private Members' time, when limited time is available to the Members of the Opposition, could conceivably be considered as an adequate parliamentary response to so many vital issues.  I contend that it is not, and the denial of a proper debate during Government time further exacerbates the democratic deficit, the gulf between the expectations of the electorate and the ability of politicians on all sides to respond to their needs.</P>
      <P>This Government is feeding and fuelling a growing cynicism among the public through their refusal to open up debate on regulations and by hiding behind the coat tails of precedent and outmoded practices which perhaps had some validity when there were one or two Opposition groups and the Government only resorted to statutory instruments and regulations to effect minor changes to complicated legislation.  The advent of EC directives to be transposed into domestic law in each member state by way of regulation has so increased the frequency of the use of the regulation procedure that to continue to deny debate on the issues involved has serious constitutional implications way beyond the area dealt with by the High Court in the case involving clenbuterol in March last.  Nonetheless, I welcome this limited opportunity to make a statement, even though we cannot move our motion or have it voted on.</P>
      <P>The great number of exemptions from the EC Directive on Access to Information on the Environment, the institutionalising of official secrecy by giving public authorities the right to withhold information and the blatant negation of public participation in the planning process amount to an abuse of democracy and confirm the worst fears about this autocratic Government with its large majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, who cannot be with us this evening &mdash; I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne &mdash; has taken the minimalist approach to the EC Directive and has misled the public, like his two Ministers of State, by stating that he is legally obliged to exempt An Bord Pleanála from the provisions of the regulations. This is incorrect.  Even if we agree that An Bord Pleanála is a judicial body &mdash; a quasi-judicial body at best &mdash; the EC Directive does not require judicial bodies to be exempt.  While the directive, which the regulations purport to implement, does not require judicial bodies to be covered, it does not prevent member states from extending national freedom of information provisions to bodies such as An Bord Pleanála.  This is a missed opportunity.  The Government may be entitled to exempt An Bord Pleanála from the regulations, but it is not obliged to do so, as the Minister would have us believe.  He has tried to mislead the public by suggesting that he had no choice in the matter when he had and he chose to keep the light out, to refer to that much publicised phrase of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in natural justice a third party appellant should be entitled to see a developer's response to an appeal in addition to the judgment of An Bord Pleanála in relation to the outcome.  If we are trying to pretend that An Bord Pleanála is a judicial body &mdash; I contend that the real judicial bodies are the High Court and the Supreme Court &mdash; it should respect the law on natural justice and the right of third parties, particularly those against whose interests the judgement may be made, to know the reasons.  In the Supreme Court each judge gives long and detailed reasons on why he came to his decision.  We are still not allowed, however, to know the reasons An Bord Pleanála reached certain decisions.  What is the Government afraid of?  Is it because the board does not have to accept the inspector's report?  Under these regulations we will continue to be denied access to the inspectors' report in a particular case and to the board's final <Col N="1056" /> decision.  We should consider what happened in relation to the Tara mast and other cases in more recent times.  How much longer will access to natural justice in this area be denied side by side with public participation in the planning process?</P>
    <P>There are other major deficiencies in the regulations.  The two month time frame within which a planning authority must respond to a request for information compares very unfavourably with the ten day time limit in, for example, the United States and Denmark for information in similar legislation.  It also compares very unfavourably with the 30 day period within which a third party objector must submit a planning appeal to a local authority. If a planning authority can take two months to respond to requests for information while an objector must lodge his appeal within 30 days, there is a negation of natural justice and a refusal to allow full public participation.  I ask the Minister to look at the anomaly in this area.  If a local authority can take two months to respond to a request from a would-be objector, while an objector has only 30 days within which to submit an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, this does not add up.  One can see how this two month time limit might be used in a mischievous way.</P>
    <P>Let us not be green about this issue. Both the Minister and I have been members of local authorities for a considerable time and we know that not all local authorities are as forthcoming with information as we would like them to be. These regulations will not insist that local authorities are forthcoming with information if they have two months within which to respond to requests for information while an objector has only 30 days to submit that information as part of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  This makes no sense.  The Government has missed the opportunity to let in the light.</P>
    <P>There are no clear guidelines on the price policy and charges for information. I see a major risk of price barriers being put in the way of third party objectors and members of the public who may not be in a financial position to pay the local <Col N="1057" /> authority charges for information.  It is reasonable to ask the public to pay for photocopying, but it is not reasonable to ask them to pay the costs of research carried out by the staff.  Public servants are there to serve the public.  Yet the Minister is suggesting that the local authority can charge the public for the time spent by staff in obtaining the necessary information.  It may be that local authorities are under-resourced in terms of staff numbers.  This issue needs to be looked at.  Nevertheless, the public should not be asked to pay for an inadequate local government service, particularly in relation to planning, development and environmental control generally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the guidelines, which attempt in a user friendly way to explain both the EC Directive and the regulations, which respond so poorly to that excellent EC Directive.  The regulations do not apply where information is required to be made available under any other statutory provision.  Again, there seems to be a major letoff, so to speak, in this area.  Mining, prospecting and foreshore licences may become less transparent as a result of the publication of these regulations.  According to the guidelines, the Planning Act provisions will remain the same.  However, the public and third parties generally are effectively allowed only the power of inspection under the Planning Acts. There is no power of inspection and retrieval.  This issue should be looked at.</P>

      <P>Reference is made in the guidelines to international relations and a discretionary reason for the refusal of information.  What is the position in regard to Sellafield and the 19 or so reactors along the west coast of the United Kingdom?  Can we not raise questions in regard to discharges from Sellafield? If we do, will we disturb international relations?  Matters which are the subject of preliminary investigation proceedings should not be exempt.  I agree that <i>sub judice</i> issues should be exempt, but not preliminary investigation proceedings.  In regard to the confidentiality of the deliberations of proceedings by public authorities, who decides what is confidential?  Commercial and industrial confidentiality is nonsense since the component value of emissions will have to be declared under effluent and discharge licences.  Where emissions have entered the public domain, information about those emissions must also be considered part of the public domain. The guidelines refer to &ldquo;requests which would place unreasonable demands&rdquo;. Who decides what is an unreasonable demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations before us, which are such a poor minimalist response to the EC Directive on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment, are a major disappointment and will not increase the level of transparency in the planning process.  If anything, the release of information to the public will be more discretionary than ever.  The Government has missed the opportunity to <Col N="1059" /> increase public participation in the planning process, to lift the veils of secrecy and to allay the fears, perceived or real, which are causing so much concern to people today.  Planning objections are 50 per cent perceived and 50 per cent planned, so to speak.  Lifting the veil of secrecy would reduce both the workload of An Bord Pleanála and the objection rate generally.  So much for Fianna Fáil's commitment to let in the light.  So much for the Labour Party's promise of open Government.  On the first occasion they had an opportunity to live up to their promises, they pulled down the blind firmly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said that the regulations were being introduced against a background of changing attitudes in relation to the role of information in environmental protection and increased efforts in recent years by public authorities to make more information freely available.  The Minister could have fooled me.  At one point it seemed that regulations to implement the provisions of EC Directive 90/313 would never be introduced.  Together with a number of environmental organisations, I was very pleased when the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, said that he was going to introduce regulations to implement the provisions of the EC Directive.  However, I should have known better.  Instead of wholeheartedly espousing this Directive, once again the Government has given a minimalist response which has only served to further alienate all of those groups who had sought a more open approach and who believed in the transparency promised by the Government and who now feel totally betrayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should this be so?  Why has the Minister decided to surround public authorities with a shroud of secrecy?  The Minister's interpretation of the Directive is regarded more of a hindrance than a help.  It avails of exemption options rather than availing of the opportunity to reassure those who foresaw exactly what could happen and which, unfortunately, <Col N="1060" /> has happened.  These regulations are a lost opportunity.  Instead of providing for freedom of access to information on the environment the Government seems determined to give as little information as it possibly can, to escape like a thief in the night.  What kind of signal does this send out to ordinary people?  What kind of confidence can people have in a Government which obviously has no confidence in them and their judgment?  How can we improve environmental protection if we do not know and cannot find out what is going on?  These regulations are not sufficient to enable this to happen.</P>
    <P>Many environmental groups are outraged by what they regard as a cynical act on the part of the Government.  These groups were ready to respond positively to the implementation of the provisions of the Directive in an open and positive manner.  The refusal in recent times to release information to environmental groups, information which would be released as a matter of course in other EC countries, did not give grounds for hope of greater openness on the part of the Government.  Unfortunately, those fears were justified.  Both Deputy Doyle and I put down motions calling for a debate on these regulations.  There are no prizes for guessing our reaction to the regulations.  While we welcome the opportunity to debate our reactions in the House, as we all know this debate is a sham.  We are merely expressing our points of view and we know that nothing will be changed.  I for one regret that my party did not have the opportunity in Private Members' time to put down a motion on these regulations.  Obviously, there are restrictions on Private Members' time; but at least we would have forced the Members of the Labour Party to vote for our motion.  These regulations are a negation of all that the Labour Party stands for.  What is the role of that party in all of this?  The electorate believed that the Labour Party would bring greater accountability to Government. Before now the Labour Party could blame Fianna Fáil but it is not facing up to its responsibilities in Government. <Col N="1061" /> The Labour Party may have a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, but it certainly has no environmental policy and no obvious active role in formulating policy, if this is anything to go by.  If the Labour Party still claims to have an environmental policy, where is its input to the interpretation of this Directive?</P>
    <P>During the debate last week on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill we had some discussion on the role of local authorities in the planning process.  I asked at that time that there be an appeals process to An Bord Pleanála so that the local authority's decisions could be further examined and, if necessary, appealed.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, did not think much of that suggestion so I am not at all surprised by the fact that we are still restricted from gaining access to information on an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Doyle's reference to the guidance note on access to environmental regulations.  While it is a very nicely produced document, it is quite confusing.  If those of us with some degree of expertise in the area of the environment find it confusing &mdash; I think under normal circumstances I have a reasonable grasp of difficult documents &mdash; I believe the public will find this document is not user-friendly.  It is complex and complicated.  I appreciate that a further leaflet to explain the regulations may be issued by the Minister but I hope that will be writen in simple, plain English and follow a logical sequence.</P>
    <P>Full implementation of article 2, which concerns information in relation to the environment, should mean that the public authorities should take a pro-active role and there should be a generous and not a minimalist interpretation of the regulations.  It should not be left up to the detective skills of environmentalists or the public in general to extract information but the facilities needed should be established.  I believe that a great deal of what the Minister says is aspirational and I wonder if the public authorities will take his suggestions on <Col N="1062" /> board.  I think they will need to be directed to take these suggestions on board.  I question why An Bord Pleanála is not included under the definition of a public authority.  The Minister's claim that he is forced by the Directive to exclude An Bord Pleanála is not correct. I think he is applying the old Civil Service rule of thumb that what is not expressly allowed is excluded.  The fact that he is not required to include An Bord Pleanála does not mean that he should seize the opportunity to opt out.  Article 130(t) of the Treaty states that member states have the right to provide more stringent rules to provide access to information.  Why does the Minister not apply that rule?</P>
    <P>We all know that An Bord Pleanála is at the centre of many environmental controversies so its exemption is seen as a mockery of the notion of transparency in the planning process.  The central role of An Bord Pleanála in environmental and planning matters means that the Directive on freedom of access to information will be severely limited.  At the very heart of the matter, where most people expect a commitment to openness, there is a total and abject failure by this Government.  There is a definition of public authority in section 3 of the Environmental Protection Act and An Bord Pleanála should be included as a public authority.  Any person should be entitled to obtain an inspector's report where there is a planning appeal without having to go through costly legal procedures.</P>
    <P>These regulations are minimalist and do not confer the right to know on the general public.  Article 3 states that member states shall ensure that public authorities are required to make available information in relation to the environment and member states shall define the practical arrangements under which such information is effectively made available.  I await with interest to see if the Minister's request that public authorities be pro-active is taken on board.  The Minister puts more trust in the public authorities than is credible.</P>
    <P>I think it is ridiculous to allow a period of two months in which to respond to a <Col N="1063" /> request for information.  I believe that this will give time for a cover-up rather than an opening of the system.  The timescale should allow people to avail of their full constitutional rights in relation to planning.  It would be a step in the right direction to follow the American example.</P>
    <P>I think the whole notion of charges for access to information is crazy.  Will this be another local charge?  Access to information should be freely available in all senses of the words.  The question of &ldquo;reasonable charges&rdquo; covers a multitude. There should not be methods of preventing a person from obtaining information particularly because of the charge involved.  The supposition seems to be that an individual or group will have to pay a fee to extract information which should be readily and freely available.  I am very disappointed with these regulations and I regret that we do not have the opportunity to vote on a motion to annul them.</P>

      <P>The guidance notes on Access to Information on the Environment, Regulations, 1993, should have been called partial access to information on the environment regulations or, indeed, minimal access to information on the environment regulations.  Freedom of access to information was one of the very first policies formulated by the Green Party when it was then known as the Ecology Party in the early eighties.  Being part of the worldwide Green movement, the Greens in Ireland have always been aware of the greater access to information that exists in other countries and that freedom can ensure responsive and community wide action to protect the environment in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fatal consequences of not having information on pollution of the environment came home to many for the first time in April 1986 following the Chernobyl accident.  Many have said that measures against the radioactive fall-out would have been much better and more effective if adequate information had been provided from the beginning. <Col N="1064" /> Before the Chernobyl accident, the UK Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 1984 ruled that freedom of access by the public to information collected or compiled by the authorities responsible for controlling pollution in exercising their statutory powers ought to be guaranteed.  Further back, freedom of information legislation was brought into Denmark in 1970, by Luxembourg in 1977, by France in 1978, by the Netherlands in 1981 and by Italy in 1986. Greece, Spain and Portugal all have constitutions that incorporate a citizen's right to access to administrative information. The reality is that in Ireland we have an enormous amount of catching up to do to help in this regard.  Directive 93/13 was adopted by the Council unanimously and is based on Article 130 (s) of the Treaty of Rome.  This enables the member states to introduce or maintain far more stringent conditions and measues to ensure freedom of information concerning the environment.  In Ireland's case the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, believes that the Directive has not been properly implemented in a number of ways, particularly because it implicitly excludes An Bord Pleanála from having to provide information to the public.</P>
    <P>It hurts me to say this, but I believe that the overriding principle in the Minister's implementation of EC Directive 93/13 on freedom of information on the environment is to maintain secrecy in Government. Article 130 of the Treaty stresses that we can implement far more stringent measures.  As I said earlier, we are catching up from a long way back.  The Directive states that member states must make available all information available to the public.  The Directive lists many reasons member states may, in certain circumstances, refuse to make certain information available, one of which is that it might be more damaging to the environment, but this has been abused greatly.</P>
    <P>One example which comes to mind is the case of a nest of a peregrine falcon. From the point of view of freedom of information on the environment, we should tell every gangster around exactly where that nest is so that he can pillage <Col N="1065" /> it, take the chicks and sell them to Saudi Arabia.  Obviously that is not intended in such a Directive.  The Minister has implemented all restrictions that he may &mdash; not that he has to &mdash; under the Directive and the Green Party believes he has gone way beyond the legal bounds of the Directive.  In fact, the Green Party are making a formal complaint to the European Commission on the implementation of the Directive.  I suspect unless the regulations are brought back to the drawing board we will be open to all sorts of legal challenges.</P>
    <P>Take for example the two month timeframe within which a public authority must respond to a request for information. This is unduly long and compares poorly with timeframes in Denmark or the US, both of which have a ten day response requirement.  If a ten day response requirement is good enough for the Danes why is it not good enough for us?  In the US, an appeal against a refusal of information must be dealt with within 21 days.  We must bear in mind that an ordinary person has only one month or, if one takes the postal system into account, three weeks in which to appeal a decision.</P>
    <P>Delays nullify the Directive because information which is too late is very often of no value.  Exclusion, by implication, of An Bord Pleanála from the regulations will ensure that many environmental concerns never come to light.  Already files with major environmental implications have been refused to the Green Party in relation to landfill sites, road proposals, pollution monitoring, building conservation and planning.  Only last month the environmental organisation, Earth-watch &mdash; even though the Directive has direct effect throughout the Community from 1 January &mdash; was still refused copies of planning files relating to the proposed new ESB power station at Poolbeg in Dublin.  Even if the regulations are annulled local authorities are still obliged, under the Directive, to provide the information.  There is no point in saying this would damage the process. The Directive is in place for the EC.</P>
    <P>Already the possibility of exorbitant charges for documents is a possibility and <Col N="1066" /> it is a sinister, controlling device against public access to information.  I am aware that students have been asked for £25 just to look at an old file and the regulations ensure no real control on this <i>de facto</i> information barrier.  In the same way as some public bars exclude people on low incomes by charging exorbitant prices, so local authorities can ensure that only very successful solicitors or big developers can afford access to the information which is intended to be available to everyone, including those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Surely the Labour Party finds this barrier to information, especially for those on low incomes, absolutely unacceptable. Certainly the culture of secrecy which these regulations reinforce in a number of ways is not only unacceptable to the Green Party but also infuriating. It is infuriating to recall the platitudes about open Government from Fianna Fáil and promises of freedom of information from Labour before the election. Now we are presented with a minimalist set of regulations, full of ambiguities, which avail of every exemption option laid down to ensure secrecy wherever possible.  Even the words &ldquo;freedom of&rdquo; in the Directive have been deleted and substituted by the word &ldquo;access&rdquo;.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne <i>(Wexford),</i> know well they can withdraw these regulations without upsetting anyone as the EC Directive has effect from 1 January.  I urge the Minister for the Environment to appreciate that the environmental problems facing this earth, such as the greenhouse effect, an accident at Sellafield and contaminated water supplies, all require every citizen to be informed and to take timely action. How can people be informed and so take timely action if the current regulations restrict and delay access to essential information?</P>

      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss the issue of access to information.  I should like to refer to one or two of the points made already. We should remember that it was the <Col N="1067" /> Labour Party who in the seventies introduced the procedure which gave rise to the establishment of An Bord Pleanála. The planning files ended up on the desk of the then Minister for Local Government, the late Deputy Tully, who agreed to the establishment of an independent body which would be free from any allegation of political influence.  This was the appeal mechanism established to ensure that any planning application would go to an independent body and that they would have the final decision.  That was a very important development almost 20 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government introduced the legislation which limited access by third party objectors and appeals to An Bord Pleanála effectively to three weeks.  Deputy Keogh asked where were the Labour Party in terms of accountability in relation to An Bord Pleanála giving information to the public and so on.  The Progressive Democrats were part and parcel of a legislative decision to limit the ordinary member of the public to dealing with questions of appeal to planning applications.  Deputy Sargent was correct in saying that two months is the period allowed to a developer to process an application and that three weeks to a month is the period within which any member of the public <Col N="1068" /> may make an appeal.  Surely a local authority or a Government Department should be able to respond within a period of less than two months.  I would ask the Minister to look again at that timeframe because freedom of information has to do with availability of information when it is needed.  There is no point in providing information if at the time it is provided the deed is done or the damage is caused to the environment and so on.</P>
      <P>In general I welcome the provisions of the regulations.  Information relating to the environment is defined in section 110 of the Environment Protection Agency Act, 1992, as follows:</P>
      <P>..... any available information in written, visual, aural or database form on the state of water, air, soil, fauna, flora, land and natural sites and on actions (including those which give rise to nuisances such as noise) or measures adversely affecting, or likely to so affect, these and on actions or measures designed to protect these, including administrative measures and environmental management programmes.</P>
      <P>That is a very broad definition.  The bottom line in regard to the EC Directive is that every member of the public should have access to environmental information on request without having to prove that one has a specialised interest in the matter.  We are all aware from dealings with local authorities and other such bodies of the difficulty in gaining access to sensitive information, whether it concerns smog levels, Sellafield, a hospital incinerator or other waste disposal facilities.  I am delighted that this matter is being removed from the whim of public authorities and welcome the fact that every member of the public will now have access to environmental information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not forget those basic points when criticising the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The EC Directive was introduced in 1990 and I regret that it has taken so long to implement it.  In fact, I understand we were obliged to have it implemented by December 1992, and, therefore, the previous Administration should have implemented it.  Nevertheless, this Administration has done so without delay.</P>
    <P>The availability of environmental information has been unsatisfactory in the past.  People could gain access to information only through the relevant agencies, local authorities, the Department or the environmental information service which was established recently.  I welcome the fact that that service has a national database and library facility. While I accept that the Department publishes an environmental bulletin from time to time, the environmental information service is the first body to make information readily accessible to the public and the public are crying out for such information.</P>
    <P>I agree that some discretion should be exercised in regard to requests for information.  If information relates to an individual, the consent of that person should be sought before making the information available.  It is reasonable to expect that if information is supplied voluntarily by a third party, the consent of the third party would be necessary before such information is made available. It is only in exceptional cases that a request is made for information which might cause environmental damage.  As Deputy Sargent stated, in the recent case relating to the peregrine falcons, information made available through the media could have led to the killing of one of those falcons.  Local authorities should be obliged to exercise discretion when supplying information involving an endangered species or other sensitive environmental information, because people could be careless, ruthless or merely aiming to make a quick financial return.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to examine the matter of the discretionary grounds on which information may be refused.  I <Col N="1070" /> understand from a newspaper article that the Minister indicated the matter would be reviewed within six months, depending on the number of complaints and the type of abuse arising during that period. Those discretionary grounds could cover a multitude of areas.  The document entitled <i>Access to Information on the Environment</i> states that information relating to anything which is the subject matter of legal proceedings, formal inquiries or preliminary investigations may be refused.  Information relating to the confidential deliberations or proceedings of public authorities, information on commercial and industrial confidentiality, including intellectual property, material still in the course of completion and unreasonable requests also may be refused.  There is far too much scope for abuse under that heading. I would prefer if that area was covered under the heading &ldquo;Partial supply of information&rdquo;.  In other words rather than leaving it to the discretion of the authority, there should be partial accessibility and where there might be an element of doubt, it would be open to the person seeking the information to negotiate with the authority.  Of course, people have the right of appeal to the courts, the Ombudsman and directly to the body.  I would like greater transparency in the publication of the regulations.  We are bound to implement EC Directives, but we are not bound to be as narrow as the Directive proposes.  We should at all times show generosity towards our citizens in the implementation of directives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my county colleague, Commissioner Pádraig Flynn, who in his capacity as President of the EC Council of Environment Ministers signed the Directive on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment on 7 June.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Access to Information on the Environment Regulations which came into force at the beginning of this year.  The buzz words in the past few years have been &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;<Col N="1071" /> because of the necessity to implement pollution control measures to bring about a green environment with clean air and water.  In the fifties, sixties and seventies we looked enviably at the European countries who had the ability to industrialise their cities and towns, mechanise their farms and achieve production levels per worker higher than we had in our underdeveloped country. Countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, France and Greece built up major tourism industries along their coastlines. However, time rolls on and when we thought we were near the bottom of the European development league, our underdeveloped resources are in fact a national asset.  What appear to be inherent weaknesses in our economy, such as vast open spaces, a lack of industrialisation, clear air and water and an underdeveloped coastline, are what many European countries would dearly love to have.  Some time ago it was speculated that the Spanish authorities would compulsorily acquire apartments and holiday complexes in portions of their coastline due to over-development and gross pollution; any one looking at a map of the Mediterranean sea would see vast sections designated as unsuitable for swimming and leisure activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an increasing awareness of the potential of development to cause pollution here and while fortunately, we have avoided the worst examples of development, people are increasingly questioning certain industrial processes etc. as it is the wish of everyone in Ireland to ensure that we learn from the mistakes made by others.  How often have we seen persons and community groups compelled to rally together to object to the granting of a planning permission with subsequent long drawn out correspondence, oral planning appeals and, in some instances, promoters withdrawing due to the length and cost of the planning process?  Many of these appeals were brought out of fear of or lack of information about the possible effects of the development on their locality.  If there were more openness and access <Col N="1072" /> to information, the bitterness which has sometimes been created in communities could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Increasingly there are conditions attached to planning permissions requiring the monitoring of emissions, the necessity to retain information gathered and the making available of records for inspection generally to the planning authority or their designated agents.  This information will now be available to members of the general public who may wish to build their store of knowledge as to how certain activities either in their own area or in other parts of Ireland or for that matter, Europe affect their quality of life.  It is imperative that people have the fullest confidence in the planning process and, more important, in the planning control process because once an industry is established and is providing valuable employment in a community, the local authority is acting with its hands tied behind its back when it comes to the rigid control and monitoring of the planning conditions.</P>
    <P>In the main, no local authority can easily move against an operation that gives employment in a region and, accordingly, when a similar type of process is started elsewhere in the country, the promoters of that process will point out the excellent operation being carried on there which is not the subject of any action by the local authority.  That is not to say that that operation is not without blemish for the local authority is operating with its hands tied when it comes to taking decisive action which may have the result of closing down an industry or result in prohibitive costs to control the pollution being caused.  On the basis that similar regulations operate in other European countries, the person making the request for information need not be a citizen of or resident in Ireland or, for that matter, in the European Community and, accordingly, valuable comparisons can be obtained and the effects of various industries in a localised situation in Ireland can be monitored.</P>
    <P>The regulations as drafted not only cover local authorities but, more importantly, a wide range of authorities exercising <Col N="1073" /> regulatory or management functions in relation to the environment, including Government Departments, the National Radiological Protection Institute, regional and central fisheries boards and the proposed Environmental Protection Agency.  The regulations are drafted to ensure that requests for information are dealt with promptly and a register maintained of all such requests, and any refusals of such requests for information will be the subject of an internal review procedure.  The interpretation of the regulations, and the prohibitions and restrictions in regard to the dissemination of certain types of information will be a matter for the courts in the event of dispute.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I would like to make about matters which are <i>sub judice,</i> which are or have been under inquiry or which are the subject of preliminary investigation proceedings.  The ground for refusal of information under this heading is discretionary and it would greatly concern me that the authorities covered by these regulations would refuse to disclose information on the basis that they were carrying out preliminary investigations to lead to subsequent legal proceedings.  I am aware of examples of ongoing investigations which have taken several years where the standard reply from the local authority is that the matter is being looked into, that the matter is being investigated or that the matter is under review.  Surely if one of these authorities is statutorily obliged to institute proceedings where there is clear evidence of damage to the environment, it is similarly obliged to quickly and speedily use the resources available to them to conclude their investigations with a view to instituting the proceedings and abate the nuisance or pollution as the case may be.  In the past individuals and groups were compelled to go to court because of the tardiness of regulatory authorities in discharging their statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have some mechanism available to him to independently review the activities of authorities whose preliminary investigations exceed, for <Col N="1074" /> example, a period of six months.  I understand that under the regulations the Minister must prepare a report within a period of two to three years on how these regulations are being implemented.  He should monitor the activities of authorities that constantly use the excuse that a matter is being investigated.  There should be a cut off point after which they cannot offer that excuse.  I know of a case in my constituency &mdash; I cannot mention it &mdash; where this has been going on for at least three years and is of great concern to a large number of people because of the serious environmental consequences. The local authorities constantly send out letters to the effect that the matter is under review and is being investigated. That has been going on for three years and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Of concern to me also is the interpretation put on the confidentiality of the deliberations or proceedings of public authorities and, particularly, reports or analyses produced to assist internal consideration of issues by a public authority. Reports and analyses are produced on an ongoing basis.  Where there is a pollution incident or such like subsequent to the preparation of a report or analysis or prior to the report or analyses, would this prevent all such reports or analyses being refused a public airing on the basis that they were produced to assist internal consideration? Blanket delineation of such reports and analyses would patently be unfair and undermine public confidence in the right to gain such information.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a public authority might circumvent the regulation by basing a refusal on the grounds of commercial or industrial interests which would be threatened.  In times of increasing environmental awareness, particularly in regard to such industries as pharmaceuticals who depend on a reputation for not damaging the environment in their efforts to penetrate world health markets, any release of information of a pollution incident is going to cause commercial damage to that industry.  Furthermore, public authorities should not have to state that they do not have the resources available to them to comply <Col N="1075" /> with the request to provide the information requested.  Our local authorities at present are stretched to the limit and any request for information puts additional demands on staff, as all such information has to be prepared to the highest standard because, very likely, it could be the subject of further scrutiny in court.  These regulations are new and their effectiveness will only be determined with the passing of time.</P>
    <P>Our public authorities have great latitude and flexibility, subject to the right of an individual to have any decision reviewed in court.  If public confidence is to be maintained these regulations must be interpreted reasonably, fairly and without fear of retribution.  The flexibility built into the regulations relating to the charge to be made by the public authorities is reasonable and again the Minister must keep this and all other issues under close scrutiny to ensure that no abuses creep into the system.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Ombudsman will have jurisdiction to review any refusal.  I am pleased also to note that the regulations provide that the public authorities are to provide an information policy statement indicating in a brief and user-friendly way the type of environmental information presently held by them and the arrangements for dealing with requests for this information.</P>
    <P>I welcome these regulations.  However, the information that is gathered by the public authorities is only as good as the resources, equipment and trained staff available.  We have come a long way in Ireland in the past few decades towards ensuring that the environment is protected for future generations.  As industrial processes become more sophisticated and complex, it is only right and proper that the authorities who are obliged to control and monitor them have the necessary resources, that the accuracy of the information obtained is beyond reproach and that it is not suspect or deficient.  The personnel operating within our public authorities are highly motivated, well intentioned and have a <Col N="1076" /> desire to discharge their public duty to the highest possible standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to implement the EC Directive on access to information on the environment regulations. Although this may not be what all Members want, it is a start and the Minister of State is to be complimented on implementing it.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have now become a major player in environmental protection and policing.  It is becoming far more costly for local authorities to implement the various regulations being introduced by the Department of the Environment. The Minister might look favourably at the possibility of increasing funding to local authorities which are stretched to the limit in carrying out their normal functions.  Any new functions imposed on them will, obviously, cause more strain.</P>
      <P>Pollution regulation and control, refuse collection and disposal and the physical planning and environmental control are all areas where local authorities have a major input.  It is only right that the public should have the fullest access to information as a right.  Of the many advances that have been made in the past few years in environmental protection, the one that immediately springs to my mind is in regard to planning.  In the past five or six years, in particular, the public have become more aware of their rights.  The implementation of this Directive will increase the amount of information available.</P>
      <P>Planning is a very sensitive issue and improved standards of planning throughout the country are very welcome.  Some might say that some of the conditions being insisted upon by planning authorities are too severe.  Of concern to planning applicants is the stipulation that an environmental impact study must be carried out in respect of planning applications. It is correct this should be the case.  Our countryside is littered with evidence of planning which has left it scarred. Perhaps the planning Acts were not in place at the time such developments took place.  I hope that is a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> The regulations are introduced against a backdrop of changing attitudes to the provision of information on environmental protection.  The increased effort in recent years by public authorities to make more information freely available is welcome.  I welcome the Minister's call on public authorities to respond positively and promptly and to provide information that is clear and specific.  This is very important.  A suggestion was made that some Government Departments and local authorities surround themselves in a veil of secrecy.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the new development at EC level which will increase awareness and promote better quality information, including ECO labelling for some produce.  This will make the public more aware of environmentally friendly products. It is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he would like to see public libraries used by local authorities and Government Departments as information centres.  Local county libraries already provide information and this would be a logical extension of their role. The provision of information by the Department of the Environment is improving annually.  Deputies will be aware that information is issued on an ongoing basis in the form of a bulletin. The information contained in the bulletin is precise and detailed on all aspects of environmental protection.  Local authorities and county councils are to be commended in that they are issuing environmental information.  Information is provided in regard to river water quality in our county on a monthly basis. The Department of the Environment issues information and reports on the quality of drinking water.  The importance of transparency in all aspects of Government business has been emphasised and this is a move in that direction. I would like the county libraries to be used more fully in this regard.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the implementation of this Directive.  There are weaknesses in it but it is a start.  We should move on from here and make positive suggestions as to where it may be improved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement.  It is pleasing that at least our society is becoming more open in relation to people's need to obtain information regarding environmental protection.  I do not wish to go over matters covered by other speakers <i>ad nauseam</i>.  As we become more conscious of people's rights to gain access to information we should make people more aware of how they may obtain information.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a planning matter which came to my attention yesterday and to which the Minister might be able to respond when replying.  When someone appeals to the planning board against planning approval granted by a local authority they must submit £100. If the appeal is upheld the £100 is not returned.  Subsequently if the local authority issues an approval on a slightly altered application and the same person appeals to An Bord Pleanála they must submit another £100.  I would be pleased if the Minister would clarify this matter as it would save me telephoning his Department.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the use of libraries. Members of Dublin Corporation have been using the libraries for a long time for the purposes of providing information. When I became a member of the corporation in 1967 I successfully tabled a motion to provide information centres where people could gain access to information on services.  Libraries have been used in that regard since that time.  Local authorities should be encouraged to use the libraries to disseminate information. Many public representatives hold their clinics in local libraries.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the publication of an increasing number of reports by the Minister's Department.  This is welcome. Reference has been made to the environmental bulletin detailing developments in environmental protection at local, national and international level.  This is welcome.  I am not sure if Deputies receive copies of the environmental bulletin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I wish to thank Deputies from all sides of the House who have made contributions here today.  Some of the Deputies are unhappy and most of them expressed reservations.  I hope these regulations are only the beginning of a process; they must not be taken in isolation. They are an honest, open attempt to reflect the provisions of the Directive in our public systems.  These should be examined, not in isolation but in the context of all the activities and publications to which I referred earlier, particularly the significant information role which has been given to the Environmental Protection Agency, which will be up and running shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues were raised by <Col N="1081" /> Deputies Costello, Keogh and Sargent in relation to An Bord Pleanála concerning the lack of transparency.  I wish to place on the record the position in relation to An Bord Pleanála.  Deputies have expressed concern about the definition of &ldquo;public authorities&rdquo; for the purposes of the Directive and regulations.  Particular concern has been expressed in relation to An Bord Pleanála.  Article 2 (b) of the Directive defines &ldquo;public authorities&rdquo; as any administration at national, regional or local level with responsibilities for possessing information relating to the environment with the exception of bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity.</P>
    <P>The regulations follow closely the provisions of the Directive in this regard. Article 3.3 (a) provides that they will not apply to information held in connection with or for the purposes of any judicial or legislative function.  &ldquo;Judicial function&rdquo; is likely to be construed as including processes of determination by Ministers and other public authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, which are open to the hearing of submissions from different parties and in relation to which the Irish courts have already declared that the authority concerned is required to act in a judicial manner.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the inspectors' reports in relation to An Bord Pleanála, particularly under the other systems that are freely available in the UK.  However, there is a fundamental difference between our system and that in the UK.  In the UK it is the inspector who makes the decision on an appeal and the inspector's report is the decision.  The board of An Bord Pleanála, however, act as a quorum of at least three, and usually as the full board of six, in complex and difficult cases.  In arriving at a decision the board must have regard to all matters before it and the inspector's report is therefore only one component of the decision making process of An Bord Pleanála. The board's decision is contained in its order which sets out in full the reasons for the decision and, where conditions are attached, the reasons for each condition.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental misconception <Col N="1082" /> about the role of inspector's report in decisions made by An Bord Pleanála. There is open access to all environmental information at all stages of the planning process.  The local authority file is an open book with the application, further information submitted by the applicant, the EIS and associated documents, reports prepared for the planning authority and the planning authority's internal documents, as appropriate, open to the public during the application period and immediately the planning authority decision is made.  At the appeal stage the full grounds of appeal, with whatever information on the environment they contain, are circulated to all parties to the appeal.  The inspector's role is to pull all this material together, make an assessment and a recommendation to the board to assist the board in reaching its decision.  It is not the inspector's role to be a source of additional and new information on the environment. However, if it transpires that new issues of significance in the appeal are highlighted by the inspector, the board, in the exercise of its functions in a judicial manner, must bring these to the attention of the relevant parties that have participated in the appeal.  They have adequate powers to do this in section 13 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992.  In this way any additional environmental information would come into the public domain.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the publication of the inspector's report would add to the already free access to all forms of information, environmental and planning, inherent in our present open and transparent planning system.  Indeed, there are already well established procedures for the circulation of relevant documentation to parties involved in planning applications and appeals.  It would confuse those procedures and make the planning process unmanageable if we were to add another layer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The timeframe for responding was mentioned by a number of Deputies also.  The emphasis in the regulations is on early response and in most cases I expect that the public authorities will respond within relatively short periods of, say, one to two weeks.  Where the information requires searches, compilation or copying, longer response periods will be required.  Some Deputies mentioned a ten day period. That could result in more refusals being given, particularly where the public authority is unable to provide information within the time limit.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The other question raised was in relation to charges. I hope we do not introduce prohibitive charges in this area.  Deputy Sargent <Col N="1084" /> highlighted the case of a student being charged £25 for old files.  That should not have happened and perhaps we may be able to assist that student by taking up the matter with the relevant authority.  I would not wish to see students, or indeed anyone else, being charged £25 for these files.  In my local authority area they do charge for the issuing of some documents, but this would be a minor charge.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise a number of aspects in relation to the charges.  As the regulations do not apply to information already available to the public, it will not be possible to introduce any additional charges for such information under these regulations.  Public authorities have been urged to continue to supply information freely as long as costs are not significant. Article 9 of the regulations requires that charges shall not exceed an amount which is reasonable, having regard to the cost of making available the information. Charges for the initial gathering or processing of information would therefore be excluded, as would charges for staff time in giving advice on information that is available.  The imposition of a charge which is so prohibitive as to be tantamount to refusal could of course be appealed by the applicant either to the public authority in the first instance or to the Ombudsman if the authority came under the jurisdiction of the office of the Court for Judicial Review.  I hope the local authorities and the people involved in giving out information will not overcharge and that the information will be made available as freely as possible.</P>
      <P>One matter that was raised on a number of occasions relates to the eight week period during which a local authority may reply on planning matters.  That period of time is much too long and is causing concern throughout the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> When the debate was adjourned last evening the Minister had dealt with Deputy Keogh's point on Sunday voting.  There is no statutory bar on Sunday polling.  However, some minority churches would have difficulty with the concept of voting on Sunday on the grounds of conscience and these difficulties must be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a wider system of postal voting was raised.  Postal voting presents serious issues in relation to the secrecy, security and integrity of the ballot.  Experience here and elsewhere has shown that unsupervised postal voting is open to serious abuse.  We can well appreciate that under particular electoral systems abuse, even on a very limited scale, can have a significant effect on election results and the formation of Government.  Following experience at two local elections the Oireachtas in 1986 decided against an extension of postal voting.  Instead it established special home voting arrangements for disabled electors, as well as an arrangement whereby diplomats and their spouses may vote under supervision at embassies.  I understand that our reservations about <Col N="1087" /> postal voting are shared by other countries, notably Belgium and France.  We are not ruling out postal voting in all circumstances.  If a way can be found to extend to postal voting the safeguards available at polling stations I would be anxious to see some such arrangement for people who have difficulty voting on account of the nature of their occupation or illness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to voting rights for emigrants.  The Deputy appeared to say that legal advice available to his party is that there is no constitutional problem in this regard.  The advice available to the Government is different.  The Government is advised that under the Constitution there is only limited scope to grant voting rights to those temporarily absent from the country. Recognising this, the Programme for a Partnership Government accepted in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants, and the matter is being comprehensively examined in that context.</P>
    <P>Deputies Keogh and Gilmore wish to see certain changes in the nomination of candidates at presidential elections.  The Deputies answered their own questions in this regard by acknowledging that the right to nominate is governed by the Constitution. This Bill can deal only with procedures.  To change the principles involved would require an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle wondered whether the proposed new arrangements for counting votes would effect a real saving of time. The Deputy suggested that the speed of the whole operation would be determined by progress in the slowest constituency. Under the existing arrangements there is a built-in delay of about 24 hours.  The new arrangement will eliminate that delay entirely.  The necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the counting process proceeds expeditiously in all constituencies.  The Deputy can be assured that the results of future presidential elections will be determined within a single day irrespective <Col N="1088" /> of the number of candidates contesting the election.  Deputy Doyle was also concerned that the voting would highlight regional differences in voting patterns.  The Deputy may be under a misapprehension here.  At the last presidential election the papers of eliminated candidates were transferred on a constituency by constituency basis and published on this basis, even though the operation was carried out centrally.  This aspect will not be affected in any way by the new counting arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle was concerned about the provision for mixing ballot papers in section 49 of the Bill.  The Deputy is correct in saying there is no question of transferring a surplus at a presidential election and the question of saving a deposit does not arise.  To this extent there is no need for a mixing process. Nonetheless the process that applies at all elections, including by-elections and referenda, has a useful role in enhancing the safeguards for secrecy of ballot.  It is important that there be consistency in procedures in so far as possible.  The mixing takes very little time.  It has been part of presidential election law since 1937 and no Returning Officer has recommended that it be dropped.  This is a matter on which the Deputy might heed her own advice: if it is not broken, do not mend it.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying that each Deputy who contributed welcomed the Bill and the programme of electoral reform of which it forms part.  It is clear there is very little problem with the content of the Bill.  The only reservation is that Deputies would prefer to be dealing with something else, and I can understand that.  What Deputies are saying is that this is a good, solid and worthwhile Bill but unfortunately it is not exciting, high profile or glamorous and provides no opportunity for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For them and their parents I sincerely hope this motion will force the Minister to take action just as a similar motion proposed by this party forced the Minister for Education in 1992 to make improvements in the higher education grants system.

The Minister's contribution could be divided into three parts, none of which addressed the motion before the House.  The Minister succeeded in ignoring the motion.  She gave a long dissertation on the history of higher education grants.  That is very interesting but it does not help those who cannot afford to attend third level colleges.  The Minister then outlined the present system and boasted of the improvements made over the last year without conceding that the system is inadequate and without admitting that it was the persistence of Fine Gael which resulted in the improvements to the system.  Worse still, when it came to future plans for the system we got the expected response that the Minister had set up an expert advisory group to carry out a fundamental review of the third level education grant support system. God help all those students as they wait desperately for a realistic and fair response from this Minister.  They are intelligent people and the last thing they want to hear is that there will be a fundamental review.  They know as well as we do that this means putting off any action.</P>
    <P>I was stunned to hear the Minister say that inequities probably exist in the system.  I can say without fear of contradiction that inequities exist and because of them students are denied access to third level education because they cannot afford it.  The discrimination against the PAYE workers and their families continues.  It is in their interests that we propose that income tax relief must be allowed to those who are not in receipt of higher education grants.  Does the Minister realise the burden that was imposed on these families when the controversial, regressive and unjustified decision was taken to means test the ESF grant?  The reality must be faced.  Modest income families do not qualify for third level education and although the Minister might not like it, the result is that students cannot, due to financial reasons, accept third level places for which they have <Col N="1092" /> worked so hard.  Income tax relief would be a major help to families in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that parents who fork out almost £4,000 a year for fees and maintenance for third level education students are not given income tax relief when such relief is allowed for dental treatment.  Does the Government believe that third level education is not as important as dental treatment?  Is investment in a child's future not as entitled to income tax relief as investment in certain types of dental treatment?  Both are essential and both should be allowed relief.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not deny that the system discriminates heavily against PAYE workers and places almost impossible financial burdens on families with modest incomes in providing third level education for their children.  The income eligibility limits introduced last year, praised as they were by the Minister, must be judged against the original limits which were scandalously low. Modest income families continue to be excluded from grant aid.  A family with two children earning one penny over £15,000 per annum will lose part of a grant.  Because of the deductions from that gross income such a family cannot possibly fund a student through college. We speak for these families, the families who provide the vast bulk of the income tax take, the PAYE sector.  These families should and must have a tax free allowance on expenditure on third level education.  It is extraordinary that tax relief is allowed on other major investments but not on education.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this motion and the contributions made to it the Minister will realise the enormous burden placed on families with modest incomes in order to provide third level education for their children.  Indeed, as other Members have pointed out, in many cases such families are forced to remortgage their homes or take out expensive loans.  In the interests of equity and fairness it is reasonable to propose that in such circumstances income tax relief should be allowed.</P>
    <P>I also want to support that part of <Col N="1093" /> the motion dealing with students who, through no fault of theirs, can only find a suitable course in colleges outside our jurisdiction.  Education should not be of a &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; quality; education, no matter where it is obtained should be for the well being of the students because their future will depend on that education.  It is for this reason I believe that maintenance payments should be paid to such students.  After all, none of us can deny that those same students would pursue courses in our colleges if they could succeed in obtaining places there.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this motion and support it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion and to support the amendment in the name of the Minister commending the Government for its commitment to continuing improvement of the higher education grants scheme and endorsing its initiatives in the promotion of social justice and equity.  In the past, the grants scheme was perceived almost invariably as a recognition of academic achievement and excellence and as a way of rewarding both. However, today, thankfully within a more enlightened society the grants scheme is regarded as one of the parameters within which successive Governments and society are judged as promoting equality of educational opportunity. Its main purpose is to ensure to the greatest possible extent that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his or her financial circumstances.  I am convinced that Members on all sides of the House share the laudable objective that improvements in grants and in student support must continue in order to achieve equality of access to third level education <Col N="1094" /> on the part of students of all social backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on recent significant improvements effected in the grants and student support areas &mdash; significant improvements on which Deputy Theresa Ahearn commented but to which she did not attach great significance &mdash; I want to comment on the amendment tabled in Deputy Quill's name, which reads:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;reform the 3rd level grants scheme to ensure complete transparency and equity in its operation, taking into account the criteria for inclusion of wealth and assets in determining income and eligibility&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>I quoted her amendment because I wanted to highlight at least one serious anomaly that obtains in the scheme.  I shall cite the case of a professional person, such as a teacher, with four children and an annual salary of £22,180.  I am thinking now of a specific case, I could quote other professionals but I am taking just one example with which I am familiar, as Deputy Jim Higgins will appreciate. That teacher generally will find that he will not have much surplus, disposable income at the end of the month.  Yet he will not qualify for eligibility for a third level grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking now as a Dublin Deputy but those to whom I have spoken, in such circumstances, particularly those residing in the country, experience great difficulty in sending their children to college where fees and maintenance costs are involved. Yet a sister of that teacher, in a very secure, semi-State job, married to a reasonably prosperous farmer, with a generous surplus, disposable income, with a reasonably good standard of living, can obtain grants for both fees and maintenance. That is but one example of many self-employed people &mdash; I am not digging into the self-employed but I must highlight this anomaly &mdash; who can use tax write-offs to create a disposable income enabling them to qualify for both fees and maintenance under the provisions of the grants scheme.  I do not blame the Minister or the scheme for that.  Rather <Col N="1095" /> I believe there is a need for much closer collaboration between the office of the inspector of taxes and the operators of the scheme in an endeavour to abolish this most unacceptable inequity, certainly most unacceptable to me and, I am sure, to the Minister.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine this anomaly very closely and endeavour to devise a formula to deal with the problem.  If I have an opportunity I shall refer later to the review group the Minister has established to examine the operations of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have examined paragraph (a) of the Fine Gael motion which reads:</P>
    <P>adopt the Fine Gael proposal to allow tax-free allowances to parents and guardians of students who do not qualify for grants and...</P>
    <P>which, while having certain merits, could be re-examined.  If the Fine Gael motion was passed in an unabridged or unamended form it would run totally contrary to the concept of equity.  I say that with no disrespect to Deputy Jim Higgins of whose overall commitment to education and educational policy I am well aware. Quite frankly, were the House to pass a tax-free allowance measure for students in third level education without amendment theoretically parents in receipt of a salary of say, £100,000 per annum, could be granted a tax-free allowance simply because their sons or daughters were attending a third level educational establishment. That would run totally contrary to the whole concept of equity in education, an aspect which may well have been missed.</P>
    <P>Despite the very significant improvements in greater access to third level education implemented recently, I might remind the House that last year, for example, there was an increase in the income eligibility limit of 40 per cent. Deputy Theresa Ahearn did not think it much but an increase of that amount in one year is very significant.  Indeed, the example most quoted to illustrate that point was referred to by the Minister last evening, that is the case of a family with <Col N="1096" /> an annual income of £15,000 with three dependent children.  That constitutes a significant move forward on the road to greater equity, greater access and equality of opportunity.  I know from my dealings with constituents that it is not sufficient, that more needs to be done within the short and medium term in this area.</P>
    <P>Another improvement effected last year was the passage of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1992, containing two special provisions for mature students, to whom the Minister referred last evening.  I will not go into them in detail but those improvements are significant and constitute a positive move forward on the road to addressing the inequities that have obtained to date.  I would encourage the Minister to continue along that road.  I know of her commitment and that contained in the Programme for Government. All I can do is continue to support that commitment and the unequivocal sentiments that have been expressed in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil oiread is Teachta amháin sa Dáil nach mbeadh i bhfábhar deontais breise do scoláirí tríú leibhéil.  Ach ag an am gcéanna, ní fólair breathnú ar an gceist go fuarchúiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I should like to say on this motion is that when it comes to money &mdash; which will always be scarce &mdash; we cannot come into this House one day and say we want more money for primary school buildings, on another day say we want money for secondary schools, on another day, money for third level, without putting some order, sequence or choices on the table.  Although I come from a background in which third level education was considered the norm, I make no bones about the fact that we must look first to primary education because that is where it all begins.  Indeed, it is at that level that certain sections of our population begin to fall behind and never catch up.  Therefore, resources for primary education must become and continue to <Col N="1097" /> be a priority.  I have never made any apology for so saying.</P>
    <P>A few things strike me as rather odd about this motion.  As my colleague, Deputy Liam Fitzgerald said, if one takes what is included in that motion, that is to grant tax-free allowances to those at present above the income limit, one would wind up making resources available to some very well-off people.  If there are choices to be made then we cannot afford to direct resources at very well-off people, in a willy-nilly, across-the-board fashion.  This would be wasting scarce resources which should be targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I fundamentally disagree with the motion which, if passed, would mean that a taxpayer in the highest tax band would reap greatest benefit from the provisions of that scheme.  In fact, I would go so far as to maintain that until we change to a tax credit system we cannot talk about tax-free allowances of this type.  It would be much more to the point to begin raising the income ceilings, thereby rendering more people eligible for grants.  Speaking as somebody for whom obtaining a Dáil salary meant paying the highest tax rate in his lifetime, I should say that I have spent more of my working life on the lower income level than on the higher income level.  Bearing in mind the £30,000 or whatever it is we receive annually, there are very many more people in less fortunate circumstances than I in our society.  If resources are scarce the available resources should be directed at those whose income is just above the limit to include them in the scheme.  Instead of trying to include everybody, including those with incomes of up to £200,000 or £500,000, the limit should be raised systematically.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have been made during the past few years.  For instance, the number of honours required has been reduced from four to two while the grant limits have been increased significantly. In addition mature students can now benefit while assistance is provided to those families with two or more children in third level education at the one time.  This represents significant progress but there <Col N="1098" /> are still anomalies in the system.  It therefore needs to be reviewed so as to remove the rough edges and to ensure that money is targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few suggestions. For example, certain items of expenditure, such as mortgage repayments, should be taken into account.  Where the amount of disposable income is small a case could be made that such expenditure should be taken into account in arriving at reckonable income.  Furthermore if the self-employed are benefiting under the system, this is due to inefficient tax assessment.  However, having said this, I know of self-employed persons who lost out because depreciation was not taken into account.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one peculiar anomaly in the system which the Minister should examine and it relates to the position in which 22 year old married persons find themselves.  If their spouse is on the dole and their father's or mother's income is above the limit they are considered to be a dependant of their father or mother, not their spouse.  That anomaly should be rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has always been the party concerned with education. Our schools undoubtedly need more resources.  Fianna Fáil has always and will continue to address the question of disadvantage in education.  The Government is continuing to advance further policies in this regard.  Fianna Fáil has constantly upgraded the system to the extent that Irish graduates are among the most highly educated in Europe.  They have travelled all over the world and gained employment in the most competitive of jobs markets.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment, is reiterated in the Programme for Government. In relation to student support the programme states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We anticipate that under the new Structural Funds extra resources will be available to assist with the cost of third level education.  On that basis it is the Government's intention to ensure that these additional resources are <Col N="1099" /> used to widen the access of all students to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity.  The promotion of social justice and equity will include continuing improvement of the Higher Education Grants Scheme to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his/her financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The number of students in third level education has trebled over the last 20 years, from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 50,000 in 1992-93.  If this trend continues it is expected that there will be over 100,000 students in third level education by the turn of the century.  This increase is reflected in the increasing proportion of the age group proceeding to third level &mdash; 20 per cent in 1989, over 40 per cent last year and close to 50 per cent by the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>Universities cater for the largest number of students, with 46,000 currently in third level education.  The growth in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology has been particularly dramatic.  In the last 13 years full-time student numbers have risen from 6,500 to 22,000.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure on education in 1993 will amount to £1.8 billion, or approximately 19 per cent of Government expenditure.  Third level education now accounts for about 22 per cent of the education budget.  Total student support, in respect of fees and maintenance grants, provided by the State this year will amount to approximately £84 million compared to a figure of £75 million in 1992.  This represents a 12 per cent increase in one year.  While these figures are welcome, they highlight the shortfall. Much work has been done, but much more needs to be done.  As I have said, we have probably the best education system in Europe, but not everyone can gain access to it.  This situation must be reversed.</P>
    <P>These are the very positive indicators of progress which highlight the Government's continuing commitment to the systematic expansion and development <Col N="1100" /> of our higher education system and underline the willing co-operation that has been forthcoming from all higher education institutions in maximising the use of existing facilities and resources. What we need to do now is build more facilities and provide more resources. The Minister must not rest on her laurels. She is to be congratulated on the work already done, but she must remember that there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>From the above information it can be clearly seen that overall developments in higher education have been excellent.  It is also evident that the major phase of expansion in the capacity of the third level system has already taken place, for which I congratulate the Minister and her Department.  However, I would like her to examine the grant system further in a more specific way.  The grant system as it stands at present serves only a small percentage of the students at third level colleges.  In 1992, 39,000 students received third level grants.  In Kerry, for example, Kerry County Council paid out £3,156,000 in student grants, excluding the ESF and vocational education committee grants.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to look into the possibility of obtaining a further allocation of Structural Fund moneys, as promised in the Programme for Government. This money could go towards achieving the ideal situation, where everybody wishing to obtain third level education could do so regardless of their financial status.  No person should be deprived for material reasons of their right to obtain third level education. These Structural Funds could also be used to provide more places in third level education.</P>
    <P>The PAYE taxpayer has been victimised so as far as third level education is concerned &mdash; the majority do not qualify for student grants even though they are footing the bill.  What we urgently need is the most equitable system possible to facilitate as many people as possible. What we cannot forget is that education is a fundamental right that everybody is entitled to.  The education system has changed dramatically from <Col N="1101" /> what applied in the days when I was growing up.  Everybody was then expected to leave the education system as quickly as possible to try to gain employment to help the family finances. I am delighted that this attitude is now defunct and that everyone realises that it is their right to continue in education for as long as they wish.  The only thing that is currently holding them back is the lack of financial support from the State.  It is for this reason that I am imploring the Minister to provide more State funding for third level places and grants.</P>
    <P>The decision to open up two new universities in Dublin and Limerick was welcomed universally.  This decision has proved to be a major success, with the two universities thriving and full to capacity.  This can be taken as an indication that the number of people denied access to universities is still far too high.</P>
    <P>In discussing student grants and education on a wider scale, we should not forget those students who are currently sitting their leaving and junior certificate examinations.  They are the future of this country and they are looking for their rights to attend third level colleges. However, the current points system is not encouraging them; it puts the students under too much pressure.  We should put a system in place as a matter of urgency under which students would be welcomed to third level education and not frightened off, which is what happens at present under the current system.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister to consider the suggestions I have made.  I do not expect her, as she stated last night, to wave a magic wand and produce streamlined procedures overnight; but I want her to implement as many improvements as possible at the earliest possible date.  I hope that next year leaving certificate students will not be put under the same pressure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Labour Party will continue to press for access to third level education to be extended on an equal basis to all sections of society.  If one <Col N="1102" /> looks at the socio-economic background of the students currently attending third level educational institutions, one will see that the situation has got worse rather than better in recent years.  The imbalance has worsened to the extent that less than 5 per cent of third level students come from families where the parents are unskilled.  This anomaly has continued despite the introduction of grants during the seventies, their extension during the eighties and the improvements last year. Educationists know that this imbalance can only be redressed by improving the education facilities available and the family circumstances of the bottom 20 per cent in our society.  Otherwise any extension of the grant system will simply pass them by.</P>
      <P>Cherishing all the children of the nation equally requires, in terms of resources, positive discrimination in favour of children from the lower socio-economic groups.  I am glad the Minister has placed emphasis on intervening on behalf of disadvantaged children.  This emphasis, which is long overdue, has been generally welcomed.  The appropriate financial measures needed to increase the participation rate of children from the lower socio-economic groups in third level education must be imbued with the basic principle of social equity. Unfortunately, the motion is defective in that respect.  The motion proposes, in effect, to increase Exchequer funding through tax free allowances for parents who fall outside the existing income limit for student grants.  As Deputy Theresa Ahern said, the objective should be to eliminate the inequities in the current grant system.  I fear that this motion would only make those inequities worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are genuine about allocating more resources for third level grants the correct approach is to progressively increase the income limit and the payment of the higher level of student grant. All third level places involve a high level of subsidy by the State which benefits both the country and the individual concerned by equipping them with the necessary skills to secure decent employment in the labour market.  There is a clear <Col N="1103" /> correlation between a student's level of skills and qualifications and his or her success in the labour market.</P>
    <P>If our Exchequer position and national debt were not such serious problems the Labour Party would be in favour of extending the grant system across the board and dispensing with all means testing. Of course, this would mean that grants would be funded entirely out of general taxation &mdash; a matter which would have to be addressed by this House &mdash; and the current claw back from families with up to three children with incomes above the £15,000 threshold would be abolished.  However, it is acknowledged that tax free allowances automatically benefit those on the higher levels of income most.  A more practical and equitable approach would be to raise the basic income limit to approximately £20,000, with a subsequent widening of the tax bands.  If we are to focus on the greatest priority in this area &mdash; this is the stated aim of most Members &mdash; we must raise the level of grants, the incentive low income families require to allow their children to make the breakthrough into third level education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment by the Minister of the advisory group which will examine the criteria for eligibility for third level grants from the point of view of ensuring equity in the financing of higher education.  A number of individuals and groups have made detailed, thorough and deserving submissions to the advisory group.  I look forward to the early publication of a report by that group.  I am confident that action will be taken promptly on foot of that report.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Fine Gael motion has much merit.  The number of students seeking third level places is likely to exceed the number of places available within the next ten years. Enrolments at primary level are falling and the student population bulge is now in the 12-14 age group.  This means that the number of students seeking places will exceed the number of places available during the next ten years.  The unemployment situation will make the demand <Col N="1104" /> for graduate, technical and post-graduate courses more necessary.  In order to accommodate Irish students who take up places in other EC countries we should extend the grant system.  Under EC regulations Irish students who attend colleges in other member states must be treated the same as students from the member state in which they attend college. However, as we know from many students who take up places in Britain there are no maintenance grants available for these Irish students.  The Minister should look at this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Quill in her contribution last night.  The inclusion of wealth and assets in the eligibility criteria is essential if the perceived inequity in the percentage of third level students from non-PAYE backgrounds is to be rectified.  It is particularly galling for me as a TD to have to tell workers caught in the PAYE-PRSI net that the children of people with assets in excess of £250,000 can receive a full grant because of their parents' income tax returns.  The suggestion made during the general election campaign that free third level education should be made available to all would only be feasible if all existing covenanting arrangements were abolished.  The cost of doing this would be in excess of £50 million.  While this suggestion is not totally prohibitive, obviously it would require increased funding.  The thrust of the first part of the Fine Gael motion is unintentionally regressive.  I would prefer to go down the route of ensuring free access to third level education through some means other than additional taxation allowances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated clearly that one of her priorities is to improve support and access to education.  The measures she has taken at primary level will hopefully mean that more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds will eventually be faced with the problem of how they will support themselves while attending a third level institution.  At present many of these students do not complete secondary education.  As a person who has worked with children <Col N="1105" /> who left school at an early age, I am glad the Minister is making the primary sector a priority.  She has taken clear action in regard to capital funding for primary education, increased the capitation levels for primary education and taken the first steps in substantially improving the number of remedial teachers allocated to primary schools, particularly schools in rural areas which had been neglected for many years.  This type of action, together with the review which will be carried out on foot of the report of the expert advisory group, will increase participation in all levels of the education system.</P>
    <P>In regard to administration, I should like the Minister to publish the scheme for third level grants early, make clear information available to parents and students from this stage onwards and provide the application forms at an early stage so that students may apply for grants, assemble the necessary information, collate it and check it as soon as they have completed their leaving certificate examination.  This would avoid the problems which arose last year.  The system was improved last year for various families and mature students but other people were crucified by having to compile the necessary information in such a short time.  Will the Minister have this matter addressed in time for this year's round of grant applications?</P>
    <P>I cannot support the Fine Gael motion because the proposed measures are regressive rather than progressive.  I commend the Minister's amendment and I know that the process of improvement which has started in third level grants will continue during her term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore.  As other Deputies have pointed out, the first part of the Fine Gael motion would be regressive.  I would be one of those who would benefit from this Fine Gael motion as my children in third level education do not qualify for grants, but I do not believe that I should benefit from additional resources for third level or in any area of education.  Any additional resources should benefit those <Col N="1106" /> on low and middle incomes.  While a Deputy's income is not extraordinarily high, it enables us to cope with the cost of third level education.</P>
      <P>If we introduced a system of funding at third level which was based on tax relief on parent's income for those whose children would not otherwise qualify for grants, we would be increasing the disparities that already exist at third level and this would increase the gap between the opportunities available for the children of skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled workers and those of the salaried, managerial and professional class and employers.  The Higher Education Authority report, which was published late last year, pointed out yet again that there is a major disparity between the children of working class families and those on higher incomes entering university.  This has highlighted the need for a major review of the current grants system.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced a body to do that and I hope its report will be made available quite soon.  I do not know if it is possible to introduce major changes in the coming academic year but I hope some changes can be made in October so that we begin to address the disparities that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously money alone is not the only reason that some students do not have the opportunity to go on to third level education.  Clearly the financial burden is a major problem for parents, some of whom live in my own constituency.  Some young people who would be excellent do not get the opportunity to go on to third level education because their parents are struggling to maintain them and I believe that any additional resources given to third level education should go to them. I would be reluctant to allow a system where tax free allowances would be used to assist those with children going to third level education.  The reality is that those on the higher marginal rates of tax benefit most.  That is how income tax relief operates in relation to VHI and mortgage interest relief.  Essentially, as a society we are subsidising in a range of areas people who in many respects do not require subsidisation.  I am not arguing <Col N="1107" /> that there are not people on low enough incomes and paying tax who may benefit somewhat from income tax relief in this area, but I do not think that help should be given in the form of income tax relief. It should be done instead by reforming the grants system itself.</P>
    <P>I believe that access to third level education starts at the pre-school stage.  I come from a large family with no tradition of third level education.  I did not pursue third level education and of my late mother's 50 odd grandchildren only two have gone on to third level education. This is not because the other grandchildren were not bright and could not have benefited from further education, or indeed that their parents could not afford to send their children to college, but it was not the tradition to go on to third level education.  Because of their social background and culture, working class families do not see third level education as a means of acquiring a job or enhancing job prospects.  It is not only a question of ensuring there are adequate grants.  We have to ensure that even before children go to formal school they have adequate access to preschool.  Based on the available research, there is no doubt that children who go to preschool have a major advantage over those who do not, and having gone through some form of preschool education the children are streets ahead of the primary school pupils who have not.  That is an area where money could be spent, particularly in the disadvantaged areas about which the Minister has already indicated her concern.</P>
    <P>Resources could also be put into reducing class sizes in primary schools.  I do not want to go into too much detail because I omitted to ask at the beginning to be allowed to share my time with Deputy Paul McGrath.</P>

      <P>The quality of some school buildings hinders the capacity of children to benefit from their <Col N="1108" /> excellent teachers.  I draw the Minister's attention to the Holy Spirit School, Ballymun, which sent a deputation to her office in recent weeks.  This school, which is 25 years old, is literally falling down around the teachers' heads and there is an urgent need to have it refurbished. Everyone in the country knows that Ballymun is a disadvantaged area.</P>
      <P>At second level, schools unofficially select their students by one means or another.  Sometimes the parents self-select the schools because they have particular views on the skills they wish their children to acquire.  Unless mixed ability pupils are encouraged at second level, we will continue to have a large number of students in disadvantaged areas who do not achieve their full potential.  The whole question of amalgamating schools on the basis of numbers falling below certain levels is one which the Minister should seriously consider.  There is an example of this in my own constituency in the comprehensive schools which, in terms of the criteria applied, fall below the numbers required for maintaining separate comprehensive senior and junior schools.  Given the socio-economic problems in that area it would be a major error in terms of preparing children for later education to amalgamate those schools and create a situation where children who are already disadvantaged would be further disadvantaged because of class size, lack of technical classes and so on.  A range of areas needs to be addressed to ensure that an imbalance does not exist at third level as between one socio-economic group and another. I am not arguing that the sons and daughters of farmers or the sons and daughters of salaried parents should not go to university. Clearly they should, but as a democracy we have to ensure that every child in our society has equal access to third level education where they have the ability to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the competitive aspect and the points system.  Many children go through most of their second level education scared stiff that they will not be able to obtain the necessary points to gain access to a particular course or to <Col N="1109" /> get into a third level institution.  Clearly there have to be some entry criteria but they should be the same for all students. We need seriously to address the damage caused to many young people as a result of competition in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>There are many things I would like the Minister for Education to do in the area of education.  Giving tax free allowances for third level education is not one of them.  I would urge her to ensure that the recommendations from the expert group are brought forward as quickly as possible so that we will begin to see some change in how our children gain access to third level education.</P>

      <P>As I listened to this debate I thought there was a possibility that we would win the vote because a number of Government speakers indicated their satisfaction with the proposals brought forward by Deputy Jim Higgins. I was beginning to think there were some conversions and that we would have an historic occasion but, unfortunately, each one concluded by saying that they wanted change, that the system was inequitable but, alas they were not ready for change just yet and suggested it be postponed to another day.  Deputy Liam Fitzgerald outlined very clearly that a teacher's salary would not be adequate to send somebody to third level education.  He went along with the the bones of what Deputy Higgins proposed but said, &ldquo;let us have it but not just yet&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy John O'Leary referred to the need for third level grants and said that the PAYE sector is victimised in relation to third level grants.  I was convinced that Deputy O'Leary would cross the floor tonight and vote with us but, unfortunately, he shied away.  Perhaps he was preparing a script for the local newspapers which he could circulate, omitting the last sentence in which he said he was not able on this occasion to vote along those lines or to vote for those changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher was in favour of the second part of this motion and felt strongly <Col N="1110" /> that students who have to go to Britain or elsewhere should qualify for grants in the ordinary way.  Perhaps he will cross party lines with one leg and stay back with the other.  I do not know how he will vote this evening.  The media in his own area of Tullamore will report that he almost voted to give a fairer system to students but not just yet.</P>

      <P>We will let the hair split. I welcome this opportunity to debate the present inequitable system of providing grants to students of third level colleges. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on initiating this debate and on the excellent manner in which he introduced it.  His contribution, in which he outlined the nature of the problem and the real financial difficulties experienced by PAYE workers who are endeavouring to educate their children, is in stark contrast to the Minister's reply, in which she said:</P>
      <P>I fully accept the need for urgent action in this area.  Not only must the general terms and conditions of the schemes be improved but their actual delivery has also to be streamlined ... and I will await the expert group's recommendations in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the matter is so urgent &mdash; and she acknowledges it is &mdash; why not accept Deputy Higgins' proposals even on an interim basis?  On many occasions the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated she was setting up an inter-departmental group to review the whole system.  There were similar promises from former Ministers for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan and Deputy Davern.  In fairness to Deputy Brennan, he introduced improvements in the system.  The Minister has promised us that the expert group is reviewing third level grants but are we to continue to wait?  Why not accept Deputy Higgins' proposals and put them into operation <Col N="1111" /> until the expert group report?  When the group recommends a system better than that proposed by Deputy Higgins, then we should be in a position to go back to the Minister's proposals.  In the meantime we must not allow people to suffer and to be out of pocket.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign last November Fianna Fáil promised free third level education for everybody.  Was this a genuine proposal or was it simply an election promise made in a last desperate effort to win support?  The person who made that promise to the electorate was the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan.  He should come before the House tonight and explain why he did so and why his party when they subsequently got into Government did not live up to that promise.  I wonder how he will vote tonight.  Will he do what his party tells him?</P>
    <P>At the same time the Labour Party promised to work towards basing income limits for higher education grants on net rather than gross income.  They also promised that take home pay would be the criterion for assessing eligibility for medical cards.  Despite the fact that Labour Party members are Ministers in each of those two Departments &mdash; Education and Health &mdash; neither promise has yet been implemented.  While I realise it is still early days in the Government's term of office they should be moving in that direction and we should have definite signs that something is about to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, debating an education motion introduced by Deputy Jim Higgins in July 1992 agreed that PAYE workers were discriminated against.  He said that the proposals by then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan did no go far enough and that more needed to be done.  He was in Opposition on that <Col N="1112" /> occasion but I wonder how he will vote tonight.</P>
    <P>The cost of sending a student to a third level college is of the order of £4,500. I speak from experience as I have two children in third level education and I am aware of the tremendous burden of putting somebody through college.  I estimate that it costs in the region of £4,500 per child per annum to cover fees, books, accommodation and so on.  That is a large sum of money and is difficult to find.  On a TD's salary one will manage it but many people on £16,000, £17,000, or £18,000 a year are doing likewise and I admire them for it.  They are doing so under extreme difficulty, frequently having to remortgage their houses.  This cannot be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>Many speakers on the Government side indicated that the proposals put forward tonight are a gift to the well-off and that both persons earning £20,000 per annum and £100,000 per annum will benefit to the same extent.  We must clarify what exactly is involved.  Deputy Higgins' motion proposes that people who do not qualify for a grant should be entitled to write off the expenses against their income tax, which will amount to approximately £1,650 per annum.  It will not be any more or less; it will amount to approximately £31 per week. Although we would prefer if the super rich paid for their education, that is the extent of the benefit, and many super rich people receive grants anyway because of the way the system operates.  I am aware of a self-employed person in my area who had great difficulty in obtaining a grant for his daughter.  Following much correspondence between that person's accountant and the county council, eventually he was given a grant for his daughter who high-tailed it off to college. However, it was disturbing to note that that young lady arrived at college on her first day in a new car which her father bought for her to assist her in getting to and from college.  That is an example of how a self-employed person can manipulate <Col N="1113" /> the system in order to get a grant.  I am aware of another self-employed professional with three children who qualified for grants in quick succession.  That man was able to buy a house in the university town for his children so they could live there while at college.  How was he able to do that and at the same time receive grants for his three children? There must be something wrong with a system that allows for such an injustice. At the same time any soldier, garda, teacher, factory worker or others earning more than £15,000 per annum will not qualify for a grant and their children might not be able to attend college as a result.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion tabled by Deputy Higgins and I hope that as many Members as possible will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins for putting down this motion especially at a time when students are considering their options for next September following completion of their examinations.  Unfortunately, many students will not be able to pursue careers of their choice because of our unfair and inequitable higher education grants scheme.</P>
      <P>It is ironic in the year the Government has no difficulty in granting a tax amnesty to the rich that it is unable to give modest tax relief to hard-pressed PAYE parents. It is even conceivable that some of the people who will benefit from the amnesty have received higher education grants already.  It must be an embarrassment to the Minister's party that on the one hand it can allow many wealthy people that great concession and on the other deprive many families of a tax concession on their hard earned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rising cost of keeping students at university and other third level colleges is causing severe financial hardship to many parents.  The burden on parents of middle income families in particular in maintaining students away from home is intolerable.  Parents who are not entitled <Col N="1114" /> to fee subvention or maintenance grants are under great financial pressure and in many cases must forego their life savings or resort to second mortgages or loans to keep their children in college.  Those are mainly middle aged parents who have worked hard for 20 to 25 years and made substantial tax contributions to the State. The financial burden is particularly difficult where students are required to live away from home to pursue their third level studies.  The total cost to parents of a typical four year college degree course is approximately £20,000, roughly £5,000 per annum.  The financial burden is alarming as those costs must be met from income after the parents have paid income tax, mortgage payments, life insurance premia, VHI contributions, service charges and all the other routine costs of rearing and maintaining a family. If two children from such families wish to go to college, the position becomes impossible.  Our higher education grants system needs a radical overhaul.  The proposal in this motion by Fine Gael to allow tax free allowances to parents and guardians of students who do not qualify for grants will help to ease the burden considerably on that sector.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and McGrath referred to the promise made by the Minister's party during the election campaign. I appreciate that it still has some time to implement its promises, but it should start making an effort in that direction.  I will draw the Minister's attention to the words of the Fianna Fáil manifesto at that time.  Indeed, according to a statement issued by the Minister here on 11 March, he dissociated himself from the words of that manifesto by stating that it would be unfair to make such a commitment.  In its election manifesto the Labour Party promised to work towards a position where the income limit for higher education grants would be based on net income rather than gross income.  Many parents voted for the Labour Party based on that commitment. Deputy Costello must feel ashamed of <Col N="1115" /> the Labour policies in this regard, because I frequently heard him speak of the intolerable burden on middle income parents.  On many occasions he emphasised the inequitable grants system we operated.  When the Fianna Fáil Party realised that the Labour commitment struck a chord with the parents of this country, not to be outmanoeuvred before the election, it promised free third level education for all.  That commitment has been put firmly on the backburner.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by Deputy Higgins, the Minister reneged on his election promise in this House in March last.  That is one of the many promises his party has reneged on since the publication of the Fianna Fáil manifesto last October.  I appeal to the Minister to take Deputy Higgins's suggestions on board and consider his arguments carefully.  In talking about equality of opportunity applying to all children, we are talking about children from middle income groups who are prevented from pursuing careers of their choice at present because of the inequitable higher education grants system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion put down by Deputy Higgins, some aspects of which deserve merit, but others do not. I consider the issues raised during this debate on the higher education grants scheme as an indication of the wide interest in what undoubtedly is an important area affecting the lives of many of our people.  The commitment in the Programme for Government to widen access for all students to third level education in the interests of justice and equity is the policy basis for the development of a fully comprehensive student support programme.  Such a programme will address the concerns raised by Deputy Higgins in making this proposal to grant tax free allowances to parents and guardians of students who do not qualify for grants.  I do not see that proposal for tax free allowances as a move <Col N="1116" /> in the direction of a fairer and more equitable distribution of resources in the area of third level student support.  I am happy to confirm that the higher education grants scheme does cover recognised third level courses in Northern Ireland.  I mention this lest any confusion arose as a result of the debate last night.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of extending the higher education grants scheme to Irish students in the United Kingdom, the Minister pointed out last night that this is essentially a question of identifying priorities for Exchequer resources.  The Minister might further consider this issue in the context of the ongoing review of the grants scheme.  It is an issue that merits careful consideration.  It would be of considerable benefit to have grants extended to students attending third level institutions in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill's amendment calls for the reform of the third level grants scheme to ensure complete transparency and equity in its operation, taking into account the criteria for the inclusion of wealth and assets in determining income eligibility.  The Minister explained last night her reasons for setting up the expert advisory group.  I can see that there is a temptation for the Opposition to dismiss the setting up of this group.  I understand it comprises some very eminent experts with impeccable credentials.  Although there is some concern that the setting up of another committee whose report will eventually be consigned to the dust-laden shelves in the Department of Education is a long-fingering exercise, I note the Minister's stated determination to publish this report and I welcome the transparency and openness of her approach.</P>
      <P>We should await the outcome of that report.  The remit of the expert advisory group enables it, in the context of means assessment, to focus directly on the issues of equity and financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and to examine the case for the inclusion of wealth and assets in determining income eligibility for student grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Deputy Gilmore's amendment emphasies equal access to third level education for students from low income backgrounds. The Minister stated last night, and previously at Question Time, that by far the most significant improvement in 1992 in the higher education grants scheme was the 40 per cent improvement in eligibility income limits.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to weigh carefully all that has been said in this debate.  In the last analysis, however, it comes down to making the best possible use of the limited resources available.  Given the substantial and continuing expansion of student numbers in the third level education sector it seems that we would need almost infinite resources to provide the kind of supports which we would wish our students.  Unfortunately, this cannot be done in the foreseeable future.  Choices will have to be made and priorities established.  The key issue is to ensure that resources are used to optimum effect in implementing the policy objectives laid down by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the steps taken to date by the Minister and the Government to redress inequitable funding in the education area generally and specifically the steps she has taken to ensure the promotion of social justice and equity in the higher education grants scheme and improved organisational arrangements for the delivery of that scheme.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for bringing this before the Dáil. This is one of the major issues for middle income families many of whom, because of the cost of third level education, have become the new poor.  Some changes were made but they were by no means enough.  Rural parents especially have to pay not only the college fees for their <Col N="1118" /> children but the cost of maintenance away from home plus bus fares, etc.  They are the worst hit.</P>
      <P>There is no question that the promises made before the last election had some bearing on the fact that there are 101 Deputies on the other side of the House. Free education for all was promised. When we put forward a realistic proposal we were laughed at by many parents because they said it was not enough. Today they would be very happy to see this proposal put through this House and get acceptance from all sides.  It would be a major breakthrough as many parents would get some relief.</P>
      <P>The ESF grants which were available up to a year ago are now gone.  Were it not for the fact that many of my constituents were able to get their fees paid at colleges in Northern Ireland such as Queen's University, Jordanstown, Coleraine and McGee they would have very little chance of getting a third level education.  I sincerely thank the colleges in the North for giving us in the Border counties that opportunity.  There are other colleges in Northern Ireland where the fees are not paid and we should work to get those fees paid as well.  I have in mind agricultural colleges, the college in Enniskillen and many others.  It is unfair that some students who want to travel North for geographical and social reasons cannot do so because of those restrictions.</P>
      <P>We have to be realistic.  Some parents have had to give up reasonable jobs and opt for social welfare because otherwise their children would not get third level education.  This is a claim that I can stand over.  When both parents are working in ordinary jobs they have serious problems if more than one child wants to go on to third level education.  Some of my neighbours' children have to go to London and elsewhere during the summer holidays to work, sometimes in two jobs, in the hope that they might be able to stay in college for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal, put forward by Deputy <Col N="1119" /> Jim Higgins, is a very worthwhile one.  If it were discussed at our council meeting in Monaghan, I am quite sure that the majority, regardless of party, would back it.  I beg this House to treat it seriously. If it is voted down tonight, as I am quite sure it will be from comments I have had, the Minister might at least take the spirit of our discussion to heart and take steps quickly to rectify the present impossible situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody who contributed to this important debate on the need for improvements in the higher education grants system.  I particularly thank the Minister for her courtesy in coming to listen to the debate.  It is a rarity for a Minister to come into the House on both nights in Private Members' time.  Deputy John Browne spoke with great insight and feeling as a parent and a teacher.  Deputy Róisín Shortall felt that the emphasis should be on primary education.  That is a point echoed by Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív.  The reality is that at third level we now have a large number of students, more than 40,000, who are not receiving any grants. As Deputy Crawford said, the majority of those students are coming from the new poor &mdash; those in the middle income bracket.  Two years ago, Deputies Quill and Theresa Ahearn produced an excellent breakdown in relation to the anomalies and inequities of the existing scheme.  Deputy Liam Fitzgerald could not have put the case better, as Deputy McGrath said, he was basically agreeing with us but could not vote for the motion. He, like a number of others, had concerns that the rich and the super rich would benefit from this scheme.  As Deputy McGrath said, we are not talking about anything here that would in any way whet the appetites of the super rich. We are talking about a maximum tax relief of £31 which would make a great difference to the thousands of middle income families who are clinging by their <Col N="1120" /> finger nails trying to survive and put their children through third level colleges at the same time.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mó bhuíochas a ghabh-áil don Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív as ucht an méid a dúirt sé.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McGrath said, I wonder which side Deputy O'Leary was on because he made the strongest possible case for the measure Fine Gael is proposing this evening.  I thank Members for the amendments they tabled.  I do not doubt the spirit of their intentions and we have heard those views before in relation to reform and review.  Deputies on some sides of the House ideologically seem to have some hang-up in relation to tax free allowances.  I do not have such a hang-up and tonight we are providing a measure in relation to such allowances. We floated this measure in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Monday.  I received seven letters yesterday and 49 letters today in support of that measure from classic working class families who are caught in the middle income trap and they are there to stay by virtue of the existing system.  I am sure I will have many more letters tomorrow because it is obvious that people are desperate when they contemplate the prospect of next September when no grants will be provided.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath who pointed to the ambivalence on the other side of the House about what they would like to do but, unfortunately, cannot do.  Deputy Deenihan, the spokesperson on youth affairs, was inundated by requests from student organisations and youth groups to address the crying need to iron out the inequities in the system once and for all. I am sure Deputy Costello who was president of the ASTI has an insight in relation to the problems in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crawford lives in a Border county and understands the problem.  He spoke with great feeling about the new poor.  People who live close to the Border tend to gain access to facilities on the other side of the Border.  I thank Deputies <Col N="1121" /> on all sides of the House for their contributions.</P>
    <P>There are now 63,000 students sitting the leaving certificate.  I imagine the parents of the majority of those students are extremely disappointed that election promises of both parties in Government in relation to changes in the higher education grant scheme have been reneged upon and that an improvement in regard to access and equity promised in the Programme for Government has not been forthcoming.  I am disappointed with the Minister's contribution in this regard last night.  The first ten pages of her speech gave an historical analysis of the present system.  Only the last three pages of her speech referred to the nub of the matter and it still was not fully addressed.</P>
    <P>Most of the State systems operating in this country are designed deliberately to discriminate heavily against the PAYE sector.  The outturn for 1992 shows that of a total income tax take of £3.5 billion the PAYE sector contributed £2.7 billion or 88 per cent.  However, a survey I carried out last year revealed that every local authority which administers higher education grants showed that of the total number of first time entrants to university who were approved for higher education grants only 35 per cent, one in every three, came from the PAYE sector.  The PAYE sector ends up paying 88 per cent of the tax take and only obtains one-third of the grants.  The Minister told the House last night that the cost to the State of the higher education grant scheme was £8.4 billion and yet the PAYE sector receives only one-third of that figure.  As Deputy Fitzgerald said, we do not want to pull down any group in order to pull up another group.  We are trying to level the playing field to ensure there is equality, access and fair play for a segment of society that pays for everything and gets nothing in return.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the sentiments of Deputies Quill and De Rossa.  They are both seeking reform taking into consideration the various criteria and elements required. <Col N="1122" /> However, I would point out to the Deputies and to Deputy Gallagher a new Member, that a former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made promises that were not kept.  Another former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, promised reform would be undertaken and that there would be a root and branch shake out and that did not happen.  The former Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, also promised there would be a root and branch reform but that did not come about.  However, Deputy Brennan means-tested the ESF grants.  Every student who entered a regional technical college last year was means-tested and seven out of ten students who received ESF grants the previous year lost them this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher advocated progressive increases in income limits.  Last night I indicated in my model of the family earning an income of £15,000 that having regard to payments in respect of income tax, £5,000 mortgage repayments, PRSI and an income levy of one per cent, the family would be left with a net disposable income of the princely amount of £117 per week and yet this family would be disqualified from a higher education grant.  The only option open to that family is heavy borrowing which causes misery in their domestic life.  It is fine to talk about reviewing the higher education system as promised by the Minister or reforming the higher education grant system as sought by the Progressive Democrats, but the higher education system is fundamentally warped, unjust, inequitable and flawed and by reforming it one would be tinkering with it at the edges.  The existing system needs to be scrapped and a start should be made from a base of social justice and equity.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats appear to have a hang-up in relation to providing relief for the PAYE sector by way of tax free allowances and this would seem to be shared by Deputy De Rossa also. However, without tax relief for mortgage <Col N="1123" /> repayments many more houses than the 3,000 repossessed last year would now be repossessed.  The tax free allowance for health costs has reduced hospital waiting lists and considerably reduced the pressure on the already overstretched public health service.  Deputy De Rossa referred to tax free allowances in relation to the inequity of the system, but if we did not have tax free allowances many of the middle income families could not afford orthodontic treatment for their children. I have no doubt that the PAYE sector who are scraping to keep their children in third level education do not mind one whit where the assistance comes from for their education as long as they receive it, whether it is in the form of a tax free allowance, increased grants, etc.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot accept amendments from Deputies opposite.  This is a <Col N="1124" /> clear motion to make available a tax free allowance which will yield up to £31 per week and which would make a crucial difference to parents.  It is clear, simple, effective, prescriptive and would make a major difference to the thousands of middle income families for whom the prospect of college next year is not a pleasure but a nightmare.  I urge this House to take this part of the motion on board together with the other part in relation to making higher education maintenance grants available to our students in the UK and other EC countries. If those countries are hosting our children in their cities and towns, educating them in their universities and paying their fees, the least we should do as a social obligation is to provide those students with maintenance grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this debate is very sensitive.  We all realise there is a serious problem with terrorists moving into and out of Britain and that there must be tremendous vigilance to ensure that these people do not travel at will, carrying arms and explosives which endanger the lives of the general public and security forces.  But from my observations over a number of years travelling to and from Britain there is a number of immigration officers at ports and airports in Britain whose attitude is not conducive to good relations between the people of Ireland and the British authorities.</P>
      <P>Time and time again I have seen decent, hard working people going about their business being harassed and humiliated at various points of entry and exit in Britain.  I ask the Minister to take up this matter with his counterpart and also to have it raised by the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Group, who meet frequently to discuss security matters and matters of mutual interest between Ireland and England.  The main area of abuse of authority is at Heathrow Airport where people are repeatedly humiliated by having their personal belongings put on public display.  Whether they be in a hold-all, suitcase or briefcase, the contents are just thrown onto a table for everybody to see, and that is not good enough.  Surely people are entitled to privacy in such circumstances.  They are entitled to be treated in a humane and proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are bad eggs, as it were, in the British system, as we have seen during the past 20 years through the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four, Maguire family and Judith Ward cases, the people concerned, whether they be the <Col N="1127" /> Judiciary, in the police force, the prison force or the immigration service are not suitable for the positions they hold.  I had a particularly humiliating experience while passing through Glasgow Airport recently when an immigration officer, upon learning I was an Irish politician travelling on legitimate parliamentary business from a meeting of the Council of Europe, suddenly became very hostile and particularly unpleasant.  I am not pleading my own case here tonight but just giving it as an example.  Thousands of Irish people are every year treated like criminals at airports such as Heathrow. Birmingham used to have a reputation of similar proportions.  It was a place where Irish people would be hassled irrespective of whether they were innocent.</P>
    <P>This attitude seems to pervade the British establishment and must stop.  It gives sustenance and succour to terrorist groups and their sympathisers.  Genuine people must be safeguarded.  That type of humiliating treatment must stop.  If people have to be searched it should be done in private.  The interrogation should be done by responsible fair minded people who do not have a grudge against the Irish race.  There is a certain percentage of the immigration authorities who seem to have it in for us.  It is not good enough.  I do not wish to be unduly harsh as this is a sensitive issue, but I want to see some action taken.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter this evening.  I have noted carefully the points he has made and I will ensure that the difficulties which he encountered on this occasion are brought to the attention of the British authorities through the Embassy in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too worried about my own case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is not <Col N="1128" /> too worried about his personal experience, although it was a harrowing one, and he has quite rightly referred to the broader question.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Embassy officials in London regularly deal with queries and offer advice to persons travelling to and from Britain who have encountered problems, usually as a result of the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  These have on occasions included complaints about the attitude of individual immigration and police officers.  Where abuses involving Irish citizens are alleged to have occurred these are immediately raised with the relevant British authorities through the Embassy in London.  In raising such cases emphasis is laid on the need for the British authorities to ensure that where additional security measures are required these are carried out in a courteous and even-handed manner and with the minimum disruption necessary to the travelling public.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government closely monitors the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act as it affects the Irish community living in Britain and Irish citizens travelling to and from Britain.  The Government is particularly conscious, given the nature of the provisions regarding the examination at ports and airports in Britain of persons travelling to or from Ireland, of the possibility of the Act being applied in a discriminatory manner.  The Government has consistently made clear to the British authorities our concern that the legislation should be applied even-handedly and that abuses should be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is determined to ensure that the rights of Irish citizens are fully respected in this regard and the British authorities are in no doubt as to the Government's position in this respect.  We have, for example, conveyed our views on several occasions to Lord Colville in connection with his annual review of the Prevention of Terrorism <Col N="1129" /> Act.  For its part the Embassy in London continues to follow closely developments in individual cases and to offer consular assistance wherever this is required.  It also ensures that close contact is maintained with the British authorities on all matters arising in this area.  The House can be assured that the Government will continue to monitor carefully the range of issues relevant to the operation of this legislation.  We will continue to raise this matter at the appropriate levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Athlone (Westmeath) Courthouse.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter in this Adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>Athlone is one of the largest centres of population in the midlands with a hinterland stretching for ten to 15 miles in all directions and it can boast of most of the usual facilities: a good industrial base, an Army barracks which employs 1,500 people, a large force of gardaí and the examination section of the Department of Education.  Add to this a regional technical college, five second level schools and all the usual cultural and leisure facilities and one begins to understand the importance of Athlone in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, for the past ten months Athlone has had no courthouse.  At that time the facilities at Athlone Courthouse were appalling.  The acoustics in the courtroom made it impossible to hear what was happening unless one had the hearing of Superman.  There were no facilities for consultations, so barristers, solicitors and clients huddled together in small groups in the courtroom or on the street, conducting their business in full view of anyone passing by.  For family law matters there was nowhere that a client could go to discuss his or her case with legal advisers in any kind of privacy. <Col N="1130" /> The situation was very intimidating for any woman wishing to take a barring order against her husband.  There was no public telephone in the Athlone Courthouse.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Trinity Sittings of the Circuit Court in July, 1992, Circuit Judge Matthew Deery stated that he would not sit in Athlone Courthouse again until the facilities were improved to an acceptable level.  This lead was rapidly followed by District Justice Jim O'Sullivan and Athlone District Court now sits at Moate Courthouse ten miles away and the most recent session of Athlone Circuit Court sat in Mullingar, 30 miles away.</P>
    <P>Because of the closure of the courthouse a large cavalcade of solicitors, clients, gardaí, witnesses and court officials leaves Athlone every Tuesday morning and makes its way to Moate for the hearing of Athlone District Court cases.  The inconvenience to all concerned is a major source of irritation when Athlone Courthouse lies almost derelict.  For those who have no transport it means a taxi journey both ways, and for the professionals involved there is the time lost in travelling which could be productively used in another fashion.</P>
    <P>An excellent proposal was presented by Westmeath County Council to the Department of Justice which would involve building a new purpose-built courthouse, incorporating free legal aid offices, a family law centre and the Department of Justice and its ancillary facilities.  This proposal was rejected by the Department of Justice and a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; offer of £250,000 was made to renovate the existing facilities in Athlone.  The balance, which is estimated to be in excess of £200,000, must be met by the local authority.  The local authority has already heavily invested in courthouses in Mullingar and Moate and the Minister for Justice should live up to her responsibilities to provide these facilities in Athlone.  Indeed, Mr. Haughey, when Taoiseach, promised in Athlone that funding for courthouses would be met by <Col N="1131" /> the Department of Justice and that they would no longer be a burden on the local authorities.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this decision in relation to Athlone Courthouse and make the necessary funding available so that it will not be such a burden on the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Athlone Courthouse, located in Barrack Street, Athlone, is in very poor condition and is unsuitable for modern use.  It has restricted access for the public and causes parking and other problems in the surrounding area.  It is one of a number of courthouses throughout the country which requires substantial renovation or replacement.</P>
      <P>In July 1992, the Circuit Court judge directed that all further Circuit Court sittings for Athlone be held in Mullingar until the courthouse is improved to the required standard.  The District Court judge also said he would not sit in the courthouse in Athlone and he has adjourned all Athlone business to the renovated Moate Courthouse, ten miles from Athlone, which is in excellent structural condition.  Despite exhaustive inquiries, no suitable alternative court accommodation appears to be available in Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county manager and other officials of Westmeath County Council and officers of my Department met on a number of occasions to discuss the matter.  The council felt that it might be a better proposition to build a new courthouse rather than refurbish the existing one.  The cost of a new courthouse was found to be prohibitive.  A proposal for a possible commercial development which would include court accommodation was examined but was also rejected.  As a result the council arranged for a professional survey of Athlone Courthouse to establish the necessary work required to rehabilitate it and the estimated cost. The survey, with its proposals and costings <Col N="1132" /> has been received, examined and discussed with the county manager and is under consideration in the Department.</P>
    <P>The public and, indeed, my colleagues in the legal profession are undoubtedly inconvenienced by having to attend courts outside Athlone &mdash; a number of them in that area have made that point to me.  Athlone plays a vital role in the court structure.  I confidently expect that, in co-operation with Westmeath County Council it will be possible to implement satisfactory arrangements to restore courthouse facilities to Athlone without undue delay.</P>
    <P>A number of courthouses throughout the country require renovation.  Because of the limited availability of financial resources, priorities are being established in the Department between the different premises requiring attention.  Progress has not been as rapid as I would like it to be but I am confident that the next few years will see substantial improvements in the standard of court accommodation throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to detain the Minister on this matter but it is of great importance to the pupils, teachers and parents.  As we are nearing the end of the present school term it is important that the Minister, and her Department, give approval to the building of a prefabricated classroom within the next few days to ensure adequate accommodation for these pupils when they begin the 1993-94 school year in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two problems are being experienced at this school.  One is in regard to a remedial teacher who was appointed by the Department.  There is great concern on the part of all involved to ensure that the Department continue the appointment of a remedial teacher.  The figures are available to substantiate that case although I understand there had been some indication from the Department that they might not be satisfied to continue <Col N="1133" /> the appointment of a third teacher at that school.  The remedial teacher is doing wonderful work at the school.  The parents are greatly concerned about this and want clarification in the near future in regard to the position of that teacher who, unfortunately, does not have a classroom.  There are approximately 70 pupils attending the school and the two teachers there take four classes each.  The remedial teacher has to operate in a staffroom which can accommodate about six pupils only at a time.</P>
    <P>I know the type of financial pressures and demands being made on the Minister but my request to her this evening is small.  There will be an application for an additional classroom to accommodate the third teacher in proper modern conditions. But, for September the parents want a prefabricated classroom erected in order to have some type of reasonable accommodation for their children attending the school.  A prefabricated building is now idle, following the opening of the new secondary school at Oughterard, and is for sale by the Sisters.  It is important that the Department have that building examined by the Office of Public Works. It is in very good condition.  If it is approved and purchased that building could be moved from Oughterard and relocated at Tooreeney.  This school is located in the Galway Gaeltacht.  I do not know how these teachers manage to teach large numbers of pupils under such deplorable conditions.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures furnished to me indicate that 70 pupils will be attending the school from September 1993, that 72 pupils will be attending in September 1994 and 69 pupils in September 1995. Urgent action is required.  The Office of Public Works has been involved in approving the building but what is required is the Minister's sanction to be conveyed to the school authorities and that would need to be done within the next week or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity <Col N="1134" /> Deputy Molloy has presented me to clarify the position in regard to this matter. First, may I point out that the authorised staffing for a national school is determined in accordance with the agreement between the Government and the INTO? Under this agreement the staffing of a school for a particular year is determined by the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The current enrolment at Tooreeney national school is 58 pupils, down from 63 in the 1991-92 school year. The accommodation comprises two permanent classrooms together with some ancillary accommodation.  The current staffing consists of a principal and two assistant teachers.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Tooreeney on 30 September 1992 was 58 which warrants a staff of principal and one assistant for the 1993-94 school year.  The second assistant at present serving in the school was due to be placed on the diocesan panel. However, that teacher requested permission to defer her panel rights for maternity reasons, which request has been granted.  She will not be placed on the panel until April 1994.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances my Department clearly would not be justified in grant-aiding the provision of a prefab classroom where the requirement for such additional accommodation would be of such a short term nature.</P>
      <P>In view of the decline in pupil numbers from 63 in 1991-92 to the current figure of 58 my Department is very doubtful that the level of enrolment projected by the Deputy will materialise.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department will review the accommodation at the school again in September next if requested to do so by the school authorities in the light of the level of enrolment then applying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Ramsgrange Community School was opened in 1977 cementing the amalgamation of the secondary school of the St. Louis Order, based on the same site as the new community school and Shielbaggan vocational school located one and a half miles from Ramsgrange. The St. Louis Order have been involved in education in Ramsgrange, County Wexford, since 1872 to date.  Sister Nóirín of that Order is now vice-principal and, at present acting-principal. Shielbaggan vocational school, which falls under the aegis of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee, is now known as the Shielbaggan outdoor pursuits centre.  It will be seen that Ramsgrange has long been established as an area of second-level education. Ramsgrange is located in south west Wexford.  The community school there services the catchment area incorporating Fethard-on-Sea, Ramsgrange, Duncannon, Ballycullane, Saint Leonard's, Gusserane, Horeswood, Clongeen and Wellington Bridge, an area in which I am privileged to live.</P>
      <P>The area served by the school over the past five years has been operating a combat poverty programme.  It may be very difficult for those people outside Wexford to believe that Wexford does have a combat poverty programme.  In addition the area was selected as a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partnership area because of its high unemployment.  It is vital that we have the best possible second-level educational facilities available in this deprived area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally the school at Ramsgrange is in good condition but the metalwork room was built to accommodate intermediate or junior certificate level students.  Because of local demand, there being no other school in that area &mdash; the nearest being New Ross 15 miles away &mdash; there is no other option available. Metalwork is taught at senior level in <Col N="1136" /> this same room.  There has been a long tradition of skills in metalwork and engineering in south Wexford, Pierce's and the Star Foundries in Wexford being examples.  The metalwork teacher in the school, Mr. Kevin Cadogan, is a rare breed, absolutely excellent.  His pupils, despite the inadequate facilities, obtain great results.  However, the biggest problem is that many pupils are deprived of learning metalwork and engineering skills due to a lack of accommodation.</P>
    <P>This extension is badly needed. Indeed, new equipment, which was paid for by the Department, remains unused because of the lack of space.  I am sure the Minister would agree that this is the source of some embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The gymnasium at the school is a fine building and was purpose built, but because of the condition of the floor covering has been closed to the school and to the local community, which had used it extensively.  It was closed in 1992 by order of the Department of Education. Again, this is a source of some embarrassment for all in the locality, given that a building which cost in excess of £200,000 to build remains closed for the want of £20,000.  As I said, the gymnasium was used extensively in the school, which is sport orientated.  Indeed, their basketball teams have won all-Ireland honours.  Outside school hours it was used by the local community.  The Boley tug of war team have won world championships.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, for visiting the school last October and the Minister for meeting a deputation from Ramsgrange recently and giving them a sympathetic hearing.  The bottom line is that the number of enrolments has fallen from a figure of 92 first year students in 1992 to an anticipated figure of 57 in September 1993.  There are other reasons for the drop in numbers, but undoubtedly the lack of space in the metalwork room and the condition of <Col N="1137" /> the gymnasium, which is now a no-go area, are major factors.</P>
    <P>In summary, the fact that new equipment for metalwork students is not being used because of the lack of space is a source of embarrassment.  Second, the fact that a massive building remains closed for the want of £20,000 is also a source of embarrassment.  Third, the long tradition of second level education in the school is being badly affected.  Fourth, this area is considered to be deprived by two Departments, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Fifth, rural development will mean nothing in this remote area if remedial action is not taken immediately. Sixth, pupils are unable to choose metalwork as a subject.  Seventh, and perhaps most important, there has been a drop in the number of enrolments which can be directly related to this problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the school is not further downgraded, to sanction this project immediately and provide the necessary finance to give the people of south Wexford, the excellent teaching staff and, more importantly, the pupils at Ramsgrange the facilities which most other areas enjoy.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to respond to the matters raised by the Deputy regarding Ramsgrange Community School, New Ross, County Wexford.  I am very much aware of the problems affecting the gymnasium at the school and also the application currently with my Department for an extension to the metalwork room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would first like to address the matter of the condition of the school gymnasium and give the Deputy a brief background to the case.  In September 1991 the board of management submitted an architect's report to my Department outlining the condition of the school hall.  Particular attention was drawn to the architect's recommendation that the sports hall be taken out of use pending renewal of the floor, in view of its dangerous condition. <Col N="1138" /> In the interests of the safety and the wellbeing of pupils and teachers, the board of management was compelled to close the hall until essential repairs could be carried out.</P>
    <P>Additional information and costings were sought and submitted to my Department following which an architect was commissioned to oversee the remedial works to the hall.  The necessary documentation was then prepared and in November 1992 was submitted for examination by my Department's technical staff and was generally found to be satisfactory.  The total cost of the remedial works was estimated at £85,000, of which approximately £50,000 referred to replacing the hall floor.  The position now is that the documentation to enable the remedial works to proceed is in place, and inevitably the question of capital funding of the project arises.  Despite the validity of this case, I was unable to include the work in the 1993 capital programme. Because of the difficult financial situation pertaining at the moment all funds are being directed towards the provision of urgently needed classroom accommodation and emergency works.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the importance of physical education facilities and regret very much that such a fine hall is temporarily out of use.  I feel so strongly about this that I recently met with a deputation on behalf of the school who have now proposed that the remedial works to the hall be phased, with the work to the gymnasium floor to comprise phase 1.  In addition, the deputation indicated that the board of management has new proposals in relation to the floor covering which will reduce the cost of this element of the work to approximately £22,500.  I have asked the relevant officials to examine this proposal carefully and I hope I will be in a position to make a decision on the matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I wish to come to the other matter which the Deputy has raised, the extension to the metalwork room.  The background to this case is similar to that <Col N="1139" /> outlined by me regarding the school gymnasium. When this application was received in my Department and its requirement accepted in principle, an architect was commissioned to prepare drawings and specifications for this extension. These drawings, which were recently submitted, are now being considered in my Department and again a decision on whether to allow the project to go to tender will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I must again say that this decision, as with the sports hall, must be taken in the context of the availability of scarce capital resources.  I wish to assure the Deputy, however, that the advancement of both projects as soon as possible is a matter of great importance to me and every effort will be made to proceed with them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 June 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 28, 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements which I am drawing up to help people in difficulties with ESB or gas bills, will involve the health boards, the ESB and An Bord Gáis in providing an integrated and effective response to these difficulties.  I am drawing up a code of practice, in conjunction with the utility companies and the health boards, for those experiencing difficulties with their ESB or gas bills. My officials will be meeting with both organisations in the near future to conclude an agreement on the proposed code.</P>
      <P>My objective in producing this code of practice is to ensure that any client on a social welfare or health board income who has problems in meeting ESB or gas bills will receive all the advice and assistance that is available from the health boards and the utility companies in addition to immediate practical help, where necessary.  My aim is to enable people to get back to a situation where they have control of their budget on an ongoing basis and where the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is used to help achieve an effective and lasting solution.  This will be a major improvement on the previous arrangements and will ensure greater consistency in treatment across different health board areas.</P>
      <P>The code of practice will state simply and clearly the procedure which each organisation will employ in dealing with consumers who are on social welfare or health board incomes and who have difficulty with their bills.  Among the benefits which I believe will accrue from introduction of this code will be a significant improvement in the liaison between health boards and local utility company managers to the consumers' benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidance issued to the health boards recently, consequent on the withdrawl of the circulars, is intended as an <Col N="980" /> interim arrangement to ensure that help will be available towards ESB and gas bills where there are exceptional circumstances and where expenditure could not reasonably be met from the client's normal weekly income.</P>
    <P>The code of practice will be finalised shortly and published in the form of an information leaflet.  The published code will incorporate the guidance offered to health boards for dealing with payments for exceptional need in respect of ESB or gas bills.</P>

      <P>Subject to satisfying the relevant conditions, members of the travelling community are eligible for the full range of social welfare benefits, pensions and allowances in the same way as claimants generally.</P>
      <P>In recent years, under the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies in the social services area I have been able to assist a number of projects organised by or on behalf of traveller groups.  Approximately £14,400 was paid out by way of such grants in 1992.  One of the projects in the Third EC Poverty Programme is a project run by the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group, (DTEDG).  This project is being funded jointly by the EC and the Government through the Combat Poverty Agency, to the sum of £300,000 in the period 1989-94.</P>

      <P>In 1983 the increase in the rate of retirement pension was implemented on Thursday, 30 June and the increase in the rates of old age contributory and non-contributory pensions was implemented on Friday, 1 July.  From 1984 to 1987 inclusive the date of the increases was <Col N="982" /> also on a Thursday and Friday, a week later in each successive year.  Since 1988 the increases in rates of social welfare pensions have been implemented on the last Thursday and Friday of July in each year.  The exact dates are in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The current rate for old age contributory and retirement pensions is £66.60 and the rate for old age non-contributory pension is £57.20.  These rates will be increased by 3.5 per cent to £68.90 and £59.20 respectively, again from the last Thursday and Friday in July this year.</P>

      <P>The drop in the number of prosecutions for 1991 and 1992 is due to the amnesty which was in force from 19 March 1991 to 13 December 1991.  This amnesty was just one aspect of a wide-ranging control programme introduced in recent years which has resulted in significant improvements in the levels of PRSI receipts and in the prevention and control of social welfare abuses generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 26, 41, 42 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The assessment of the value of free board and lodging in the case of a young person who is claiming unemployment assistance and living at home is made by reference to the parental income, disregarding a standard amount, as a parental allowance, and dividing the remaining income between the non-earning members of the household.  There is also an overall limit on the value of benefit and privilege in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice the combination of the disregard of the standard amount and the limit means that claimants living in households with income at or less than the level of unemployment assistance, regardless of the source of that income, <Col N="985" /> would not have any means assessed in respect of benefit and privilege or a very small assessment.  As household income rises a benefit and privilege assessment would arise at a gradually increasing level.  There is not, therefore, a poverty trap in the sense referred to and the question of disregarding long term social welfare payments does not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify the position in relation to the disregard of social welfare payments which I introduced in this year's Social Welfare Act.  This disregard is relevant only in assessing the means of one of a married couple who is claiming unemployment assistance, where the other spouse is already in receipt of a social welfare payment.  In that case the overall payment to both is limited to the appropriate married rate.  The disregard of social welfare payments provided for in the Act ensures that this overall payment is not further reduced by the underlying entitlement of the spouse who is already receiving a payment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I meet a large number of organisations on a wide range of issues relating to social welfare.  At these meetings issues which relate to widowers sometimes arise. Specifically, I meet the Irish Widowers and Separated Fathers Association at the annual pre-budget forum which I introduced to give organisations representing people on social welfare the opportunity to put forward their priorities for the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> In 1989 I extended the widow's (noncontributory) pension scheme to cover widowers with dependent children.  Prior to that there had been no specific schemes for widowers.  Provision for widowers was expanded further in 1990 when I introduced the lone parent's allowance which provides an allowance, on a means-tested basis to lone parents including widowers, who are bringing up a child without the support of a partner.  The cost of extending to widowers the present social insurance contributory pension for widows is estimated to be in the region of £25 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The question of social insurance cover for widowers is being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of its proposals for a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report shortly and I will examine the matter again in the context of their recommendations.</P>

      <P>The question of the appropriate way to measure unemployment is primarily one for the Central Statistics Office.  The two main measures of unemployment at present are the labour force survey, undertaken annually by the Central Statistics Office, and the monthly live register figures, based on the numbers signing on for unemployment payments or credits.  These two measures are compiled in different ways and yield different results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 labour force survey showed that, in the case of males, 90,000 out of 108,000 unemployed in the labour force survey were on the live register.  In the <Col N="987" /> case of females, the proportion was lower, with 27,000 out of 63,000 being on the register.  Information is not available as to the reasons for this.  A possible explanation is that people who regard themselves as unemployed but who are not entitled to an unemployment payment, do not in practice sign on the live register.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other differences between the information from the labour force survey and the live register.  For example, among those regarded as &ldquo;inactive&rdquo;, that is, outside the workforce, in the labour force survey, 41,600 are on the live register.  The most likely explanation is that people who regard themselves as not in the workforce, such as people who have taken early retirement or those on home duties, are continuing to sign on for social welfare payments or credits.</P>
    <P>In relation to entitlement to unemployment payments, equal treatment legislation was introduced in 1986 and since then men and women are entitled to claim all social welfare payments on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>My Department makes considerable efforts to ensure that all of those entitled to payments, be they male or female, are advised of their entitlements and encouraged to claim.  We publish a range of information leaflets covering all aspects of entitlement.  We also undertake advertising campaigns to highlight client awareness of the services obtainable and provide a support service to voluntary groups in advising the public of their rights.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare was established in August 1983 and its report was published in July 1986. The report represented the first major comprehensive review of the social welfare system and contained four main recommendations.  These were: improved child income support, a broadening of the social insurance base, improvement in the delivery of services and improvement in basic payments. Considerable progress has been made in all four areas since the commission's report was published.</P>
      <P>In the area of child income support, the number of child dependant rates has been streamlined from 36 in 1987 to three at present.  The minimum child dependant allowance will be £12.80 with effect from next July, as compared with £6 in 1987.</P>
      <P>This year's budget provided for a substantial increase in child benefit payments to £20 for the first three children and £23 for the fourth and each subsequent child. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to increasing child benefit still further over time, following integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  A new grant of £200 for mothers on the birth of twins will also be introduced from July.  In addition, the family income supplement will be improved, so that families on family income supplement will be £12 per week better off from July.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare also recommended a broadening of the social insurance base.  With effect from April 1988, I extended social insurance cover for pensions to the self-employed, including farmers.  In 1991, I extended full social insurance cover to part-time workers earning £25 or more per week. This year these part-time workers are becoming eligible for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity benefit for the first time, representing a substantial improvement in their employment conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> The major and ongoing improvements which I have made in the quality, efficiency and delivery of social welfare services are in line with recommendations made by the commission in this area.  In some areas we have gone further.  I have set up eight regional management centres throughout the country and local offices are being converted into one stop shops for all social welfare services in these areas.  This amounts to a major and fundamental re-organisation in the way these services are administered and delivered and is resulting in a more local customer-oriented service.</P>
    <P>In recent years, social welfare payments have more than kept pace with inflation.  All long term social welfare rates now exceed the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rate which is £58.20 in 1993 terms.  The new maximum standard weekly rates for long term payments will range from £59.20 to £68.90 with effect from July.  The carer's allowance will also increase to the long term rate from July.  Short-term payments will be increased to a new personal weekly rate of £55.60.</P>
    <P>The exceptionally difficult budgetary circumstances earlier this year did not allow the Government to achieve in full the priority rates proposed by the commission for short term payments.  This will be achieved in the context of further growth in the economy.  However, the Government is committed, under the Programme for a Partnership Government, to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the incomes of pensioners.  I will continue to keep payment levels under review and to implement the commission's recommendations in this area as resources permit.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, the National Pensions Board is currently finalising its report on the development of a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive this report shortly and its recommendations will be given careful and detailed consideration by me.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EEC Directive 79/7, equal treatment between men and women in social welfare matters was due to come into effect in December 1984.  The implementation of the directive was delayed until May 1986 when the first part of equal treatment came into effect.  Full implementation of equal treatment took place with effect from November 1986.</P>
      <P>The delay in implementing the directive meant that during the period December 1984 to May 1986, married women received a lower personal rate than other claimants in the case of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit. During this period married women received a maximum of 12 months unemployment benefit as against 15 months in the case of claimants generally.  During the period December 1984 to November 1986 married women were not entitled to claim increases for adult and child dependants except in exceptional circumstances and they were not entitled to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1992, the Government provided for equality of treatment in respect <Col N="991" /> of the period of delay in implementing the directive.  The necessary provisions are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations 1992, S.I. No. 152 of 1992.  These regulations provide for payment of increased rates of benefit, extended duration of unemployment benefit, increases for dependants in the form of a household supplement and unemployment assistance. Under the provisions of the regulations, payments are being made on a phased basis over the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
    <P>My Department made extensive efforts at the time to identify all potential beneficiaries by trawling through records of married women who were getting a social welfare payment in the period of the delay.  Personalised claim forms were issued to all potential beneficiaries and about 85,000 claims have been received to date.  These claims are currently being processed in accordance with the provisions of the retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>In order to cushion families who would otherwise have suffered a reduction in their weekly payments arising from the new dependency arrangements introduced in November 1986, alleviation payments were introduced on a temporary basis.  In 1988, it was decided that these payments should be phased out gradually and the amounts payable were reduced on an annual basis to coincide with the budgetary increases each year.  These payments were discontinued entirely in July 1992.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the number of communications from solicitors acting on behalf of women seeking alleviation payments are not maintained by my Department. There is no legal entitlement to such payments. Court proceedings in which the plaintiffs are seeking alleviation payments have been initiated in a number of cases, and as already made known, these proceedings will be defended by my Department.  Ultimately the matter will have to be determined by the courts and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate <Col N="992" /> for me to make any statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>People who cease to be compulsorily insured under the pay-related social insurance system can become voluntary contributors and pay voluntary contributions to maintain their pension entitlements.  In order to become a voluntary contributor, a person must have at least three years PRSI contributions paid and must apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year in which they finish work or receive a credited contribution.</P>
      <P>People who claim short term payments such as disability, unemployment or maternity benefits or who receive invalidity or retirement pensions automatically receive credited contributions for each week of their payment which gives cover for pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>In 1991 I extended social insurance cover to 27,000 part-time workers, mostly women, who now have cover for pensions in their own right when they retire.  Also, in 1988 I brought farmers and the self employed into the social insurance system and this year their spouses and dependants have entitlement for the first time to widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the situation of some 500,000 women who work full-time in the home.  Under present arrangements, they are not entitled to credited contributions for their period out of the workforce.  In many cases voluntary PRSI contributions may not be a practical proposition for them.</P>
    </Speaker>

These proposals will be developed in the context of the recommendations <Col N="993" /> of the National Pensions Board, whose final report I expect to receive this summer.</P>

      <P>The provisions for paying equal treatment arrears to married women for the period December 1984 to November 1986 are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).  The regulations provide for (a) the payment of a higher personal rate in the case of certain social welfare payments, (b) the extended duration of unemployment benefit, (c) payment of a household supplement in respect of a dependent husband and/or dependent children and (d) payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the legislative provisions payment of arrears is being made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Phase 1 provides for the payment of arrears in respect of the higher personal rates and extended duration of unemployment benefit while phase 2 provides for the payment of arrears of household supplement in respect of dependants and the payment of unemployment assistance. The legislation provides for phase 2 arrears to be paid in two equal instalments &mdash; the first instalment to be paid not later than 31 December 1993 and the second instalment to be paid not later than 1 July 1994 with amounts of less than £100 to be paid in full in 1993.  A total of 85,100 applications for equal treatment arrears were received and all these have been processed for phase 1 entitlement except for a small number of cases where additional inquiries had to be made to determine entitlement.  Some <Col N="994" /> 17,000 applicants were not eligible for phase 1 payments.  These consisted mainly of widows, wives separated from their husbands and married women who had no claims or who were single during the relevant period.  A small number of claims are still being received each week and these claims, while technically late, are being accepted.  The number of applicants eligible for phase 1 payments was 67,464 and 67,121 have been paid.  Payments are issued once a week.</P>
    <P>Processing of arrears of household supplement due under phase 2 of the provisions commenced last April.  To date some 15,500 applications have been processed. Of those 9,800 were entitled to payment and the remaining 5,700 were not entitled to household supplement. Those not entitled to household supplement fall into two categories &mdash; (A) a married women with no child dependants and whose husband was not considered a dependant because he was earning in excess of £50 a week, and (B) a married women whose husband was in receipt of a social welfare payment during the relevant period.  As regards the latter category the husband received the full household supplement for child dependants on his claim at the time and in such cases the household supplement is deemed to be fully paid to both spouses. A total of 8,820 applicants have received their phase 2 entitlements.  A further 70,000 claims have yet to be determined for phase 2 entitlements.  Based on experience to date between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of these cases will be eligible for payment.</P>
    <P>In summary almost 100 per cent of eligible phase 1 claims received have been paid.  As regards phase 2 cases, 15,500 have been examined and 63 per cent of those will be eligible and will be paid promptly after determination.  A further 70,000 cases will be reviewed for phase 2 entitlements over the next six-seven months and eligible cases will be paid promptly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every possible effort has been made to ensure that all married women with entitlement to equal treatment arrears are paid the moneys due to <Col N="995" /> them.  In this context when the legislation was introduced last year claimants with potential entitlement to arrears were identified from my Department's records and issued with personalised claim forms. An extensive advertising campaign was also carried out in the media at the time inviting applications.  A special section was set up in my Department to process the applications and deal with inquiries relating to the provisions.  Payment of arrears is not subject to delay and is being made within the timescale contained in the provisions.</P>

      <P>The social welfare appeals office receives 18,000 appeals every year.  If present trends continue the office will receive over 20,000 appeals in 1993.  At the end of May the total number of appeals on hand was 6,635, down from 7,571 at the end of March.  A total of 2,712, 40 per cent of current appeals were registered more than three months, 13 weeks, ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the appeals on hand for some time are cases which involve oral hearings or special investigations.  They would include, also, cases where executors are contesting the recovery from deceased pensioners estates of pensions overpaid, cases where appellants are being paid but are seeking some decrease in the amount of means assessed against them and cases where the person has been found to be concurrently working and claiming benefit and is contesting the amount of the overpayment.  In some cases delay arises where oral hearings have already been arranged and adjourned at the request of the appellant or his legal representative <Col N="996" /> so that further evidence may be submitted.</P>
    <P>When an appeal is received from a person dissatisfied with the initial decision of the Department of Social Welfare, the grounds upon which the appeal is based are examined.  This may involve a second examination by a medical referee in the case of a sickness benefit payment or a further investigation by a local officer of the Department in the case of claims relating to other schemes. It is often possible for the deciding officer to revise the initial decision at this stage when the additional information has been received and thus resolve the appeal speedily.  Alternatively, if the facts have been fully established and appear to be agreed in substance, the appeals officer may be in a position to make a summary determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>However, in about 40 per cent of cases any contention may be resolved only by way of an oral hearing of the appeal. Where an oral hearing is needed there is little realistic prospect of the entire process being completed in less than three months and additional resources would not alter this fact.</P>
    <P>The continuing high number of people who are availing of their statutory right of appeal has undoubtedly resulted in some delay in processing appeals.  Both the social welfare appeals office and my Department review procedures constantly to see how the administrative system can be streamlined to provide a more efficient and speedier service to customers.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in response to the increased volume of appeals, I have arranged for the appointment of two additional appeals officers to the social welfare appeals office.  These appointments will, initially be on a temporary basis, but I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new unit has recently been established in my Department to review the entire initial decision making process on claims for social welfare benefits. One of its tasks is to ensure everyone will get as much information as <Col N="997" /> possible on the reasons for the original decision in their cases, especially where a claim is being rejected in full or in part.  I am confident that, in addition to improving the service to customers, this unit will do much to help reduce the incidence of appeals as customers will understand better the reasons for the decisions in their cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 65 together.  I would like to make it absolutely clear that my Department is not introducing a State identity card.  The card being introduced by my Department is a social services card.  The card is primarily a registration card but social welfare customers will be able to use the card for all social welfare services, for example, when contacting a social welfare office, a community welfare office or post offices as they are modernised in connection with claiming unemployment payments.  Customers will also be able to use the card for reference purposes in their dealings with the tax office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the social services card is not a national identity <Col N="998" /> card.  There will be no photograph on the card and it will not be compulsory to carry it.  It is designed for use in connection with social welfare, revenue and related services only.  The purpose of the card is to enable the holder to gain easier and quicker access to these services.  In the light of this I do not consider that the publication of a White Paper on the matter is called for.</P>
    <P>In relation to Question No. 46, the same question was put down and replied to by my predecessor on 14 October 1992.

      <P>The administration of the social welfare system is carried out by the staff of my Department who numbered 4,017 at the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>Also directly involved are 75 managers of local branch employment offices who provide services for the unemployed on behalf of my Department.  These contractors employ staff whom they pay directly.  The number so employed is a matter for the individual manager and the Department does not keep information on them.</P>
      <P>In addition a significant number of personnel in other organisations are involved to varying degrees in administering the system.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the health boards on my behalf.  Many of my Department's weekly and monthly payments to customers are made at post offices.  Pay related social insurance contributions are collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  Information is not available on the numbers in these organisations who are involved on social welfare work.  The total cost of administering the social welfare system, including the cost of services provided by the other organisations mentioned, amounted to £161 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>Administration costs amount to less than 5 per cent of the cost of the services at £3.7 billion.</P>
      <P>My Department is constantly looking at ways to improve its administrative practices.  This is part of the ongoing commitment to provide the best possible customer service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is recognised as leading the field particularly in developing <Col N="1000" /> services for customers backed up by the latest information technology.  It is in regular contact with other social security organisations through the international social security services association and the international institute for administrative studies.  The sharing of knowledge and experience is of great value to all participating social security organisations including my Department. Indeed, my Department has been invited to make presentations on the Irish social security system and its administration to a number of international symposia of these institutes.  Also, a number of delegations from Europe, including the UK, and Asia have visited the Department to discuss the use of information technology to support social security administration and learn from the Department's experience. In addition the Department has been invited by a number of international consultancy firms and the World Bank to provide expert assistance on the development and implementation of social security systems in Eastern Europe and Asia.</P>
    <P>Comparative studies of costs in other countries have not been undertaken.  The nature of social welfare schemes vary widely from country to country making it difficult to draw accurate comparisons.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for economy in the use of public funds.  I am, therefore, pleased to have been the first Minister to conclude, in 1990, an administrative budget agreement with the Minister for Finance, the key objective of which was to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the Department.</P>

      <P>In determining the rate of unemployment assistance payable to a person, income earned by their spouse is taken into account.  Where the spouse is self-employed the net earnings, after deducting all expenses incurred, are taken into account.  Where the spouse is an employed person the amount taken into account is the gross earnings less tax and PRSI contributions, travel costs and a standard disregard of £45 in lieu of other personal expenses.  In both cases the resulting figure is assessed.  Where the claimant's spouse qualifies as an adult dependant, the amount of unemployment assistance payable is the married rate of assistance less the means. Where the spouse does not qualify as a dependant, the amount payable is the personal rate of assistance less half the means.</P>
      <P>I am examining the whole issue of the treatment of working spouses of social welfare recipients.  Last week I increased from £55 to £60 the amount which a person can earn and continue to qualify as an adult dependant on their spouse's social welfare payment.  I will be addressing, in the context of this examination, the provision for assessing the income of couples in determining means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently offered a facility to old age contributory and retirement pensioners to have their pension payments paid directly into a bank or post office savings account.  This is part of my programme to improve services <Col N="1002" /> to the public and introducing payment options for social welfare customers.</P>
      <P>Up to now pensioners had no choice but to collect their pensions each week at post offices.  Under the new arrangement, pensioners can, instead opt to have their payments credited to their accounts, at a bank or post office, at four weekly intervals.</P>
      <P>To date, 5,200 pensioners have opted for the direct payment facility.  This represents a 4.6 per cent take-up rate of those offered the facility, which is in line with experience elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Pensioners not opting for direct payment will continue to receive payment by pension book at post offices as always.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that payments under this arrangement should be made in arrears. This ensures that my Department has adequate time to respond to any change in pensioner circumstances before the next payment is made.  I understand that similar arrangements operate in other countries.</P>
      <P>Because pensioners are currently paid one week in advance the first direct payment will be made five weeks after the last payment by way of pension book.  All subsequent direct payments will be made every four weeks.</P>
      <P>Pensioners opting for direct payment of pension are advised that payment will be made four weekly in arrears.  The new arrangements suit many pensioners particularly those coming from the workforce, many of whom are already paid monthly in arrears.</P>
      <P>The new facility is entirely optional and a pensioner may decide whether or not this method of payment suits their circumstances.</P>
      <P>As a once-off incentive in 1993 to contributory old age and retirement pensioners, my Department is offering £50 in prize bonds to those who opt for the new payment method during 1993.  This applies whether they opt to have their payments made to a bank account or post office account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to pension up to the date of a pensioner's death will be the same for all pensioners regardless of their <Col N="1003" /> method of payment.  Any uncashed or unissued payment due at date of death will be paid to the pensioner's estate or next-of-kin as appropriate.  There is no loss of pension payment.</P>

      <P>In supplying food aid to developing countries, the nutritional needs of recipient people are of paramount importance.  The choice of food aid products is determined by these needs rather than by the types of food that are in surplus at any given time in the Community.  Care has also to be taken not to put farmers in the recipient countries out of business, thus risking future food shortages.  For this reason and where possible, food is purchased locally rather than imported from Europe.</P>
      <P>In practice, use is often made in EC food aid programmes of products held in intervention stores, particularly skimmed milk powder, butteroil and cereals. Under the EC's regular food aid programme, millions of pounds worth of cereals, milk powder and other food are supplied to developing countries every year.  Last year for example, in response to Southern Africa's worst drought in decades and severe food shortages in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere, the European Community gave nearly two million tonnes of food to the worst affected countries.</P>

      <P>The only requirements communicated to my Office by the Garda in respect of Grangemockler Garda Station relate to a problem with the chimney in the married quarters, which was reported to the Office of Public Works District Inspector in Thurles by the local Garda Superintendent on 25 March, 1993.</P>
      <P>Because of alterations made to this chimney many years ago it is very difficult to clean.  To do so requires the attention of a builder.  The chimney has been cleaned in this way over the years at a reasonable cost.  In the current instance the Garda Superintendent was advised that the chimney should be again cleaned in this way.  However, a subsequent request was received from the Superintendent asking that the chimney be examined with a view to finding a more permanent solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>This is being done and, when the results of the examination are to hand, they will be conveyed to the gardaí without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.  The tax system provides for three options for the taxation of married couples.  These are joint assessment, separate assessment and separate/single treatment. Couples may choose the system which suits their particular circumstances and the Revenue Commissioners have published a leaflet giving details of the options currently available.</P>
      <P>The equality issues to which the Deputy refers were addressed in the 1993 Finance Bill which has recently been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. These new provisions were designed to address the underlying concerns articulated by the Second Commission on the Status of Women in its recommendations. A publicity campaign to inform couples of the options open to them as a result of the Finance Bill changes will be undertaken in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joint assessment is the taxation option which applies to the bulk of married <Col N="1006" /> couples.  Under this option one person is assessable and chargeable to tax on all the couple's earnings.  Until the changes in the Finance Bill, 1993, the husband was always the assessable person.  It is for this reason that full details of the couple's allowances are issued to the husband.  A notice of tax free allowances also issues to the wife detailing the allowances allocated to her.  The 1993 Finance Bill will come into effect for the years 1994-95 and subsequent years and provides that the couple may choose the wife or husband as the assessable person.  The Bill also provides that, in relation to couples who marry after 6 April 1993 and where a specific choice is not made, the spouse with the highest income is treated as the assessable person.  Where under the new system the wife is the assessable person full details of all allowances will be issued to her and details of the allowances allocated to her husband will be sent to him.</P>
    <P>The requirement for a wife to receive permission from her husband to acquire his tax free allowances is a feature of the joint assessment system as currently operated.  It arises because the husband is deemed to be the assessable person under joint assessment.  Under the new provisions enacted in the Finance Bill, 1993, this requirement will apply equally to a husband where the wife is the assessable person.</P>
    <P>Married women who do not wish to pool their allowances with those of their husbands may opt for separate assessment before 6 July in the year of assessment. Where a wife so opts she is treated as a single person throughout the year of assessment and details of all her allowances are included on her tax free allowance certificate.  The tax payable by the married couple who have opted for separate assessment cannot exceed the tax which would have been payable if the couple had remained in joint assessment. To achieve this any unused allowances or rate bands of one spouse are transferred to the other spouse after the end of the year of assessment.  In practice where it is possible to anticipate the end of year position accurately and where both spouses request it the Revenue <Col N="1007" /> Commissioners will arrange to transfer the allowances and rate bands, in so far as is practicable, at the start of or during the year.</P>
    <P>Under separate-single treatment, tax-payers are taxed as single persons and allowances may not be transferred between them.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to his decision of 7 February 1991, approving the northern cross route, his attention has been drawn to Aer Rianta's proposals for a new south terminal having access to the proposed Ballymun interchange on the northern cross route and to the fact that Aer Rianta was solicited to write to Dublin County Council to support the proposed interchange and link road as a means of a fast and easy access to the city for the anticipated massive increase in traffic; the reason the consequent implications of this additional traffic were not taken into account in the supplementary traffic study carried out subsequently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the EIS published in March 1990, by Dublin County Council was based on traffic data supplied by consultants (details supplied) on the assumption of tolled roads; if, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that the NCR is to be toll free, the consequent increase in traffic volumes means that the published EIS is therefore invalidated; if he will undertake to request a new EIS to cover both county council and corporation areas affected by the route, its proposed interchanges and link roads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to require the carrying out of a further Environmental Impact Study for the Northern Cross Route. Many of the environmental impacts of the route arise from its physical presence and are not directly linked to the volume of traffic that will use it.  In the case of matters such as noise levels and air pollution which have a relationship to traffic volumes, I am aware that the impact predictions in the study were based on traffic flow projections which assumed that the route would be tolled. The study did, however, include traffic projections both for tolled and toll free <Col N="1011" /> operation of the route and evidence in this regard was submitted to the public inquiry held prior to the approval of the motorway scheme.  While it is likely that the increased traffic volumes using the route on a toll free basis would give rise to some increase in noise levels and air pollution in the immediate vicinity of the route, it is also likely that there would be offsetting improvements in environmental quality on existing parallel routes, many of them in residential areas, arising from the consequential reduction in the level of traffic using them.</P>
    <P>I understand, from Dublin County Council, that unsolicited representations were received from Aer Rianta in September, 1991 outlining the company's support for the proposed Ballymun interchange. These representations, made some seven months after the motorway scheme had been approved and some 15 months after the public inquiry was held, refer to the company's long term plan for a new south terminal from which traffic would access the Dublin Ring Road via the Ballymun interchange.  It will be a matter for the relevant planning authority to consider the implications of such a development in due course if and when a definite proposal is made to it.</P>

      <P>The Foreshore Act, 1933 requires that all developments on State owned foreshore must be authorised by an appropriate licence or lease to be obtained from the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correct procedure to be adopted is to apply for such a lease or licence to the Minister for the Marine.  The application should be accompanied by a large <Col N="1012" /> scale Ordnance Survey map (25&rdquo; latest edition) and detailed plans and drawings of the proposed works.</P>
    <P>Certain developments would also require the submission of an environmental impact statement.  In addition, applicants will be required to publish notice of the proposal in newspapers circulating in the area.</P>
    <P>While a harbour authority has no statutory function in the granting of licences or the making of leases of foreshore, it would be consulted where the proposed development is within the harbour limits. Sometimes a harbour authority, in co-operation with the developer, might itself apply for a head lease of foreshore in order to facilitate and control a particular proposal.</P>

      <P>All vessels wishing to engage in commercial sea fishing must be entered on the current sea fishing boat register. In order for a vessel to be entered on the register, it must first obtain a sea fishing boat licence.</P>
      <P>In order to obtain a sea fishing boat licence, applicants are required to provide full details with regard to the vessel, its ownership and proposed fishing operations for consideration by the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>Licence applications are decided upon in line with current policy which requires that, prior to a licence being issued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;applicants must withdraw active capacity (in terms of both tonnage and horsepower) from the current fishing boat register at least equivalent to that of the proposed new boat.  Special conditions apply to the Beam Trawler and pelagic fleets, where the capacity being withdrawn <Col N="1013" /> must be from the same sector of the fleet as the new vessel being introduced;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the new vessel be safe and sea-worthy;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the skipper/owner is duly qualified under the relevant legislation in force;</P>
    <P>&mdash;no decommissioning grant has been paid in respect of the vessel;</P>
    <P>&mdash;proof of ownership be furnished.</P>
    <P>I must also be satisfied that the economic and social benefits arising from the exploitation of the target species of the boat involved will accrue primarily to the coastal regions and communities which the quotas are designed to benefit.</P>
    <P>If the applicant complies with the above criteria a licence will issue in respect of the vessel.  Depending on the size and type of vessel, the licence may contain certain conditions restricting the fishing operations of the vessel.  On receipt of the licence, the owner must apply for the vessel to be registered under the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations, 1989.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the question, I can confirm that no recent submissions have been received regarding the process of the issue of licences.</P>
    <P>The Department is at present engaged in the process of carrying out a comprehensive review of the current licensing policy in the light of the recent fleet capacity targets set by the European Commission.  It is hoped to finalise this review within the next two months with a view to holding consultations with the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>Participants in that scheme have the option of withdrawing between 1 September and 15 December in any of the years 1992 to 1996 provided that they enter the new Common Agricultural Policy reform arable scheme and fulfil its set-aside obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the latter scheme, farmers must set-aside 15 per cent of the area which they enter in the scheme.  The remaining 85 per cent must be under eligible arable <Col N="1016" /> crops i.e. cereals, oilseeds or protein crops sown before 15 May each year.</P>
    <P>Compensatory amounts are payable on both sown and set-aside areas.  It is not possible to claim payment only on set-aside land under this scheme, and the maximum area for which set-aside payment can be claimed is 15 per cent of the combined sown/set-aside area.</P>
    <P>The person named did not notify my Department of his intention to withdraw from the five year scheme during the prescribed period, nor is there any record in my Department of an application from him in respect of the new Common Agricultural Policy reform scheme.

        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Fuarthas iarratas ó Bhord Bainistíochta na scoile sin i mí na Nollag 1992 ar dheontas £5,775 mar chabhair chun oibreacha feabhsú-cháin a chur i gcrích ar chlós na scoile, a úsáidtear freisin mar Choláiste Gaeilge i rith an tsamhraidh.  Ós rud é go bhfuil roinnt oibreacha a rinneadh ar thimpeall-acht na scoile airgeadaithe ag an Roinn Oideachais, tá an t-iarratas á mheas againn i gcomhairle leis an Roinn sin d'fhonn a chinntiú nach mbeadh an dá Roinn ag airgeadú na n-oibreacha céanna.</P>
