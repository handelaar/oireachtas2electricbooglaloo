      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As is your wont, Sir, you have captured the spirit of the House in the multi-coloured and celebratory tie that you have chosen to wear this morning. You, more than any Member of the House, have got the spirit of jubilation that all of us experience at this tremendous result.  I would like to join with the Taoiseach in conveying to Jack Charlton and to the entire team of the Irish Republic the utmost congratulations of all Members of the House on their success and the fact that we will now be represented in the World Cup finals in the United States.  In particular, I know the House would wish to congratulate Alan McLoughlin, who did wonders for the heart condition of many Members of the House by what he was able to achieve in such glorious fashion.  However, it is in a sense unfortunate that it had to be in a match with the other part of this island that we suceeded in becoming finalists in the World Cup.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate if the House did not also convey its congratulations and best wishes to Billy Bingham on his retirement from the management of the Northern Ireland squad and also congratulate the Northern Ireland team on the very efficient football they played yesterday and express the hope that, under whatever guise, the next time there is a World Cup final both parts of Ireland will be represented there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to join with the Taoiseach and the leader of Fine Gael in congratulating the Irish team on their great win and on going forward to the World Cup.  I also congratulate their supporters.  There were five teams from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and it is great that we are the ones going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has surpassed the former Taoiseach in the speed with which he went to welcome the team back.  I am not being critical in saying that.  I am delighted the Taoiseach went to welcome the team back, even though they returned in the early hours of the morning.  I was very pleased to see the Taoiseach there with Jack Charlton and the Irish <Col N="2103" /> team.  It shows that politicians are quite human, that we do watch games, are not serious-minded all the time and are delighted to join in the fun and the celebrations for this great team that is representing us in the World Cup.  I hope they do extremely well, and I hope the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste succeeded in getting enough visas for all of the fans who want to go and watch them play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I obviously want to join with everybody here in expressing congratulations to the Republic of Ireland team and, indeed, to the Northern Ireland team on the battle that they put up in order to stop us from getting to Boston.  The result we got last night was probably the best we could hope for, a one-all draw which enables us to go to Boston and Billy Bingham to go out with some respect in terms of the game that was played.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I want to add my words of congratulations to the boys in green, given the natural affinity that I feel with them, and congratulate both teams, both wearing the honourable colour, who did so well on the field in such a tense atmosphere which was quite palpable even from this part of the country.  We wish them all the best and hope that both parts of Ireland can take pride in the participation of Jack Charlton, an Englishman, along with many Irish people and people of mixed extraction who will go to represent the Republic in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on all occasions, I congratulate Jack Charlton and the Irish team on what they have achieved.  For the past number of years the Irish team has given great service to this country.  It is fitting that the team qualified for the World Cup and that is a fitting finale for many of the members of the team whose careers in football are near an end.  I hope they achieve further success in America. I ask the Government to ensure that sufficient visas will be made available to allow their supporters &mdash; our ambassadors &mdash; travel to America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand only three member states of the EC require visas for their citizens to travel to America, one being the Republic of Ireland. Would the Taoiseach not consider negotiating a bilateral agreement to make that requirement no longer necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is in Washington and has had discussions on this matter.  At my first meeting with the US Ambassador to Ireland, Ms Jean Kennedy-Smith, when she asked what she could do for Ireland, I said that one of the first things she could do would be to ensure that Ireland had a sufficient supply of visas for our supporters.  That is a mark of the confidence I had in our team.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Northern Ireland team qualified last night the Northern <Col N="2105" /> Ireland supporters would not require visas to travel to the United States, but the supporters in the Republic will require visas.  This point should be stressed by the Tánaiste while he is visiting Washington.  I note the Taoiseach is looking for his place on the team.  Would he like first reserve or captain of the team?</P>

It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be taken without debate; the resumed debate on the Second Stage of No. 11, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m.; the Dáil shall observe a one minute silence at 1 p.m. today for peace in Northern Ireland; and business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Governments of which the Taoiseach has been a member have made <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> type agreements with the social partners a centrepiece of their economic strategies since 1987, when does he propose to allow the Dáil debate the apparent breakdown of discussions leading towards such an agreement last night?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has allowed statements on this matter to be raised on a number of occasions.  This is an important matter because the Government has made the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the centrepiece of its economic strategy.</P>

      <P>I was not going to ask for a debate on the matter because that may or may not be helpful.  I want to be helpful to the Taoiseach, but he does not believe that.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is still the Government's intention to resurrect the discussions with the social partners?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is aware that this is a budgetary matter and it is not the practice to refer to items that may or may not appear in any particular budget.  I am surprised Deputy Bruton seeks a debate on this matter.  Does he want to have the opportunity to vote against central pay bargaining as his party has done since 1987?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

In view of the important statement made by the Tánaiste relating to Northern Ireland yesterday in the United States, is it intended to have a discussion in the Dáil relating to that statement and Government policy in that regard?  The Tánaiste made a detailed statement in the United <Col N="2108" /> States and it would be appropriate to have a debate in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá fadhbanna faoi leith ag Contae Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil an Bille seo ag plé leis na fadhbanna sin go léir ach ar bhonn teicniúil teoranta amháin.</P>
      <P>In my last contribution I gave some examples of the problems in County Dublin highlighted when the development plan for the county was considered in the last number of years.  The Minister will have to make up his mind on the outcome of that development plan. There is no indication of the outcome in this Bill except that the Minister retains significant powers, some of which are excessive and others, such as in the case of this plan, which need to be invoked. It appears to the general public &mdash; people have repeatedly said this to me &mdash; that what started off as a development plan has ended up as a developers' plan.  That raises the question of how the Minister will respond, given his previous commitments in terms of not spending taxpayers' money on bad proposals which would not contribute to the overall good planning of County Dublin.  That question should be answered very quickly by the Minister to avoid further cynicism in County Dublin in regard to the local authority and the body politic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Dublin Alliance for Proper Planning is one of a number of organisations set up in response to the development plan.  That group believes that development and planning in its area has not been in compliance with overall proper planning.  It cites a number of <Col N="2113" /> examples which should be considered by the Minister in the context of his overall review of local government in County Dublin.  The first in Malahide which goes under the name of Rob's Wall raises the question of the difference between a developer allegedly secretly making payment to a councillor and a developer flaunting money and inviting local sports clubs to accept payment in return for serving as lobbyists with county councillors. Clarification is required on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the light of local government reorganisation, it has been argued very vociferously by a State agency, Aer Rianta, that the area around Dublin Airport is the subject of very dubious and bad planning practice.  Apparently there is no prospect of this land ever being developed for industrial purposes.  Yet, the taxpayer, whom we represent, will be expected to come to the aid of Aer Rianta when it is seeking to buy such land for necessary airport developments and pay a severely inflated price for it.  The Minister for the Environment is the proper person to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>A few miles down the road from Dublin Airport, a small road in Brackenstown in Swords was expected, under a previous development plan, to cater for a large development.  It is proposed to locate further developments along this road.  It seems that no lessons have been learned from what happened on the last occasion.  There was what one can only describe as a street riot between the residents on that road and gardaí had to be called to maintain peace between the longer established residents and the new residents.  The new residents want a bus service to be provided but the longer established residents do not think buses will be able to negotiate the road.  This impasse has been brought about by shortsightedness and bad planning.  The Minister should get off the fence and indicate clearly what he will do to resolve the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>The people in the Liffey Valley area of west Dublin have a number of grievances, one of which relates to the Laraghcon <Col N="2114" /> housing development which will open up the north bank of the Liffey Valley.  Reference is often made in this House to the charm and natural resources of Dublin, advantages which will be publicised during the Eurovision Song Contest next year.  However, at the same time we are selling out, so to speak, on the things which make people want to live in and visit Dublin and on our tourism industry, on which so many people depend for a livelihood.  This disregard for the needs of the community has to be tackled.  This Bill provides an opportunity for the Minister and Deputies to comment on the state of play in regard to the development of Dublin, some of which is not good.</P>
    <P>Obviously taxpayers, who will be expected to pay for many of the proposals which have been voted through in a development-led fashion, will want answers to their questions.  The Minister, and Deputies, have said that one should not question the planning process for the entire country merely because there are problems in Dublin.  I accept that Dublin has the greatest number of planning problems but we must refer to what is happening elsewhere.  Trends throughout the country have contributed in no small way to the planning problems in County Dublin.  I am referring to policies pursued by various Governments which have inadvertently encouraged migration from rural areas, particularly along the west coast, to Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are now fewer people working on the land and more people are moving to Dublin, the big city, in search of employment.  In addition to leading to the depopulation of rural areas, the closure of schools, post offices, etc. and a breakdown of rural life, which is only too familiar to the people living in the areas affected, this trend is leading to longer housing waiting lists in Dublin and more problems in providing employment in Dublin which has a large population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind that local government will have to be reorganised if any progress is to be made in combating the problems to which I referred.  Local authority members need to be given powers similar to those enjoyed by local authority members in other countries if they are to act as proper representatives and not merely carry out instructions issued by central Government. In this context, consideration should be given to the issue of the dual mandate, into which the Minister might have some input, so as to further enhance the role of councillors and ensure that we have proper local government not only in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to create three new councils in the Dublin area, the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council, the Fingal council and the South Dublin council, while at the same time dissolving Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation. The dissolution of these councils will mark the end of an era in local government. This Bill is in many ways a followon from the Local Government Act, 1991 which set up three new committees and appointed three new managers in Dublin County Council.  The most far-reaching change in local government in Dublin was provided for in the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985 which transferred the Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle area from the Dublin city area to the Dublin county area and transferred the Ballymun area from the county area to the city area.  This reorganisation led to a substantial net loss in terms of land for Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to fully understand the implications of what is contained in this Bill <Col N="2116" /> one has to go back 30 years to when Dublin Corporation had the foresight to buy land cheaply in the Dublin county area ahead of the developers, speculators and rezoners.  The corporation built 11,000 local authority houses on this land with the approval of Dublin County Council and the Department of the Environment.  It also built the Tallaght town centre, which is a development showpiece, and provided much of the land for industrial development and employment creation in the Dublin county area.  The corporation also provided some of this land for amenities in the new estates in the county area.  We should pay tribute to the corporation planners who 30 years ago had the foresight to save the taxpayers of this country and the ratepayers of Dublin county and Dublin city millions of pounds by buying this land at that time.</P>
    <P>The availability of this land to Dublin Corporation allowed the corporation to switch its housing policy from one of building high rise flat developments to building standard three and four bedroom family housing units with front and back gardens and with open spaces for children to play and other areas that a community needs to develop.  Dublin Corporation's practice of building housing developments outside its boundaries was not uncommon.  Other local authorities throughout the country in Cork and Limerick also had a policy of building outside their administrative areas because the land was not available to them to build within their boundaries.</P>
    <P>At present there are 5,152 families on the Dublin city housing lists and there are 7,198 families on the Dublin city transfer list.  They are mainly people living in flats who wish to transfer to houses.  I say this as a member of Dublin City Council since 1979 and a former Lord Mayor and chairman of the City Council.  Every member of any local authority is aware that the housing needs of one's elected area are always one of the most pressing matters to be addressed.  They are also one of the issues that takes up most of the time of members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Dublin has had a housing crisis going <Col N="2117" /> back to the sixties and the seventies, and it was tackled in various ways at various times and with varying degrees of success. But the greatest success in terms of housing in Dublin city occurred during the period from the early to mid-eighties when the corporation, with the approval of Dublin County Council and the Department of the Environment, were building approximately 1,500 houses per year.</P>
    <P>In 1986, Dublin Corporation built over 1,600 houses, which was the highest housing output of any local authority in this country.  That represented the peak of the housing drive to tackle the housing needs in the city.  In 1986, Dublin city had substantially solved its housing needs.  Unfortunately, in 1987 that policy was reversed and the housing programme was halted and for many years few houses were built by Dublin Corporation in either the city or the county.  That led to a situation where once again we now have over 5,000 families on our city housing list.  I would acknowledge, however, that attempts are now being made to tackle that problem; the corporation hope to have 500 housing starts made this year and that programme will continue next year.</P>
    <P>In the county area to which I have referred, under the housing drive of the early eighties Dublin Corporation built 11,000 local authority houses in the Dublin County Council area.  Of those 11,000 houses, 7,500 remain tenancy dwellings available to Dublin Corporation. At an approximate estimate of £30,000 per house, they represent a value of £231 million.  Those 7,500 houses in the county area represent over 40 per cent of Dublin Corporation's total housing stock.  In recent years vacancies in dwellings have been the main source for housing families on the corporation waiting list.  The vacancies which arose in the county area accounted for over 70 per cent of the vacancies in Dublin Corporation's housing stock.  The withdrawal of this pool of vacancies from Dublin Corporation will make it almost impossible for it to tackle its housing needs. By comparison, Dublin County Council <Col N="2118" /> has 2,391 families on its waiting list with the same population approximately as the city.  With the establishment of the three new councils this means that each new council will have approximately 700 families on its housing list by comparison to Dublin city which has over 5,000 on its housing list and over 7,000 on its transfer list.  I say that merely to put the issue into perspective.</P>
    <P>In addition to the housing stock in the county the corporation also have 1,850 acres of land in the county area which it is proposed, under this new legislation, to transfer to the new local authorities. This land has been valued at £40 million and its loss to the corporation would be a further setback to their efforts to tackle the housing needs in the city.  One also fears what might happen to that land with Dublin County Council's policy of rezoning land willy nilly and one wonders what would happen to that land if it went into the ownership of the new local authorities.</P>
    <P>The corporation's housing stock in the county consists largely of houses built in recent years, whereas most of the corporation's housing stock in the city is much older.  A very high percentage of it is made up of flats, which are considerably more expensive to maintain than houses.  If the corporation loses its housing stock in the county, which now seems inevitable under the new legislation, we will need a clear housing policy, particularly in relation to the allocation of vacancies.  Financial arrangements would have to be put in place to compensate the corporation for the very heavy loss of income which would arise from these transfers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policies for allocating houses in both the city and county and the new county areas, at present both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have totally different schemes of letting and housing priorities.  Most local authorities would evolve a scheme of priorities taking into account the particular needs of its area.  Because of the demand for housing in the city, the corporation has evolved a scheme of priorities which takes into account various <Col N="2119" /> social factors.  There is a housing welfare section within the corporation made up of social workers, who carry out work in this area and who allocate priority on the housing list to families, taking into account their particular social housing needs and other social factors affecting those families.  Dublin County Council do not have a similar scheme on their list of priorities and I would be concerned that people in those situations might not be given sufficient consideration by the new local authorities.</P>
    <P>The policy for allocating houses and for drafting a scheme of priorities is the most urgent task facing the new regional authorities.  What is needed for the Dublin city and county areas is a common housing allocations policy and a common scheme of priorities so that people would have consideration for housing vacancies in the county area as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and I regard it as a rationalisation of a situation that exists at the present time.  I am not a great believer in the phrase that big is beautiful.  I am more concerned to have manageable areas in relation to the extension and the development of Dublin so that we are in a position to ensure that there are sufficiently manageable geographic areas in which we can provide good government for the entire city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the former Dublin County Council will now be divided into three administrative areas and that, by and large, the corporation will remain as it stands at the present time. This is a continuation of a long period of democratic local authority operation going back to 1837, when the first township of Rathmines was established and the other townships of Drumcondra, Pembroke, Dalkey and so on.  They were developed under the 1898 local government legislation and were followed on with the more recent legislation in 1985 and indeed the legislation that gave effect to this Bill, the 1991 legislation, where the various managers drew up the reports <Col N="2120" /> which we are now dealing with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that henceforth Dublin Corporation will be continuing the policy first enunciated in the Civic Charter of 1991, embarking on a policy of urban renewal so that we will develop inwards rather than outwards.  For example, we will not be seeking to extend the boundaries of Dublin Corporation's authority but rather will be seeking to develop and upgrade the city at its core. With that aim in mind we are seeking further residential development in the private sector by providing incentives along with the new commitment on the part of the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> development of housing in the inner city. We are concentrating in particular on eliminating dereliction, on building up areas in the city that had become derelict and totally unsatisfactory for human habitation, with the ultimate objective of once again having an inner living city where people can walk about day and night.  The provisions of this Bill will facilitate that development.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises major problems from the point of view of Dublin Corporation. The nub of the problem arises in Part V and the Third Schedule, Parts I and II which relate to the formulation of policy and programmes in functional areas along with the co-ordination of activities of the various local authorities and their managers.  The second problem arises in relation to the transfer of the assets of one principal local authority to the functional area of another.  That is a major concern to Dublin Corporation since the burden of such problems must fall on that local authority.  Its original policy had related to the inner city.  In the sixties its policy was to move outwards, to green field areas, and develop new housing estates and for example, the creation of the peripheral towns of Tallaght, Lucan and Blanchardstown.  That was where people wanted to live.  Of course, in the process Dublin Corporation acquired a considerable land bank for a reasonable amount of money.  In fact most of the land accumulated by Dublin Corporation &mdash; in excess of 1,800 acres is in its possession <Col N="2121" />&mdash; was acquired by way of two separate loans of £3 million.  The acquistion of that land now would constitute an enormous burden.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the problems caused by rezoning in the Dublin County Council area and the enormous profits made by speculators and property developers.  However, it has to be said that Dublin Corporation, had the foresight, using taxpayers' money and revenue collected from commercial and residential ratepayers, to acquire that pool of land for development.  Some of that land has been built on.  As my colleague, Deputy Kenny pointed out, there are 11,000 dwellings belonging to Dublin Corporation in the county area, which means that that authority allocates houses in that area to those on its waiting list.</P>
    <P>That land bank is needed for Dublin Corporation's city tenants.  Indeed, it is a stark fact that there are in excess of 5,000 people at present on Dublin Corporation's housing list compared with in the region of 2,300 in the entire Dublin County Council area.  As a result most of those on the housing list are given relatively new accommodation in the county.  That problem must be addressed but that has not been done in this Bill.  I do not want to talk about the matter of rents, or the tenant purchase revenue that would properly accrue to Dublin Corporation, but I wish to refer to a former housing allocation area of Dublin Corporation.  There is no provision in this Bill for a common housing list or how that problem is to be dealt with.  The Bill should have catered for that, alleviating Dublin Corporation's concerns and its ultimate responsibility to provide accommodation for its tenants.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the land acquired using ratepayers' money?  The presumption is it will be transferred either through agreement among the various local authorities or, alternatively, the Minister intervening by appointing somebody to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for independent arbitration or an appeals mechanism. That concerns me because we cannot <Col N="2122" /> forget that this land was acquired using ratepayers' money.  Indeed there is here a question of legal title.  Can a Minister unilaterally decide to transfer to another local authority land acquired, not through any departmental resource or funding but rather through the independent funding of Dublin Corporation?</P>
    <P>What is the need of Dublin County Council, which has approximately the same quantity of land in its ownership as Dublin Corporation, for that land?  Why should we add to the former's land pool? The Bill should specify how that land belonging to Dublin Corporation is to be used, what will be its ultimate fate?  For example, will we allow the three new local authorities to sell it off for private development?</P>
    <P>That would not be satisfactory because the land was purchased by city of Dublin ratepayers' money.  The Minister should address that matter.  We should remember that the three area managers in their report did not recommend that procedure. Rather they recommended that it be dealt with in a more coherent fashion within the existing local authority functional areas.  They did not recommend a transfer of those lands to any other local authority functional area.</P>
    <P>I perceive two major problems.  The first is in relation to the land bank.  Either there should be no provision for its transfer or, if there is to be provision made for such transfer, we must ensure its future usage is stipulated.  There must be a better mechanism than is prescribed in the Bill.  Second, we must deal with the housing needs of the local authority that will suffer by the transfer of those 11,000 dwellings to which I referred.  There should be some joint housing list drawn up for the entire city.  Perhaps that can be done under the auspices of the proposed regional authority.  These are loose ends not covered by the provisions of this Bill but which are exceedingly important for the citizens and tenants of this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that this Bill constitutes the final stage of Government policy begun in 1985 or, perhaps, earlier. Its provisions create three new local authorities <Col N="2123" /> to replace Dublin County Council. Many people are sad that Dublin County Council, set up as an administrative authority in the 1890s, is about to be abolished. In some respects I am inclined to the view that local government around Dublin needs more power delegated by the Department rather than more local authorities.</P>
      <P>While many provisions of the Bill are welcome others give rise to many queries, for example, whether they will lead to increased efficiency or even greater confusion than at present.  Under the present system there had been very little co-operation between councillors representing the city and county of Dublin although there was co-operation and co-ordination at management level.  Sometimes it was hard to see it but theoretically it was there under the city and county manager. Obviously there has to be co-ordination. The various services such as housing, roads, sewerage and water have to be provided at individual council level but others will have to be provided on a regional basis where they will be looked after by one authority and contracted to others.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the century Dublin people lived in very overcrowded conditions. We have now moved from that trend and the population of the city and county has grown considerably during the past century.  People sought improved living standards and moved to the developing suburbs.  For many years that resulted in the city boundary being extended so that houses were always built in the city.  Eventually people worried that, if the trend continued, the county would shrink.  The county council fought back and asked that these boundary changes be scrapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last major change in the early 1950s led to a considerable number of extra houses being built in the city area. Since then, Dublin Corporation, which has always been under pressure to house its citizens, has had to buy land and build houses in the county.  We also had boundary changes in 1985 and, overall, the city lost ground.  They gained some places <Col N="2124" /> such as Ballymun in my own constituency but they lost Baldoyle, Sutton and so on and overall there was no great change.</P>
    <P>Following the last major change in the 1950's Dublin Corporation bought land in the county and built on it.  It gave some to private builders so that there would be a good social mix.  In all Dublin Corporation built 11,000 houses in the county area for which it obtained approval from the county council and the Department of the Environment.  At present 7,500 of those 11,000 houses are tenancy dwellings with the rent paid weekly.  The remainder are being bought out by the tenants.  The 7,500 houses comprise about 40 per cent of the total corporation housing stock, excluding flats.  The bulk of the vacancies arise in the county.</P>
    <P>Most of the corporation housing tenants in the city area have been there a long time.  They rarely move from the area with the result that very few vacancies arise.  When they do there is enormous demand for them.  If these 11,000 houses had not been built by Dublin Corporation, the equivalent of five or six Ballymuns would have been the only option open to it.</P>
    <P>As city councillors the part of the Bill about which we are concerned is section 35 and the Third Schedule.  I should like to comment on the two main aspects: land and housing.  Housing falls into the 7,500 rented dwellings category and the balance are tenant purchase houses. Most of the 3,500 tenant purchase houses may have been fully bought out at this stage, I do not have the figures.  Deputy Seán Kenny gave the housing waiting list figures earlier.  Dublin Corporation has just over 5,000 on its housing waiting list and in excess of 7,000 on its transfer list whereas the county has only 2,400 on its housing list.  If all these houses are transferred to the authority in which they exist how will the city provide housing for its citizens in future?</P>
    <P>Opening the Second Stage debate the Minister spoke about being fair in whatever arrangement was arrived at.  If you have to hand over everything there is nothing fair about that.  For a start Dublin Corporation will be at the loss of the rent <Col N="2125" /> from the 7,500 dwellings.  The point has often been made that there is no net revenue from local authority dwellings and that we spend more on maintenance than we collect in rent.  That is true but it is caused by many factors.  As we discovered in 1988, if you sell half the houses maintenance costs are not halved because roads, parks, water, sewerage and so on are all charged against the maintenance budget in Dublin Corporation.  Even when half the houses are sold many of those bills remain.  When we say we spend more on maintenance than we collect that is not true.  By and large the houses in the county are relatively new, built about 20 years ago.  They are in better condition than many of the older houses in the city and there is a net revenue from them.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation built in the county because land was not available to cater for housing needs.  I accept that small infill sites are being developed but this depends on the funding available from the Department.  One can certainly build in the inner city but not on the scale of ten years ago when we built 1,500 houses per year.  Now that the Department is giving more money to the corporation it is looking at sites.  Most of the plans submitted to us are in respect of small schemes, they involve professional work and absorb much of the time of the corporation officials.</P>
    <P>We do not want to go back to the situation which prevailed at the turn of the century, people cannot be asked to live in overcrowded housing accommodation and we cannot adopt the European style of building high rise dwellings. People in Ireland do not like to live in dwellings which are 15 or 25 storeys high.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what happens, the houses in the county will have to be available solely to the corporation or through some type of joint list for a number of years to allow time for a replacement scheme.  We cannot allow this to turn into something like the sale of the century.  If houses are transferred to the county some money must be handed over to allow the corporation to acquire sites and build replacements within the city area.  The Bill refers to a scheme being set up.  The <Col N="2126" /> managers will have a meeting to make arrangements and next year or the year after they will be told whether there will be a cash handover.  That seems very strange as ideally, all that should have happened before the legislation goes through.  As somebody said, the dowery should be known before the marriage takes place.</P>
    <P>The second category is where tenants are buying their houses from Dublin Corporation under the tenant purchase scheme.  At present 3,500 tenants buy their houses from Dublin Corporation which in turn funds its capital works and refurbishment programme from that money.  There is no logical reason to change the present arrangement as it would involve unnecessary bureaucracy. It would be wrong to take the money from Dublin Corporation and there is no logic in interfering with the present arrangements under the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>There are no Dublin County councillors in the Chamber this morning, but having listened to them I accept they have a genuine gripe about housing.  They represent constituents who are Dublin Corporation tenants in the county areas. They believe the channels of communication between county councillors and the corporation are not good.  There is probably some validity in that assertion.  Dublin County Council has houses in Ballymun and Santry and I have experienced the reverse situation although on a much smaller scale.</P>
    <P>The land banks are a different matter. There is no sense in forcing Dublin Corporation to hand over its lands in the county areas.  The corporation has over 1,800 acres of land in the county, I understand the county council has a similar amount and that a couple of hundred acres is in joint ownership.  There have been times in the past when Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation agreed that land should be taken into public ownership and, as neither was able to buy it on its own, it was felt that the best thing to do was to take the land into joint public ownership.  They always cooperated in matters of that kind.  The <Col N="2127" /> corporation land bank is valued at £40 million and it is obvious that, as the county owns 1,800 acres, it has more than it needs for its short term use.  Why is it suggested that corporation lands should be handed over?  I know county councillors are much more experienced than city councillors at making land deals and they have pulled many a stroke when rezoning land for developers.  Is it proposed that the corporation's land be handed over so that the county councillors can continue with the fun and games of land deals?  The Department has criticised the decisions on rezoning yet it appears to take the side of the county council by handing lands over to it &mdash; that is the way city councillors see it.  We must also ask if the county council will be free to dispose of these assets which the corporation originally acquired from its own funds.  If this land is handed over to the county council, ratepayers in the county council area will benefit.  It appears that if the land is handed over instead of being acquired by statutory order, the county council will be free to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposed regional authorities will be given real powers, otherwise they will be just talking shops. Under the present arrangement there is a lack of co-ordination and with four authorities it could be far worse unless the regional authorities have real power.</P>
    <P>Recently the city councillors went on a bus tour of the city-county boundary areas.  Many councillors do not seem to know where the boundaries, are but others seem to be acquainted with them. The itinerant sites, some official but mostly unofficial, are sited on the boundaries, which creates problems.  There is a similar problem with Dunsink tiphead which is located a couple of hundred yards inside the county boundary.  The county council is not very worried about this because it does not have houses nearby but the corporation houses are very near it.  I wish there was provision in this Bill which would allow any local authority to demand a say in the running <Col N="2128" /> of any facility within half a mile of its boundary.</P>
    <P>A recent trend is that people want to live in the city.  However, if we stop furtheir development in the county area all the development will take place in the city.  I accept some sites have to be developed but church land and lands belonging to institutions, green areas around Glasnevin and Drumcondra &mdash; I could rattle off six or seven institutions &mdash; have all been sold recently for development.  It is now getting to the stage that there will not be a blade of grass in the city, that is going from one extreme to another.  Certainly we have to develop derelict sites but we should not build on green field sites.  I know that Dublin people still want to live in the suburbs and we should foster that trend.</P>
    <P>City councillors are worried about the fact that under the Bill there is neither a system of arbitration nor appeals system against decisions.  Having built up a land bank and a portfolio of houses over the years councillors feel very strongly that they should not be taken from the corporation and if there is some arrangement in future years for the transfer of this property there should be a system of arbitration and appeal so that justice will be seen to be done.  Otherwise the city ratepayers may take the matter to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this Bill as I served for 13½ years on Dublin County Council and immediately prior to my present appointment I was its chairman.  While I was delighted to be appointed it was one of the sadnesses that I had to instantly leave an authority in which I had been so deeply involved.  I was also involved in the process of devolution, which has come a long way in Dublin County Council. The area committees have worked reasonably well and this is the final stage in a process that began in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If local government is to mean anything it must mean that local people and those they elect make the decision on services and bring their local knowledge to bear on the decisions that affect the <Col N="2129" /> local community.  It means delivering services to people.  Up to now Dublin County Council has not met within its own functional area and in many cases people from Balbriggan are making decisions on land in Shankill and <i>vice versa</i>.  The break-up of the second largest public body into manageable units which can work is timely.  With 78 members it is larger than the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Dividing the council into three local councils is only one part of the process of devolution.  We need to provide information and access to council services in local areas and there are moves in that direction in County Dublin.  In local shopping centres people should be able to gain access in a one-stop-shop to all the services of the local council without having to go to an office remote from where they live.  Local government officials should work in the heart of the community which they serve and bring local knowledge to bear in their work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves by the Government towards the devolution of power and responsibility to local authorities. The single biggest complaint by local councillors is their lack of power, for instance in relation to road traffic functions.  Decisions about where to locate double yellow lines or pedestrian crossings were always referred to Garda headquarters.  I am glad that road traffic legislation transfers that function from the Garda Síochána to the local authority.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with a 78 member public body is that if everybody wants to speak for three minutes, which is the standard speaking slot to discuss one issue, it takes three and a half hours. Members were being disenfranchised in not being able to speak and the sheer volume of business meant that people who were not full-time politicians were being disenfranchised.  Local government is meant to be the amateur tier of local government involving ordinary citizens in running their communities.  Such people were being disenfranchised because their employers would not allow them two or three days a week of to provide virtually full-time local government service.  That <Col N="2130" /> has affected the quality of decision-making and the nature of participation in Dublin County Council.  The inability to be present two or three days a week has probably deamaged rezoning policy.  Some of the decisions made by Dublin County Council on rezoning do not represent the wishes of the communities of the full council as some councillors are unable to attend council meetings for two or three days a week.  Votes can be called at any time and are not scheduled as they tend to be in this House.  The decision represents the vote of the people who were present at the meeting rather than the council as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am profoundly concerned at the orgy of land rezoning which has taken place in County Dublin over the past number of months.  Most of it had more to do with rewarding land owners or development companies who speculated in land than with the ordinary planning and development of the capital city.</P>
    <P>In the city, which still has substantial dereliction and under-used land and buildings in the centre, and thousands of acres of scheduled development land not yet built on, including land for which there is valid planning permission, the effect of this rezoning orgy is to divert limited development from rebuilding the city centre and planned development of the suburbs to vital green belt areas. There is limited development taking place in Dublin which is no longer the fast growing urban centre it was in the sixties and seventies.  Between 1986 and 1991, the population of the greater Dublin area grew by only 0.4 per cent. Zoning new areas for development in a haphazard way can only be at the expense of the city centre and areas already earmarked for redevelopment.  If the signal to developers is that if they put enough pressure on the right political parties they can buy a green field site for £6,000 an acre and on rezoning subsequently have it revalued at £60,000 an acre, is it any surprise that we do not have builders developing the derelict sits in Dublin city centre?</P>
    <P>A prime residential site in Dublin city which should be developed before we <Col N="2131" /> encroach on the green belt around the city is that at Charlemont Street Bridge, a site of about eight acres which has been derelict for the past 15 years.  Why would developers buy a site like that and rebuild the city centre when they can buy land cheap and get their political friends to rezone it so that they can make a killing?</P>
    <P>The rezoning orgy represented a sustained attack on the green belt between the city and the mountains from Firhouse to Shankill.  At Ballycullen Farm 360 acres have been rezoned and a whole new area at Scholarstown has been rezoned. The Knocklyon community simply cannot take the amount of traffic already there.  People feel trapped in their homes and cannot get out in the mornings to get to work.  The county council is proposing a huge development on very sloping ground at the foothills of the mountains.</P>
    <P>In the last round there was rezoning at Ballinteer just below the Blackglen Road on the far side of the Southern Cross motorway line which is meant to be the development boundary for the city.  The village of Stepaside will now be engulfed by greater Dublin.  There has been rezoning of land on the Burrow Road for three development sites and rezoning of land to the south side of Stepaside village.  The Southern Cross motorway line is again being breached here and this will set a precedent.  Ultimately will we see the city stretching all the way to the Wicklow border at the Scalp?  The Carrickmines valley, a beautiful scenic amenity right up to the doorstep of Tully church, an historic monument with an ancient cross, has been rezoned although this area is a vital green belt for the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>My local village of Dundrum risks losing its economic and commercial viability through the decision to rezone the Pye lands at Crazy Prices for commercial development, including a major shopping complex.  This is likely to move the commercial heart of this area from the historic village centre with its attractive Victorian shops to a faceless modern shopping centre at the motorway junction at Crazy Prices.  That will destroy the heart of my community despite the <Col N="2132" /> efforts of local business people to renovate the village with &ldquo;the greening of Dundrum&rdquo; project.  I feel very strongly about that.</P>
    <P>I fear that the division of County Dublin into three administrative counties will simply multiply the rezoning frenzy by three, unless the new regional authority takes on the responsibility for developing a framework plan for the county as a whole.  The regional authority should look at the development needs bearing in mind population projections for the greater Dublin area and assign any development land between the four new administrative entities, Fingal, South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin Corporation in the city centre.  I hope we can start by rebuilding the city centre and eliminating the derelict sites that mark down town Dublin, what should be the heart of our city.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I have been at pains to put measures on urban renewal into the National Development Plan and we do not want to see it thwarted by the rezoning frenzy in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>When the framework plan is agreed individual councils will decide on development using local knowledge.  If the establishment of three local authorities multiplies rezoning by three it will result in great damage to the city.  I urge the Minister, in considering the powers of regional authorities, to ensure that they have responsibility for co-ordinating services and co-ordinating a framework strategy for overall development planning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to Dublin Corporation housing in the county area and to that body's land bank in the county area.  In my 13 years on Dublin County Council I discovered that one of the biggest causes of heartache for the council was the position of Dublin Corporation tenants living in the Dublin County Council area who elected people to that Council.  Their main problems were associated with the maintenance and management, of their estates by their landlord, Dublin Corporation, who was <Col N="2133" /> not answerable to them.  It was answerable to Dublin Corporation councillors but not to the councillors the people of Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin elected.  Effectively, Dublin Corporation has been acting like an absentee landlord in such areas.  I welcome the proposal to move the ownership, management, control and maintenance of such housing stock to the local authority in which such houses are situated so that in voting for local representatives the people can vote for a person who can follow up their queries at council level. It would be nonsensical to move the existing housing stock and leave the land bank in place so that Dublin Corporation could create similar problems to those that existed in the past.  The 1991 Act provides for financial transfers between local authorities and that provision should cover some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation pioneered the development of inner city housing and urban renewal in Dublin.  Their schemes at the Coombe, in Ringsend and City Quary are models but the private sector was slow to follow suit.  It would be regrettable if such commitment to the city centre is abandoned as many sites in Dublin city centre could be developed.  I would like Dublin Corporation's building plans to concentrate on its own area.</P>
    <P>The residential qualification was repealed in the 1988 Act.  It is now open to anybody living in the Dublin Corporation functional area to apply for housing in the Dublin County Council area.  The Dublin regional authorities should coordinate the points and applications system, and the letting priority schemes of the four new local authorities which will come into operation on 1 January so that we can operate a common housing list and housing stock from public money. That would give people living in the corporation area an opportunity to apply for current corporation-owned housing stock in the Dublin County Council area and alleviate many of the problems associated with housing.  In ten year's time the people applying for housing will be today's teenagers growing up in Tallaght <Col N="2134" /> and Blanchardstown.  They will be seeking housing in the areas in which they grew up.  We are dealing with a transitory phenomenon where the main housing vacancies are in the county area and the main housing list is in the city area.  In future years the major housing list will be in the county area because that is where the young population of today live.</P>
    <P>I represent Dublin South, a constituency that will be divided between two councils, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The boundaries separating those two regions were selected in 1985, that choice had more to do with Fine Gael's electoral prospects in the 1985 local elections than with selecting rational boundaries.  In dealing with a matter as serious as local government division we must select boundaries that people recognise.  In my constituency people are not aware that when they cross a small stream at the triumphal arch on the Dodder Park Road they move from the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area to the South Dublin area.  That type of boundary makes no sense.  At a minimum I urge that the boundary between those two areas should be Grange Road which people would recognise as a real boundary. It currently runs behind the Loreto estate on the Nutgrove to Clarkestown Road.  That boundary does not bear any relationship to other boundaries in the area.  The most sensible boundary on the east-west line between Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin is the Dodder River which is recognised as a natural boundary between communities. That would make more sense in the long term.  I appreciate the difficulty of redrawing boundaries when dealing with existing elected local authority members. For example, those elected to the Tallaght-Old Bawn area represent the Whitechurch and Firhouse area on one side of the river and areas in west Tallaght, such as Old Bawn and Killinarden, on the other side.  They are not natural communities.  I appreciate the difficulties associated with changing local government boundaries between elections, but for something as serious as permanent councils I urge that the boundary <Col N="2135" /> between the South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown areas be re-examined so that we can establish councils to whom people may owe an allegiance and have boundaries to which people can relate.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in relation to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area arise also because of the amalgamation of the old Borough of Dún Laoghaire area with areas of County Dublin.  That should be a new area in its own right.  It is unfortunate that the Dún Laoghaire name will continue to be used, in a sense it is similar to the Borough of Dún Laoghaire taking over the Rathdown area, places such as Shankill and Churchtown.  People in parts of Churchtown which have been in the Dublin County Council area for years are being moved to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area without even moving house.  People should be allowed to develop an affinity with their areas.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that some of the legacies of the separateness of the Dún Leoghaire area persist in this legislation, even in a minor sense.  For a new local authority to be successful one area should not have a head start on others.  If places such as Dundrum, Churchtown, Clonskeagh and Shankill are to feel part of the new unit, rather than taken over by the Dún Laoghaire area, they should be placed on a similar footing.  Those are my personal comments, but they reflect the feeling of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>People might wonder why I should speak on the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, 1993, but I am interested in any local government reform.  I can relate to many of the problems in Dublin.  For example, in Waterford city many local authority houses are situated in the Kilkenny County Council area and this legislation deals with a similar problem.  I have been interested in local authority reform since I was elected to Waterford City Council in 1985 but, unfortunately, I had to vacate that position on becoming Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of power given to elected members of local authorities. <Col N="2136" /> In 1989, when I was elected to the Dáil for the first time, my parliamentary party set up a sub-committee to examine the question of local government reform and make recommendations.  As part of this study the sub-committee travelled to the United Kingdom to visit city, county, district and even parish councils.  It struck me that the leader of a council there, the equivalent of a mayor or chairman of a county council there, had more power than anyone else.  The equivalent of a city or county manager was a chief executive and the contrast was striking.  This person had to consult at all times with the leader of the council.  I would like to see us move in that direction because local representatives do not have sufficient powers.  Whether we like them or loathe them they must go before the electorate every five or six years and they stand or fall on their record.  It is not right that city and county managers, secretaries and engineers should have all the power.</P>
    <P>It was once put to me that the amount of time local representatives spend at meetings or at council offices is the equivalent of one week of the year whereas these officials are always present.  With this in mind how can we compete?  It is practically impossible for a local representative to acquire the same knowledge given that officials tend to give minimum information.  Perhaps the answer is to make greater resources available.</P>
    <P>We have also fallen into the trap in recent years of abolishing various bodies of which local representatives are members.  We are moving more and more in the direction of not allowing local representatives to be members of the local bodies that remain.  This is a mistake and points to a lack of democracy.  The many interest groups who wish to be represented on these bodies are not answerable to anybody while public representatives are.</P>
    <P>In this debate the problems associated with rezoning in Dublin have been highlighted. I share the concerns expressed. While this leaves much to be desired at the end of the day the people who make the decisions will have to face the <Col N="2137" /> electorate and if they do not do what the electorate wants them to do they will be voted out of office.  They must bear this in mind.  It is wrong that others can dictate what the policy should be given that they are not answerable to anybody. While I do not agree with much of what has happened in Dublin, where various tracts of land have been rezoned, probably, for the wrong reasons, the people who are making the decisions will have to answer to the people.</P>
    <P>Some speakers suggested there was a need to change traffic by-laws in Dublin. Similar problems are being experienced in Waterford city.  In Dublin if the roads committee decides to restrict traffic and parking, through the use of yellow lines, at a particular location it will have to seek the approval of the local Garda chief superintendent who has to consult with the Garda Commissioner, no less.  Why do we elect people to do a job if we will not allow them to do it?  Local councillors, who are elected by the people, should make the decisions and they should stand or fall on their record.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the question of boundaries.  Given that three new county councils are being established in Dublin boundaries will have to be changed.  In Waterford we have been seeking an extension of the city boundaries. There is a large number of local authority houses on the opposite side of the boundary in south Kilkenny.  For historic reasons, development has only taken place on one side of the river.  In this regard I should mention there is a need for a second river crossing.  More important, the city boundaries need to be extended.  While I am aware the establishment of regional authorities should lead to better planning it has been shown that there is a need for this extension. About 15 years ago the boundary on the opposite side was extended to include land for which Waterford County Council was responsible and there is a need for a further extension on this side also.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill there will be a mechanism to decide the new boundaries in Dublin.  I presume, however, that any Minister for the Environment would be <Col N="2138" /> slow to make changes elsewhere given that one group will say one thing while another group will say the exact opposite. Therefore, we need a new mechanism to allow orderly development proceed.</P>
    <P>On the question of regional councils, on Second Stage the Minister said that the purpose of these authorities was to promote the co-ordination of public, including local authority, services.  He said the order establishing them will provide for a significant role in relation to the review and co-ordination of development plans.  It would be eminently sensible to make arrangements to allow adjoining local authorities to communicate with each other.  In this regard Waterford Corporation and Kilkenny County Council have a good working relationship and cooperate with each other when it comes to the provision of water, sewage disposal and other services.  I am sure the same is true in Dublin but it would make sense to put a mechanism in place to allow regional authorities communicate with each other.  It would be in everybody's interests to ensure that the services are properly developed in the future.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authority housing, members of local authorities should be given more responsibility.  I often wonder why it costs so much to build a local authority house.  It would probably be cheaper for a local authority, if it wished to provide a scheme of 20 houses, to go to McInerney's to buy a block of houses.  That needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The local representatives should be given more responsibility and power and they will stand or fall on what they do with that.  Broadly speaking, this Bill is welcome as is all local authority reform, but it does not go far enough.  However, at least it is a start and I hope we will continue to make progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to say a few words on local government issues.  This new initiative of the Government to change local authority administration is a good idea.  There is a need to ensure that local authority administration meets the needs of the <Col N="2139" /> increasing population of Dublin city and the neighbouring lands and the growth in business, trade, etc.  Therefore, the reorganisation of Dublin County Council into three separate administrative centres of Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin must be welcomed as a progressive step.  I am sure, however, that many would argue strongly against the new system, that is a natural response to any new idea. Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have done excellent work in the past, but we must move with the times.</P>
      <P>At one time local authorities depended to a great extent on national revenue. However, in the last few years, because of expenditure problems at national level, they get less money from national Government by way of rate support grants, etc.  This puts pressure on local authorities to find the money locally. People are finding it difficult to finance both local and national expenditure, they feel they are being trebly charged, they pay income tax, VAT and rates, yet they have to finance projects at local level as well.  The Government must look seriously at the question of local authority expenditure.</P>
      <P>In my home town of Navan there is traffic chaos because of increasing trade and commerce in the area.  Meath County Council is seeking approval from national government for a new spur road and bridge there.  The amount of time lost by business and working people trying to get in and out of the town is unbelievable.  I hope the Minister will look seriously at this application and that immediate structural funding is allotted.</P>
      <P>The new body in Fingal should acknowledge the advantages of the roads in County Meath which are financed by Meath people.  I am not speaking about national primary routes, etc, I am speaking about county roads which are in a scandalous condition because of heavy traffic through our county to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we should, I do not know if anybody would object to that, but if people can see the advantages of using toll roads to do their business and are prepared to pay, I see nothing wrong with the idea.</P>
      <P>There is a movement of population from the Dublin area to County Meath and that puts tremendous pressure on finance in County Meath.  Sewerage schemes cannot cope with the increasing population in towns like Navan, Kells, Trim, Ashbourne and Dunboyne and Meath County Council needs money to cater for that.  One might say that certain sections of County Meath should be incorporated in this Bill and linked up with the new Fingal administration by way of a joint venture.</P>
      <P>The Government is shifting the cost of implementing European Community regulations to local level.  The cost of lighting, pollution control, improving water quality etc., must be paid for by the local authority; we are moving money urgently needed in one area to other areas; and we must do so under EC regulations.</P>
      <P>There is a two-thirds grant for disabled persons for essential repairs to property, some of these people are old age pensioners or single people with small incomes.  They cannot raise the other one-third and, therefore, cannot avail of those grants.</P>

    <P>Local authorities are finding it more difficult to raise finance from local business to provide necessary services in their areas.  This is understandable when one considers that those businesses are expected to pay tax in respect of employment and business.  The Minister should note the points I made.  I support the Government's proposals in regard to local authorities.  It would be a worthwhile exercise if local authorities in the next 12 months were to consider how administration might be improved at local level.  If local authorities continue in the manner in which they have been operating for the past 20 years, many will not survive.  They must change their administrative practices.  I hope the <Col N="2141" /> people will benefit from the proposed new administrations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I know the Minister of State has a keen interest in housing people on local authority housing lists and in recent times has shown a particular interest in the efforts of Dublin Corporation in that regard.  Although the Government has reversed the trend of recent Governments by providing finance for the building of a substantial number of local authority dwellings, the Bill may have a retrograde effect in Dublin city.  That is a matter of extreme concern to me, other members of the city council and the officials who deal with the people on the local authority housing waiting list.  I am referring to the provision under which land and houses in the county council area will be transferred from Dublin Corporation to Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 5,152 families on the Dublin Corporation housing waiting list and a further 7,100 families on its transfer list.  The transfer list is often not considered but it is significant because many of those families live in grossly overcrowded conditions in flat complexes. In many instances the conditions are Dickensian.  Very slow progress has been made in the refurbishing of the flats due to a lack of finance and many dwellers wish to move to houses.  The Minister is aware of this problem and members of the city council and I discussed this matter with him on many occasions.  Each year 60 to 70 per cent of house vacancies for those on the Dublin Corporation housing and transfer lists arise in the county area.  That is a significant figure in respect of Dublin Corporation's attempts to house people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are 2,391 families on the Dublin County Council housing list.  In excess of 30 per cent of the corporation's rented houses are currently in the county area and, significantly, only 317 people on the corporation's housing list reside in the county area.  The majority of people who are homeless or in need of adequate accommodation in Dublin live in the city area, Dublin Corporation <Col N="2142" /> area.  The potential to rehouse those people lies largely in houses for which Dublin Corporation sought loans to build in the county area.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has approximately 1,850 acres of undeveloped land, some of it serviced, in the county area.  The bulk of that land is zoned for housing purposes.  It is significant that the money to acquire that land was borrowed and repaid and that land represents the city's assets.  The county council has a land bank available to it.  The implication is that if that land is passed to it, it will sell it because it does not appear to have any pressing need for a land bank when it has already a similar resource.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, suggested that housing lists are transitory and in future the bulk of the housing waiting list will be made up of young families in the county area.  That may be true, but how far into the future did the Minister envisage that would be the position?  Based on Dublin Corporation's up-to-date figures which I quoted, that will not be in the near future, but in the far distant future.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate precisely how Dublin Corporation's housing and transfer lists will be catered for if the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I disagreed with the policies of the last two Fianna Fáil dominated Governments, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government and the earlier Fianna Fáil Government, who used some of the councillors and TDs who were of the same opinion as me, to force Dublin Corporation to sell its land bank in the inner city.</P>
    <P>Even though policy has changed and we are told we should be building in the city, the last Fianna Fáil dominated Government forced the corporation to sell the bulk of its land, certainly its best sites in the inner city, for private developments. If this Bill is implemented, a combination of the two policies will leave Dublin Corporation without a significant land bank in the city or county area.  I do not know how Dublin Corporation or Dublin City Council will meet its responsibilities as a housing authority to <Col N="2143" /> the families and people on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>This matter will have to be addressed before the Bill is implemented.  If not, I hope the members of the Labour and Fianna Fáil groups on Dublin City Council, who are also Members of this House, will oppose the full implementation of the Bill.  They have been talking a lot at Dublin City Council meetings about the implications of the Bill and how strongly they are opposed to it.  Indeed a Labour councillor called a special meeting of the city council in the last couple of weeks, instructing the city manager and his officials to be present, to protest and express alarm at the implications for Dublin city and the people on the housing lists of the introduction of this Bill.  I hope that is not a PR exercise for the Labour and Fianna Fáil councillors on the city council.</P>

      <P>Land rezoning in Dublin seems to be as newsworthy as the weather.  An in-depth study should be carried out not alone in Dublin city but in towns and villages, of derelict sites and buildings with a view to getting them back into use rather than moving to new sites.  The time has come for a complete re-examination of our housing needs. The health board in my area is co-operating with the local authority in providing the best type of housing for the needs of the old and homeless.  For years the trend in regard to house building has been to erect in each housing estate a number of old people's dwellings consisting of one or two rooms.  The trend has changed in <Col N="2146" /> my region to provide a group of houses for old people where they can be serviced by the district health nurse and social workers, it is a trend that should continue in the future.</P>
      <P>Even though there is an inflation rate of less than 2 per cent the cost of services, water, sewerage, fire fighting or waste disposal is increasing.  The cost of implementing EC directives, particularly those relating to public water supplies and waste disposal, is prohibitive.  The revenue accruing from such services does not meet the costs of providing an adequate service.  Most local authorities are now moving towards the provision of underground water supplies rather than surface water supplies as there is less pollution from farms, industries, etc.  There are huge costs involved in the provision of adequate water supply and treatment facilities to ensure a proper quality of water.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to speed limits.  I agree that local authority members and managers would be the most competent people to deal with this issue.  The procedure for increasing or decreasing speed limits is very drawn out.  The proposed limit has to be approved by the Garda authorities and a regulation has to be brought before the House for approval before the speed limit can be implemented.  This procedure could be short circuited if local authorities were given the power to implement speed limits.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the extension of boundaries.  In many towns half of the local authority houses are located outside the urban boundary.  For reasons best known to themselves, the local authority have failed to extend the boundaries. Local authorities should have one housing waiting list rather than having separate lists, which can give rise to much duplication and the need for investigation by housing officers in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to contribute to the debate but I felt I had to reply to Deputy Gregory, who lectured Members on this side of the House. Deputy Leonard referred to the so-called <Col N="2147" />&ldquo;Gregory Plan&rdquo;.  In 1982, when Fianna Fáil was negotiating with Deputy Gregory, whose support it needed to form a Government, it took a plan outlining its proposals for Dublin city off a shelf, where it had lain for many years, and dusted it.  The plan was mainly composed by a former Member of this House, Martin O'Donoghue, but it became known as the Gregory plan.  Deputy Gregory has been given credit for this great plan, but he had no input whatsoever into it.  He lectured people on this side of the House about PR, but I know he has certain friends who are very anxious to help and promote him.</P>
      <P>The loss of land by Dublin Corporation to the new county councils will be a tremendous blow to Dublin.  People like my father, who served on Dublin Corporation from 1930 to 1967, supported the purchase of a land bank during the sixties to promote housing for the people of Dublin city.  People sometimes forget that in 1932 approximately 100,000 people were living six to 14 to a room in Dublin city, which had the worst slums of any city in Europe.  The only city it could be compared with in terms of misery was Calcutta, where people died on the streets.  Great progress has been made in improving the housing conditions in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>When Dublin Corporation purchased land in the county it was with the intention of housing people in the Dublin city area.  As has already been said, there are approximately 5,500 on the corporation's housing waiting list.  What will I say to people who come to me asking to be housed?  I will have to tell them to go to a county councillor, because the corporation no longer has a housing department as such.  I cannot make representations to the corporation on their behalf and the land has been handed over to the new councils.  These people will be disenfranchised by this Bill.  The Minister should look again at what he is proposing in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why there cannot be greater co-operation between the corporation and the new councils.  Some <Col N="2148" /> people will regard the new regional councils as their local power centres.  This will be done at the expense of the people of Dublin city.  The Minister needs to look again at the Bill.  The former members of Dublin Corporation, including a member of the Cabinet, in this House could advise the Minister on his proposals in regard to Dublin Corporation.  He is proposing to take away its housing function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the 1991 census, the population of Dublin county is approximately 550,000.  The major changes in population over the past number of years have necessitated the introduction of this Bill, which provides for the establishment of three new county councils &mdash; Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  As a Deputy from a neighbouring county, I would be very anxious to see co-operation between the new councils and the councils in the neighbouring counties.  Local authorities have a lot in common, but the co-operation necessary to make our local government system more meaningful and democratic has not existed for the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years a lot of progress has been made in providing new motorways.  To a large extent these motorways can cause great inconvenience to the people living in the counties in which they are built; motorists from other counties tend to benefit more from them. In this connection I would refer to the Newbridge bypass, a fine motorway, which is mainly used by people travelling through County Kildare but who do not stop there.  We have erected appropriate lighting along that road which is very helpful to those leaving Dublin and driving through Kildare.  Unfortunately, Kildare County Council must foot the bill for the lighting, not the Department of the Environment and for the coming year that lighting will cost £50,000.</P>

      <P>In Kildare we are being asked to provide a service that is used mainly by those who live outside the county and we are expected to foot the bill for that service. That cannot be tolerated and it is unfair to expect any local authority to take on that task.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to address this matter.</P>
      <P>Anyone who travels through Kildare will know that major road works are in operation there at present.  The Leixlip-Maynooth-Kilcock bypass is proceeding and the Newbridge bypass was opened earlier this year.  The Kildare bypass will be opened also in the not too distant future.  However, in regard to the stretch of road from Kilcock to Kinnegad, we are paying for the services of the engineers who will plan the road that will bypass Kinnegad and no compensation is available to Kildare County Council for that.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a Bill which proposes to establish three new county councils in Dublin and I hope those councils will learn from some of the difficulties we are experiencing and that there will be greater co-operation between neighbouring authorities.  It is only common sense that Dublin County Council, with approximately 78 members, should be broken up.  With such a large number it can be quite difficult for members to have a meaningful discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to participate in this debate for several reasons.  I welcome the Bill and I am glad to say that when I had responsibility in this area in the 1980s it was decided to reorganise local authorities. The earlier part of the reorganisation took place in various towns around the country but the proposals which are now before us were also included in that reorganisation.</P>
      <P>The initiative for that reorganisation emanated mainly from those who were demanding more local democracy in the various towns in the county of Dublin which were only represented by county council members on Dublin County Council.  We all recall the strong demands from people living in areas like Tallaght which had a population, as we were told on that occasion, larger than the city of Limerick.  They were demanding their own local authority where their voices could be heard.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of Dublin County Council, which now has more than 75 members, required that something be done about the unwieldy council which presently represents that area.  Dividing the council into three local councils would approximate to the numbers which represent county councils in rural constituencies and counties.  Therefore, it would appear that the demand is not as great now, judging by the comments of some of the local authority members in this county and city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach at the time, the former Deputy, Garret FitzGerald, was very much involved in the drawing up of the constituencies and I hope that the members of his party will recall that he had quite a large input into decisions concerning the size of the various boundaries, including streams and roads etc., which should be included in the plan. <Col N="2152" /> Indeed, he was very conscious of the names that should be given to these new councils.  At the time it was easy to come up with names such as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal but I am unhappy with the name that is to be given to south-west Dublin.  There are very obvious landmarks in that area after which that local authority could be named.  I am sure it will be brought to a conclusion very shortly.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this debate since I represent County Wicklow which borders the Dublin County Council area.  I am glad I also represent part of County Kildare, which abuts the western part of the functional area of one of the new local authorities to be established under the provisions of this Bill. Indeed, the decisions implicit in the provisions of this Bill do not stop at the borders of Dublin but will have an effect on a much larger area.  They will have their effect on the counties surrounding Dublin.  In my short contribution I shall be endeavouring to examine the effect that reorganisation can have on counties like mine and the part of Kildare I represent also.</P>
    <P>For some time past there has been some controversy between the counties of Wicklow and Dublin with regard to the supply of water to Dublin from Wicklow and also from some parts of County Kildare.  We know that the facilities created for the supply of water to Dublin were initiated by Dublin Corporation many decades ago and that the amount of water extracted from the Roundwood and Blessington reservoirs was very little in those earlier years, when the 1927 Act, I think it was, was enacted to flood the area around Blessington, creating a reservoir there.  We know now that the volume of water being extracted from that area is huge.  But it must be said that the rateable valuation of those reservoirs has barely kept pace with inflation.  This means that the revenue yield to Wicklow County Council through the payment of rates, which is the only way that local authority can reap any return rather than any gallonage levy, is minimal.  The result is that Wicklow County Council imposes <Col N="2153" /> practically the highest service charges in Leinster.  I assume that once the estimates have been struck in the next week or two, some problems will arise in that respect.  Assuming they are struck, thereafter water rates on each household in Wicklow will amount to £60.  A person living in Blessington who had to pay that rate could see their neighbours in Brittas in County Dublin, a short distance away, not having to pay any water or service charge whatsoever.  When the new structures have been put in place I predict there will be a demand for the raising of funds for that local authority, who will have to give consideration to whether they want to have service charges included.</P>
    <P>In the general scheme of things I hope that my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, will examine this unfair method of raising funds for local authorities through the imposition of such service charges.  While those charges were introduced by another colleague of mine, the Tánaiste, in 1983 when I was responsible for the introduction of the appropriate Bill, they were meant to be additional funding for each local authority if that was their wish.  It was left to each individual local authority to decide whether they wished to impose such service charges to fund necessary facilities in their respective areas.  We know now that that additional funding has since disappeared. We are now aware that, with the limitation on rateable valuations and the reduction in the rates support grant, more and more counties are dependent on service charges.</P>
    <P>This has led to an anomalous position. For example, in Dublin, where there is a huge commercial and industrial rate base, in that part of the county represented by these new local authorities, one can afford to impose no service charge or a very low level of service charge.  In Wicklow the commercial and industrial rate base is very small, so that the amount raised by, say, a 1 per cent increase in rateable valuation will amount to approximately £35,000 compared with a yield in the region of £60,000 <Col N="2154" /> to £70,000 occasioned by a 1 per cent increase in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power, who spoke before me, mentioned the difficulties created for County Kildare where the local authority must provide facilities for the population overflow from Dublin, particularly the provision of housing, whether private or local authority, and where no rates are levied from which the local authority can fund amenities.  Yet they must provide increased services for that overflow of population from the city and county of Dublin.  This leads to increased demand for facilities and services generally, such as the provision of roads, public libraries, water services and so on.  This means that the pressure on local authorities is much greater in counties adjoining Dublin city and county whereas the relevant rateable valuations for the purpose of collecting funding have not increased correspondingly.</P>
    <P>The problems of local authorities will be reflected in the creation of these three new authorities in Dublin when there will be a variation in the level of rates between theirs and those being levied in other counties, rendering places either more or less attractive in which to build, create employment and so on.  We in Wicklow County Council expect our rates to rise to practically the second highest nationally, or at least in the Leinster area, thereby rendering our county less attractive to commercial activity in that our commercial and industrial rates will have to be greatly increased because our county does not contain the large industrial complexes that contribute so much to rates in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow we must also provide leisure facilities.  It is the most beautiful county in Ireland and is located next to Dublin, from which thousands of people commute, particularly at weekends in the summer, and even throughout the year.  This means we must provide and maintain those roads being used regularly at weekends, as well as providing toilets and other amenities for leisure purposes.  This is becoming an ever increasing burden on our local rates.</P>
    <P>When these three new local authorities <Col N="2155" /> have been established Wicklow County Council will certainly have to consult with them.  For example, we have to provide car parks all over the county and maintain places of national interest like Glendalough in order to cater for the increased volume of traffic and commuters arriving there each weekend.  There are places like Brittas Bay which attract many thousands of people in the summer.  Many years ago we built a car park there funded jointly by Dublin Corporation and Wicklow County Council.  That is one example of commendable co-operation; unfortunately, it has not been extended in any other area of our county.</P>
    <P>In the future, with places of interest such as the interpretative centre at Luggala and attractions like those being created in Wicklow town, with the refurbishment of the jail and the interpretative centre there, there will be even more commuters from Dublin and other places at weekends.  However, such commuters do not generate any real funds for the county since people usually bring along sandwiches and do not avail of our hotels for overnight stays.  Nonetheless, there is a huge movement of traffic in and out of the county.</P>
    <P>The creation of these three new local authorities will have quite an effect in that there will be enormous variations not only within County Dublin and Dublin Corporation but also within adjoining counties.  It will be essential for the Department of the Environment to examine these effects, and not merely within County Dublin.  We must remember it will take some time to resolve all of the problems of the transfer of assets between one local authority area and another, but their establishment will also create difficulties for neighbouring local authorities.</P>
    <P>We must remember also the revaluations that take place every five years. For example, because Dublin consumers are not using the degree of power which was intended by the ESB when the Turlough Hill generating station was built, Wicklow County Council lose out.  The Valuation Office have reduced the rateable <Col N="2156" /> valuation on the power station with the result that £116,000 less in rates is paid to Wicklow County Council.  That is something over which Wicklow County Council cannot have control.  I imagine there is not a great deal of control from Dublin either.  The property was built in Wicklow for the balancing of ESB usage in the city of Dublin where the take-up is not what was expected.  The ratepayers who have their businesses and their industrial activity in Wicklow are the people who will suffer as a result of the change.  They will have to pay an additional 3.5 per cent increase in rates to make allowances for the reduction that the ESB will be granted from the Valuation Office.  That will be a huge imposition: it will mean either cutting back on the marginal services in Wicklow or increasing service charges or rates inordinately on the people of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Apart from the impact the new councils in Dublin will have on the citizens of the city and county, this reorganisation will have its effect, too, on bordering counties such as Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.  I hope the Minister will take note of whatever representations may be made to him in that regard from these other counties.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset I welcome the Bill because it brings local democracy nearer to many of the citizens of County Dublin.  The views of local authorities adjoining Dublin County Council will have to be heeded when we highlight the difficulties a metropolis such as Dublin has on adjoining counties and the problems that are likely to arise from the reorganisation, and the division of assets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation particularly as it affects the local authority with which I have been involved since 1974, when I was first elected to Dublin County Council. Admittedly, I had to remove myself from that scene between the years 1982 and 1991 because of ministerial duties.  In 1974 Dublin County Council comprised some 24 or 26 members whereas today it has a membership of 78.  First there was <Col N="2157" /> an increase from 24 to 36 members and then a sudden increase to 78.  I witnessed great changes in Dublin county during those years.</P>
      <P>It is sad to reflect on what local government has become.  Central government must take responsibility for the current state of local democracy, if there is such a thing any more.  Those involved in central government seem fearful of restoring to local authorities some of the power they used to have and that is reflected in the availability of candidates for local government elections.  People who might otherwise be interested believe that, as members of local authorities, they would be so circumscribed as not to be able to make much of a contribution.  None of the parties had any difficulty in finding candidates to go forward for local government elections.  There was always a large number of independent candidates, too, who would stand for local government elections.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of rates in 1977, local government has become a talking shop.  You cannot have power without responsibility.  We are expecting local representatives to take decisions when, with the exception of service charges, they have no control over the amount of money they have to spend or how it is raised.  That will never work.  I am not saying you should impose local taxes on top of the present tax system.</P>
      <P>The reality is that if we were to reform dramatically our central tax system and allow local government to charge its people for the services it wants to provide, we might restore some respect for local government.  Local government has become so centralised now that it is difficult for them to blow their nose without getting the permission of the Department of the Environment.  For a country with a population of 3.5 million people I find it extraordinary that we have such a complicated system, such bureaucracy, with local government not knowing what it is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always thought of one small local authority, namely Killarney UDC, as an example of what could be done. This is an impression as distinct from in-depth <Col N="2158" /> knowledge.  I always got the impression that Killarney UDC involved themselves totally in the development of tourism in the Killarney area.  People involved in the tourism industry were elected to that authority and they have been very successful.  This shows the potential that exists in local government if it is used properly and allowed develop. What local people can do for their community and their area is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I see a difference now in comparison with the time when we had responsibility for raising our own resources, when if I went to a public meeting and was asked by a group of residents if, for instance, we would purchase a certain piece of land for open space or whatever, I would say that the request could be considered but in the context of the Estimates.  You then got from the management the cost of whatever development was being sought by residents and compared that with what it would mean in terms of a rate, a penny in the £1, a halfpenny in the £1 or whatever it might be.  You were able to make your case to the residents and tell them that you had to fight for the money when it came to the Estimates, that first, you had to convince members from other parts of the county either to support you in bringing about an increase in the rate or omit something else in order to achieve what the residents wanted.</P>
    <P>People understood then that they did not get anything without paying for it and when they got it, they valued it. Nowadays it is a question of putting down yet another motion, writing to the Department and then sending a deputation to the Minister.  It is a load of codology. It is not doing anything for local government, it is not developing local government as it should develop, it is not building communities, it is not instilling a sense of responsibility in communities and in the people who are elected to local authorities.  As a result of all this there is frustration among the public who cannot understand why, instead of filling potholes properly, the local authority merely dumps in temporary filling which is washed away by the next shower of rain. When you make inquiries you are told <Col N="2159" /> that there is not enough money to do a permanent job.  What a waste of money and what an example we are showing to the electorate in terms of the way we manage resources and our own business. The person in the street says: &ldquo;Look at this for more waste of money while they are telling us to tighten our belts and that they will increase our taxes&rdquo;.  Because you are told that everything you ask for cannot be done due to a shortage of money, you do not know what work can be done.  Whoever audits properly the way the money we have is spent?  It is never done.  Inefficiency is rampant in many areas.  If elected members feel they are part and parcel of the system and are allowed have control in the spending of resources, they will play an important part in local government.  Above all this would encourage more people to stand for elections to local authorities which is a major problem at present.</P>
    <P>What is happening to national lottery funds is a disgrace.  When I was in Government I was involved in the setting up of the national lottery which was designed specifically to provide funds for sport and recreation.  Lottery funds are now being spent on many projects yet no money goes to local authorities to develop community facilities.  What funding do those who are involved in running football clubs, youth clubs and other facilities in the community get?  They do not get any funding.  The average grant paid to clubs by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee under the sport and recreation subhead was £143.  In Ballybrack in my constituency where there is high unemployment, many unemployed men spend some part of each day helping out in the local football club.  The club, of which I am President, costs about £14,000 a year to run between transport, insurance and miscellaneous expenses.  Do Members realise that those involved in running the club go from house to house on five consecutive Fridays to collect £1 because people do not have the money to pay £5 to go to a Joe Dolan fund-raising gig on a Friday night?  That shows the level of <Col N="2160" /> local commitment.  The State's level of contribution is £143.  There are 17 teams, each with 14 players, catering for the many young children ranging in age from seven and eight to 17 and 18 in that club. These youngsters are being provided with facilities that keep them off the streets. Discipline and a sense of comradeship and community spirit is instilled into them.  This keeps them out of Loughan House and Trinity House, where it costs the State £60,000 per year to maintain a young person.  Yet all the State can provide for community groups is £143 per annum.  Millions of pounds of national lottery funds are spent annually but central Government is afraid to give local authorities the power to distribute the available resources.  Should not a percentage of national lottery funds under the sport and recreation subhead be given automatically to local authorities to be allocated in the interests of the community?</P>
    <P>I remember, as no doubt does my colleague Deputy Jim Mitchell who was also in local government in 1974, when Dublin County Council provided substantial community grants for building recreational centres and other community activity.  Local authorities could not give a community group £5 today towards the cost of building a community centre.  At one time, Dublin County Council could give grants of £50,000 to build a community centre.  The council had a properly managed scheme to help communities.</P>
    <P>In many respects I am delighted Dublin County Council which has become so controversial is being divided into three local authorities.  This should bring the local authority to the people.  Is there any point in dividing up the local authority if the new bodies will not have the power to take the initiative and build communities? Local government is not only about collecting the rubbish, sweeping the roads and cutting the grass, it should be about developing community spirit and initiating programmes.  It should have the trained staff to initiate developments as distinct from administrative staff.  That is the potential of local government. However, the structure of promotions <Col N="2161" /> in local authorities is through the administrative channels.  One becomes a principal officer after going through the clerical grades.  Local authorities need development staff and they need to recruit people from tourism and industry because they have the expertise in development and in industry.</P>
    <P>I remember when Dublin County Council bought land in Sanydford, which is now the Sandyford Industrial Estate, one of the greatest developments in south County Dublin.  The county council did not wait for the private sector to develop it.  The land was bought for about £2,000 per acre and we ended up selling sites in the industrial estate at £200,000 an acre.  The profits, however, went back into the local authority's funds for further development.  There is no reason that should not continue.</P>
    <P>Will the local authorities get involved in such developments again?  There is not the same level of drive as there was 18 or 19 years ago.  We are supposed to have made progress but as far as I can see local government has regressed.  The Minister should try to persuade his colleagues in Government to allocate a substantial portion of the national lottery funding to his Department so that it can be dispersed to the local authorities to be spent at their discretion under various subheads.  Local government should be involved in the development of facilities in the community.</P>
    <P>Controversy over rezoning has been raging in County Dublin.  It is a statutory function of the local authority to review its development plan on a five year basis. County Dublin was destroyed by a policy in the 1970s to develop three new towns and people from the city centre were literally dumped in areas of County Dublin that did not have facilities.  This was based on so-called professional advice from planners from other countries. A great deal is said about taking professional advice but it is my belief that elected members who communicate with their electorate regularly should have a major input in planning.  I make no apologies for that.  That is what they are elected to do.  The most expensive residential <Col N="2162" /> areas in Dublin, where the property values are highest, are around established towns and villages.  Property values in Malahide on the north side are high because people like living in the village/town atmosphere.  Those areas were not created by professional planners. In Dalkey and Dún Laoghaire property values are very high and those areas too were established not by professionals but by ordinary people using common sense.</P>
    <P>People have used the County Dublin development plan for political reasons and have managed to persuade the public and some people in the media that there is a massive scandal going on.  I reject that.  I have never heard of anyone being offered or receiving bribes.  I have just seen people trying to do their best.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will be established and Dún Laoghaire Corporation will be incorporated into it. Dún Laoghaire Corporation has not got one square inch of land for development. The piece of Dublin County Council which will go into Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is very much developed. Unless the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council builds in the Dublin mountains it will have no land in five or ten years' time.  When people are talking about zoning they should remember that we are talking about five to ten years ahead.  Young married couples seeking to buy a house will not be able to buy a house for £50,000 or £55,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in five or ten years' time.  Practically no land was rezoned in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area in the context of this development plan, with the exception of the Monarch Properties proposal, which at four houses to the acre, was a crazy decision &mdash; no good to young married couples and a bad use of land.  A development plan is supposed to plan ahead.  If we want to provide for the future we have to zone land.  There is no point in the Minister allocating funds to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in the future if it has no land on which to build, whether for local authority housing <Col N="2163" /> or for first time house buyers.  We have now managed to convince people that rezoning is all wrong, but if we do not rezone land for development how can we have development?  Will the critics tell me what we in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will do in the next five to ten years if the little bit of land that is left is not zoned for housing?</P>
    <P>This Bill allows for the abolition of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, which has been established for very many years.  It is a sad occurrence, but I hope it is in the interests of progress.  I pay tribute to those who worked in Dún Laoghaire Corporation down through the years and the people who gave their time voluntarily as elected members.  I hope those of us who will be in the new county council will continue to work for the people we are trying to serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister should find a different name from Dublin South for the new county council as it means nothing to the people of Clondalkin or Tallaght.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill the intention of which is to improve the system of local government in those areas.  The Minister in his speech referred to the 1991 census and to the population of 547,000 in the Dublin County Council area.  The Minister said that at the start of the century nearly all the county was essentially rural and that throughout the century the population in the Dublin area has more than doubled, with growth being especially marked over the years between 1930 and the early 1980s, involving an increase of more than 0.5 million and that the growth in overall population had been accompanied by a redistribution on a massive scale, with population loss at the centre and population gain in the surrounding county.  The Minister referred to many proposals for the reorganisation of local government structures in the Dublin area to adapt to <Col N="2164" /> the changing social, economic and population patterns.  It was natural for the city to spread outwards and for suburbs to develop when the motor car became part and parcel of everyday life and people were able to commute easily between the city and the county.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh in his contribution said that as Minister in 1986 he started the ball rolling on this new administrative structure.  What consideration has been given to issuing a White Paper on the needs of the capital city to prepare it for the 21st century?  What work has been done to assess the effect the changes proposed in this Bill will have on Dublin city?</P>
      <P>Speakers in this debate have focused on their own constituencies or on their own councils.  I am honoured and proud to be a member of Dublin City Council since 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that troublesome. &ldquo;Jim will fix it&rdquo; is always around to heckle me, but I participate to the best of my ability in the interests of the constituents I represent.  The members and officers of Dublin City Council have worked with vision in the best interests of the city in relation to its needs and demands for the years ahead.  Many of the speakers from the county council area criticised Dublin City Council and the corporation for their activities over the last number of years.  I totally reject Deputy Rabbitte's reference to the failure of Dublin Corporation to manage and maintain their housing estates.  Deputy Rabbitte said that there was no democratic accountability in Dublin Corporation and he referred to a legacy of neglect. It was wrong of Deputy Rabbitte to come in with such hard hitting lines. His assertions are without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell is aware, we in the city council have worked in the best interests of the city.  We have not had the long meetings the county council have had.  The reason for those lengthy meetings was that members were abusing their power as members of the council by <Col N="2165" /> moving section 4 motions while other matters on the agenda were not reached. It is important to put on record what happened at those county council meetings, that members have abused their powers and that legislation had to be introduced to address such abuse.  It is regrettable that the members of the county council who permitted that to happen have come into the House and criticised members of the city council and Dublin Corporation.  The efficacy and commitment of city council members is second to none.  It is our premier council and carries out its business in that manner.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill has caused much concern among members of Dublin City Council.  We held a special meeting requesting a report on the impact of this Bill on the council in relation to for example, the transfer of houses and housing land.  The council had the foresight to purchase and develop land banks and houses as necessary down through the years and it was customary to extend the boundary for accommodation of our housing units.  The fact that some 7,500 of the houses we own are still tenancy dwellings, which represents 40 per cent of Dublin Corporation housing, will have a serious effect on Dublin Corporation's housing stock.  I appreciate that they are local authority houses and will remain in the ownership of a local authority.  I have no difficulty in that regard, but what will be the position of people on the Dublin Corporation housing list because of their city council address and those on the county council housing list because of their county council address?  This matter is of major concern to the city council and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Land was acquired by the corporation to enable it fulfil its statutory requirement in relation to housing, including the making available of sites to small builders for development of auxiliary services such as amenity facilities, shopping centres, industrial use and so on.  It was acquired to facilitate the county council in cases where it did not have the necessary funds to acquire land and in cases where lands were jointly purchased with <Col N="2166" /> the county council to bring land into public ownership before prices escalated. Much of the land to which I referred was purchased in the sixties and seventies.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation owns approximately 1,850 acres of land in County Dublin.  That is an enormous amount of land and will have a great impact on Dublin Corporation's future development. The previous speaker spoke about the need for a development officer in local authority structures.  To an extent we have had development officers and have taken steps for future development. That should be recognised.  We should not demoralise people who had the necessary foresight by bringing a Bill before the Dáil and in one stroke of a pen transferring all their efforts of the past number of years to new local authorities.</P>
    <P>The city manager submitted a four page response to the city council on the effects of this legislation on the city council and I will forward that report to the Minister for his consideration.  In summary, the city manager stated that the existing legislation should be amended to allow the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, to apply to the disposal of lands under the legislation, or that section 35 and the Third Schedule be deleted, or that the provisions of section 35 and the Third Schedule be amended to exclude all references to the transfer of land and houses sold or in the course of being sold.  I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</P>
    <P>I have before me also a letter which the Lord Mayor circulated to members of Dublin Corporation who are Members of this House in which he indicates the importance to Dublin City Council of amending the legislation.  His letter highlights that if the legislation is not amended it will have a detrimental effect on our housing stock and land banks for future housing projects for our citizens.</P>
    <P>Overall, the change in administration is welcome but it will have a serious effect on the city council.  Some of our managers who have come up through the system <Col N="2167" /> and provide effective in their role as assistant city managers have been appointed managers in the new local authorities. Basically, those managers cut their teeth in Dublin City Council.  I congratulate the three managers, Davy Byrne, John Fitzgerald and Kevin O'Sullivan, and wish them success in their endeavours. They are excellent managers and have now been absorbed from the corporation management structure.  Many other officers of Dublin Corporation will be transferred also.  Len O'Reilly of the planning department, Dan O'Connor of the engineering department and Christy Boylan, who has responsibility for our parks, are among the many officers who will be transferred.</P>
    <P>Such transfers will have adverse effects on the management structure of Dublin Corporation.  Many of our senior managers in Dublin Corporation have applied for positions in the new councils and have been successful, leaving a vacuum in the corporation that must be filled.  That will have implications for the team spirit developed in Dublin Corporation down through the years.  I pay tribute to all officials of Dublin Corporation who have worked as a great team in the development of this city.  It is regrettable that the city is in the heart of the greater Dublin area.  We are being suffocated because the land banks and housing stocks are being taken from us; there are difficulties in respect of our water supply, our waste management policy and traffic control. Many speakers referred to those difficulties.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether it will be possible to change the city boundaries if there is a need for an extension and the effect this will have on the new authorities? Does he share the view that there will be a need for flexibility in coming years?  There is a need for us to plan for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, from the 1930s to the 1980s people moved out of the city to live in the suburbs.  While some have settled in well others for family, work and other reasons would like to move <Col N="2168" /> back.  We should recognise that the city acts as the pulse, that there is movement towards the city and that we have to plan for this.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the need for a port access route.  As a representative for the north side of the city, I have been inundated with queries from residents who are concerned at the number of large commercial vehicles using routes which were not constructed to take this traffic. In addition, they have to contend with the problem of rat running through residential estates.  There is therefore an urgent need to construct the northern leg of the port access and eastern relief route. I hope the Department of the Environment will support this proposal.</P>

      <P>In County Sligo we find it difficult to raise funds and we will shortly hold our annual meeting to discuss the estimates. The only way we can raise funds to provide services is by way of service charges. With the exception of Dún Laoghaire, people living in the capital city do not have to pay these charges.  The reason is that the owners of large commercial premises pay large amounts in rates.</P>
      <P>Sligo Corporation find it easier than Sligo County Council to raise funds due to the large number of commercial premises in the town.</P>

We have privatised our refuse collection service which has proved a tremendous success.  As a result every person living in a rural area can now avail of this service. However, those supplied with a water and sewerage service have to pay heavy service charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the possibility of making Cohesion Funds available under the National Development Plan to ensure that there is a sewerage scheme in every small village.  I am referring to villages of 20 to 25 houses.  If such schemes are provided these villages will develop.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to the allocations made from the national lottery. In this regard we would welcome any allocation for sport and recreational facilities.  In the past these allocations were made to the local authorities who then decided on the way in which they should be divided up.  This money was put to good use.  While the decision to allocate funds to GAA and soccer clubs was heavily criticised the decision which gave rise to most criticism was the one to allocate funds to golf clubs.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that Deputy Brennan, while speaking on a Bill which deals specifically with County Dublin, did not miss the opportunity to promote the interests of County Sligo but I suppose that is the reason he has been so successful and is continually elected to this House.  I should point out to him, however, that while he can secure national lottery funding for golf courses in County Sligo &mdash; his former colleague, Mr. Ray MacSharry, secured even larger sums &mdash; he did not answer my question as to what the membership fee at Tubbercurry Golf Club is.  I can assure him that whatever it is a great deal lower than the fees payable at golf clubs in Dublin.</P>

      <P>None of the Ministers in the Department has the same understanding of the nuances of the issues in Dublin county and city that Members of this House on the Dublin County and City Councils have.  It is not an unfair criticism to say that progress in relation to local government matters in Dublin has only come about when there was a Dublin Minister in the Custom House. For example, the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, was passed under the Mr. John Boland, and the benefits of that Act are still being experienced to this day in the city with the renewal of the city centre in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Dublin identity is very important to the people of Dublin, but this Bill makes no provision for that.  It proposes to set up three county councils, two of which <Col N="2172" /> will have no reference to Dublin in their title.  Half in jest but whole in earnest, I ask if we are going to have a Fingal team or a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown team playing in the all-Ireland final?  There is a need to see Dublin as a whole, not just for administrative and co-ordination purposes but because Dublin needs to be seen as a place that people can identify with.  Therefore, I propose that the title of each county council should include the name of Dublin, just as in London there is the London Borough of Chelsea or the London Borough of Lambeth.  I know there is a provision in the Bill that the new councils should name themselves. However, this House should lay down that the name should start with the &ldquo;Dublin county of&rdquo;&mdash; for example, the &ldquo;Dublin County of Fingal&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Dublin County of Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;.  I agree strongly with the point made by so many others that calling &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo; the area that was to have been called &ldquo;Belgard&rdquo; is ridiculous.  South Dublin, to most people, is the area largely covered by the proposed Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  In that regard, although I believe the name &ldquo;Dún Laoghaire&rdquo; should be in the title, I do not think the name &ldquo;Rathdown&rdquo; should, because Rathdown is a small appendage to Dún Laoghaire whereas the new county council covers a much wider area going as far as Rathfarnham.</P>
    <P>The idea of a Dublin identity is very important to the people of this city and it is totally ignored in this Bill.  It is a Philistine Bill in that respect; it does not understand the spirit of Dublin and the identity of Dublin and there must be provisions which take account of that in the titles of the three county councils.  Dún Laoghaire should be called the &ldquo;Dublin County of Dún Laoghaire&rdquo; and Fingal should be the &ldquo;Dublin County of Fingal.&rdquo; Quite honestly, I think &ldquo;Dublin County of Belgard&rdquo; would be a much better title than &ldquo;South Dublin&rdquo;.  I do not know what is wrong with the title &ldquo;Belgard&rdquo;, because Belgard Castle and Belgard Road are right in the heart of the proposed county. It should not be left to the county councils to pick any name they like.  We could end <Col N="2173" /> up with the county councils deciding to call themselves by some of these fancy names, such as &ldquo;Westington&rdquo; or &ldquo;West Hampton&rdquo;.  Many of the street names or estate names are totally English names, ignoring the ancient place names of an area.  For that reason, the naming should not be totally left to the county councils.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill for any regional co-ordination of a substantial nature.  I know it is envisaged that there will be some sort of loose regional authority for Dublin, but Dublin needs much more than that.  For instance, one cannot have four unattached development plans and each county council or the city council merely exhorted to have regard to the plans of the others.  Each county council will want to maximise development in its own area.  In a situation where we have had two authorities up to now, Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council, this has led to Dublin county, planning for all these new towns and massive population explosion, drawing people out of the city, leaving a derelict rundown inner city.  We have schools in the city almost totally underpopulated or closing down while new schools and new classrooms are needed out in the county.  To that list can be added post offices, sewerage services, water services, Garda stations, bus services, health centres, etc.  We have them massively underutilised in the city while there is a huge new demand for them in the county.</P>
    <P>Now the city council has the ambition to double the population of the inner city in the next ten years, it having been halved in the last ten years.  In other words, the city council wants to restore the population in the city within ten years to what it was ten years ago in recognition that we want a living city and that the services are all there.  However, this will not happen if we do no more than urge each of the new county councils to have regard to the plans of the others.  We need much more than a loose regional authority.  We need a greater Dublin council of one sort or another.  The duties of such a council are clear and relate to things like roads and transport.  The abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority, <Col N="2174" /> set up by me as Minister for Transport, was a major mistake.  There is a need for a transport authority and it should be part of the local government structure because transport cannot be divorced from other planning matters.  I would see a greater Dublin council having responsibility for transport, planning and co-ordination.  It should also be that authority's job to make sure that there is no conflict between the objectives of the different development plans.  It would have an overall strategic planning role and, possibly, the responsibility for approving the development plans of each local council.</P>
    <P>At this moment we have one city and county librarian who runs both services with parallel staffs, but at least there is co-ordination.  When this Bill is implemented there will be four county librarians and no co-ordination, which does not make sense.</P>
    <P>A nightmare scenario in housing is proposed in this Bill.  The responsibility for housing should be taken away from the four councils and a new housing agency created under the greater Dublin Council that I propose.  A new housing agency is necessary because it would be untenable to have people trapped within the boundaries of these new authorities and unable, without enormous difficulty, to transfer to other county areas.  It is almost impossible at the moment to transfer between corporation houses and county council houses even though many of the corporation houses might be across the road from the county council houses.  We need a housing agency not just for co-ordination purposes but to ensure that housing is fairly accessible to people living within the four authority areas.  Otherwise, there would be huge problems &mdash; for example, it would be much easier to get a house if one lived in Fingal than it would be if one lived in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Huge anomalies would be obviated by the creation of a housing agency.  The creation of such an agency under a greater Dublin council would also present the opportunity to reinvigorate the whole area of housing management, maintenance and control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2175" /> Let nobody be under any illusion about the fact that there are enormous difficulties in Dublin at the moment.  There is wholly inadequate provision for the maintenance, refurbishment and day to day management of local authority estates.  As a matter of urgency local managers must be employed on site to coordinate all statutory services in housing estates.  Statutory and financial provisions must be made in that regard.  The Minister has told us repeatedly that the manner in which maintenance is presently provided for local authority houses is very costly and that is a product of the structural problem.  Those issues would be addressed and dealt with by a new agency under the greater Dublin council.  I hope the Minister will take those matters on board.</P>
    <P>Other services must be provided on a regional basis &mdash; for example, waste disposal and water and sewerage supply.  I do not envisage that the greater Dublin council would be undemocratic.  It could be elected from existing councils.  I would not favour a second election.  One representative from each council could be elected to the greater Dublin council and additional representatives could be elected to ensure that representation on it was proportionate.  I urge a stronger greater Dublin council than a loose regional authority, which I believe may be envisaged.  One cannot be sure what is envisaged in that regard because it is not covered in detail in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The boundaries that have been decided are reasonable, but the boundary between Dún Laoghaire and South Dublin is not appropriate.  It runs through the middle of Marely Grange parish and covers part of Rathfarnham parish.  I lived in Marley Grange parish for 15 years until a few years ago and I now live nearby.  The proposed boundary is an absurdity.  It might have been acceptable when there were two committees of the county council, because the same county council would have covered the parish. The boundary cuts through a housing estate.  The boundary line should be changed to the road immediately to the <Col N="2176" /> west of Nutgrove Shopping Centre; that would involve a minimum transfer of a population between the two councils and disruption.  Otherwise the boundary would create an anomaly.  The boundary would run through the middle of a parish, which is a cohensive unit with many of the children of the parish attending the same school and many of its parishioners attending the same church and so on.  The proposed boundary is not logical as it would split the parish into two county council areas.  There is no easy solution, but the change I suggest would result in most of the parish being included in the South Dublin area and in little disruption to the local population.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the proposed development plans for County Dublin, the perceived scandal that exists there and the adverse comments and reports that have been made in regard to it.  Who may alter the development plan if councillors, the people's elected representatives, are not empowered to do so?  Will that power fall to unelected officials who are not answerable to the public?  Will councillors be able to alter only those changes proposed by officials? That would be a ludicrous position. Councillors elected to represent the public would not be able to represent their public interest.  Urgent protection is needed for all concerned.  I would favour the introduction of sections in the Bill before it passes Committee and Report Stages which would provide that any change in the development plan could be proposed only by a councillor elected from the concerned area and that councillors from other electoral areas could not propose changes in a development plan for that area.  The majority required to vote on changes in the development plan should be higher than a simple majority, perhaps a majority of the council should be required or 60 per cent of the council.  Those two measures would protect conscientious hard-working councillors from insinuations that they may be involved in any wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>The new council should confirm Dublin County Council development plans that have been completed or are <Col N="2177" /> nearing completion and take account of the provisions I suggested.  Development matters should be left as the responsibility of councils.  There is a dangerous drift towards the idea that decisions in respect of rezoning should no longer be made by elected representatives.  That would result in unelected officials being responsible for planning decisions but they would not be answerable to the public.  Such a measure would rob people of their say in local planning matters. Officials would be less prone to pressure in respect of wrong decisions than councillors who are answerable to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Local government in Dublin is the least localised in the country.  The provision in the Bill to provide for the appointment of more councillors, 78 among the three councils, is a step in the right direction. The three councils cover an area with a population comparable to that of Dublin city.  Dublin city has 52 councillors for a population of more than 0.5 million. There is only one councillor per 10,000 people.  That does not reflect local government.  The large area of Ballyfermot, with a population of more than 10,000, should have an urban district council; but because of the present system it is only part of a much larger electoral area.  More councillors should be elected to Dublin City Council.  Proportionately, the same numbers of councillors should be elected to Dublin city as to the county.  I look forward to next year's urban elections and I hope the Minister will make some provision for a more localised suburban council for an area such as Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>Priority should be given to the refurbishment of some housing estates, particularly flat complexes.  Some people must live in an environment which is productive of social problems and alienation. The Minister must consider funding such work.  Refurbishment work, such as the replacement of windows, must be considered. In some houses the windows cannot be opened and this would be very dangerous in the case of a fire.  Consideration should be given to providing a grant scheme for such work in cases <Col N="2178" /> where people cannot afford to wait the five to seven years for their windows to be replaced.  I hope the absence of a Dublin Minister or Minister of State from the Custom House will not militate against the urgent needs of the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit I met President Clinton, Secretary of State Christopher and senior administration officials.  I also met Speaker Foley, Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, Senator Kennedy, Senator Moynihan, Senator Leahy and other leading members of Congress.  On 16 November I met with the Friends of Ireland group in Congress and on 17 November with the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  During my visit I also availed of the opportunity to brief a range of media representatives in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> I achieved two principal objectives during my visit to the United States. First, I explained to President Clinton and all others whom I met the Government's policy in relation to Northern Ireland, in particular the priority we are attaching to the urgent pursuit by the Irish and British Governments of a framework which could deliver peace, stability and reconciliation.  I found the President to be both very well informed and supportive of our efforts.  I expressed the Government's deep appreciation for his consistent interest and concern and his readiness to contribute to the search for peace and for a lasting settlement of the problem.  We agreed that the two Governments will maintain close contact in this regard.</P>
    <P>Second, I outlined to Secretary of State Christopher the Government's views on a range of other matters such as GATT, taxation issues and visas, both in relation to the 1994 World Cup and more generally. I discussed with him a number of foreign policy issues such as former Yugoslavia, Somalia, EC-US relations, UN reform and peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>My discussions with Speaker Foley, Senator Mitchell and other members of Congress related primarily to Northern Ireland.  I briefed the congressional leaders in detail on the Government's policy and expressed our appreciation for their continuing support and interest.  I also expressed the appreciation of the Irish Government and people for the very generous United States contribution to the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I completed my visit with an address on the subject of Northern Ireland to the School of Advanced International Studies at John Hopkins University in Washington.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he outline a little more clearly the nature of the assistance offered by President Clinton in reply to the Minister's report on the six principles and his proposals for the North?  Did President Clinton raise with the Minister his suggestion of a peace envoy to Northern <Col N="2180" /> Ireland?  Has the Minister any deadlines or have they gone in the same way as have the Taoiseach's deadlines?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government values the support and concern of the United States administration in assisting us to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I took the opportunity to brief President Clinton and the other members of the US administration with whom I met on the present position in terms of Anglo-Irish relations and the policy being pursued by the Government.  President Clinton was extremely well informed, including having at his disposal details of the statement made by the British Prime Minister on the previous evening.  The President reiterated the support of the United States administration for the efforts of both Governments to resolve the conflict.</P>
      <P>The question of the envoy was discussed in the course of my meetings in the United States, although not with President Clinton, and the position is as has been enunciated in this House on a number of occasions.  It was raised between the Taoiseach and the President earlier this year.  From the outset we have welcomed President Clinton's readiness to consider a more active role for the US in relation to Northern Ireland if that is opportune and desirable, and this has been reiterated on many occasions.  We will pursue our efforts to establish peace and resume dialogue and in those circumstances the question of deciding on an envoy is not relevant.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in terms of trying to find a solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.  If there were any differences in emphasis or otherwise we should make every effort to overcome those because of the seriousness of the conflict.  In that respect both the Taoiseach and myself, since forming the partnership Government, have made every effort to work together solidly and persistently to see if we can bring about a solution to this problem.  As I said from day one in this House and as the Taoiseach has said on many occasions, that is a priority for the Government, as it has been for many Governments in the past.  In that respect I hope we can make progress.  There are some signs that progress is possible at this stage and we are all very concerned that the existing opportunity should not be missed.  We will persist in a unified manner on behalf of the people with the programme we have outlined.  My discussions with President Clinton were primarily to update him on what is happening and to inform the US administration of the possibilities that exist for making progress in resolving the conflict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 12, 29, 31 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the continuing fighting in Croatia and the possibilities for an overspill of conflict in the Yugoslav region generally.  I wish again to underline the imperative need to bring peace to Bosnia, particularly with the onset of winter, and to improve the level of distribution of aid to its inhabitants.  These priorities were clearly signalled by the European Council at its special meeting on 29 October.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of conflict in former Yugoslavia the Government has been fully engaged in the international effort through the European Community, the CSCE and the UN to bring peace to the region and to support the victims of war. We have also undertaken a major programme of humanitarian assistance in support of refugees and displaced persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practical efforts by the European Community and its member states to bring <Col N="2184" /> about a settlement have focused on the promotion of a negotiated settlement through the International Conference on former Yugoslavia, chaired by David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg; participation, by more than 14,000 personnel from EC member states, in the UN peacekeeping force and the EC monitor mission, to create the conditions necessary for a settlement; the application of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and practical support for the CSCE sanctions assistance missions which help states in the region enforce these measures; and humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict.  To date, 700 MECU has been contributed, some 60-70 per cent of the total international aid effort.</P>
    <P>A settlement in Bosnia, vitally urgent in itself, is the key to a settlement for the Yugoslav region.  Peace in Bosnia will give momentum to the efforts of the conference co-chairmen to find a political solution to the dangerous situation in Croatia and the Kosovo region in Serbia. Only an overall political settlement will make it possible for refugees and displaced persons to return in safety to their homes.</P>
    <P>A peace package for Bosnia was elaborated by the parties under the auspices of the co-chairmen over the summer period.  It has been accepted in large measure by the three Bosnian parties. Disagreement regarding the size of the territory to be assigned to the Muslim majority republic within a Bosnian union has, however, brought the negotiations to an impasse.</P>
    <P>The declaration adopted by the European Council, at its special meeting on 29 October, appealed to the parties to resume negotiations.  In response to the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and the possibility of a human catastrophe during the winter, the European Council adopted guidelines for a European Union joint action to support the conveying of humanitarian aid in Bosnia.  The Council of Ministers, on 8 November, adopted detailed provisions on this joint action, one of the first to be undertaken under the Common Foreign <Col N="2185" /> and Security provisions of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>The joint action aims to intensify the effort to relieve the suffering of the Bosnian people.  Central to this will be an increase in the financing for UNHCR, the leading humanitarian relief agency. A major effort will be made to identify and to ensure the protection of key supply routes.  The modalities for the reopening of Tuzla and Mostar airports are to be examined.  The possibilities for the reinforcement of the UN peacekeeping force, UNPROFOR, with a view to enabling it to discharge its tasks in Bosnia more effectively, are being examined by member states.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the joint action on the convoying of humanitarian aid, the European Union is continuing to make a determined effort to encourage the parties to resume the negotiations on the peace package for Bosnia, including the territorial aspects.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the peace plan for Bosnia will require a major effort by the international community.  A substantial role is provided for the European Union in the draft agreements.  This includes supervision of initial elections in each of the constituent republics, the administration of Mostar and assisting the UN in the supervision of the disarmament process.  The European Union will also contribute to the reconstruction of Bosnia through financial, economic and technical assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his very comprehensive reply.  Is he aware that a major effort has to be made to bring humanitarian aid to the thousands of refugees, many of whom are living rough, in the snow?  Can he confirm the information I received this morning from the Bosnian information centre in London that many tonnes of food are in warehouses and cannot be distributed to the people who need it?  What action will the Tánaiste take to ensure that the food is distributed?  Will he put pressure on our European Union partners to put pressure on the Serbs and Croats to open the northern routes.  The Bosnians have told <Col N="2186" /> me that they believe food is being used as a political weapon to get them to agree to a peace agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to comment on any report the Deputy may have received in the past number of hours. However she passes on the information to my office I will have the matter examined. Obviously the situation in regard to humanitarian aid is verging on the catastrophic and everything possible has to be done to get this aid to the refugees. That was the view taken at the recent Foreign Ministers meeting.  This matter will again be discussed at our meeting next Monday, at which stage we will get a progress report.  It would be totally unacceptable if, as the Deputy said, food was being used as a barter to bring the negotiations to a conclusion.  I will investigate the position and report to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 6, 13, 15, 16, 17, 27 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of a framework for peace, stability and reconciliation among all the people of Ireland is perhaps the most important single challange facing the <Col N="2188" /> Government.  I believe that there may be a significant window of opportunity at present to achieve a complete and permanent cessation of violence.  The Irish and British Governments have major moral and political responsibilities to exploit that opportunity and to do everything possible to devise an acceptable framework for peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome Prime Minister Major's acceptance, in his Guildhall speech last Monday, that &ldquo;there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many years&rdquo; as well as his assurance that the British Government is &ldquo;now actively seeking a framework to deliver peace, stability and reconcilliation&rdquo;. I also strongly agree that &ldquo;all concerned will have to show courage, court unpopularity, break down old barriers and take risks&rdquo;.  It is also very encouraging that the Northern Ireland conflict is now a high priority for the British Government also.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach told the House last Thursday, the Government is giving the highest priority to the development of a basis for peace.  We are working hand-in-hand with the British Government to explore the scope for a peace process which would facilitate the ending of violence once and for all.</P>
    <P>In a speech in this House on 27 October, I outlined a number of principles which, taken as a whole and further developed, should assist the development of that process.  These were favourably received by the British Government and by a wide cross-section of opinion on this island, North and South, and internationally.</P>
    <P>The principles sought to balance, on the one hand, an acknowledgement of the right of the people living in Ireland, North and South, to determine their own future with, on the other, the principle that any decision involving a change in the present status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the freely expressed consent of the people there.  I believe that a balance between these key concepts, which is already implicit in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, can be developed in a way which can advance <Col N="2189" /> the objective of reaching lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that the principles which I outlined were intended to be complementary to the efforts which John Hume has been making to find a basis for peace.  The factors involved in the Northern Ireland problem remain the same and are known to all.  Accordingly, initiatives taken by any democratically-minded political leader to address the problem will clearly reflect a number of common points and approaches.  I believe it is more important to discuss the principles put forward on their merits, rather than to seek to attach labels to them.</P>
    <P>As I have previously made clear, we greatly value the efforts made by John Hume.  His initiative has profoundly altered that climate for discussion and has crystallised public hopes that peace may be attainable.  It is for the Irish and British Governments to assume their responsibilities and to use all the resources at their disposal to bring to fruition the hopes which inspired Mr. Hume's initiative and have been further raised by it.</P>
    <P>The search for a peace formula and efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement through fresh dialogue are complementary and in many ways inter-related.  The achievement of peace would, of course, completely transform the political environment.  It would enhance to a very significant extent the prospects of achieving a successful outcome to renewed dialogue.  It is, accordingly, an objective which must be pursued urgently, vigorously and imaginatively by both Governments over the period ahead.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I have consistently made clear that we wish to see the earliest possible resumption of a collective talks process addressing all strands of our relationship and aimed at a fair and comprehensive political settlement of the problem of Northern Ireland.  We have been working actively with the British Government on ways in which we might provide a framework to carry the matter forward.  It remains our hope that those northern parties who at present refuse <Col N="2190" /> to engage in talks will again find it possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have made abundantly clear my desire for dialogue with Unionist political leaders.  Through a variety of channels, I have made sure they are directly aware of my interest in hearing their views and concerns and in discussing ways in which a lasting accommodation between the two traditions on our island can be reached.</P>
    <P>While no specific arrangements have been made as yet for a meeting with the UUP leader, Mr. Molyneaux, I am encouraged by his reactions on the matter and to the positions I have taken.  I look forward to the prospect of a meeting and hope that it can take place shortly.  I would be glad to discuss with Mr. Molyneaux, and with other party leaders in Northern Ireland, the six principles to which I have referred, and the benefits which the achievement of peace would bring to both communities in Northern Ireland.  I am also willing to discuss with the party leaders the positions which each party has taken on ways in which political progress might be achieved &mdash; including the DUP in their recently published document, &ldquo;Breaking the Logjam&rdquo;.  I have to acknowledge that this document has, however, evoked a somewhat unfavourable reaction from both Unionist and Nationalist political leaders in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I note that the Minister has signally failed to deal with the issue raised in my question, but I appreciate that the Chair is in no position to force him to be more forthcoming on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that John Hume told the public at large that his proposals had the potential to bring about peace within a week and that core elements of those proposals are being kept secret from the Unionist community, can the Minister indicate whether it is reasonable to assume in those circumstances that there is something at the core of the Hume-Adams proposals which is repugnant <Col N="2191" /> fundamentally to the Unionist position and, if not, can he suggest any other reason to keep these proposals secret?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Taoiseach and I were given a confidential briefing by John Hume, the Leader of the SDLP, on the outcome of his talks with the Sinn Féin leader, Mr. Adams.  In the joint statement issued on behalf of the three of us after the briefing we said that we believed the need for confidentiality should be respected in the interests of peace.  That is still the view of the Government.  It is a matter for the two people involved, Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams, to decide whether they will ultimately make the outcome of their discussions public.  The Government has set out fully in the Dáil and elsewhere its position and views on this issue.  Obviously it is not for me to decide whether matters are repugnant to the Unionists &mdash; those are matters with which the Unionists will have to deal in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not simply a matter of him deciding what the Unionists should or should not know?  The issue here is whether an alternative agenda, which has the potential for bringing peace to the province within one week, is being explored and if it has the potential, why one of the parties to the conflict in Northern Ireland should be kept wholly in the dark as to what is so significant about <Col N="2192" /> these proposals that they must not know about them.  I am asking the Minister to indicate to the House what it is about the Hume-Adams proposals, if they do have the potential to bring peace within a week, that requires them to be kept confidential from one community only in Northern Ireland, given that our Government has not indicated their contents to the British Government, that the IRA's Army Council is aware of them and, presumably, the other members of the SDLP.  Why must the Unionist community be excluded from any knowledge of the contents of these so significant proposals?</P>

I am ready, willing and available to do so.  The Deputy is also well aware that both Governments are involved in discussions on a regular basis, perhaps with more intensity than ever before, in relation to the genuine prospects, which I know everyone in this House supports, of establishing the peace process. Between ourselves and the British Government I would hope that we can advance the prospects which I believe exist at the present time in a genuine form and obviously it is in everybody's interest that progress can be made.</P>

      <P>In recognition of these ties the Cultural Relations Committee of my Department has for many years supported the activities of the Irish Newfoundland Association and has assisted other cultural projects in Canada which have included Newfoundland in their itineraries.

      <P>I understand that there are plans to reinforce and celebrate these links with conferences, one to be held in Ireland in 1995 and the second in Newfoundland in 1997.  When the details of these are confirmed I will be happy to consider any ways in which we can offer our support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 21, 32 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The US Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, provides for a visa waiver programme under which nationals of countries with relatively low visa refusal and overstay rates are allowed to visit the US for up to 90 days without a visa.</P>
      <P>The countries admitted to the programme are designated by the US authorities on the basis of criteria specified in the 1986 Act.  These criteria are quite complex.  The refusal rate for non-immigrant visa applications in the previous two year period must be less than 2 per cent and less than 2½ per cent in each of the two years.  A country may be dropped from the programme if the number of its nationals who were excluded from admission to the US, or withdrew their applications, or violated the terms of admission in the previous year exceeds 2 per cent of those who initially applied.</P>
      <P>It is because Ireland has not so far met these criteria that we are not included in the programme.  The US authorities are in no doubt as to our strong wish to participate in the programme.  I availed of my meetings in Washington this week with the Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, and with congressional leaders to underline our interest.  We will be following up very actively on these discussions during the period ahead and will be exploring every avenue to secure Ireland's inclusion in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="2197" /> agree that the particular convergence criteria, if I might use the phrase, the 2 per cent limit, cases special difficulties for this country because of the demographic bulge which we have at the moment? Would he indicate whether he has sought from the Americans special consideration in view of our particular difficulties? Also, in view of the requirement for visas in 1994, would he indicate to the House whether he has made any progress with the idea of allowing intending Irish travellers to the United States who fall outside the normal qualifications for a visa to post some kind of performance bond or whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;performance here, so that they can effectively offer some kind of security against their return?  Although that might sound like a form of bail, it seems to me that there are many for whom people are willing to go guarantors and in the last analysis the colour of their money may be the only way of differentiating between a genuine guarantee and one which is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise calculation of the figures is apparently an extremely complex matter.  Our difficulty does not lie in our overstay rate, which is apparently very low at present, but in the refusal rate at the Embassy.  That remains somewhat above the ceiling established by the 1986 Act.  As the House knows from our discussion on this matter some months ago, I raised this at the earliest opportunity with the US administration in view of our absolute confidence that the Irish team were going to qualify, a confidence which was shattered for a period last evening.  The Embassy have reacted in a very positive manner and we are getting full co-operation from them. A senior US administration officer, an Assistant Secretary of State from the Department of State, is coming to Dublin next month to examine with the Embassy in Dublin and with ourselves whatever systems may be necessary to ensure we <Col N="2198" /> obtain the maximum number of visas. The Deputy has mentioned in the past the question of a bond and that is something that will be considered.  In fact, it may be desirable that Members of Parliament offer a bond on behalf of clients they considered are so entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the refusal rate has now fallen below 3 per cent and is very close to the figure stipulated in the United States Act to which he referred?  Will he agree also that citizens of the United States coming to Ireland &mdash; very often with strong Irish connections &mdash; experience great difficulty in settling or finding work here?  In that context will he accept that the way to approach this issue is not to seek more visas but rather to seek a bilateral agreement with the United States, entirely eliminating the need for visas, because, as he knows, we are one of just three countries in the European Union who now require visas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am aware that, as the Deputy said, our refusal rate has been reduced somewhat in recent years and has come quite near the acceptable criteria.  Second, in our discussions with the United States administration we will do everything possible to reach the best possible arrangement for Irish citizens who want admission to the United States. Obviously, one prospect is the possibility of the visa waiver programme &mdash; if we can qualify for that, that will remove the immediate difficulties &mdash; but, in the long term we would hope to get the same entitlements as are available to the rest of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the United States issue figures of refusals; my view is that they are very high.  Will the Minister agree that practically every person between the ages of 18 and 25 is refused a visa by the United States Embassy in Dublin?  Certainly that has been my experience from constituency work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would he agree also that a problem <Col N="2199" /> which should be raised with the American authorities is the poor information made available to a person who is refused a visa?  I agree that we are dealing with a foreign country, that in this case it is foreigners dealing with foreigners, but a person who has bona fide reasons to be given a visa and is refused, is not given reasons by the United States Embassy, the State Department or Government &mdash; primarily it is the embassy with which we deal.  Would the Minister agree that we should raise that question?  I am sure he and every Member had heard of problems in the course of constituency work about this lack of information or, to use a not undiplomatic word &ldquo;rudeness&rdquo; in the manner in which people are dealt with at the United States Embassy when raising queries about their visa refusals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be grateful for small mercies, an 18-hour day has some advantages.  As the Deputy remarked on the last occasion, the position has improved greatly in relation to the embassy and to the processing of visas. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, it is a matter for the embassy to decide, on behalf of the United States Administration whom they represent, what information to divulge to visa applicants or, indeed, to Members of the Dáil who inquire on their behalf.  Let us hope we can build on the improvements of recent months.  I raised the matter as far back as May last with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher and the matter has been acknowledged in a very receptive manner by the United States Administration.  I hope we can develop on that in a constructive manner and, if possible, eliminate problems or certainly minimise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, from his knowledge and <Col N="2200" /> experience, in many instances there are what I can only describe as ridiculous refusals of visas by the United States Embassy.  I should like to give an example.  Last week I was approached by a businessman and his son who wish to travel to a conference in Atlanta in January. The father has a visa, but the son who because he is aged under 25 has been refused.  That refusal is then taken into account in the statistics which will lead to a refusal rate in excess of 2 per cent.  It is ridiculous.  In those circumstances will the Minister agree that, in his discussions with the Ambassador about this issue, he will ensure that this 2 per cent refusal rate is not advanced as an excuse for not eliminating the visa requirement altogether, that it just does not make sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I can give my opinions and certainly will reflect the reasonable views expressed in this House to the Ambassador and, indeed, to the Administration and the Embassy. Obviously, it is a matter for them, in the context of the United States Immigration, Reform and Control Act, 1986, to decide the criteria for refusals and to decide whether we qualify or not under the visa waiver programme.  The position has improved greatly and we should build on that in a constructive way.  Over the years serious difficulties have been encountered and absolute frustration caused to Members in relation to their dealings with the United States Embassy and the manner of responses.  That has improved significantly and I want to work on that in a constructive way and let all Members do the same.  Let us hope we can eliminate as much as possible of the difficulties experienced in the past. Deputy O'Keeffe gave a very reasonable example.  I should like to think that if the decision in that case is appealed to the United States Embassy, it would be seen as a genuine application on the part of somebody wanting to attend a conference.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that there are provisions for intergovernmental conferences in the context of 1996.  As I have said here on many occasions in the past, it would be extremely important that we have the opportunity of presenting papers both to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and to this House well in advance so that we can debate the issues and have a constructive input to those very important decisions that have to be made, both for this country and the European Community.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make proposals for the purpose of effectively promoting the democratic dimension of European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union entered into force on 1 November. The Treaty contains a number of provisions designed to promote and reinforce the democratic dimension of the European Union.</P>
      <P>First, the Parliament will have a right of co-decision with the Council in a number of areas of Community policy. Second, Parliament's assent will be required where the Community takes action on various issues such as the conclusion of international agreements. Third, the Parliament must approve the appointment of the European Commission. Fourth, Parliament's involvement in policy making is strengthened through the extension of its right of consultation. In addition the Treaty provides for improved contact between the European Parliament and national parliaments.</P>
      <P>As a result of these provisions the European Parliament will be much more closely involved in the preparation of Community legislation.  As the conclusions of the Brussels European Council point out, Parliament's powers relating to the political and administrative control of the executive will be increased.</P>
      <P>On 25 October, the Council, the Commission and the Parliament agreed on the practical arrangements which will enable the Parliament's new functions under the Treaty to operate efficiently.  These arrangements have yet to be tested in practice.  I believe, however, that they will considerably increase the role of the European Parliament and, in conjunction with the role of the Council and national parliaments, will appreciably improve democratic accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, therefore, it would not be timely or desirable for me to make <Col N="2205" /> proposals involving a review of a Treaty which has just entered into force.  The Treaty, however, contains provisions for a review of the scope of co-decision to be carried out on the basis of a report to the Council to be submitted by the Commission by 1996 at the latest.  Ireland will contribute to the debate on the report in the light of our experience of the new provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the experience of the Danish Government in the referendum on the Treaty on European Union and, indeed, of the French Government in respect of the same matter, would the Minister agree that it is important to bring the issues relating to developments in Europe closer to the people?  It is unfair for small nations such as Denmark and Ireland to carry the can, as it were, for the larger nations in implementing the new treaties that will arise in the context of the next intergovernmental conference in 1996.  Now is the time to put in place structures and information networks to ensure that the Irish people are well informed of the decisions that will have to be made post-1996 or in the context of the 1996 referenda. Can he indicate more precisely, because this question has been asked previously in the House, his views on what structures should be put in place and what he has in mind to ensure that the Irish people are well informed of the importance of the decisions which will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with the Deputy's remarks regarding the difficulties experienced by certain countries in relation to ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  I was extremely critical of the whole manner in which the Maastricht Treaty was handled, because a great deal of information was not made available to the voters until the last moment.  Also, one accepts that the Maastricht Treaty is extremely complex. We are now in a better position, particularly since the establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to ensure that there is adequate time to debate any <Col N="2206" /> changes and any improvements that have to be made.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, the Maastricht Treaty has only entered into force.  We must learn from the experience before making any new proposals but certainly the questions of accountability, openness and transparency are extremely important.  I hope there will be greater involvement by national parliaments in the activities of the European Union.  This issue is dealt with in the declaration attached to the Treaty on European Union.  In fact, this very week I understand that members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are in Brussels and Strasbourg. This is in the spirit of the declaration made in relation to European Union.  Through the Sub-Committee on European Community Legislation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs itself, we can ensure that not only are we better informed on European issues, which are complex by their very nature, but that the general public will also be better informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the committee of the regions will play a meaningful role in removing some of the democratic deficit that people experience in this country?  Would he agree that the establishment by his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, of the regional development authorities will assist in that process by seeking funding for various community initiatives from the European Community? In view of the fact that I received a parliamentary reply from the Minister some time ago indicating that appointments to the committee of the regions would be made by the regional development authorities, can he now explain the reason the Government has decided to make these appointments unilaterally? This is not in the spirit of the Treaty on European Union or in the spirit of the committee of the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Minister for the Environment has primary responsibility for bringing names <Col N="2207" /> forward to Government.  Article 198 (A) of the Treaty on European Union, establishing the committee of the regions, states that the committee should consist of representatives of local and regional bodies.  Obviously, that will be the position. Until the bodies are set up they will not be in a position to bring forward nominations.  I agree with the Deputy that this will be an extremely important committee in relation to its involvement with Europe at the highest level.  Also it is important to ensure that local government has direct access to Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions. First, in relation to the committee of the regions, is the Minister aware that apparently a secret list of names was submitted &mdash; but not published &mdash; to the Presidency of the European Union prior to the Brussels Summit?  Is the Minister aware that one of his own councillors &mdash; Councillor Nash &mdash; it on that list?  Is he in a position even now to tell us who is on the list, why business was done in that fashion and does he not think it is entirely contrary to the type of approach advocated by my colleague, Deputy Hogan?  Second, while we are talking about openness, there will be an intergovernmental conference in a couple of years' time which will focus on the question of a common defence policy. Can the Minister tell us whether he is in favour of a common defence policy so that we can debate the issue in a real sense in a transparent way in the months and years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an issue Fine Gael are always trying to advance at a fast pace.  My understanding is that it was hoped to submit the names to the council meeting, but the Portuguese Government have indicated they will not be in a position to nominate until January next year.  There is not question of secret nominations. I suspect the Deputy's party leader was consulted in relation to drawing up the list.  The Government have to advance names if there is no other process.  Perhaps the deputy leader would be able to inform the Deputy.</P>

It has been made very clear in the Programme for a Partnership Government that if there are to be changes in relation to Ireland's traditional stance the people will have to be consulted.  I would have no difficulty in coming before Deputy O'Keeffe and his colleagues on the committee and bringing forward views on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>It is generally believed in circles in Brussels that the Government has already decided there will be seven from Fianna Fáil, five from Labour and one from Fine Gael appointed to the committee of the regions.  Can the Minister indicate whether that information is accurate? Can he indicate whether proposals for the appointment of these representatives will be brought before the House?  The Minister has indicated that it is his understanding that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party may have been consulted in regard to the issue.  Will he clarify whether other party leaders have been consulted because I certainly have not been consulted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>Because there is a problem with the Portuguese in appointing the Committee of the Regions, it will not go ahead until January.  In view of that will the Tánaiste revert to what he suggested in a parliamentary reply some time ago and allow the regional development authorities &mdash; which the Government is establishing in any case &mdash; to make these appointments.  That would show some semblance of democratic accountability for the appointments being made, which is clearly the spirit enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 18, 20, 54 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Angola has been and remains one of great concern to the Government.  It is clear that a grave humanitarian crisis is unfolding in that country.  Following a meeting last month with the aid agencies which are seeking to bring help to Angola, the Government decided to allocate £250,000 from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund for assistance to Angola.  The funds are being channelled through CONCERN, Trócaire and GOAL for their respective emergency operations in Angola.  Earlier in the year, the Government gave £50,000 to Trócaire for a health programme for refugees and displaced people in Luanda.  So far this year, the European Community has allocated 33 <Col N="2211" /> million US dollars for emergency assistance to Angola.</P>
    <P>On the political front Ireland, together with our EC partners, has supported the actions and initiatives of the international community to bring the fighting to an end.  The Twelve have directly appealed to both sides to the conflict to adhere to and respect the 1991 Peace Accords. Repeated attempts have been made by an UN Secretary-General's special representative and by Portugal, the United States and Russia to bring the two parties together and to put an end to the civil war.  Following the declaration of a ceasefire by UNITA in September, talks under the auspices of the United Nations were convened in Lusaka on 25 October between the Government of Angola and UNITA.  These talks were postponed after one week, but have resumed this week.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its partners believe that it is important to maintain pressure on UNITA and, at the same time, encourage the government of Angola to build on the momentum of the talks in Lusaka, so that an effective ceasefire may be agreed and a peace process put into effect.  In the face of UNITA's refusal to come to the negotiating table, the United Nations imposed mandatory sanctions on the delivery of arms and oil to UNITA. Along with our EC partners, Ireland has taken the necessary measures to implement these sanctions.  The Security Council has indicated a willingness to consider further measures against UNITA, should they continue to refuse to participate in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, has written to the Belgian Presidency to express Ireland's concern at the crisis in Angola and has asked that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Development Council which will take place on 2 December.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity during my visit to Washington this week to discuss the crisis in Angola with the US authorities. We agreed that the situation in Angola <Col N="2212" /> was a priority issue for the international community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he aware that concern has been expressed in UN circles that the EC has subscribed inadequately to the appeal for humanitarian aid for Angola?  In his reply the Tánaiste said that certain sanctions have been implemented.  Can he expand on that?  There is a question of whether the ceasefire is genuine: 1,000 people are being allowed die each week. Will the Minister clarify what is meant by this new understanding of a ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the matter of UN concern about the EC contribution. The European Community has not contributed to the UN humanitarian appeal but has given a substantial contribution in emergency relief, a total of £33 million this year.  I am aware that there has been some criticism of the EC's development programme in Angola but this is a separate matter from relief aid.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's understanding of the ceasefire is as good as everybody else's. Obviously when a ceasefire is declared one hopes that the declarants would adhere to the conditions.  I had discussions with the US administration who were obviously in a position to give me more detail than I already had.  The incidence of murder, loss of life and limb, in Angola is on a horrific scale.  I have been informed that the loss of limbs has been higher in Angola than in any other conflict over the past number of years. Angola is very high on the international agenda but ultimately it is a question of the parties on the ground, particularly UNITA, coming to the table to see if it can resolve its differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the resurgence of civil war in Angola had a great deal to do with the weakness of the UN mandate after the 1992 general elections and will he outline the initiatives we have taken at UN level for a strengthened UN mandate in Angola? If the peace process gets under way in Lusaka &mdash; which I understand is at a <Col N="2213" /> crucial stage on this very day &mdash; given that both parties to the conflict came to a meaningful ceasefire agreement and agreed to talks on a Government for the country, would we be in a position to persuade others to send troops to Angola immediately on that agreement being put in place?  For instance, in Mozambique there was a six months delay from the time the peace process was put in place to the actual arrival on the ground of 4,000 blue beret United Nations troops.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Flaherty, raised the question of the UN consolidated appeal for Angola which, I understand is £226 million but of which only £56 million has been pledged to date &mdash; pledged but not delivered &mdash; and towards which European Union has not made any contribution, as the Minister outlined in his reply.  Would the Minister agree that this is not a very honourable position for European Union to adopt notwithstanding that it has made a contribution of £36 million for emergency aid?  As a member of European Union, what initiatives are we taking at Commission level to ensure that the EC responds to the consolidated United Nations appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to deal with the different aspects of the Deputy's question but he may wish to come back to some if there is any omission on my part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am mindful of the serious situation in Angola and will keep it under review. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt and I will remain in contact with the Irish Aid agencies on their assessment of further need.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are many demands on the emergency humanitarian assistance fund but certainly the situation in Angola is appalling and has huge requirements.  With regard to emergency situations, one has to make decisions on the best and fastest channel to get aid to those in need.  In this respect I am satisfied that the three aid agencies, GOAL, CONCERN and Trócaire are best placed to help.  As is well known, Trócaire has been active on the ground in Angola for many years and GOAL and CONCERN have recently sent <Col N="2214" /> teams there.  When the UN appeal was launched earlier this year there were genuine fears at international level that relief would not get through to those in need and indeed there were substantial grounds for that belief.  The Irish aid agencies have become active.  I am satisfied that they will put our funding to good use.  The EC has not contributed to this UN appeal but it has already contributed $33 million.  With regard to the Deputy's comment on the necessity to have UN troops on standby, and available to go into service, that has to be put in context having regard to the financial and personnel constraints in the UN.  We are conscious that already there are more than 14,000 EC troops in the former Yugoslavia, despite the fact that many people give the impression that nothing is being attempted.  The UN is under tremendous pressure in relation to its operations.  The Secretary General of the UN has particular difficulties in having further troop complements available because of the number of crises with which the organisation is trying to grapple. This must be considered by the UN in the review of its 50 years of operations. On the question of funding of the UN, some of the main contributors are very much in arrears in payments.  We certainly welcome the commitment by President Clinton at the General Assembly in New York in September that the US will be making every effort to catch up on its arrears.  As Deputies know we are owed vast sums of money by the UN.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and I would not underestimate the extreme difficulties. Obviously, the UN would want to assist if the conditions on the ground are such that there is a ceasefire and we are talking about the rebuilding of Angola.  I would not play down the difficulties the Secretary General will have in getting troops deployed in Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last week at the meeting of the Joint <Col N="2215" /> Committee on Foreign Affairs some of the aid agencies to whom he referred expressed concern at the failure of the EU to contribute adequately to the consolidation appeal?  Will the Minister undertake to raise this issue again at EU level?  Will the Minister clarify the Government's policy and EU policy on the ceasefire and the associated issue of sanctions?  I am sure the Minister is aware that many people feel that this is just time-buying process by UNITA and they have grave reservations about holding off sanctions in the context of a ceasefire which is so far short of what we understand as a ceasefire, and a process in which they are not sure about the sincerity of the other party involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is very high on the agenda of the General Affairs Council of the European Union and it will continue to be so.  I got reassurances in Washington that it is also very high on the US agenda because of the appalling atrocities.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the UN Security Council on 15 September 1993 adopted Resolution 864 and under its terms, UNITA was given notice that unless a ceasefire was established and agreement reached on the implementation of the peace accord, an embargo on the sale of arms, military equipment, military assistance and oils will be imposed.  Unfortunately, UNITA did not comply with the resolution and the embargo is now in force.  With our European partners we are determined that action will be taken to implement these measures.  We work with the Twelve in relation to Angola and will continue to ensure that Angola remains high on the international agenda.  I have not received a report from the committee meeting of last week, but I will ensure that I get it. We will have discussions with the aid agencies in relation to their concerns, because their experience is invaluable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing us to tease out this issue because the situation in Angola is probably the most tragic in the world despite the <Col N="2216" /> tragedy in Ireland where more than 3,000 people have lost their lives in 20 years.  In Angola 900,000 Angolans, mainly noncombatants, women and children have died from starvation, lack of clean water and so on in the past 16 years.  On behalf of Ireland will the Minister take the initiative on Angola?  We know the effect of President Robinson's visit to Somalia. Ireland can take a very strong position in regard to the conflict in Angola.  Will the Minister take a leading role on Angola and ensure that strong diplomatic pressure is put on UNITA to come back to the negotiating table and that the sanctions are made to work?  It requires a person to take the initiative because otherwise it will get mixed up with the normal humanitarian and aid initiative of the EC.</P>

      <P>To develop the point made by Deputy Owen on an Irish initiative on Angola, what instructions has the Minister issued to our envoy at the UN in relation to the mandate in Angola? Has the Government sent a diplomatic enjoy to Rwanda to say to the imperial Government that we recognise that Government as the legitimate Government of the country?  No doubt the Minister will say that we are acting within the Twelve on a common foreign policy but, as my colleague suggested, it is very important that we take a special interest in that country because of our past.  We should be seen to take the initiative in this case.</P>

There is no point in the UN adopting a resolution in relation to an arms embargo which is not being implemented.

      <P>I am pleased to acknowledge the unequivocal and forthright stand taken by the leaders of the main churches in the face of the continuing vicious campaign of sectarian assassination and violence.  Their common stance has underscored the widespread revulsion felt by the vast majority in both communities in Northern Ireland, and throughout this island, at the continuing <Col N="2218" /> campaign of violence and the insistent demand for peace.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings with church leaders on an individual basis in recent months and I look forward to staying in close touch with them.  There are, of course, long-standing arrangements for regular consultations between the leaders of the various churches.  These consultations are clearly a matter for the church leaders, and in the circumstances I do not propose to take the course of action recommended by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I tabled this question to bring to notice that while the perception abroad is that the troubles in Northern Ireland are based on religion, the fact is they are based on pure tribalism, as is evident from the events of last night.  I would like the Minister to consult with Church leaders regularly so that people worldwide can see they are of one voice in condemning violence.  I am glad to note the Minister met with leaders of some Churches.  Has he met leaders of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches as well as the Roman Catholic Church and Church of Ireland?</P>

      <P>I have met representatives of all the Churches because they have an important role to play.  Despite the perception abroad, I accept the Deputy's point in regard to the basis of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  It is totally unacceptable that sectarian tenets still persist and that because of their religious persuasions, people's views are not always tolerated.  I would like to believe that in the present climate of toleration that is developing we will see an end to the sectarian difficulties with which we have had to live for many years.  I place great value on the example, leadership and cooperation shown by Church leaders.</P>

      <P>In his speech last night at the Johns Hopkins University the Minister referred to the efforts being made in general to resolve the Northern Ireland problem.  He referred to the fact that he hoped for an even-handed approach from the British Government in respect of the two communities in Northern Ireland.  Is that also the approach of the Irish Government?  The Minister stated also that the British Government had abandoned its approach of trying to get the parties around the table and were pursuing instead a policy of bilateral meetings with the constitutional parties.  The manner in which the Minister made that statement indicated that he expected that approach to continue for some time.  Is that his intention, or does he foresee a prospect of having round table discussions in the relatively near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that both the Governments are in a position to approach the Northern Ireland problem in an even-handed manner.  Obviously, if the <Col N="2220" /> approach is taken in an even-handed manner one would like to believe that there would be a balanced outcome.  As the Deputy is well aware from his experience in respect of Northern Ireland matters, the achievement of that balance has, unfortunately, failed politicians on this island.  Despite our best efforts, we have failed in that regard down through the years.  However, after the foundation of the State great efforts were not made in that area, but a new reality now prevails in the South and I hope the same is true of Northern Ireland.  It is extremely important that we approach the matter in an even-handed manner.  If we can do that we may be able to achieve what we set out to do.</P>
      <P>In regard to the resumption of talks, since the formation of this Government we have been ready and available to resume round table or any other form of dialogue.  It is important that dialogue is resumed at the earliest possible opportunity. As I stated last night in Washington, if we can bring about a cessation of violence the atmosphere for the resumption of talks would be transformed and we could get on with the job in hands.</P>

      <P>I raised the question of the attitude of various Churches to integrated education at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs some weeks ago and I was appalled to be told by Mr. Andy Pollak, who was briefing us, that the stumbling block in relation to integrated education in Northern Ireland is the Roman Catholic Church.  Is the Minister aware of that and will he do something to break that impasse?</P>

      <P>I certainly was not aware of the remark that was made but I have a general understanding of the background to it and the difficulties that arise in <Col N="2221" /> regard to integrated education.  Integrated education would play an enormous role in breaking down the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland and, as Deputy De Rossa stated, on the rest of the island also.  That is something I will be aiming for.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 37 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's network of resident diplomatic missions is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future.  We do of course keep the possibility of its extension under review in the light of changing national and international circumstances and the resources available to us. Because of competing demands on our limited financial and personnel resources, it is doubtful that, in the short term at least, Ireland would be in a position to establish a resident Embassy in Israel.  However, the Government will continue to monitor closely the evolving <Col N="2222" /> situation in the Middle East and our Ambassador in Greece, who is accredited to Israel on a non-residential basis, will maintain regular contact with the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>The visit to Israel earlier this month of an Oireachtas delegation led by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs marks a further development in Irish-Israeli relations and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of that delegation, I was led to believe that the opening of an Israeli embassy in Dublin was about to receive immediate Cabinet attention.  I was led to believe also that this view was shared in Israel.  Will the Minister indicate whether the Government is considering a reciprocal arrangement in that the Israelis may open an embassy in Dublin?  The person who drafted the Minister's reply did so with an economy of language which did not cover a reciprocal arrangement.  Is the Minister aware that there is a growing market between the Irish and Israeli economies and that it is proposed that El-Al or Aer Lingus will run direct Israel-Dublin flights next year.  In that context, will the Minister agree that there would be much to be gained from having more intense diplomatic relations with the state of Israel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply was drafted having regard to the question tabled.  Perhaps it was intended to ask the other half of the question to which the Deputy referred.  The understanding the Deputy received from the delegation that went to Israel is also my understanding.  The matter is high on the Government agenda and I hope to have it dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in recent weeks I have looked at the trade figures between Ireland and Israel and they are both favourable and increasing.  There is potential for further growth in trade with Israel and I hope this can be developed.  As I have said previously, given what is happening in the Middle East we have an historic <Col N="2223" /> opportunity to develop our relations with Israel.  This is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy McDowell for his ingenuity.  Last month I tabled a similar question and I wondered how he managed to have this question put back on the agenda.  Does the Minister agree that the delay in making a decision to allow an Israeli embassy to be opened in Dublin is the source of a great deal of tension between Ireland and Israel and that it is nothing short of churlish?  Is he aware that the Israelis think the reason for the delay is that there is a difference of opinion between him and a former incumbent of his office?  Will he use his position as Tánaiste and deputy head of the Government to prevail at Cabinet and have this decision made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation which has far reaching implications for local government in the Dublin area also contains some messages for those of us who live on the periphery of that region. Indeed, it contains a particular message for members of local authorities and local authority administrators throughout the rest of the country.  I should quickly make the point that local government is operating in a totally different environment today as compared with the position 100 years ago.  In this regard I compliment those who drew up the original Local Government Acts in so far as they stood the test of time.  They were calculated to strike a balance in the system.  Indeed, this legislation lasted well beyond its sellby date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past 25 years due to pressure from the people, in many cases for <Col N="2252" /> good reasons, we began to tamper with the system to such an extent that some aspects are now unworkable.  In particular I would like to deal with the question of local government financing.  In this regard the position has changed dramatically since the first Local Government Acts were put in place and the first local authorities were set up in the sense that local authorities no longer have the power to raise a large proportion of the finance required.  Consequently, they are subject to restrictions in regard to the ways in which they can spend this money.</P>
    <P>A number of other speakers have referred to this matter.  All I can say is that it would be far better if the local authorities were able to raise revenue. For example, they could be entitled to receive a percentage of VAT receipts or income tax collected within their functional area.  However, that would present us with a difficulty in the sense that public representatives would not be directly involved in the difficult task of levying various taxes.  As we are aware, if the responsibility for this task rests with some other institution or body, that institution or body will spend the finance raised in whatever way they see fit.</P>
    <P>I am glad my constituency colleague in County Kildare, the Minister of State, is sitting opposite me.  We have had this argument on many occasions in the past. It is fortuitous that we are speaking on this Bill at this time, given that the local authorities are in the process of preparing their estimates, which are discussed at this time of year.  The Minister of State in the past believed that local charges should be abolished.  For a long time I have believed that if we abolish them we will lose many services.  There is only one way to resolve the problem, that is, the Minister of State should ensure that a sum of money is included in his Department's Estimates for Kildare County Council to enable it to do what he has always wanted it to do.  I know the Minister of State would be upset if he did not get an opportunity to outline clearly what his intentions are in this area.  Constituents in the counties of Kildare, Wicklow <Col N="2253" /> and Meath are equally anxious to know what his intentions are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are good intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt they are good intentions, but I hope the passage of time has not in any way watered down the Minister's very good intentions.  I hope the expression &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; is not unfortunate in the context of water charges and that the fact he is sitting on the far side of the House now does not alter the fine aspirations the Minister espoused when he sat on this side of the House.  It is likely he will be asked that in the next couple of weeks by councils like Kildare County Council and I know he would like to be informed in advance.  The necessary financial preparations that must be made in such circumstances take some considerable time and I would not like to spring that upon the Minister of the Department later.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the far reaching burdens placed on the local authorities by central Government.  I refer to the various Acts of the Oireachtas which have to be implemented by the local authorities and which in many cases impose financial burdens on them.  A multiplicity of such legislation means that the already meagre finances of local authorities are further stretched and the ability of the members of local authorities to provide the services required by their constituents is consequently restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are around 240 or 250 Acts of the Oireachtas which put a financial burden on local authorities, who have inadequate, if any, recompense.  The Motorways Act is a problem in that lighting for motorways is the responsibility of the local authorities which have had to design such motorways with lighting etc. to international standards.  That costs huge sums of money; and these motorways are there to serve the commuter population and not necessarily the people who live or work in a local area.  This has already been referred to by Deputy Power on the other side of the House. In Kildare County Council we have a colossal electricity bill in respect of lighting <Col N="2254" /> of motorways, most of which are not for our own benefit.</P>
    <P>The Abattoirs Act is a serious cause of contention.  I know the Minister is conversant with that legislation as we were both sitting on this side of the House when the original Bill was passed.  We pointed out the dangers of the erosion of the financial resources of local authorities through lack of sufficient funding for a veterinary officer.  We anticipated what would happen, and it has happened.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not concerned; he was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture at that time.  The fact that this legislation seriously affects the local authorities' capacity to fulfil their normal financial obligations does not impinge on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  This Act imposes an obligation on the local authorities but gives them to chance to recoup their losses.</P>
    <P>These are just two of a multitude of financial burdens on the local authorities following the passing of legislation by the Oireachtas.  Considerable sums of money are spent implementing legislation which could have been spent on other worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>The question of local authority members' responsibilities in regard to rezoning of land has been raised here. The amount of attention such an issue can generate is amazing.  Many people have been preoccupied with it over a long time.  It is regularly suggested that the elected members of local authorities are not competent to carry out this work.  I do not know why this is so because, after all, the members of the local authority were elected to perform this task.  They do their best.  Sometimes they make mistakes; they go too far or they do not go far enough.  Be that as it may, their job is to carry out their task given to them by the electorate and they have done a reasonably good job.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the rate support grant, which impacts on all local authorities and, at the risk of being parochial, paticularly on Kildare County Council.  I do not have to tell the Minister the absolute necessity of updating the <Col N="2255" /> rate support grants in line with current valuations, particularly in areas that have been subject to considerable development over the last 15 or 20 years, so that they now fall far short of their share of rate support payments since the abolition of domestic rates.  It is clear there is now a vast gap between the local authorities that were not subjected to much development and those like Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and Dublin County Council itself which were.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will act as an inspiration to the Minister and the Government in arriving at a means of resolving this problem for the future.  If that problem is not addressed now the people who live in the outer ring of the greater Dublin area, particularly in the newly developed areas, will have a quality of life in terms of services etc. that falls far short of what was available under the old local authority system ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Many speakers have pointed to the need for facilities and amenities to support growing and devloping populations.  I can only underline the importance of that and say that it is absolutely necessary to address the problem in the near future.  Otherwise we will have to spend large sums of money to provide infrastructure that should have been provided years ago.</P>
    <P>It is useful to talk about the Dublin area and Dublin County Council, because what Dublin County Council is experiencing today will be experienced by those of us who live in the outer ring of the greater Dublin area and we should learn from the mistakes that were made. We should provide the services and amenities now when it is cheaper to do so rather than attempting to do it in retrospect when serious damage has been done to society.</P>
    <P>I am not making any allegations against anybody.  I recall that members of my local authority area were blamed for rezoning land in a town that should never have been rezoned, but those local authority members were not responsible for the rezoning.  That decision was made by ministerial order or by way of an appeal <Col N="2256" /> to An Bord Pleanála.  The boundary changes in the area were forced on those local authority members.  In many cases rezoning took place without any input from members of local authorities and decisions in that regard were made over their heads.  In the past, very few amenities were provided in rezoned areas for outdoor recreational pursuits such as football and other sports.  There was only a limited provision in respect of indoor facilities.  In developing communities it is vital to ensure that adequate open space is provided to allow the local community make its own financial contribution into the amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>Greater amounts of money must be spent today on providing services and facilities that should have been provided when areas were developed 20 to 30 years ago.  That is a sad reflection.  Ironically, this expense is not incurred as a result of a lack of foresight on the part of members of local authorities, because they were not involved in the development plans, but on the part of those who made decisions in respect of the development. I hope we have learned from reviews of county development plans that adequate provision must be provided for recreational facilities which will cater for the projected population of areas designated for rezoning.  Those facilities must be provided at the development stage and not later.</P>
    <P>I am sure those who live on the periphery of the Dublin area will be surprised that Dublin County Council will be replaced by a number of local authorities. This is a major change.  We will have to wait and see whether the change is good or bad.  The change should improve matters because the more consultative the process one engages in the better and the more refined is the outcome.</P>
    <P>Local government has not kept in step with the many different demands of society.  Society requires a local authority system to which it can respond and the system must respond to society.  If that two way process does not exist there is a danger that the public may become disillusioned with the local authority system.  The public may perceive that the <Col N="2257" /> system imposes burdens on them but does not give much in turn.  Local authorities provide a wide range of vital services which people take for granted, such as libraries, higher education grants, fire services, emergency services and so on. Local government should evolve in line with the community in which it is situated and, if it does not, it will lose touch with the local community and become dangerously irrelevant.</P>

      <P>I like to thank Deputies who contributed to the Second Reading of the Bill.  In particular, I would like to thank them for the positive tone of their contributions.  I welcome the fact that the provisions of the Bill have been welcomed generally.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Minister's speech, the intent of the Bill is quite simple and indeed has been approved in principle by the Dáil in the context of the 1985 Reorganisation Act and the 1991 Local Government Act.  It is the establishment of three new county councils to replace Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Deansgrange Joint Burial Board.  Given this situation, the Bill is perhaps surprisingly complex and long.  This results from the many consequential technical amendments to other statutory provisions, together with a number of improvements being effected which are designed to rationalise local authority operations in certain service areas.  On the detailed provisions of the Bill, I have noted that a number of amendments can be expected on Committee Stage and they will be dealt with in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the specific points raised on the Bill.  Deputy Doyle and other speakers referred to the abolition of Dublin County Council and that the concept of County Dublin would disappear.  All children learn that there are 26 counties in the State.  They are what might be termed the geographical counties and they are a strong concept in the minds of all Irish people.  However, for local government purposes the State is divided into what are called administrative <Col N="2258" /> counties.  Those are counties for which a county council is elected.  There are 27 of those; County Tipperary has two county councils.  In addition, there are five county boroughs, Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, and each of those constitute an administrative county which has its own city council. Therefore, there are 32 local government divisions &mdash; 27 counties and five county boroughs &mdash; which elect county or city councils and which by law are termed administrative counties.  Following this Bill the administrative county of Dublin will be replaced by three new administrative counties, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Then there will be a total of 34 administrative counties &mdash; 29 counties and five county boroughs &mdash; in the State.  Only time will tell if in future years those three new local government counties will develop an identity which will supersede the existing geographical county of Dublin.  For the immediate future it is safe to assume they will continue to be a single area, the geographical county of Dublin comprising the county borough and the three new counties.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made that the accumulated revenue deficits of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation should be written off rather than their being transferred to the new authorities. Between the two existing authorities the accumulated revenue deficit at the end of 1992 was more than £21 million. Translated into simple language, the suggestion is to ask the Government to provide £21 million in Exchequer funds to wipe the slate clean.  I regret that, given the many financial problems and demands facing the Government, solutions like this are simply not on.</P>
    <P>However, while Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation have incurred substantial deficits, those deficits are only one side of the issue and to get a fuller picture one must also consider the extent of debtors on the books of both authorities in respect of the very substantial sums owed to the authorities under a variety of headings.  In the case of Dublin County Council, its debtors <Col N="2259" /> amount to a realistic figure of £18 million and the sum for Dún Laoghaire Corporation is approximately £3 million. Those assets will also transfer to the new councils and every effort must be made to collect those outstanding sums.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to write off the debts owed to the councils by individuals and companies, using taxpayers' money. Even if I were in a position to do so, one could imagine the response from every other local authority if this were done. All of this serves to remind the councils that budgetary discipline is a fundamental requirement of any council's financial operations and it will be essential for the new councils, from day one, to put in place sound financial systems.</P>
    <P>The local authorities considered the question of the names of the new counties. For example, Deputy Walsh indicated that the south Dublin area committee gave considerable time to this issue.  No area committee made proposals to change the names of the new counties, nor did Dublin County Council or Dún Laoghaire Corporation in their formal submission to the Minister in relation to the reorganisation report.  This is a matter which should be left to the councils to decide and the Bill provides for this.  It is not a matter for the national Parliament to intervene and impose solutions on local people.  For the first time ever, a procedure involving public consultations is set out for the new councils to promote a change in the name of their counties. This is as it should be as a local issue is best decided by local people.</P>
    <P>The question of co-ordination was referred to by a number of Deputies. There will be four principal authorities for the Dublin area; the three new county councils and Dublin Corporation. To ensure proper co-ordination between the local authorities on an ongoing basis and in a properly structured manner, the Bill requires their managers to put in place appropriate procedures for consultation and co-operation.  This will involve consultation and co-operation at official level, regular meetings and other practical arrangements worked out <Col N="2260" /> locally to ensure the new statutory duties introduced by the Bill are complied with. In this regard the Bill imposes a statutory duty on the local authorities in performing their functions, at official or elected member level, to have regard to the metropolitan interest.  By virtue of this provision, in performing any statutory function which may have an impact on the metropolitan area, in relation to waste disposal, roads, major planning applications or other matters, the relevant local authority must take the metropolitan interest into account.  This is designed to ensure that local authorities will not operate in isolation and without reference to the overall Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The regional authorities will be in a position to formulate a regional framework which will form a necessary backdrop for local authority operations to be undertaken by reference to the overall metropolitan interest.  The Minister will shortly make an order under the Local Government Act, 1991, to establish regional authorities.  Their role will be to promote the co-ordination of public services generally in their regions, including local authority services.  Dublin city and three new counties will constitute the Dublin region, and the surrounding counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow will form and mid-east region.  The new authorities will be well placed to view local problems, needs and priorities from the broader regional perspective.  They will also be able to provide a regional focus and voice where these are lacking at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically requires the individual Dublin local authorities to have regard to any reports, submissions or joint submissions made by the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities.  In this regard I would expect both of these authorities to co-operate closely with a view to devising an appropriate framework for Dublin and the surrounding areas.  Taken together, the provisions of the Bill and the operation of the regional authorities will ensure co-ordination on an ongoing basis and within the regional dimension. This will apply in relation to local authority <Col N="2261" /> services and functions affecting the Dublin area as a whole, including the review and co-ordination of development plans.</P>
    <P>The principle of the transfer of houses and land to the local authority in whose area they are located has been welcomed by most speakers in the course of this debate.  Several Deputies spoke of a need to expedite the transfer process.  I welcome this generally positive response from Members of all sides to the proposals for the transfer of local authority dwellings and lands.  Deputies' concerns tended to centre on the future operation of the housing system when the ownership arrangements have been rationalised under the transfer schemes.</P>
    <P>Some 7,500 rented dwellings are owned by Dublin Corporation and located in the county council area.  Speakers referred to the unsatisfactory position in that the tenants involved are not represented at local level by members of the authority which provided their dwellings. There is a general perception among these tenants that because the county councillors who represent them have no say in the allocation of resources by the corporation who manages and maintains the houses, the management and maintenance of the dwellings has suffered. The corporation and the council have separate maintenance depots which militates against effective use of resources and the tenants generally perceive that they are remote from the services of the corporation.  Equally there are county council houses, but a much smaller number, located in the city area where the same issues arise.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation report on the establishment of three new county authorities in the Dublin area recommended that ownership of the local authority housing stock should be transferred to the local authority in whose area it is located.  In the absence of a single housing authority for the Dublin area as a whole, the report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing also recommended a transfer of full responsibility for the corporation housing stock in the county area to the new county councils.  Such a transfer <Col N="2262" /> would secure a more rational, cost effective and democratically accountable local authority housing management and maintenance system in the Dublin area. At a time when three new county councils are being established it is important to establish clear responsibilities for the provision of services, and indeed that local communities are clearly aware as to who is responsible for what.  Discussion on this matter brings to mind the provisions of section 32 which require the local authority to have regard to the overall metropolitan area and its inhabitants. Local authorities cannot operate in isolation from one another but must work together for the benefit of all, it is on this basis that I see the transfer process proceeding.</P>
    <P>Essentially the approach taken in the Bill has been to provide a framework which will ensure that the question of the transfers for which there is general support is tackled without further delay in a way that will allow all the issues, including those raised in the House, to be worked out by the authorities immediately affected.  I have every confidence in the ability of these authorities to negotiate and develop transfer schemes that will effectively deal with and accommodate their respective interests.  The Bill ensures that this process will involve not alone the managers but the elected members of both transferor and transferee authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that I have avoided advocating or attempting to impose any set of solutions lest it might unduly influence the authorities' deliberations. The issues involved should be worked out by those in the best position to do so, and this is the principle followed in the Bill.  The central point is that the Bill allows the local authorities the flexibility to consider the many issues which arise and to work out the most appropriate transfer arrangements, taking an all round view of the implications of the transfers for all the authorities.  We must also remember that what is involved here is a transfer from one public body to another.  The public is concerned with the actual service provided and, as I have <Col N="2263" /> said, the transfers to be effected by the Bill are designed to improve and rationalise the operation of the system.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the implications of the transfers for Dublin Corporation's capacity to meet housing needs.  The question has been asked as to how and where housing applicants in the city will be catered for in the new circumstances where the corporation will no longer have houses or lands in the county.  The vast majority of the corporation's approved housing applicants wish to remain in the city.  Therefore, the corporation should ideally not build in the county again, but should concentrate on developing a strategy to carry out its housing programmes within its own boundaries.  In this context I emphasise that housing provision by local authorities should not be concentrated solely on new building but should achieve a judicious mix of new houses and the purchase of existing private houses, including those in need of refurbishment.  While there may be some cost implications for the corporation in providing housing exclusively in the city area as opposed to green field sites in the county, small infill developments in the city can be widely beneficial.  By making a significant contribution to urban renewal it increases the population in the inner city area, makes better use of existing services and helps to regenerate the many run-down areas that are still all too evident.  The corporation's housing activities will have the potential to act as a catalyst for other initiatives such as shops, private housing and so on in areas that are at present badly in need of redevelopment.</P>
    <P>Needless to say the overriding principle to the transfers of houses to the authority in whose area the houses are situated is that the position of people currently on the housing waiting list of any of the Dublin authorities should not be adversely affected.  I am aware that Dublin Cororation was able to avail of 270 casual vacancies last year from its housing stock in the county.  While the transfers could have significant implications for the corporation's future housing <Col N="2264" /> operations, the proposals in the Bill are structured to allow proposals to be developed by the authorities that take account of these issues.  The corporation may find it necessary to retain a capacity to avail of casual vacancies in the county area, and the provisions of the Bill allow schemes to provide for this.  Equally, the question of houses provided for occupation by persons designated by the corporation could also be considered.  None of these options is closed off and indeed they are recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank Members for their contributions to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to the level of investment in science and technology, particularly in science, and the way in which it can lead to the creation of jobs.  If this country is to make progress it must develop its indigenous industries, the agricultural and food industry, the fishing industry and the forestry sector. Most multinational companies are science based, particularly the pharmaceutical and electronic industries, <Col N="2265" /> which have a large base in this country. These companies depend very heavily on science and technology for progress. During the 1960s the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson, laid very strong emphasis on the relevance of science and technology as a means of stimulating economic development.</P>
      <P>Two types of jobs can be created.  First, we can create jobs with a high level of innovation which are heavily dependent on technology.  A large number of people, earning good money, can be employed in these jobs and we can get a very worthwhile price on the world market for their products.  Second, we can go down the road of a low wage economy, an option to which I would be very much opposed.  If we want a highly developed technological economy which produces new goods then it is essential to develop our science and technology.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that there is a crisis in science as suggested by a body of practising scientists in a report in today's <i>Irish Press</i> although there is no doubt that there are very serious problems in that area.  In August 1993, <i>Nature,</i> the world's leading scientific magazine, referred to Ireland as a scientific backwater where the Government had turned its back on science.  Ireland is described as a country where science is not championed by the Government and where there is no ministry with special responsibility for science, no research council and no effective lobby to support it.  This scientific journal is read in almost every scientific laboratory throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Low levels of innovation have been cited as one of the fundamental reasons Ireland is not developing the jobs it badly needs.  Ireland has the lowest level of investment in science in the developed world and the level of medical research has been seriously reduced over the past few years, particularly medical research supported by the Health Research Board.  The budget for this board in 1992 was reduced to £1.7 million, or 0.09 per cent of the total health budget.  Since the abolition of the National Board for Science and Technology approximately a decade ago, scientific agencies have been <Col N="2266" /> under siege and bombardment from elements of the establishment whose ignorance has only been matched by the vigour with which they have set about destroying and damaging Irish science.  It is disgraceful that elements of the establishment should have set about undermining science, which in turn has undermined our capacity to develop. Much of the progress made in Ireland has been science based.  This is particularly true of the dairy industry where progress was underpinned by the research and teaching in UCC and UCD.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to think that Ireland could lead the world in the area of science.  However, it is essential to make a realistic investment in science and technology which will enable us to be conversant with trade in this area and to avail of ideas developed elsewhere.  It is vital to support out small group of elite scientists who, over the past few months, have been distracted from their work, forced to enter the political process and write to newspapers in an effort to highlight their difficulties.  I refer in particular to Professor Brian Harvey from UCC who has been writing to the newspapers for the past three or four months and Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, a very distinguished young Irish scientist who has returned to this country from the United States.  I understand he employs 36 people in his laboratory while Professor Brian Harvey employs 11 people in his laboratory. Most of the funding received by these scientists comes from outside the country. It is essential that every encouragement is given to these people who provide a great service, generate relationships throughout the international community, attract students from other countries to study here and enable our best and brightest young scientists to study here and eventually become involved in industry.  Many of the people whose work underpinned the progress in our dairy and agricultural industry began their working life in the Agricultural Research Institute.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, worked in the Agricultural Research Institute, where he made a contribution <Col N="2267" /> to science, before he became involved in politics.</P>
    <P>A Cabinet sub-committee should be set up to consider and promote science and technology.  A science board should be established &mdash; I understand there is some movement in this direction &mdash; to review the present position in this area and make recommendations.  We will not make any progress in the area of science and technology until a science unit is set up in one of the key Departments &mdash; the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully appreciates the importance of science and technology and the contribution they can make to industrial development and national life generally. Over the past five years the science and technology budget has risen very dramatically from £3.8 million in 1988 to £49.1 million in 1993.  Therefore, the comments from some quarters that the Government is not committed to science and technology are without foundation. However, as in any line of endeavour, politicians, no more than industrialists or scientists, are constantly faced with choices and challenges and decisions on how best to apply scarce resources to competing projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to developing science and technology but it has to maximise the take from its investment for the national good.  It has to fully exploit the science base and apply technology in support of innovation and industrial development generally.  In the short term the Government is shifting the emphasis from pure science to applied research which will help industry.  We are not unique in doing this.  The history of science and technology in Europe is of a community which is good at basic research but poor at translating it into competitive advantage, new products and new jobs.  The European Commission <Col N="2268" /> and the member states recognise this.</P>
    <P>The European Union's research and technology development programmes all place emphasis on the applied end of the science and technology spectrum.  Indeed President Clinton's policy paper of last February, the recent UK White Paper and various other reviews carried out in member states do likewise.  The Culliton report is very precise on this.  It states:</P>
    <P>Technological competence is one of the main keys to competitive advantage. This is not an optional extra in the search for greater industrial output and employment growth; without adequate technology development in Irish industry a decline in competitiveness is inevitable.  Constant improvements in product and process technology are essential to maintain an expanding industrial sector.  This applies to all sectors of industry.  Even simple low tech products are produced with greater efficiency, quality and precision with improved process technology. Sustainable development of indigenous industry requires entrepreneurs and executives who have a practical knowledge and appreciation of technology and the wish to use it.</P>
    <P>Ireland is thus very much in the vanguard of change and of switching emphasis to the application of technology.  We want to reduce the remoteness between the third level and industry.  We wish to create far greater interaction between technology and industry and we want to make schemes responsive to the needs of industry.  The Measure 6 scheme, which we introduced this year and which has a £23 million budget, is purely industry driven; but many of our other schemes are also addressing the needs of industry, large and small, from our technology transfer programmes, to our technology audit programmes for firms, to Tech start, Tech management and to higher education/industry collaboration schemes. Many of these schemes are providing practical help to small indigenous industry and allowing them to take the <Col N="2269" /> first steps on the road to technology upgrading.</P>
    <P>For industry to be successful it must generate a constant stream of new products and improved processes.  It must produce new products to meet customer preferences and it must improve quality and cut costs through efficiency in the production process.  As Culliton said, this is not an optional extra.  If industry is standing still, it is in effect going backwards.</P>
    <P>Science and technology policy to be truly effective must foster a climate in which innovation can develop and spread.  Unfortunately, innovation cannot be ordered to measure.  It is a complex social process calling for a scientific, technical and business culture as well as a climate that encourages entrepreneurship and long term-vision.</P>
    <P>Because it is convinced of the pivotal role which science and technology has to play in modern society, its potential contribution to industrial development, the need for industry to constantly upgrade and innovate and the large amount of State resources already committed to these activities, the Government has agreed to a full scale review of science and technology, details of which will be announced in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government is now embarking on consultations with the European Commission in relation to our proposed National Development Plan 1994-1999. Included within this plan is a special sub programme for research and development which will include measures targeted at funding company-led research and development, assisting companies to evaluate and upgrade their research and development potential, developing, the technology services provided by Eolas, developing regional technology centres offering services to specific industry sectors or in particular technologies, programmes in advanced technologies which develop the expertise of third level institutions in enabling technologies, a fund to support third level research and backup support on evaluation and linkages with other EC programmes for research and technology development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2270" /> I appreciate the very detailed comments which the Deputy has made on this topic.  His suggestions in relation to the Cabinet subcommittee on science, a possible science board and also a special science unit will be brought to the attention of the Minister in the context of the review of science and technology I mentioned earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter involves hardship for two families.  It may affect other families also, but these are two specific cases where the mortgage interest supplement is being denied and where both families, who are now affected by unemployment, find they cannot meet their mortgages.  When the contracts were signed one or both of the partners in these families was working.  However, between the stage of signing the contracts and collecting the key of the house they became unemployed.  They are now being denied this supplement because the authorities refuse to give the supplement to people who were unemployed at the time they took on the responsibility of buying their homes.  That is the rule according to the health board, but these people were not unemployed when they took on the responsibility.  They signed contracts at a time when they were in employment and did not foresee any unemployment situation arising.</P>
      <P>These families will be destroyed if we cannot overrule this nonsensical bureaucracy. It will also put them back on the housing list, where they will be provided with accommodation at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  It is likely that at some stage in the future one or both of these families will regain employment.  The treatment of these families shows a great deal of inhumanity on the part of those who have made this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these families is from Drimnagh and the other is from Crumlin.  In the case of the first family, they pay a mortgage of £207 per month but are now receiving unemployment assistance of only £116 per week.  The husband in this case <Col N="2271" /> worked until May 1993 and received final approval from Dublin Corporation for the purchase of this house the previous month on 27 April.  It is a shared ownership scheme, but he did not collect the keys to the house until a month after he became unemployed.  Despite the fact that he had entered into a contract, the health board is now saying that he is not entitled to the supplement.</P>
    <P>The second case involves a couple who are not married; they are common law husband and wife.  The letter from the health board refers to them both, but a previous reference to the case which I raised here by way of parliamentary question referred only to the lady concerned. The man in this case was working when they both signed the contracts; but, again, when they received the keys the man had become unemployed.  They have an endowment policy loan on which the repayments are £310 per month.</P>
    <P>Both of these families are now facing ruin because of a technicality.  I am asking the Minister to put a stop to this nonsense. At the end of the day it will cost the State more, in addition to the terrible trauma that will be caused to these families. If they have to give up their homes in Drimnagh and Crumlin, respectively, the only place they can be accommodated by the local authority is in Tallaght or some area where there are houses available at present.  That would mean taking their children out of the community, enrolling them in new schools, losing the deposit which they sacrificed everything to put together as well as the repayments they have made so far.  If they could be given a little help to get over this difficulty they would eventually be able to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>In both these cases the families are self-starters.  They did not seek to be housed by the city because they were aware of the difficult housing situation. Both of them are from ordinary Dublin working class families and they made great sacrifices to put together a deposit for a house.  They now find that everything they have is being thrown to one side by what I consider to be an outrageously <Col N="2272" /> bureaucratic interpretation of the rules.</P>
    <P>It is our job, not just to raise taxes and legislate.  This is a House of Representatives, and the overall Government and its agencies are accountable.  In this case the Eastern Health Board has gone too far.  The Minister should advise them that for the sake of both these families and others like them, the rules should not be adhered to in this rigid, technical manner.  It would be different if they had been unemployed all the time and had taken on this responsibility against the advice given to them but that is not the case.  In both cases they were employed at the time of signature of the contract.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position not just to inform me of the view of her Department and the Eastern Health Board but to review these two cases and direct that these two families are assisted.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a payment may be made to a person whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs in respect of the interest element of a mortgage repayment subject to a minimum contribution of £5 from that individual's own resources.</P>
      <P>The determination of individual applications for assistance with mortgage interest repayments is a matter for each health board.  However, in general, it is health board policy not to assist people who secure a mortgage when they are not in a financial position to meet their repayments.  That policy is as much in the interests of protecting the individual as in the interests of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>In one of the cases in question, involving a male applicant, he became unemployed and claimed unemployment assistance on 21 May of this year having applied to Dublin Corporation in March of this year to purchase a house under the shared-ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale was closed on 25 June 1993. However, Dublin Corporation has informed the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="2273" /> that it was not advised of the change in the applicant's circumstances and that if they had it would have been necessary to reassess the application.  Dublin Corporation also indicated it is not its policy to grant mortgages to persons in receipt of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In this case the Eastern Health Board refused the application because the person in question had entered into a commitment when he was not in a position to meet the repayments.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are similar in the second case in that the person in question received mortgage approval on 5 February, 1993 when she and her partner were in receipt of social employment scheme or unemployment payments.  The health board refused the application on the same basis as the previous case.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on payment of rent and mortgage supplements are currently under review by an advisory committee involving all the eight health boards and chaired by the Department of Social Welfare. I will ask the committee to consider the specific issues raised by the Deputy in these applications.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is interested in assisting individuals to the maximum possible extent.  Nonetheless, one must be realistic in terms of an individual's ability to take on a very substantial commitment when they are not in employment.  Certainly, in relation to the specific cases raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell, I will have officials of my Department examine them in some detail to ascertain whether the Eastern Health Board or Dublin Corporation are in a position to carry out a further review of their cases.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rates Support Grant.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  As Members of the House will know, most local authorities are in the process of preparing their Estimates for the year 1994.  I should explain to the House that the rates support grant constitutes the method by which the Government compensates &mdash;<Col N="2274" /> or, I should say more properly, feebly attempts to compensate &mdash; local authorities for their loss of revenue resulting from the abolition of domestic rates in 1977 and the eventual abolition of rates on agricultural land in 1982.  The rates support grant notified by the Minister's Department to local authorities in the current year was 2.3 per cent, grossly inadequate in all cases.  No doubt the Minister will argue that the 2.3 per cent keeps pace with the rate of inflation.  Of course, that takes no account of extra responsibilities placed on those same local authorities resulting from legislation and Government policy in recent years, even within the past year.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is laudable but the regulations drawn up in relation to it must be implemented by local authorities, necessitating additional staff and resources. There is nothing in the rates support grant which reflects that additional cost. The same applies to the additional cost devolving on local authorities under the building regulations stipulated in the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, passed by this House within the past 12 months, another major cost with staff implications and so on.  The Minister takes no account of that in his notification of the rates support grant to local authorities.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, are only now being implemented because they were never properly funded.  This means that local authorities must fund veterinary inspectors and so on.  Yet those same local authorities are being pressurised by the Department of Agriculture and Food to implement more of the provisions of that Act in the coming year while nothing in the rates support grant reflects those additional costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing their estimates for 1994 almost all local authorities were obliged to make provision for a number of outstanding awards which will become payable under the 1994 pay agreement of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  In 1992 the pay element of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for a 3 per cent <Col N="2275" /> increase in wages and salaries throughout the local and public services.  Similarly, in 1993 the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for an increase of 3.5 per cent.  Of course the Government, having agreed these matters, welshed to some extent and sought their postponement.  While the ceiling on the 3 per cent was lifted from 1 December 1992 and the ceiling on the 3.5 per cent will be lifted in a few weeks' time, from 1 December 1993, the Minister for Finance was forced to agree last January that all arrears of salaries and wages accruing from 1992 and 1993 would be paid in 1994.  Therefore, one can readily see the effects on local authorities' budgets in having to meet that increased demand in the coming year.  That item alone in the case of estimates of most local authorities shows that their wages and salaries bill is increasing by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent.  Similarly this increase is reflected in the pensions which must be paid by local authorities.  I notice that the increased pensions in the budgets of most local authorities for 1994 are between 7 per cent and 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister expect local authorities to organise their affairs while being subjected to all these increased costs &mdash; I mentioned but a few in relation to legislation passed by this House recently &mdash; not the least of which is the implementation of those legislative provisions? How can the Minister expect them to continue to run their affairs while receiving an increase in their rates support grant of only 2.3 per cent?  Of course, in effect, it means the Department is saying they should send the remainder of their bills to their few remaining ratepayers. That is not acceptable because the few remaining commercial ratepayers nationwide simply cannot continue to bear that burden.</P>
    <P>I have some interesting figures to demonstrate what I mean.  For instance, in my own county of Roscommon, with which I am most familiar, if the rates support grant kept pace with the value of lost revenue from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and agricultural <Col N="2276" /> land, it should be of the order of £8,950,000 whereas, we are receiving a rates support grant of £4,733,000 only, leading to a shortfall of something like £4.5 million, on domestic rates alone.  In County Mayo the shortfall is just short of £6 million; in County Sligo the shortfall is £4.45 million and in County Leitrim, with a population of approximately 25,000 the shortfall is £2.5 million; that is how bad it is.</P>
    <P>We all tend to be critical of services provided by the various Government Departments and which are often referred to in this House but we must acknowledge that most Government services cost more every year and that there is an ever greater demand for better services. We may be critical of the Department of Education; nevertheless, the cost of its service continues to increase.  I would have to agree that the quality of service improves as a result.  I am sure the Department of Defence receives an increased allocation here every year and that the quality of service offered to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no doubt improves. The one area where the quality of service has not improved, considering the amount of money allocated to it, is the local authority service which touches practically every citizen of this State.  We cannot accept this.  I am a member of a local authority who intends to vote against these estimates and the Minister may be faced with having to abolish us. My local authority will be one of many throughout the country who will take decisions of this kind.  I hope the Minister will be willing to meet and discuss with me these estimates and the rate support grant and to consider an increased allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy John Connor for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> In the current year total spending by local authorities is estimated to amount to £1.7 billion.  This is broken down between current spending of nearly £1.1 billion and capital spending of £600 million.  This is a very significant public spending level by our local authorities, and they are delivering a wide range of services many of which are taken for granted.  There have been calls for more funding for local authority services and I accept this is a natural tendency in an effort to improve and expand the range of services. However, we have to be realistic about what we can accomplish with the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>As I said, current spending by local authorities exceeds £1 billion this year. Of this amount, £400 million is provided by way of Exchequer grants and the rest is raised at local level.  Many of the Government grants fund specific services &mdash; from improvement and maintenance work on non-national roads to recouping the cost of higher education grants.  There is also the rate support grant, which amounts to over £173 million this year. This is a general purpose grant; local authorities have complete discretion as to how and where it is spent within their own estimates.</P>
    <P>There have been demands for a substantial increase in the grant.  The fact is, however, that there has been an increase in the grant this year and local authorities have already been notified that their allocations will be increased by 2.5 per cent for the coming year.  The increase may be modest; but it is an increase at a time when there are severe constraints on our public finances.</P>
    <P>There are many genuine demands competing for scarce resources and the Government has to strike a balance between expenditure and taxation.  Calls for increased levels of rate support grant or in other areas of local authority funding, are understandable; but the broad options are either to take funds away from some other services or further increase taxation.</P>
    <P>There is no easy answer and the Deputy will recall the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, <Col N="2278" /> saying this in the Deputy's presence when he met with the members of Roscommon County Council on 23 July last.  The Government's aim is to reduce rather than increase the overall level of taxation and to achieve a fair allocation of the overall resources available.  The local authorities are getting a reasonable share of the resources available in present circumstances. That is not to say that there are not difficulties and problem areas at local level but we have to cut our cloth to suit our measure.</P>
    <P>In the context of Roscommon County Council's finances, the Minister heard at first hand the issues being faced at local level when he met the council last July and the Deputy should understand that the difficulties being encountered at local level are acknowledged.  We are always trying to find better ways to do things and have as much decision making as possible done at local level.  I have to say that Roscommon County Council manages its financial affairs very well and I believe that the council are capable of settling their expenditure estimates for 1994 within the resources that are available. This may call for hard decisions on some issues, but these hard decisions simply have to be faced by all of us.  It is not possible to increase the council's allocation for 1994 beyond the 2.5 per cent increase already notified.  The grant is a general one and the size of any increase cannot reasonably be compared to the size of increases in particular items of expenditure.  The total rate support grant allocation for Roscommon for next year is £4.77 million and this compares favourably with that allocated to other local authorities.  Indeed, the Deputy will probably be aware, as a matter of interest, that the findings in the report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies suggested that under a number of redistribution options, Roscommon County Council would lose significant amounts of grant.</P>
    <P>There are a number of local authorities who for one reason or another are experiencing more difficulty than others in the context of the estimates.  It is always possible to find some basis on which statistical analysis would suggest that the rate support <Col N="2279" /> grant allocations to some should be increased while that of others should be reduced.  This approach is untenable in present circumstances and it is felt that there is a good deal of unspoken recognition of these realities.  The Minister is not in favour of major financial upheavals being visited on individual local authorities. If imbalances exist, they did not come about overnight and it would certainly be imprudent to try and solve them suddenly and at the expense of others who may be equally hard-pressed.  It is fair to say the Minister is less than convinced that widesperad redistribution of the rate support grant is appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of respect for you and your office I will do so, but I see little point in the exercise.  I should say that I went out of my way last evening to transmit certain documents to the Minister for Education concerning the manner of operation of the governing body of the Letterkenny Regional Technical College and the implications of an announcement by the chairman of the governing body that it was decided to ask the Fraud Squad to investigate the alleged misappropriation of public funds &mdash; although there is no evidence that this has in fact been done.</P>
      <P>The matter has been brought to my attention by the Union of Students in Ireland whose local branch union is being forced to discontinue its service to its members arising from a decision of the governing body to withhold payment of the capitation fee and annual college allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The documents which I passed to the Minister would seem to suggest a conflict of interest between the public role and the private commercial interests of the chairman of the governing body, an apparent breach of the Data Protection <Col N="2281" /> Act and gross impropriety concerning the manner in which the affairs of the governing body are conducted.</P>
    <P>Further, it is alleged by the union that some local officers and activists of the union are subjected to harassment and sinister phone calls.  The union further believes that a person was recently appointed to a senior post at the college without suitable academic or professional qualification other than a history of close political association with the chairman, although there were many eminently qualified candidates.</P>
    <P>The local students' union at Letterkenny has for some time had a commercial arrangement with an entertainment emporium called The Golden Grill (Letterkenny) Limited.  It was decided this year to do business with a competitor establishment.  This occasioned a letter from the director of The Golden Grill &mdash; a son of the chairman of the governing body of the regional technical college &mdash; to virtually every second and third year student of the college, giving rise to the conviction on the part of the union that the author of the letter was given access to the college data base.  A great many students are concerned to know precisely what information other than their college accommodation address was supplied to a private businessman.  The contents and tone of the letter have given rise to threatened proceedings for defamation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bernard McGlinchey was one of the several hundred appointments made by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, in the days before he left office.  Deputy Brennan seemed to regard political allegiance as one of the main &mdash; some would say the only &mdash; qualification for appointment.</P>
    <P>I am advised that Mr. McGlinchey is now chairman of a governing body almost exclusively of the same political persuasion. I acknowledge this factor does not disqualify these members from the proper conduct of their duties.  However, the manner of the conduct of the affairs of the governing body as described to me warrants the closest scrutiny by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2282" /> I find it disturbing that USI put the Department of Education in possession of this information in far greater detail six weeks ago.  That information detailed the nature of the impropriety in the conduct of the college's affairs; highlighted the central allegation that the private commercial interests of the chairman of the governing body are influencing, if not dictating his conduct of the affairs of the college and detailed the ugly nature of the harassment experienced by some students.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister has been in possession of this information for six weeks she has made no response concerning any investigation that she has, or is, conducting into these serious allegations. The absence of the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, suggests <Col N="2283" /> that she is again seeking to avoid her responsibility in the matter.  Apparently the privileges of office have banished the high-minded rhetoric about high public standards in which she engaged before the election.  The Minister must now choose between doing her public duty and saving her Fianna Fáil colleagues from embarrassment.</P>
      <P>That a college of education should have the conduct of its affairs made the subject of such allegations is unconscionable and I regret it must be ventilated on the floor of this House because of the Minister's inaction.  I greatly regret that the Minister did not come into this House this evening &mdash; having regard to the nature of these allegations and the necessity to ventilate them &mdash; to detail what investigation, if any, she is conducting and what action she proposes to take.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 43 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lisbon European Council in June 1992 concluded that the current round of enlargement to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway was possible on the basis of the institutional provisions contained in the Treaty on European Union and attached declarations.  This position was confirmed both at the Copenhagen <Col N="2226" /> European Council in June 1993 and at the recent European Council in Brussels on 29 October.</P>
    <P>In Brussels, the European Council decided to mandate the Presidency and the Council Secretariat to prepare a proposal on the adjustments that will be required to the institutions with the accession of new members on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen conclusions. The Council indicated its hope that the position of the member states would be defined on this issue at its meeting on 10-11 December following discussions in the General Affairs Council.  The Presidency and the Council Secretariat are currently preparing the proposal on institutional adjustments required to take account of this round of enlargement.  This proposal will be discussed by the General Affairs Council at a future meeting.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the mandate set by successive European Councils since Lisbon the adjustments that will be required to the institutions of the Union to take account of this round of enlargement include: an increase in seats in the European Parliament; and allocation of votes to the new members at Council for qualified majority voting; adjustments on the rotation to the Presidency; an increase in the number of Commissioners; an increase in the number of judges and advocates general at the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and an increase in membership of the Economic and Social Committee, the committee of the regions and other relevant committees.</P>
    <P>There has been no explicit negotiation on the rights of smaller states in the context of an expanded European Union. However, certain informal proposals in circulation in the context of the enlargement issue seemed to open a much wider institutional dabate.  Some of the ideas could have led to a shift in the institutional balance to the disadvantage of the smaller member states.  For example, the size of the Commission would be reduced and the effect would be to deprive the smaller member states of the automatic right to have a Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on any <Col N="2227" /> proposals in the context of enlargement that would fundamentally alter the balance between larger and smaller member states to the disadvantage of the smaller member states has been made abundantly clear.  The Taoiseach, in a statement on 9 September said: &ldquo;we reject such proposals, which run counter to the conclusions of the Lisbon and Copenhagen European Councils&rdquo;.  In a statement I made in the Seanad on 13 October, I rejected any move to use enlargement as an opportunity to bring about fundamental changes in the existing institutional balance.</P>
    <P>At the special General Affairs Council on 26 October, Ireland, together with all the smaller member states, made clear its opposition to any suggestion that the current institutional balance would be altered in the context of this round of enlargement.  In that context, the conclusion of the European Council in Brussels on 29 October which authorises the Presidency and the Council Secretariat to prepare a proposal on the adjustments required in the institutions to accommodate this round of enlargement on the basis of the Lisbon and Copenhagen European Council conclusions fully reflects our position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement to the UN General Assembly on 1 October, I pointed to the many successes of the UN Operation in Somalia.  Whereas one year ago several hundred Somalis were dying each day from famine and malnutrition, today people are no longer dying from man-made famine.  Similarly, a year ago violence was widespread in Somalia; today almost all of the country is calm.  Schools have been reopened, district councils are being established, the Somali courts have recommenced work, and progress has been made in re-establishing the Somali police force.</P>
      <P>The exception to this pattern of progress is South Mogadishu, where the efforts of UNOSOM have been continually frustrated by the activities of General Aidid and his supporters.  There, a particularly vicious campaign of murder has been directed against UNOSOM personnel in an effort to prevent the force from carrying out its mandate.  We extend our sympathy to those countries which have lost personnel, and condemn the perpetrators of the killings.  To date more than 80 members of the operation have been killed.</P>
      <P>Many Somalis have also been killed in these incidents.  In the circumstances of Mogadishu reliable figures are not available, and we must be careful not to lend credence to figures produced as part of a propaganda campaign.  Nor is it possible to say how many of those killed were civilians and how many were active supporters of General Aidid.</P>
      <P>The Security Council has considered developments in Somalia and, and in its Resolution 885 adopted on Tuesday last, decided to authorise &ldquo;the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry, in further implementation of Resolution 837, to investigate armed attacks on UNOSOM II personnel which led to casualties among them&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that South Mogadishu continues to represent a serious challenge to the United Nations in its role of making and keeping the peace.  The UN must continue its search for a peaceful resolution in Mogadishu learning from and <Col N="2229" /> building on its success elsewhere in Somalia. Enforcement action in Mogadishu, when it is necessary, must be the minimum required and should be carefully directed to achieving the overall political aim of UNOSOM, which is national reconciliation.  These were among the points that I made to the UN Secretary-General, Dr. Boutros-Ghali, when I met him in September.  During that meeting, I affirmed the Government's commitment to supporting the efforts of the international community to help the people of Somalia both through humanitarian assistance and in the process of national reconciliation.  We have also maintained contact with the US authorities. I myself have had discussions with the US Special Envoy, Ambassador Robert Oakley.  It is vital that the cease-fire in Mogadishu announced by General Aidid on 8 October hold, and that the efforts to achieve political reconciliation between the different factions be renewed with vigour.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General presented a report on the situation in Somalia to the Security Council on 16 November. UNOSOM II's mandate expires today.  I understand that the Security Council may extend the mandate, while it considers the Secretary-General's report on developments in Somalia and his observations thereon.  The Secretary-General's report is being carefully studied in my Department.</P>

      <P>In the light of the continuing political and economic transformation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Government are <Col N="2230" /> working to consolidate and deepen Ireland's relations with these countries. Discussions with their Governments constitute an important element in this regard.  The intensification of our direct contacts with these countries complements the important relationship which is developing between them and the European Union.  Through these contacts, Ireland plays a role in providing urgently needed economic aid and political support.</P>
      <P>Following the official visits to Poland and Hungary which I made earlier this year, I intend to visit other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, next year, when mutually convenient dates can be arranged for these visits.  The Government also encourage visits to Ireland by members of the Governments of the states in question.  Discussions have been held in Ireland with the President of Kazakhstan, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation and, last week, with the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>The Government also avails of the opportunities offered by meetings of international organisations to develop relations with central and eastern European countries.  At the UN General Assembly in September, I met with Ministers from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia.  On the occasion of the Council of Europe Summit early in October, the Taoiseach met the President of the Czech Republic and the Prime Ministers of Estonia and Slovenia. Further ministerial meetings in the margins of the forthcoming CSCE Summit in Rome are also envisaged.</P>

      <P>Ireland ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 8 December 1989.  Our first report under Article 40 of the Covenant was the subject of hearings before the Human Rights Committee in Geneva on 12, 13 and 14 July 1993.  The Irish delegation was led by the Attorney General who was accompanied by representatives of my Department and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 28 July the Human Rights Committee adopted its Comments on Ireland's report.  The committee expressed its satisfaction with the high quality of the report and the constructive dialogue engaged in by the Irish delegation. The committee expressed particular appreciation for the fact that the report had been published in Ireland by my Department well in advance of the hearings.  It also noted with appreciation the willingness of Ireland to involve NonGovernmental Organisations in the debate surrounding the reporting process and the openness displayed towards their critical observation.  As the Deputy has noted, the committee made a number of specific recommendations.  In summary, these address the following areas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2233" />&mdash;the compatibility of Irish legislation with the Covenant and the question of incorporating its provisions into Irish law;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 56, 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between Ireland and South Africa were established in October 1993.  Mr. Eamon Ó Tuathail has been appointed as the first Irish Ambassador to South Africa and will take up duty there very shortly.  While the Ambassador will reside and be based principally in Pretoria, the administrative capital, it may also prove necessary for the mission to maintain a presence in Cape Town, the legislative capital, where the Parliament sits for some six months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening of our Embassy marks the beginning of a new era in Irish-South African relations.  We greatly welcome the recent changes leading to the emergence of a non-racial, democratic South Africa; our decision to open diplomatic relations is a response to these changes. It is important that Ireland should make a contribution to the political and economic development of the new South <Col N="2236" /> Africa; we are also conscious that it represents a new market with considerable potential for the export of Irish goods and services and we wish to see that potential developed.</P>
    <P>No decisions have as yet been taken with regard to possible secondary accreditations which might be undertaken by our Ambassador to South Africa.  Any such accreditation would be a matter for discussion and agreement with the Governments of the countries concerned.  The separate issue of South African diplomatic representation in Ireland, and whether this will be on a resident or non-resident basis, will also be a matter for discussion and agreement between the two Governments.</P>

      <P>The World Health Assembly, held in Geneva on 10-14 May 1993, considered a resolution which sought to ask the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on whether the use of nuclear weapons by a state in war or other armed conflict would be a breach of that state's obligations <Col N="2237" /> under international law, including the WHO constitution.  Voting took place by secret ballot.  The outcome was that the resolution was adopted by 73 votes in favour, 31 against, with 6 abstentions.</P>
      <P>Ireland's opposition to nuclear weapons is of long standing and well known. Successive Governments have made clear our policy or seeking the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a comprehension nuclear test ban treaty.</P>
      <P>The broad approach which the Irish delegation took to the World Health Assembly, in so far as my Department was concerned, was that the issue of the legality of the use of nuclear weapons raised a number of political as well as legal issues, and was more appropriate to the United Nations General Assembly than the World Health Organisation.  The General Assembly can also appropriately look not only at the question of the use of nuclear weapons, but also the justification for the threat of such use.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993 provides for what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;the incentive amnesty&rdquo; or &ldquo;the 15 per cent amnesty&rdquo;.  This amnesty covers certain income and chargeable capital gains of individuals for the period up to 5 April, 1991 where the tax, or any part of the tax, due in respect of such income and gains has not been paid.  Thus, it extends to both undisclosed liabilities to income tax and capital gains tax and to arrears of such taxes already on record.</P>
      <P>Tax which, on 24 May, 1993 was the subject of enforcement through sheriff action, court proceedings or the power of attachment is excluded from the incentive amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amnesty gives those who failed to meet their tax obligations in the past one last chance to put their tax affairs in order, in advance of the introduction of more stringent penalties for tax fraud, <Col N="2240" /> and the continuing strengthening of Revenue's compliance programmes.  It is not an option to be availed of by those who were less than compliant in the past.  It is an obligation to which they must adhere or pay the penalties.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the thousands of inquiries to the Revenue Commissioners that there is considerable interest in the amnesty.  To take advantage of the opportunity provided by the incentive amnesty a taxpayer must declare all outstanding liabilities before 30 November 1993.</P>

      <P>I am aware that due to serious financial difficulties, it was necessary for the Board for the Employment of the Blind which operates the Blindcraft workshop to place the staff on a three day working week.  With a view to tackling the situation, I asked the National Council for the Blind which is the major voluntary body concerned with the training and welfare of the blind, to examine the board's operations to see if it could offer suggestions on how the difficulties can be resolved and the workforce restored to a five day working week as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The national council has made certain suggestions as to how Blindcraft's operations can be put on a sounder financial footing.  My Department has requested further information on the financial and marketing aspects of the proposals.  On receipt of this information I hope to be in a position to make a decision on the future of Blindcraft's operations.</P>

      <P>It is often possible to make a decision based on documents such as those received without the need of a further assessment.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, however, the candidate was seen and assessed by one of my Department's psychologists.  Based on all the available information, if was decided that the candidate was not eligible for special consideration.  This decision was communicated to the school on 7 May 1993 and explained to the school principal, in the course of a phone call, on 13 May 1993.</P>
      <P>The assessment of my Department's psychologist will be supplied to the candidate's school, if requested.</P>
