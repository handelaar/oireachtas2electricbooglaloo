      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate. The debate on No. 8 shall not exceed two hours and the following provisions shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) the speeches of the Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrat Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member shall not exceed 10 minutes and (iii) the Minister or Minister of State shall be called on to reply not less than ten minutes before the debate is due to conclude.  In the case of the resumed debate on No. 11, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes.  Business shall be interrupted at 3.50 p.m.  The Dáil at its rising today shall adjourn until Tuesday, 27 April 1993.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate satisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be an opportunity to discuss Nos. 3 and 5. No. 3 provides for the use of the term <Col N="1018" />&ldquo;chairman&rdquo; for two committees of this House and I am sure the majority of this House would prefer the use of a neutral gender term such as &ldquo;chair&rdquo; or &ldquo;chair-person&rdquo;. To my knowledge, recommendations have been put forward by the Commission on the Status of Women in that regard.  While I appreciate the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; has been used in the past and I am not suggesting that there is any ill intent in this proposal, I believe the Minister of State and the Government would wish to use a different term.  I ask them to agree to that.</P>
      <P>We should have a brief debate on No. 5 which concerns the introduction of a change in the rules concerning comment by Members of the House on matters supposedly <i>sub judice</i>, before a court or tribunal.  Such proposals would command widespread support in the House but as this is a major change in procedures, Members should at least have a brief opportunity to discuss it.  A debate lasting for half an hour or 45 minutes would suffice.  That would allow Members to express their views.  This is an important and welcome change but it should be debated, however briefly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's comments and I suggest, without any offence to you, Sir, that chairpersons are genderless and in order not to offend anybody we might use the term &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; which is a less offensive term.  It is said that, like angels, chairpersons are genderless and I hope that does not offend you, Sir.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Owen said there were very few angels in this House, but I do not know if I agree.  I suggest also that the Interpretation Act, 1937, should be altered.  Yesterday when discussing a Bill relating to the Department of Justice the Minister was referred to as &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  Now that we have a female Minister, the Interpretation Act, 1937 should be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes in regard to <i>sub judice</i> matters and I am sure all Members <Col N="1019" /> welcome those changes.  Hopefully, they will prove to be effective.  I note in paragraph (4) of the motion matters can be raised only by way of notice either on the Adjournment or by way of parliamentary question.  I presume, therefore, that a Member cannot refer on Second Stage to a matter which is before the courts.  That might be somewhat restrictive because the requirement to give notice will still give the discretion to the Ceann Comhairle, whose rulings have often prevented us from raising matters which are before the courts.  I question whether this motion will make any real difference if notice has to be given.</P>

      <P>The points raised by the two previous speakers support the general point I wish to make, that is, so far this week we have dealt with 19 motions without debate.  Many of these motions have a major impact on the way this House does its business.  Obviously we are moving to reform this House &mdash; I welcome this move, and much of what has been proposed &mdash; but I should like a commitment from the Government side that, having seen how the reforms we have introduced without debate in this House work, we will be given the option to reform, adjust and change them.  The purpose of debate is to define and sort out any difficulties in advance and improve the proposals.  We are not being given that kind of debate on this occasion.  This is a mistake.  Nevertheless, I do not propose to oppose these motions.  However, we need to be cautious about rushing through many motions of this kind without debate.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the points made by Deputy De Rossa. Reference has been made in this House for years to the need for Dáil reform.  It is now time to do something in this respect instead of merely talking about it.  There was a two-day debate in this House when all these views were expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the <i>sub judice</i> rule, it is clear that the approach being adopted is a practical one.  Having listened to the points made by Deputy Harney, the bulk of what is being proposed here was proposed by the Progressive Democrats Party when it was in Government.  It would be grossly unfair to the Chair to expect him make instant decisions in this regard.  Consequently, the Chair is entitled to receive a notice about this matter.  The approach being adopted is a practical one, and I suggest that we proceed with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that we delete item No. 5, which deals with the <i>sub judice</i> rule, from the list of items to be taken without debate.  Time should be provided for a discussion, however brief, during which Members of the House and the Minister of State who drafted this motion could examine the thinking behind it.  Members who know what these rules mean in practice are more likely to abide by them than Members who have been asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to make what I consider to be a helpful intervention. As the House will be aware, there will be a full day's debate on the new committees shortly after the Dáil resumes.  That debate will cover the foreign affairs committee and the other committees.  It should be possible, with the agreement of the House, to allocate a half hour for a debate on item No. 5 during that debate on the efficient running of the House and the committees.</P>

      <P>I understood that item No. 5 was agreed by the main Opposition party.  This matter was discussed for two hours during the two-day debate.  I have no objection to allocating a further half hour to it after the Easter recess, but I would prefer if proposals which were agreed would remain agreed.</P>

If this body is to be given an independent statutory mandate I think he will find that will require legislation; otherwise, it will not be independent.  Given that the Government has committed itself, in the reply to that question, to an independent Board of Trustees for the National Museum legislation must be introduced.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement on Social Security between Ireland and the United States of America which was signed in Washington on 14 April, 1992, and which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 26 March, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> In accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution, I seek the approval of Dáil Éireann to the terms of the Bilateral Agreement on Social Security between Ireland and the United States of America. The purpose of the agreement is to safeguard the pension rights of Irish workers who move to the US to work and to protect US workers who come to work in Ireland.  The agreement will benefit thousands of Irish emigrants to the US.  Many would have worked and paid social insurance contributions in Ireland for lengthy periods.  Usually any social security rights they had accumulated in Ireland were forfeited once they emigrated.  This agreement will mean that these social security rights can be used together with their US social security rights to qualify them for a pension whether they choose to remain in the US or come home to retire.  It will mean that our emigrants to the US will have the same protection of their social security rights as workers who move within the EC.</P>
    <P>This is the most important agreement on social security which Ireland has entered into since we joined the EC in 1973.  It will have a major impact because of the huge numbers of Irish workers who have emigrated to the US in search of work.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, an extra 1,100 US pensions will become payable to Irish people who have worked in the US and most of whom have returned home.  This will generate additional income of approximately $1 million to the State.  My Department has estimated that around 400 people will qualify for Irish pensions immediately the agreement comes into force.  The number of pensioners will increase over time as the benefits of the agreement come into effect for our more recent emigrants.  The US is already paying around 6,100 pensioners living in Ireland most of whom are returned Irish emigrants.  The annual value to the State of these pensions is $35 million.  My Department is currently paying 200 Irish pensions in the United States.  These would be pensions which the people qualified for because they had <Col N="1038" /> sufficient contributions paid either in Ireland or the US to qualify.</P>
    <P>The agreement with the US covers the following Irish benefits: old age contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's contributory pension, orphans contributory allowance and death grant.  In the US the following benefits are covered: retirement benefits, survivor's benefits, disability benefits and family benefits for retired or disabled workers.  The agreement will apply in cases where a person has insufficent contributions to qualify for any of these benefits under the laws of one or other of the two countries.  Where a person has an independent domestic entitlement there will be no need to invoke the provisions of the agreement because their independent domestic entitlement is likely to be more favourable.</P>
    <P>The agreement will operate by allowing, for example, periods of social security contributions paid by a person while working in the US to be taken into account for an Irish pension as if they were periods of Irish PRSI.  The amount of pension payable will be based on the total number of years in which the person was employed in Ireland <i>pro rata</i> to the combined work period in both countries. Most people who worked in both countries will qualify for two <i>pro rata</i> pensions, one from each country.  A similar method of calculation will be used by the US authorities.</P>
    <P>A further provision of the agreement will benefit Irish workers posted to the US temporarily and US workers sent here by their parent company on the same basis.  When the agreement comes into operation such a worker will only be subject to the social security laws of one country.  It will mean that Irish workers posted to the US will continue to pay PRSI contributions here and retain their rights to full Irish benefits and will also be exempted from paying any social security taxes in the US.  Similarly, US workers will remain attached to the US social security system for up to five years.</P>
    <P>The claiming arrangements under the agreement have been kept simple.  A person living here can apply directly to <Col N="1039" /> my Department to have his US entitlement examined.  We will take it from there.  We will send the claim to the appropriate US authority and find out any further details they might need.  A US resident can apply to the US authorities about his or her possible Irish entitlement. The pensions will be paid by each country separately.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, I took the initiative of extending the free schemes to EC pensioners and people receiving pensions under bilateral agreements.  When this agreement comes into operation Irish people with US pensions living here will also become entitled to free electricity, TV licence and telephone rental allowance. As a result of the agreement 3,500 US pensioners living here will for the first time qualify for the free electricity concession and some 1,800 will qualify for the free TV licence and telephone rental.  These concessions will be extended to them immediately the agreement comes into operation.</P>
    <P>In effect this will be a pension protection network for Irish workers.  It is the fourth social security agreement to protect workers' pension rights which I have concluded since I started with the Ireland-Austria agreement in 1989.  My objective is to extend to our emigrant workers the same level of protection as they would have, if they worked within the EC.</P>
    <P>The potential benefit this type of protection has for our young workforce is enormous.  It means that mobility is a practical proposition for them because their future pension entitlements are secure.  There are 8,500 people receiving either old age, retirement or widow's contributory pensions on foot of a combination of social insurance contributions in Ireland and other EC states.  This number will go further as the next generation becomes increasingly mobile.</P>
    <P>We have agreements in place with Austria, Canada and Australia.  I will sign agreements with New Zealand and Quebec later this year.  Negotiations are underway at official level with the United Kingdom in respect of residents of the <Col N="1040" /> Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, who are not covered by the EC regulations.</P>
    <P>A European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement is expected to come into force later on this year to bring nationals of the former EFTA States (except Switzerland), that is Austria, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Liechenstein, within the same social security legal framework as EC nationals.  Any Irish workers who are in these countries will, therefore, have all their social security rights fully safeguarded once the agreement becomes operative.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are also underway on a separate bilateral agreement between ourselves and Switzerland.  When all of these agreements are in place we will then have a network of agreements with 21 different countries.  This network represents a major protective safety net for all our emigrant workers.  It will mean that when they reach pension age their pension rights will be secured and they will suffer no reduction or loss of their entitlements because their working careers are spread over a number of different countries.  I regard these agreements as fundamentally important in my overall pension strategy.</P>
    <P>I have seen at first hand the very positive attitude of our emigrants towards the Canadian and Australian agreements and I met with and had lengthy discussions with representatives of Irish groups and associations in these countries when I signed both of these agreements.  The agreement we are discussing here today has generated a huge amount of interest both here and in the United States.  Its introduction will be warmly welcomed and appreciated by many thousands of Irish workers in both countries.  I will be exploring the possibility of extending the number of countries with whom we have agreements when the present phase is completed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of my determination to ensure that the pension rights of the half million members of occupational pension schemes are secure.  The Pensions Act which I introduced in 1990 to provide safeguards for such pensions is still the foremost legislation of its kind <Col N="1041" /> in Europe.  To ensure that the same kind of protection can be given to Irish members of overseas-based pension schemes, I took powers in the Social Welfare Act, passed last week, to enable me to pursue, with other countries, agreements which would afford these workers the standard of protection for their pension rights which is laid down in our Pensinos Act.</P>
    <P>This is an important agreement for Irish workers and their families who have spent some of their working career in the United States.  It will bring them considerable benefits by way of pensions which they could not have qualified for previously and also a range of entitlements under the free schemes.  This initiative will be warmly welcomed by Irish emigrants both in Ireland and in the US.  They will see in it a recognition of their needs and welfare.  We value the contribution which they have made to the development of the country of their birth and the country to which they emigrated.</P>
    <P>I learned this morning that the United States Congress has now approved the agreement and this means that the operative date will be 1 September.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this agreement which is progressive in nature and will take effect on 1 September 1993, if ratified today.  This agreement will protect the pension rights of people who have paid social security contributions in Ireland and in the United States.  It does so by allowing social security contributions paid in Ireland to be counted towards qualifying for certain benefits in the United States and <i>vice versa</i>.  It also contains important provisions for workers who are sent on temporary assignments from one country to the other.  It will cover any person who has <Col N="1042" /> been subject to the social security laws in Ireland and the United States and who has paid social security contributions in both countries.  In the United States it will relate to benefits under the federal programme in relation to retirement benefits, survivor's benefits, disability benefits and family benefits for dependants of retired or disabled workers.</P>
      <P>Irish citizens who worked in both Ireland and the United States and paid social security contributions in both countries will now qualify.  I learned from the Minister's remarks that a person can qualify for pensions from both countries and be entitled to receive both at the same time.  Another benefit that will result from the scheme when it comes into operation is that all recipients of US social security pensions of the type covered by the agreement who are living in Ireland will be entitled to apply for the free schemes available under the Irish social welfare system.  I welcome that provision as it was a serious omission up to now.</P>
      <P>This agreement is very important to many people who were forced to live in the United States but wish to return to Ireland.  Up to now they were often prevented from returning for financial reasons.  A person who worked in Ireland for a number of years and was then forced to emigrate due to job loss, redundancy or the high levels of unemployment in this country fell between the two systems and this injustice is now being eliminated. In addition they will qualify for the added benefits under the Irish social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this agreement I am at the same time mindful of the many thousands of people who left this country down through the years because of unemployment and entered the United States illegally.  They are not part of the regularised workforce there.  Many of these people, unfortunately, have been exploited due to their classification as aliens and receive low wages.  They have been prevented from claiming benefits under the United States system and still cannot gain recognition for their long years of positive work and toil in the <Col N="1043" /> United States.  The United States economy has been built partly on the hard work of Irish people down through the decades but many of these are still outside the system.  There must be tens of thousands of Irish people who are still trapped by the unjust system in the United States.</P>
    <P>What is the reason a person from this part of the island has to obtain a visa to enter the United States?  Very often they have to endure what I would describe as a degrading procedure at the United States embassy.  Indeed, when they apply for a holiday visa they can be called not once or twice but sometimes three times for an interview before eventually being rejected.  We have all come across such cases.  I dealt recently with a case where a brother and sister applied for visas to go to the United States to attend a wedding with their parents.  The sister was given a visa while her brother was rejected.  This question must be raised by the Government.</P>
    <P>While people from this part of the island can encounter problems a person from the other jurisdiction on this island, from Great Britain or other European countries, can gain admission to the United States without a visa.  This is true also in the case of people from Far Eastern countries; they can enter the United States quite easily.  I cannot accept this unjust system and I have raised this question on many occasions in the House and with the United States embassy, but I have yet to be given a satisfactory explanation. It is about time that this unjust system was terminated.</P>
    <P>What is the reason Irish people who wish to gain admission to the United States hold this unique position among the citizens of the European Community and why does the United States Administration discriminate against the Irish population?  What about the so-called special relationship between this country and the United States and the special recognition in the United States of the role played by Irish people down through the years, which has been spoken about so often?  Is this special relationship limited <Col N="1044" /> to St. Patrick's Day speeches?  Is it a matter that can be raised at election time in the United States and then quietly and easily put aside or is it a genuine one and, if so, what is the reason it is not recognised in the manner I have outlined?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach who, we have been told will be going to the United States in two weeks time, to raise this matter with the United States authorities to eliminate this injustice once and for all.  If this is done, this agreement which is being ratified today and which I welcome, would have more meaning for Irish people who are outside the system at present.  The Minister stated also that further agreements will be entered into with the United Kingdom and other European countries.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the one contribution rule which emigrants have to comply with when they return to this country.  They will qualify when they pay one social welfare contribution but very often this can prove to be a major impediment for returned emigrants in obtaining social welfare payments.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unjust that returned emigrants are often faced with this insurmountable barrier.  I ask the Minister to consider waiving that rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. His predecessor, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, signed this agreement on 14 April 1992 and I am very happy that it is to be brought into effect on 1 September this year.  I have asked various Ministers for Social Welfare questions about this agreement during the past ten years or so and, as I said, I am happy the matter <Col N="1045" /> has been brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>This agreement will strengthen the historic links between Ireland and the United States which date back to post-Famine times when Irish people first began to emigrate to the United States. Indeed, the stories of the American &ldquo;wakes&rdquo; held in this country before people emigrated never to return are part of our culture and history.  From that point of view, this agreement is welcome.</P>
      <P>There are literally very few houses in the west, from Donegal to Mayo, through Connemara to the southern counties which do not have strong connections with the United States.  There is practically no house in County Mayo which does not have direct relatives living in the United States.  Indeed, people from certain parishes have tended to populate certain areas of the United States.  For instance, people from the Achill area tend to emigrate to Cleveland, people from Tourmakeady tend to travel to Boston while people from the Belmullet-Erris area tend to travel farther west to San Francisco, Los Angeles and so on. In addition, people from all over Ireland have emigrated to New York.</P>
      <P>When one speaks to pensioners they always tell us that they felt that they were second class citizens in that they were forced to leave this country when it did not have anything to offer them. However, they used their initiative and worked for most of their lives in the United States and in the process supported their families in Ireland.  Throughout the forties, fifties and sixties the parcel from America was of major importance to the families that remained at home.  While there have been advances in telecommunications and travelling time has been shortened, these people played an important part in maintaining links with Ireland.  This agreement confirms their view that they were neglected and let down.  I am very happy to commend the Minister for bringing the matter to a successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister comes to reply he might indicate the reason 3,500 pensioners will qualify for free electricity <Col N="1046" /> while only 1,800 will qualify for a free television licence and telephone rental allowance.  These returned emigrants who are now drawing United States social security pensions worked in the copper mines in Butte, Montana, as shop assistants in Macey's in New York, as steel-workers in Cleveland and so on.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that people who work with American firms which have a base here and who are sent to the United States to gain experience and for training will be retained on the Irish social security register for up to five years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would bear in mind that on two occasions President Clinton failed to appoint an attorney general. In one instance he was unable to do so because his nominee had employed illegal aliens in the United States.  This matter is a source of concern for employers in the United States who may be fearful of employing Irish people who may not have a visa.  When the Taoiseach visits the United States he should raise this matter with the powers that be.  This is very important legislation.  It gives consolation and a degree of dignity and recognition to a great number of people who in difficult times worked abroad, sending part of their earnings to Ireland to keep their families alive.</P>
    <P>As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association it has been brought to my attention that there is a great number of Irish workers in Britain who were not in the contribution system but who worked on the &ldquo;lump&rdquo;.  In their later years they found themselves unemployable and have ended up in doss-houses and hostels, relying on the social security system.  These people played their part in the building of Great Britain after the war and contributed to the upkeep of their families here.  Many of them are too proud to return to the land of their birth, having worked for many years in Britain without being in any contribution system.</P>
    <P>This agreement between Ireland and the US points clearly to the importance of people being registered for employment and having contributions credited to them.  It means that pension and social <Col N="1047" /> security rights are safeguarded in either country.  It is critically important that all negotiations between countries in terms of employment and social welfare benefits should stress this fact.  We should make it as easy as possible for Irish workers in Britain and in America to be properly registered and above board, so that when they reach pension age their rights will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The news of this agreement will be very welcome to a great number of people from Donegal, Mayo, Galway, West Kerry and throughout the country who emigrated in difficult times and palyed their part in the building up of the US and in keeping their families alive in Ireland. This agreement is due recognition by the Government of the part they played.  I welcome this wholeheartedly and commend the Minister for his interest in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome this agreement which was entered into with the Government in the US when my party was a member of the previous Government.  I am glad that it is now being formally implemented.  It will serve to standardise the complicated and entangled process of sorting out the pension rights of the increasing number of Irish and American workers who at <Col N="1048" /> some point in their lives travelled across the ocean to work.  Already, agreements of this type exist between Ireland and both EC and non-EC countries.</P>
    <P>A fundamental right of any person who works and pays contributions, either through PRSI in Ireland or through the primary insurance agreement in the United States, is that at the end of one's working life one should be able to receive one's full pension rights and there should be a minimum of bureaucratic fuss involved in so doing.</P>
    <P>At present to qualify here for any form of a <i>pro-rata</i> pension payment, one must have made 20 PRSI contributions. This necessitates having spent 16 years working in Ireland or in a country with which a pension agreement has been reached.</P>
    <P>If a person has spent less than 16 years working in Ireland, and has worked abroad in a country which does not have such an agreement, one will not qualify for any contributory pension.</P>
    <P>On this point, the Progressive Democrats await the final report of the National Pensions Board, to see their recommendations on whether a form of proportional contributory pension might be paid if a person is just short of the 20 contributions required at present.  That report is expected during the summer. The board is currently examining the whole relationship between pensions and social insurance payments.</P>
    <P>It seems unfair that the difference between qualifying for some form of contributory pension and not qualifying at all is as little as one contribution.  A fairer method, and one which I understand the National Pensions Board are examining, might be the payment of entitlements on a ratio basis, so that no one who had contributed in any way would be denied contributory assistance at the end of the working life.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of current employment trends has been covered under the terms of this agreement. Where an employee is sent by his or her parent company to work in Ireland or the United States for a specified length of time, that time will be assessed, for pension <Col N="1049" /> purposes, as having been spent in their native country.</P>
    <P>While welcoming this agreement, it would be inappropriate to let the Government sit back on their laurels. What is contained in the text of this agreement is no more than a standardisation of a bureaucratic procedure. It simplifies the process of claiming a contributory pension, but sorting out these wrangles is no more than the job of the Government anyway.</P>
    <P>This agreement will have been signed on behalf of Ireland by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Charlie McCreevy a year ago next Wednesday. Why has it taken so long to bring before the House the text of an agreement which has already been signed?  This does not bode well for those Irish in America working illegally and not making payments to the American primary insurance programme.  The Government now needs to act to secure even the most basic rights of protection for these workers.</P>
    <P>A recent estimate put the number of illegal Irish emigrants working in the US at 135,000.  The Government must, as a matter of priority, turn its attention to trying to secure some kind of provision for their welfare from the new American administration.  Let us hope that if such an agreement can be reached, it will not take a full year for the text to come before the House.</P>
    <P>There has been unprecedented demand for the different visa schemes since they were first issued.  Irish people in growing numbers are interested in travelling to America.  The provision of the permanent visas means that at least some people can travel legally.</P>
    <P>A standardisation of all procedures in relation to the claiming of contributory pension entitlements, and indeed all other social insurance payments, whether paid inside or outside this country, is urgently needed.  I would urge the Minister to pay immediate attention to that need.</P>
    <P>I hope the implementation of this agreement marks the beginning of that process.  Many tens of thousands of people from Ireland have travelled to eke <Col N="1050" /> out a living in the US.  There have been millions over the years.  We must be very grateful to the US Government for its assistance to so many of our fellow countrymen.  Galway is a county which probably has more emigrants who have had to go to the US over the years than any other county.  If one was to take the Galway people or the Connemara people from places like Chicago and Boston, it would leave a huge void in those cities. They are very much part of society in those cities.  Many of these people have an ambition to spend their latter years at home in their own country.  I represent a constituency from which many people have emigrated and I am familiar with the difficulties which returned emigrants experience.</P>
    <P>The formal implementation of this agreement will be of great benefit to many of those people and, although it is a year late, I express my appreciation to the Minister.  It will be welcomed by many people throughout Ireland but in the west in particular.  I hope this is merely the start of many major improvements to eliminate the differences which have existed for those who have had to emigrate and the loss they experienced on their return.  I should like to express our grateful thanks to the American Government for its willingness to enter into this agreement with us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle that those who have paid for their entitlements should have maximum flexibility to transfer them abroad and, indeed, maximum benefits from them here.  The cost-benefit comparison for such payments shows them in a negative light relative to benefits available to people on unemployment assistance.  Frequently, those people who are fortunate to be in permanent <Col N="1051" /> employment tend to be less expert on matters pertaining to benefits. For example, many would not be aware that all contributory pensions are fully &ldquo;exportable&rdquo; to any country &mdash; at least I understand that is the case but, perhaps, the Minister will clarify the matter &mdash; irrespective of whether we have a bilateral agreement with that country.  Several aspects of the agreement, referred to by other speakers, are particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>The five-year rule would affect a substantial number of people who would have been in employment in my constituency with an American company for two or three years.  Obviously, they would make substantial savings by continuing to make their contributions under the American system without the necessity to pay contributions here.  Equally, there are many people working with companies here who on transfer to America for a period of years or months under this agreement, will continue to pay their PRSI here and will not be liable for further payments in the United States.  That will, obviously, be a substantial cost saving for them, plus the extra benefits at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of people lost out badly because they did not have sufficient contributions either here or in America.  I understand, under the terms of this agreement, they will be able to accumulate their rights in both jurisidictions and will gain substantially.</P>
    <P>Many people living here have American pensions and it is not always the case that they are well off.  The fact that hitherto they have been debarred from benefits such as the free TV licence, ESB and telephone rental allowance has been a great disadvantage to them.  I welcome the fact that many of these people will how be eligible for such benefits.  I laud the principle of extending rights to emigrants &mdash; in this case our emigrants to America.  As the Minister indicated, he intends, within a short period, to have a similar agreement with 21 countries.  As Deputies Enda Kenny and Molloy pointed out, their constituencies, which are close to mine, have a long and sad tradition <Col N="1052" /> of emigration to America.  This agreement will be of enormous benefit to those people who may return.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the extension of power which the Minister has, under the pensions Act, since last year, to protect pensions by agreement with other countries. That has been a matter of grave concern not just to people who have travelled from one country to another but for those who have fears about their pension rights.  This bilateral agreement, which extends benefits to people who previously had little or no benefits, is welcome and it is a very good road on which to continue to travel.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this bilateral agreement which has been awaited for years.  We are aware of the inadequacies and the inequities for pensioners in our constituencies who are not eligible under the free schemes.  Many United States pensioners, because of variations in the value of the dollar are worse off than many of our own pensioners.  Access to the free schemes would be an advantage to them.  Those in receipt of pensions here should be eligible for the benefits under the schemes to which our pensioners are entitled.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the younger people I welcome the provision under which a temporary transfer will not be adversely affect their social security entitlements. It takes cognisance of the fact that many young people working with multi-national companies here travel for experience; it works both ways.  This is a huge step in relation to such bilateral agreements and I look forward to the many other agreements the Minister hopes to sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, and his officials, to consider one or two points.  As Deputy Molloy indicated, our emigrants have had tremendous success in the number of Morrison and Donnelly <Col N="1053" /> visas they have been able to acquire. Some of them have been in the United States illegally for many years and, unfortunately, were not within the social security system there.  Will the Minister, through his counterpart in the United States, ask for an amnesty for those who have now obtained visas to buy back a number of years' rights so that they will have entitlement to full pensions at a later stage?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister clarify whether unemployment assistance for returned emigrants could be introduced at a later stage? Unfortunately, because of the world recession, many people who have returned from the United States are ineligible for such assistance.  Will the Minister consider entering into negotiations in relation to such eligibility?</P>
    <P>I welcome this agreement which will help many of my constituents and those who missed out in the absence of such an agreement.  I welcome the fact that the United States Congress has now approved the agreement and that the Minister's policy is to ensure equity in the system.  I hope bureaucracy will not delay pension applications here.</P>

Tá an-chuid daoine ann a d'fhill ó Mheiriceá agus nach raibh ábalta tairbhe a bhaint as leasuithe a bheas ar fáil de thoradh an chomhaontaithe seo.  Deán-aim comhghairdeas leis an Aire as ucht an cheist seo a leanúint ó ceapadh é.

Cé go bhfáiltím roimh an chomhaontú ní cóir dúinn na daoine sin a ligean i ndearmad.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire in ann rud éigin a dhéanamh ar a son siúd.

    <P>I welcome this new bilateral agreement. The only reservation I have is that it took so long so conclude bearing in mind that it affects so many of our people who emigrated to the United States.  The provisions of the agreement are already available to Irish people who have emigrated to other EC countries and it has the effect of putting our emigrants to the United States and, indeed, returned emigrants from the United States who are now pensioners, on the same footing as those who emigrated to other EC countries.  As Deputy Allen mentioned no cognisance has been taken of the difficulties encountered in this area by our undocumented emigrants in the United States.  Perhaps it is a matter we might deal with on another day but we should not forget their difficulties.  This agreement is particularly good news for Irish pensioners who have spent their working lives in the United States and who have now returned here.  I understand the Minister stated that 4,000 or 5,000 people will benefit from the agreement.  It was a <Col N="1055" /> source of grievance to Irish citizens who had emigrated to the United States and returned home that people of the same age group and category who had returned from other countries were receiving social welfare benefits such as free travel allowance, free electricity allowance, free television licence and other benefits, but those people, because they were resident in the United States, were not able to avail of those benefits.  This agreement is welcomed by returned emigrants from the United States as from 1 September 1993 they will be entitled to the same benefits as returned emigrants from other countries.</P>
    <P>Pensioners who have returned from the United States have had a difficult time over the past few years.  They suffered a drastic reduction in their income because of the fall in the value of the dollar. About five or six years ago the pound and the dollar were on a par, now 1.50 or 1.60 dollars equal 1 pound.  No cognisance was taken of those pensioners' reduced income but they will now benefit from the provisions of this agreement.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of a non-State pension from the EC or any other country, who receives £5 over the amount of the non-contributory State pension does not qualify for the free fuel scheme.  Eligibility for that scheme should be reviewed because returned emigrants from the UK or European countries whose income is £5 over the non-contributory State pension have a genuine grievance as they are not eligible for the free fuel scheme.  The United States climate is much warmer than ours and people who have lived there are used to a higher temperature in their houses.  When they return to this country they should be entitled to the same heat in their houses, they probably use more fuel than people who have never left this country.  This is an area that should be considered.  I have been interested in this agreement for a number of years and I welcome its completion as a step forward.  I compliment the Minister and his predecessors who pursued this matter and it is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I also welcome this bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United States. Over the past few years I have had a number of inquiries from people, who, through no fault of their own, had to emigrate to the United States, regarding whether their Irish contributions could be used to augment their pensions. Unfortunately the answer on those occasions was that the contributions did not count.  The Minister must be complimented on initiating this agreement and bringing the legislation before the House today.  This bilateral agreement is probably the most important agreement on social security into which Ireland has entered since we joined the European Community in 1973.  The United States currently pay approximately 6,000 pensions to US pensioners living in Ireland while the Department of Social Welfare pay over 200 pensions to Irish pensioners in the United States.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the agreement is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked and paid social security contributions in both Ireland and the United States.  The agreement does this by allowing social security contributions paid in Ireland to be used to qualify for certian benefits in the US and <i>vice versa.</i> The agreement also contains important provisions for workers on temporary assignments from one country to another.  These provisions contain rules as to which country's social security laws will apply in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to mention the benefits covered by the agreement.  In Ireland it includes benefits such as old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widows's contributory pension, invalidity pension, orphan's contributory allowances and death grant.  In the United States it covers retirement benefits, survivors benefits, disability benefits and family benefits for dependants of retired <Col N="1057" /> or disabled workers.  It is also important to outline the practical benefits of the agreement.  For example, an Irish citizen who worked in Ireland and the United States and who had paid social security contributions in both countries might qualify for an Irish pension based solely on his or her social security contributions paid in Ireland, and a US pension based solely on contributions paid in the United States.  Alternatively, if a person does not have sufficient contributions paid in either country he or she might qualify for a proportional Irish or US pension, or both, based on a combination of contributions in Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>A further important benefit is that recipients may also qualify for free electricity, natural gas allowance, free telephone, rent allowance, free travel, free television licence or a free fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are made aware of this bilateral agreement because in the past there has been criticism that people have not been sufficiently informed of their entitlements.  Last week I paid tribute to the Minister and the Department for the efforts they have made over the years in relation in making people here aware of their entitlements. In welcoming this agreement it is incumbent on all of us, particularly the Minister and the Department, to ensure that people here and in the United States &mdash; the responsibility is greater on the United States Government &mdash; are made fully aware of this bilateral agreement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past people were unable to avail of the benefits of this new agreement which is now more important than ever because of the many emigrants availing of visas to the United States. This agreement will be of benefit to them in the future.  I welcome the agreement and compliment the Minister for bringing it forward today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing forward this agreement today.  I note that most of the Deputies who spoke on this issue seem to be from the west coast down as far as Cork.  I also note that three of the Deputies are from <Col N="1058" /> my own county of Donegal.  I wonder if that signifies the proportion of people in Donegal who will benefit from this scheme.  Undoubtedly, there have been many inquiries to my office in Donegal in regard to this.  I was amazed to hear the Minister say that 6,000 Irish emigrants have returned.  As I said a large number of them must be on the west coast.</P>
      <P>I will not be repetitive.  Everything required to be said about this agreement has been said.  Deputy Allen raised the point about visas, which is certainly a bone of contention among Deputies. However, at a time when we are introducing an agreement with the United States we should not be sending bad vibes to the Embassy which might prove counterproductive for young people who apply to the Embassy for visas.  I agree with Deputy Allen but now that we are entering into an agreement with the United States we should request the Embassy to be a little more sympathetic to our problems.  I suggest to the Embassy that it is a thorn in the side of public representatives that we have lost the ability to represent some of our constituents. I know this privilege has been abused in the past but I ask the embassies to reconsider their position and allow public representatives to again make these representations.  Individual public representatives who abuse their privilege should be blacklisted but they should not all be tarred with the one brush.  This was a great asset to our constituents provided we were able to vouch for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I wish to raise concerning this agreement is that there are many elderly Irish American citizens in the United States who are paying exorbitant medical fees for doctors' care, home nursing care and, particularly, in nursing homes.  There is a good possibility that a large number of those will return home to Ireland and there is a market in that area.  We have excellent nursing homes here, they are quite reasonable and provide very good medical care.  As a result of this agreement those elderly people who may have thought they could never return home <Col N="1059" /> may now be able to do so.  Nursing homes here will benefit by providing medical care for Irish citizens living in the US who want to return to Ireland.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a step forward and I hope it will benefit many Irish Americans in the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on bringing forward this agreement.  The figure of 6,100 he gave regarding the number of US pensioners here is quite significant.  Indeed, the $35 million in revenue which they bring into the country is welcome.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach's St. Patrick's Day greetings and having read his speech in the Official Report it strikes me that we have a very special relationship with the United States of America and, therefore, I welcome this agreement. It acknowledges that we are giving something back to the US pensioners who decide to return here.  In relation to the 3,500 pensioners eligible for the free electricity scheme, that figure is reduced dramatically when we talk about the free telephone scheme, where only 1,800 people benefit.  I am sure the Minister is aware that is probably due to the stringent guidelines placed on the free telephone allowance scheme.  Members of the Oireachtas have made representations for people regarding the free telephone allowance but, because of regulations and red tape, they were deemed ineligible.  Pensioners from the US will be eligible for some of the free schemes but may not be eligible for others due to red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An earlier speaker raised the question of the cost of medical treatment in the United States.  That is a well known fact but I would ask the Minister for Health to examine another aspect of this problem. If pensioners who return to Ireland apply for a medical card, as we know they are entitled to do under the Irish system, they are subject to a rigorous means test. This is in contrast to the existing policy in EC countries.  An EC resident living in this country is eligible for a medical <Col N="1060" /> card and, equally, we have reciprocal rights within other EC countries.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that, in addition to these new benefits and concessions which these people will be eligible for, they would also be eligible for a medical card.  In recent times I have been approached by some American citizens who have asked me if they would be eligible for a medical card.  I explained the rigorous means-testing we have, particularly from the point of view of domicile and whether they have purchased a house here or in the United States, or if they rent a house and how much the rent is.  There is a rather punitive regime in regard to means-testing and most US citizens who come to this country would find it extremely difficult to get a medical card within our system. If we are giving it to EC citizens, possibly we could look at it in the context of US citizens to see if US citizens would be eligible.</P>
    <P>The question of visas is a sore point with most people here.  The citizens of most countries in Europe do not require a visa to go to the States, but the practice of requiring visas is still operated as far as this country is concerned.  Maybe that is because of our high rate of emigration in the past.  However, in recent times public representatives have had many overtures from constituents in relation to getting visas.  In many cases we know the bona fides of the people who have applied are genuine, but the American Embassy have treated us rather unfavourably and are no longer tolerating representations from politicians.  That is regrettable.  If there is to be a new dawn in the relationships between ourselves and the USA, they must reciprocate in kind.  I would like to see that matter addressed again. At least guidelines might be put down concerning contacts between Oireachtas representatives and the American Embassy.  If some Deputies abuse their position, it is wrong that all of us should be punished.  Certain guidelines should be laid down, and if a Deputy does not conform to them let him not be eligible to make representations in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the agreement and would <Col N="1061" /> like the Minister to look at the medical card aspect of it because it is an area that would attract a lot of goodwill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> This agreement between Ireland and the United States is the latest in a series of agreements that have been concluded in recent years and I compliment the Minister on having concluded it.</P>
      <P>People of my own age and younger do not worry about pensions and social welfare entitlements at an early stage in their working career. However, it is to be welcomed that these people will now have an increased level of protection for the future, for times when their incomes may not be as secure as they are now and when they may need to claim social security either in the country in which they are now resident or when they return here.  On behalf of the people who will, in time, benefit significantly under this agreement, I want to compliment the Minister on his conclusion of it.</P>
      <P>On the coming into effect of this agreement, approximately 400 extra people who have returned to Ireland from the United States will be entitled to some form of social security benefit.  I note also that 200 Irish people are currently in receipt of benefit in the US.  Could the Minister elaborate on the expected number of Irish people who will come into benefit in the United States within a short time of this agreement coming into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the arrangements in regard to free electricity, free television licence and telephone rental will also be extended under this agreement.  I have come across a number of returned Irish emigrants who cannot avail of the benefits which are available to Irish social welfare recipients and these people feel very disadvantaged because of the treatment they receive compared to people <Col N="1062" /> who have accumulated benefits in Ireland.  I know these people will particularly welcome this extension.</P>
    <P>I am also happy that the claiming arrangements under this scheme will be simple.  We are all very much aware of the difficulties people have in making claims under the social welfare system.  It would be inconvenient if people had to deal with two national administrations.  I am glad therefore that the Department of Social Welfare here will take the ball and run with it and deal with the administration of social security in the United States when a claim is made.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for some further information on this matter. The social security system in the United States is not as well developed as it is here and I am concerned that people who may have accumulated entitlements to certain benefits in Ireland while working here and who then move to the United States may not be able to carry that entitlement with them.  Can the Minister say what Irish entitlements remain uncovered under this agreement and if anything can be done to improve the situation so that people will not find in five or ten years' time that they are not covered for something they thought they were covered for.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister on behalf of younger people who in the course of their working lives will be able to build up entitlements to benefits in this country and in other countries in which they work, particularly the United States. With the implementation of the Donnelly and Morrison programmes, people will be in a much better position to register for social security in the United States and build up credits which will benefit them in later years.  On behalf of those people who will benefit in the years to come, I would like to thank the Minister for concluding this agreement and hope that he will be able to respond to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Gallagher for sharing his time.  I want to join in the total welcome of the House for this measure.  The Minister has <Col N="1063" /> concluded several of these agreements and he is to be particularly complimented on this.  Deputy McDaid seemed to regard this as a purely west of Ireland or south of Ireland problem.  Most of the citizens who have had to emigrate from the eastern part of the country took the shorter boat to Britain and, in latter years, to Europe.  Nevertheless, we do have a number of people in the east who will benefit from this measure. In the mood of the House at the moment, I had better declare a small interest in this.  I do have a brother who is at present involved in employment in New York and maybe he will make the decision to come back when he hears of this new arrangement, although, judging from his status over there, I doubt if he will be asking for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement will at least accord some measure of rights to people who have spent much of their working life in America, not through choice, but because of the economic position here. There is a general perception that all Irish-Americans are wealthy and that they stay in big hotels in the west when they visit.  However, my view in that regard changed when as Minister for Tourism and Transport, I was trying to promote the tourist industry.  During that time I met many Irish people in New York and elsewhere who were annoyed that we should seek contributions from them and request them to join golf clubs and so on for their occasional visits to the country.  That type of tourism promotion is important but we also have responsibility for those people if they retire here or return if our economic position improves.  People who choose to return and give their knowledge and expertise to our community are entitled to certain rights.  The Minister stated that he has got a good deal for Ireland, but we should also be generous in the other direction. He is doing that in accepting that not alone should this agreement benefit pensioners who return here but that it is our responsibility to improve those pensions if necessary.  I ask the Minister to include in this agreement widows of Irish emigrants <Col N="1064" /> who have qualifications here and in America but who were born in America and wish to live here.  Such persons should also benefit under this agreement, but that may be provided for.</P>
    <P>During election campaigns particularly, one regularly meets pensioners who live here and who have American citizenship.  I do not know if their circumstances will be altered under this arrangement, but they are unwilling to exercise their vote franchise because of a fear of losing their pension rights or, conversely, their American citizenship. That is an old chestnut that needs to be examined.  This may not be the case, but some people believe that if they are granted citizenship after working for many years in the United States they forfeit all rights here, particularly in regard to voting in Dáil and European elections.  They may be entitled to cast their franchise in local elections and I ask the Minister to clarify that matter.  Such people should be made aware of their entitlements in that regard as well as their benefits under the pension schemes which will operate here and in the United States.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this measure.  I am sure many Members have friends in America.  We are inclined to believe they are wealthy and would never need to avail of Social Welfare benefits and so on here, but that is not the case.  It is necessary to stabilise the position between the two countries as the recent currency fluctuations cost many returned emigrants a great deal of money in the past year or two.  I accept that there are swings and roundabouts in this area. Nevertheless, if this measure can be of assistance when one's income is diminished because of the economic position between one country and another, it is welcome and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies from both sides for their interest in this important agreement between Ireland and the United States of America.  When we started work in 1989, we first concluded an agreement <Col N="1065" /> with Austria with little or no delay.  We then started work on the agreement with the United States which was much more complex because of the vast number of Irish people involved on both sides which is expected to increase in future.  This agreement will have a huge impact and major implications for those people and, consequently, it has taken somewhat longer than expected to complete.  In 1991, I made special efforts, particularly during the summer, at diplomatic level to bring this agreement to a conclusion because of the many complex and technical issues delaying its implementation. At that stage I received great co-operation from the officials in the American Embassy here, I emphasise that because questions were raised in this House in relation to visas.  That broke the log-jam and led to the signing of the agreement in early 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy and others asked why it has taken so long to implement the agreement.  It involved a complicated and time consuming technical procedure in the United States.  The agreement was signed in April last year, but there is a requirement in US social security law that before a signed agreement can be enforced, the President of the United States must transmit it to Congress for a period during which at least one House of the Congress has been in session on each of 60 days.  This period generally encompasses about four to five calendar months.  If the 60 day session period is not completed during one Congress the entire period must start again in the new Congress.  The previous Congress in the United States adjourned on 2 October 1992 and this meant that the full 60 days session period had not been completed in respect of the agreement.  It had, therefore, to be resubmitted in January 1993 and a 60 day requirement has now been finalised.  Following this both sides must exchange diplomatic notes certifying that each has completed all the legal and constitutional requirements.  The agreement then becomes operative on the first day of the third month following the month in which these notes are exchanged.  As expected, the agreement will be in operation <Col N="1066" /> by 1 September this year.  We have just received word that Congress has finally accepted the agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy expressed some criticism of me in that regard, but I assure him that my officials, my predecessors and I worked hard to ensure that this agreement would be concluded.  The signing of this agreement will be a start in supplying a network of agreements and supports for emigrants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher stated that young people are not very concerned about pension rights.  That is true but, of course, such rights are important and young people will realise that later in life. Deputy Gallagher raised questions about the value of the simplified claiming and the Irish entitlements which are not covered by the agreement.  It is simpler to state what is covered and that includes the old age contributory pension, retirement pensions, the widow's contributory pension, the invalidity pension, the orphan's contributory allowance and the death grant.  Other items are not covered, particularly short term benefits such as unemployment.  That question was raised also by another Deputy.  The difficulty is that unemployment insurance is a federal state co-ordinated programme administered by each state under national guidelines.  Each state collects contributions, maintains wage records, takes claims, determines eligibility and pays benefits.  Therefore, the states are not in a position to enter into an agreement on unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen welcomed the agreement and requested that we be mindful of the position of people who are illegal. I am very conscious of the position of these people and I will bear in mind the points made by Deputies in this regard. He also referred to the one contribution rule. I want to make it clear that the one contribution rule has nothing to do with this agreement; it is an EC rule, not an Irish rule.  We do not like this rule and are opposed to it, but we understand it &mdash; it prevents people from travelling to another country to claim unemployment payments there.  Obviously, there were objections to this practice and consequently <Col N="1067" /> the one contribution rule was introduced.  Ireland has argued that the one contribution rule should be waived in the case of countries with close ties, for example, Ireland and England, where people regularly come and go.  We make that argument all the time.  While we have not succeeded in our request, we will continue to argue this point.  As Deputy Allen said, it is ridiculous that a person from across the water has to get one week's work here before the contributions he has paid come into operation. As I said, the one contribution rule is an EC rule and has no effect on this agreement; it does not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>Given that the House supports the motion, I should say that I took the liberty of preparing a fact sheet which I can distribute to Deputies after the debate. This sheet contains all the facts in relation to the agreement.  If they wish, Deputies can take this sheet home with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I waited to see if the Whips supported the motion.  This is why it is so important that we stick by what has been agreed by the Whips.  The sheet was printed on the basis of the Whips agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the length of the negotiations.  I have covered that point.  Once again, I thank the officials involved in the preparation of this agreement. Deputy Molloy referred to the pensions board report.  I expect that report to be published during the summer.  This report will deal with the outstanding issues which have to be addressed.  The Deputy asked that consideration be given to <i>pro rata</i> pensions. The Deputy may be aware that I have already introduced <i>pro rata</i> pensions in certain areas.  The pensions board will look at this question.  The Deputy asked why it has taken since last April to introduce this motion.  I have explained the reasons for this and I trust that the Deputy will note these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tony Killeen welcomed the protection afforded to occupational pensions. This very important protection was <Col N="1068" /> contained in the Social Welfare Act.  I will be seeking in the negotiations to extend that protection to occupational pensions in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mary Coughlan stressed the importance of the Morrison visas.  She referred to those people who are undocumented and not covered as yet.  She also referred to the importance of the agreement to County Donegal.  I believe that the numbers referred to are under-estimates rather than overestimates. However, time will tell if this is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley welcomed the agreement.  He was concerned about the free fuel scheme.  The position in relation to the free fuel scheme and the extra benefits is that the conditions which apply to Irish people apply to people who receive pensions from another country. This was a major development. I got Government agreement to the extension of the extra benefits to people with pensions from another country.  This need not have been done; it is not done in other countries.  This also applies to the agreement as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dan Wallace welcomed the agreement and highlighted its effect on people in Cork.  When I was in Boston recently I met Cork people who are very involved with emigrant groups there. This agreement affects a number of Cork people at present and will affect large numbers in the future.  The Deputy suggested that we should make the agreement as widely known as possible.  I will certainly do what I can in this regard. The fact sheet is a first step in this process. I trust Deputies will use local radio to inform the public about the agreement.</P>

      <P>That is good news.  Deputy McDaid stressed the importance of the agreement for County Donegal.  I agree with the points made by the Deputy in this respect.  Having attended the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York, I realise a large number of Donegal people are living in New York.  They make up the largest group of Irish people <Col N="1069" /> living there.  Very large numbers of people from Donegal, Mayo and the west coast generally will be affected by the agreement.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Embassy, some of the issues which have been raised can be taken up with the new American Ambassador, Jean Kennedy-Smith.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pat Gallagher referred to the position of young people and the need for a simplified claim system.  The system will be a simple one and both sides will pursue claims on behalf of their own people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh claimed that there was general welcome for the agreement. He referred to people born in one country who spent time in the other country. The key factor in this regard is the attachment to the social security system in a country.  A person who has been attached to the American social security system will be covered here and a person who has been attached to the Irish social security system will be covered in America.  This point is covered in article 3 of the agreement &mdash; a copy of the agreement is available in the Dáil Library &mdash; which states: &ldquo;The Agreement shall apply to any person who is or has been subject to the laws of one or both of the contracting States and to the dependants and survivors of such a person within the meaning of the applicable laws of either State.&rdquo; Therefore, there is no need for any concern in this regard.  Once a person has been attached to a social security system in one country they will be covered in the other country.</P>
      <P>This is a very welcome agreement and I am happy to have been able to bring it before the House at this time.  I thank the House for the welcome it has given to the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was referring to the agricultural provisions in the budget.  An agricultural environment scheme will be introduced for the first time this year.  The Government has allocated £0.9 million to that scheme.  While the scheme is very worthy and welcome, I do not think this small allocation will make very big inroads in this area.  Nevertheless, it is a beginning.  I imagine that the scheme will be enlarged in future years and will receive further funding both from the Government and Europe.  Incidentally, 75 per cent of the cost of the scheme will be taken up by the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year for the first time an upper weight limit has been placed on beef carcases acceptable for intervention.  The Community first fixed a weight of 340 kilograms but, as a result of objections raised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh &mdash; who must be complimented for the stand he took on that issue and others &mdash; the limit was increased to 380 kilograms and will come into effect on 1 July 1993, not 1 April as previously mentioned.  The fixing of a weight limit will have quite an impact on Ireland, as we export much of our beef to the Community and have more in intervention.  In 1992 about 750,000 tonnes of beef was taken into intervention but by 1997 that figure will be reduced by a little more than 50 per cent, to 350,000 tonnes.  Ireland will have to export much more of its prime beef on the open market, which may be a blessing in one sense but not in others.  We will have to go further afield, find new markets and extend existing markets.  Coras Beostoic agus Feola, the body that promotes our beef and other agricultural goods, has had its Government allocation reduced by 2 per cent this year.  That is surprising, especially when one takes into <Col N="1071" /> account the additional task that will be faced by the organisation in the future in promoting our product.  I very much regret the reduction in the allocation to CBF and I call for a much larger increase in coming years to cover the extra cost involved.  In the past some of our very notable exporters sold beef on the open market only but, unfortunately, some of them have been very heavily criticised in the past 18 months.  Other exporters have sold directly into intervention, a practice that will be seriously restricted after 1 July when the 380 kilograms weight limit is imposed.  After 1977 less and less meat will be accepted into intervention stocks and more will have to be sold on the open market, leading to increased work and expense for the CBF.</P>
    <P>The allocation for group water schemes has been increased by £500,000 to £2.5 million.  While I appreciate that the Government has increased their contribution towards water schemes, £2.5 million is not sufficient to get the schemes already in train under way.  A much greater allocation will be required bearing in mind the high percentage of rural houses which do not have running water. I very much welcome the increase of £500,000 in the allocation but that figure would have to be trebled to make a serious impact on the schemes already awaiting ratification by the Department.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that the 1993 budget would create jobs.  However, I do not understand the way in which an increase in the level of VAT on poured concrete from 10 per cent to 21 per cent could signal a jobs creation operation. Perhaps the Government parties, in their wisdom, have a complicated way of working out such things, but, being more simplistic, I do not recognise how that could create jobs.  The increase in VAT is most regrettable because the building industry, which is directly affected by this move, is labour intensive.  Any measures that might help to increase the amount of building work undertaken would be very desirable.  I should like the Minister to explain his policy in regard to increasing <Col N="1072" /> the VAT rate on concrete to 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate on adults' clothes has been increased from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  I see 15 and 16 year old girls wearing garments that would be too big on their grandmothers.  How are shopkeepers supposed to distinguish between a garment for a 15 year old girl and one for her grandmother?  For some reason, present fashions seem to dictate that the bigger the clothes, the better.  To say that the increase in VAT applies only to adult clothes is incorrect because it would be very difficult to distinguish between clothes for a 15 year old girl and an 85 year old grantmother.</P>
    <P>The health services allocation has been increased by 12 per cent for which the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, must be complimented.  The total expenditure on health services per year is about £1.7 billion, so a 12 per cent increase in the allocation is sizeable. However, it does not appear to have made any impact on the health boards.  In the Western Health Board area hospitalisation costs have increased and we are also threatened with the closure of certain wards for a period during the summer, perhaps for a month.  I have been told that all hospitals in the Western Health Board area are anticipating closures during the summer and I have no doubt that the same will apply to the health board areas.  There is a requirement for a saving of approximately 10 per cent.  I have had the experience of being a patient in a Roscommon hospital and in another in Dublin since Christmas.  I thank God that things worked out well and that I am in the House today, so I should not complain too much about money.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford the closure of any wards in Roscommon hospital.  That is equally true of the hospitals in Galway and Castlebar. There are four coronary care beds in the hospital at Roscommon. During my four day stay in coronary care at nights some of fellow patients were removed to make room for other patients.  At the time I was told that if <Col N="1073" /> other patients had arrived after a particular time at night they could not be admitted to Roscommon but would have to be transferred to a hospital in Galway or Castlebar.  I do not know what will happen to patients when they are refused admission to the hospitals.  Surely we cannot rely on a drastic reduction in illness, sickness, car accidents and heart problems.  I contend it is most unfair to place such extra burden on nurses, doctors, in fact on any one individual who may have to say to a distressed father and mother: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot admit your child to hospital tonight.&rdquo;  Needless to say, it will be the nurse or doctor who refuses to admit such a patient who will also be the subject of abuse, but their hands are tied because of regulations introduced with regard to hospital admissions last year.  I understand that if a ward has been designated for four beds then it must contain four beds only.  I understand also there is a regulation in being stipulating that any extra beds in such a ward would not be covered for insurance purposes. In the light of what the Minister said at the Labour Party Conference last weekend, perhaps he will review the overall position.  I wish him luck in that respect.  However, I would plead with him not to propose bed closures during any part of the year by way of a money-saving exercise.</P>
    <P>I note that £29.3 million has been allocated to railways, which is very much to be welcomed.  However, I note that those moneys will be expended mostly on the Dublin to Belfast and Dublin to Cork lines without any moneys being spent on, say, the Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Westport or Sligo to Limerick lines.  This would appear to be an endeavour to keep funds very much on the Eastern sea-board.</P>

      <P>With regard to the licensed trade, one dear to my heart for a number of reasons, I was delighted to note that the Minister for Finance thought fit to refrain from increasing excise duty on liquor, benefiting that much overburdened, overworked, over-taxed and underpaid sector of our community, namely, publicans.  That is a trade employing approximately 38,000 part-time and full-time workers.  In view of the fact that taxes on beer here are the second highest in the EC league, it would be indeed desirable that the Minister in future budgets would ensure that excise duty would be reduced rather than increased &mdash; not alone desirable from the publicans' point of view but also from the point of view of their patrons, including tourists.  For example, since excise duty on spirits was reduced there has been a dramatic reduction in legal and illegal importation from the North.  Therefore, a further reduction on beer would also be helpful in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In drawing up his most recent budget the Minister was subjected to severe constraints.  I should like to congratulate him on his adroit manoeuvring across the political minefield. However, subtle political considerations are not uppermost in the minds of the electorate &mdash; jobs are and must constitute the thrust of all activities in this House.  For example, within 24 hours of the Minister's Budget Statement 780 jobs had gone at Digital in Galway. Representing the long-standing, chronic unemployment blackspot that is Wexford, I fully sympathise with the people of Galway on their newly-found status in the unemployment super league.  I must emphasise that, because many people around this House and nationwide still perceive Wexford as a prosperous county, a land of milk and honey, where there are very few unemployed.  We who live in Wexford know otherwise.  I am pleased to note that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne <i>(Wexford)</i> is present, since he was the first to acknowledge that our unemployment rate is the third highest nationwide, second only to Donegal and Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long-term job creation is dependent on a sound, debt-free economy with a reasonable tax structure.  However, neither debt reduction nor tax reform featured as priorities in the Minister's budget, which is regrettable.  The long-term burden of debt service and repayment acts as a halter around our economy.  It is imperative that maximum effort be undertaken to reduce that debt annually, because if we fail to do so we shall be passing that appalling economic handicap on to another generation.  The realisation of that objective necessitates <Col N="1076" /> a long term strategic view.  In this context I might remind the House of my remarks on the currency crisis, that there has been an historic incapacity on the part of our institutions as at present structured to manage our economy.  For example, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank are in need of drastic reform and of the opening up of their operations since, as matters stand, they perpetrate a stranglehold on economic thought and consequently on economic development.</P>
    <P>While recognising that the budget does not afford a forum for institutional reform, its provisions do reflect the lack of such reform.  I acknowledge that in the past year there were many economic and political constraints under which the Minister for Finance had to labour. Equally, I acknowledge that seldom is progress made along a straight line. I sincerely caution the Minister not to allow bending with the breeze become habitual; hard times require hard decisions.</P>
    <P>There has been much emphasis on the 27 per cent increase in capital expenditure. I have no ideological hang-up about State spending and welcome its beneficial effect on job creation. However, there are two things to be noted in that regard.  First, we should realise that the jobs so created to a large extent will be short-term.  Second, the economic effect of the increased capital expenditure will be offset by an increased level of taxation.  For the first time since the mid-eighties real disposable incomes will fall or, at best, fail to rise.  Such gains being reaped from changes in our tax code will be wiped out for all but the very lowest earners by the imposition of the new 1 per cent levy.  This represents not so much a tax on the employed but a tax on employment and will lead to the number of opportunities for those out of work being reduced further.  In economic terms, it will be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>The gulf between the private and public sectors is glaring in that the private sector is being asked to pay extra taxes to fund the 7.4 per cent rise in the public service pay bill.  The Minister has expressed his determination to reform <Col N="1077" /> the public service pay bargaining system and I hope we can take that at face value. From his long experience in the Department of Labour he is more aware than most of the intricacies of this task.  The system is organised and is the only gaming machine which is weighted against the House.  Should the Minister fail to curb the appetite of the public service our room for economic manoeuvre would be severely limited for many years to come.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxation, I wish to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Ahern, for introducing the probate tax.  This will be an efficient and equitable tax, but it appears however that it will not be applied to gifts given prior to death.  This is a matter which the minds in the Department of Finance might examine.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister stressed that the 1 per cent levy will be applied for one year only, but the history in relation to 1 per cent levies is deeply discouraging.  I would have preferred if the Minister had avoided introducing this levy and I insist that he keep his word and abolish it at the end of this tax year, having regard to the fact that we know if it proves successful it will not be once off.</P>
    <P>The new VAT arrangements will serve to postpone full compliance with EC commitments.  The tax on labour intensive industries is anti-employment.  In this regard I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Foxe.  In particular I would like to dwell on the proposed increase in the rate of VAT on newspapers from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  The newspaper industry in Ireland is in dire straits with accumulated losses of £10 million.  The combined effect of the VAT increase and the removal of the cap on RTE represents an unnecessary blow.  At a time when we already have the highest rate of VAT on newspapers in Europe the Minister has decided to add a further £10 million to production costs.  Not only does this amount to a tax on employment, it is a tax on democracy.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have a broadly based newspaper industry which is imperative in maintaining the quality of our democracy.  Should this increased <Col N="1078" /> pressure bring about the &ldquo;Murdochisation&rdquo; of the Irish newspaper industry, the first to feel the pinch will be the politicians.  Unless we want the standards that prevail at the <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Daily Mirror</i> to become the norm in Ireland we should support our own industry.  Although quite often I find the media disagreeable, one finds within it wit, brilliance and insight.  Unless we want a diet of crude monosyllabic tabloids I appeal to the Minister in the strongest possible terms not to take this punitive step.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 the VAT take from adult clothing and footwear has more than doubled. I share the view expressed by Deputy Foxe that it will be difficult to decide who can be described as adult.  In the budget the Minister chose to increase the VAT current rate by 30 per cent.  This must be viewed against a background of declining margins in the trade.  In 1991, 47 per cent of domestic output, or £198 million worth of goods, was sold at home. This domestic market supports 7,000 manufacturing jobs.  It is estimated, however, that 1,200 of those 7,000 jobs are now at risk.  The Minister has failed to supply any worthwhile argument to support these measures and, again, they are counter-productive.</P>
    <P>I also share the views expressed by Deputy Foxe in relation to the VAT change in regard to concrete.  This does not make sense and will not contribute to job creation.</P>
    <P>The estimated figure for the national debt at 2.9 per cent of GNP, or £760 million, has been artificially depressed by £150 million to be derived from the sale of State assets, namely, Greencore and Irish Life.  It is regrettable that the historical whiff of sulphur surrounding the management of Greencore should have provoked the frenzy of suspicion which accompanied the interest expressed by Archer Daniels in the Government's 30 per cent share.  I welcome the Minister's decision to put this shareholding up for auction.</P>
    <P>I have two concerns in regard to this sale, namely, that the public interest in this strategically important industry and <Col N="1079" /> the interests of the company and its growth potential should be safeguarded. Neither of these constitutes ideological considerations, but the nub of the public interest is the golden share and the sugar quota vested in the company.  One third of the sugar beet crop is harvested in County Wexford.  Therefore, the security of this industry is of vital importance to the county and must be safeguarded at all costs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the interest expressed by Archer Daniels, this form of foreign investment would be in line with the Culliton report and it would be a grave error of judgment if crude ideological considerations were to predominate.  Of public note also is the fact that the foreign investment in Digital is different from the proposed involvement of Archer Daniels in that a partnership between the two companies would allow Greencore to expand internationally in a way that would not be possible if the share was bought by an Irish company.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is rising against a background of a declining population.  By any standards this is a doomsday scenario. Since budget day there has been no upsurge in business confidence and it now appears that our last hope for recovery in 1993 lies in the continuing favourable trend in interest rates.  However, so long as sterling remains outside the ERM we have no such guarantee and it would be criminally foolish not to realise that we could have a repeat of the currency crisis in the coming months.  This raises questions about our currency policy and ERM membership.  It would be unacceptable if this House was again forced to accept baseless assumptions, which is what happened prior to devaluation.  I no longer trust the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to do my thinking for me.</P>

      <P>The most important aspect of the budget is the impact it is likely to have on job creation.  We do not go in very much for economic planning here; it seems that we end up with a budget instead.  A two hour speech by the Minister for Finance once a year is <Col N="1080" /> hardly the best way to establish the framework for adequate and informed debate about national economic priorities. The strong negative reaction to this budget from the business sector, in particular, was certainly a clear message to the Government.  One commentator described this budget as a &ldquo;Heath-Robinson contraption&rdquo;.  It was a very elaborate budget but, at the end of the day, it was singularly unambitious.  Much was expected of it but what we got in the end was a pedestrian affair that pleased very few.</P>
      <P>At the time some even expected a radical budget &mdash; they are probably feeling sore now &mdash; which might provide some measure of the Labour Party's input into the broad thrust of Government policy. Instead we got one of the most cautious, conservative and neutral budgets for many years.  Many commentators believe, as I do, that the overall impact of the budget will be bad &mdash; bad for jobs, output growth and tax reform.  The forecast growth rate for 1993 contained in the Department of Finance's Economic Background to the Budget is 2.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>On the general question of figures, I welcome the fact that the Central Statistics Office will get a 16 per cent increase in its funding &mdash; it probably needs it.  I take a much more pessimistic view of the prospects for the coming year.  It is estimated that consumer spending will show only a modest increase, less than 2 per cent, and the weakness of domestic demand will tend to militate against development of the more labour intensive enterprise.  There will be little or no employment growth and we can expect that unemployment <Col N="1081" /> will rise by some 27,000 to around 19.5 per cent of the labour force by April 1994.</P>
      <P>IBEC claim that their surveys indicate a sharp fall in orders over the past few months and that probably indicates a fall in the growth rate of manufacturing output from over 10 per cent to something of the order of 3 to 4 per cent. These figures obviously reflect the near impossible trading conditions as a result of the currency crisis. Even allowing for stability and a lower pound, the poor outlook for the European economy as a whole means there is little prospect of greater growth.  Notwithstanding all of this why did the Minister for Finance make things even worse for some of the more exposed sectors of the economy? Let us take the clothing industry, a very labour intensive one, as an example. I once tried to make my living in the clothing industry and appreciate the numbers working in the industry and how hard it is to make a living?  This industry is very responsive to changes in the marketplace. The Minister, in his wisdom, chose to increase the rate of VAT from 16 per cent to 21 per cent, while at the same time excessively high rates of income tax add greatly to the cost of employing workers.  How will this help the fashion industry, which everyone recognises is an area of great job potential? Indeed, Irish talent and creativity in this field enjoys a certain international reputation.  We are certainly not helping to encourage that reputation in the method the Minister has taken to squash any emerging talent in the fashion industry. Output in clothing and footwear fell by almost 5 per cent last year.  At the end of the day the only people to benefit will be the &ldquo;Arthur Daly-type&rdquo; importers of cheap tat that can be sold on market stalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will have practically no effect in terms of employment growth. On the basis of the Minister's post-budget forecast 3,000 net new jobs only will be created in 1993 and 309,000 people will be on the live register.  Everyone knows that probably the figure will be much higher.  Labour force survey figures for <Col N="1082" /> the year to April 1993 are likely to show a marginal rise in employment only of about 1,000 and a rise in unemployment of 25,000, which means that more than 18 per cent of the labour force are out of work.  The labour force is expected to increase by nearly 30,000 in the year to April 1994.  Were it not for the massive 20 per cent increase in the Public Capital Programme, financed mostly from EC Structural Funds, the figures would be truly frightening.  I suppose we must be grateful for small mercies.  Higher capital spending may give a modest boost to employment or it may just prevent things from becoming nightmarish.  The boost to the Public Capital Programme may stabilise employment in the building and construction sector, although the depressed outlook for private construction will offset the increase in public sector activity.</P>
    <P>When something radical and proactive is needed what does the Government do? It slaps on higher rates of tax and a new income levy which will further depress the level of activity.  We have far too many taxes, PAYE, PRSI, the health levy, the employment levy and now a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; income levy.  A substantial portion of tax revenue now comes from the lower income workers.  The basic allowance for PAYE is now so low that it is lower than the weekly wage of even poorly paid unskilled employees.  Indeed many unskilled part-time workers can find themselves paying income tax.  The so called &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; income levy may not be all that temporary.  The Minister for Finance calculates that anyone who earns £173 per week gross is sufficiently well-off to pay an extra income tax.</P>
    <P>There has been for a long time a consensus on the necessity and desirability of tax reform whereby tax would be levied on a broader base and in a much less complicated way.  This position was endorsed by the Commission on Taxation, the NESC and the OECD.  More recently, the Culliton report endorsed this position.  It was argued in that report that the impact of tax reform will be pervasive.  It did not argue that improving marginal tax rates, for example, by <Col N="1083" /> itself, will lead to an immediate and evident surge in job creation activity, but by removing the demoralising effect of the current tax system and removing the waste of all sorts of non-productive tax avoidance activities, reform will create a far more conducive environment for productive enterprise and more solidly-based investment decisions.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report claims that &ldquo;in no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far-reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation&rdquo;. This budget has to be seen as a lost opportunity in that regard.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left believes that most people pay too much tax &mdash; a view shared by most people in the country.  We also believe there are many disincentives preventing employers from hiring more labour.  Unlike the other Opposition parties we believe that tax take from some sectors must be increased.  Bringing equity and fairness into the tax system is an important goal.  We do not believe in &ldquo;tax and spend&rdquo; for its own sake.  Tax is just a source of revenue as the taxation system can be used to encourage the more efficient use of available resources.</P>
    <P>One of the great puzzles of the recent Irish economic track record has been its impressive output growth figures combined with a very modest increase only in employment levels.  This led to some rather glib suggestions that we had entered an era of &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo;. The NESC report, The Association Between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland, argues that the jobless growth claim is not literally true as Ireland had a rate of employment growth at a very modest level of 0.3 per cent per annum from 1960 to 1990, which is in line with late developers in the EC, such as Greece and Spain.  The NESC document states that the extent to which economic growth impacts on employment growth is determined as much by the structure and composition of that growth, as by the absolute rate of growth.</P>
    <P>The NESC argues that it is clear that recent trends in the structure and composition <Col N="1084" /> of Irish growth have tended to reduce the employment intensity of Irish growth relative to other countries.  The basic point is that, while economic growth is necessary for employment growth, it is the nature and composition of economic growth that will determine how many jobs will be created and where they will be created.  Much of the growth in recent years was achieved in the high-tech manufacturing sector, which is not particularly labour intensive.  By contrast in the Irish owned and medium-tech sectors growth rates have been disappointingly low.  These sectors are much more labour intensive.  The Government must consider how greater levels of employment intensive growth can be achieved.  The clothing industry is just one example of an industry where a contradictory approach is taken.  In this case we are putting the squeeze on an industry that is labour intensive but that needs to be nurtured and protected.  The pattern of Irish economic growth is further distorted by the operation of transfer pricing.  At present Ireland is a tax haven for multi-nationals &mdash; I do not know how long that position will last.  Transfer pricing created the illusion of a high export dynamic economy with big output and productivity, but in many ways this is simply due to the trickery of accountancy.</P>
    <P>To return to the point I made at the start of my speech, the whole budget procedure is no longer up to the task of structuring a proper debate about our economic and financial priorities.  Since reform is the buzzword of the moment and there is quite clearly a need for reform in many areas of our procedures, it should be considered in this area.  Why should all budgetary matters be compressed into one long speech per year? Obviously a definitive statement about tax changes and revenue commitments is necessary, but the budget debate should begin several weeks before the Budget Statement rather than after it.  That might take some of the misery and excitement out of the budget and certainly would make for less good television.  But if its consensus about national priorities is to be regarded as a key factor in shaping positive <Col N="1085" /> outturns our procedures need to be changed.  Everyone knows that the Minister for Finance is lobbied by interest groups in the run-up to the budget but it would be more acceptable if that process was more transparent.  We were promised more open Government.  Perhaps that can be expected in relation to the budget and we can look forward to some changes in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on her general comments about the structure and timing of the budget.  It is not long since we went through the ritual of waiting for the British budget within a few weeks of which the Minister would be expected to come in here and deliver our response, as it were, taking into account the British line.  Although that great modern economist, John Maynard Keynes, said that in the long run we are all dead, there is a long run dimension to economic planning, but the current budget presentation and administration does not provide for that.</P>
      <P>This Government should try to work towards a medium-term budget, as Deputy McManus said, which would operate over three or four years, which would allow us to decide on certain priorities and pursue them over several budgets.  We understand the reasons for the daft ritual that takes place at present &mdash; it relates to the Stock Exchange, to traders and so on.  I noticed on budget day that new Deputies were not given a copy of the budget speech until the Minister had delivered it.  Perhaps that practice, too, could be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A newspaper article by Paul Tansey in the aftermath of the budget was headed: &ldquo;Another Disaster From Ahern&rdquo;.  I considered that kind of comment very unfair to the Minister considering the circumstances that existed following the fierce battle in relation to the exchange <Col N="1086" /> rate mechanism in the previous four or five months.  I am not sure about the wisdom of the line taken by the Central Bank on that occasion but, considering international circumstances and the fact that the Government had been in office for only a few weeks, the Minister's budget was a reasonable response, one which created a framework for development.</P>
    <P>I listened on budget night to a number of Deputies who normally occupy those vacant chairs lecture us about what the partnership Government should do.  I remember in particular comments from Deputy Dukes about the difficulties and missed opportunities in the budget.  That Deputy was a Minister for Finance for a number of years during which fiscal policy was at a standstill and no major initiatives were taken.  The fundamental issue which should govern budgetary policy in medium and long term planning is the unemployment crisis.  That is the major issue facing the economy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in Finland which has experienced major structural problems as a result of the collapse of the Eastern European, particularly the Russian, market.  Unemployment in that country has increased to a figure slightly above that here.  The Finns regard that as a major crisis, almost similar to that of a war.  The Government there, emulating their Nordic colleagues, have undertaken effective action to deal with the crisis.  Similar alarm and determination should be evident in this House in regard to our unemployment problem. Everything we do, including in this budget, must be judged by reference to the jobs crisis.  In this regard, I welcome the steps taken by the Minister, particularly the increase in the capital budget of £500 million which, I hope, will have a spin-off effect of at least 3,500 jobs in the infrastructural and building trade. The Government has plans for a national economic and social forum which will consider structural changes in social welfare and taxation.  We are in the process of setting up a national development plan which I hope, will consider the jobs crisis as a priority.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of this morning <Col N="1087" /> there is an interesting article by Professor Fred Powell, head of the department of social administration and social work at University College, Cork, in which he refers to the current response to the jobs crisis, namely, the introduction of workfare. This matter was referred to by our Progressive Democrats colleagues at their recent party conference.  We in the Labour Party are opposed to the introduction of workfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a response to the jobs crisis.  Professor Powell in his article refers to the conservative origins of this programme and contrasts it dramatically with the position in countries such as Sweden where people, having been unemployed for 14 months, have a chance of taking part in six months intensive training, almost always leading to a return to the labour force.  That is the approach that should be emulated by our country.  The national association of centres for the unemployed &mdash; I am a director of the northside centre &mdash; is opposed to any such development.  My party, through the party leader and Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, put forward a very imaginative proposal about a year ago on a national work sharing plan.  It was proposed that, through voluntary work sharing by five or six people, an extra job could be created without any loss of benefits.  Such a programme would be a valuable initiative in confronting the horrendous problem faced by the long term unemployed.  I categorically state our opposition to the introduction of a workfare programme.  We believe that work sharing is the only way forward.</P>
      <P>It is not very long since an MRBI survey showed that 60 per cent of workers would be prepared to examine the possibilities of work sharing if the Government brought forward a major national plan in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the negative impact of the taxation changes, I would make a special plea for the rag trade.  All labour intensive industries must be protected if we <Col N="1088" /> are serious about solving the jobs crisis. I welcome the move to dramatically reduce the VAT rates affecting trades such as hairdressing, even though I have reservations about the extremely low wages which seem to be the norm in that business.  It appears that the clothing industry did not mount a significent campaign with regard to the proposed VAT changes.  The industry is now gearing itself towards the quality clothing end of the market.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether or not the 21 per cent rate could be reduced at least to the British rate of 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am honoured to be a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Yesterday we questioned the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and his staff and looked at the whole area of tax collection. Our major fiscal problems during the eighties have been due to the fact that significant sectors of business, the self-employed and the farming community did not pay any tax at all for long periods. Yesterday I was astonished at the revelation that £1.5 billion in taxation is outstanding.  The Minister had great difficulty in devising ways to collect taxation and here we have this gigantic figure, equivalent to about 15 per cent of all the spending by the Department of Finance, outstanding in uncollected tax.  I hope the Government will pursue that tax vigorously during our time in office.</P>
    <P>Despite international difficulties the Minister was able to keep the EBR within the 3 per cent limit.  If we returned to the policies of the seventies and eighties we would not retain the benefits achieved in recent years and there would not be any way foward for this Government.  If this budget is successful and we have 4 per cent growth this year &mdash; most economists are predicting an upturn next year &mdash; and that continues up to the mid-nineties we should reach the Maastricht 60 per cent ratio of debt to GNP.</P>
    <P>I welcome the massive Labour input to the social side of this budget.  I welcome the extra £20 million provided to reduce hospital waiting lists.  Many Deputies have dealt with heartrending cases of contituents on huge waiting lists for <Col N="1089" /> years.  In its manifesto the Labour Party promised £25 million for mental handicap services.  It is a great achievement that an additional £10 million will be spent this years for places for adult mentally handicapped people.  I applaud the Minister for Finance and his colleague in the Department of Health on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to put an extra £3.5 million into disadvantaged areas. Many underprivileged areas on the north side of the city need major resources.  I have noticed that Germany spends the same amount of money on vocational training as we do on universities.  We should be able to adopt a similar policy. When one studies factors relating to long term unemployment one finds that long term unemployed people are very often people who did not get a chance to sit the leaving certificate or the junior certificate. It is sensible to put resources into education.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for expanding the social welfare budget to £3.7 billion. The way to reduce that budget is to take vigorous action on unemployment.  I am sure that the unemployment figures will be reversed as a result of some of the measures being considered by the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>We should reconsider the means testing of the carer's allowance.  This was a worthwhile innovation which was introduced by Deputy Woods, but has been retarded by the strict means test applied to it.  Many people just do not have the opportunity to benefit from the allowance.  I notice that the British spend something like £8 billion on maintaining their three million unemployed people. Economists estimate that with the expenditure of half that they could radically attack the unemployment problem through training and direct labour subsidies. That is the road we should go down.</P>
    <P>My Democratic Left colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, on the night of the budget was critical of the £25 million to be granted towards county enterprise boards and of the £100 million being provided by the banks.  Deputy Rabbitte suggested that it was another way of pulling <Col N="1090" /> money out of the hat.  My view is the opposite to that of Deputy Rabbitte, who seemed to severely criticise the county partnership approach.  County partnerships are part of the process of local empowerment which our President highlighted since she took office two years ago.  In every community in the city, particularly in deprived areas, massive strides have been made by local-communities towards creating jobs and community development because previous Governments were prepared to give a little financial aid.  The four new county partnership boards for Dublin will provide a significant opportunity to develop employment in this city. Recently in Dublin City Council we began to re-establish a Dublin enterprise board under our civic charter.  We hope the Minister will fund it proportionately and that out of the £25 million which is available Dublin city will get at least £4 million and Dublin county will get the £8 million or £9 million to which it is entitled.  In fact, we would be entitled to more, because we have the highest unemployment of any region in the country as the labour force surveys make clear.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move to maintain mortgage interest relief, to increase it to 90 per cent and to provide for 100 per cent relief for the first three years in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the jobs front, there are many areas of the budget on which I would like a more vigorous response.  I am confident, however, that both the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment will respond, in the months and years ahead, to some of the issues which I and my Labour Party colleagues have raised concerning a major attack on the jobs crisis.  At present there are approximately 70 million people unemployed in the EC.  If we were to reduce unemployment by 5 per cent over the next decade we would have to create 25 million jobs.  That is a major task, but by using imaginative devices, such as a national voluntary work sharing scheme, something worthwhile could be achieved. Both the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="1091" /> Ahern, and I were Christian Brothers men &mdash; I as a teacher and he as a pupil. He was a pupil long before I became a teacher of economics at the school.  If I were marking him on this budget I would give him a B or a B plus.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Broughan mentioned that new Members did not receive a copy of the Budget Statement on budget day I remember thinking at the time that that was a strange practice.  As five weeks have elapsed since the budget, I have almost forgotten the few points I wished to raise. Before becoming a Member of this House I could never understand the hype or the fuss created about budget day. There appeared to be an extraordinary amount of excitement about it, yet it is only part of the Government's financial plans for the year.  Deputy McManus said the budget debate should take place weeks before the budget rather than weeks afterwards.  This year was not a normal year.  I understand that in other years there were debates on the Estimates and the Public Capital Programme. Normally the procedure is more long drawn out and people have an opportunity to discuss matters in advance of budget day.</P>
      <P>We had all been prepared to expect the worst in this year's budget because of the severe international recession, soaring interest rates and changes resulting from the Single Market abolishing VAT at the point of entry.  In my previous employment I worked close to that area. I was surprised that the VAT receipts released last week for the first quarter did not show a greater decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Minister introduces the budget on the day and the rest of us can sit back and itemise the parts we do not like, the parts we would have improved and <Col N="1092" /> done differently.  That is the easiest thing in the world to do.  The success or otherwise of any plan or budget can be judged only after 12 months.  As I have said, the figures released for the first quarter for receipts and expenditure were surprisingly good.  Since the budget interest rates have reduced considerably.  The unemployment figures, although very high, have shown a slight improvement during the past two months.  Obviously, it is much too early to assess whether the budget has been a success, but the indicators we have had in the past weeks have been in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I suppose we all object to the 1 per cent levy, but the Minister had to balance his budget and that is acceptable.  It is extraordinary that the levy had to be imposed on those earning £173 per week or £10,000 to £12,000 per annum, the area in which there are thousands of workers.  We like to think that thousands are in the higher earning bracket but when we examine the statistics that is not the case.</P>
    <P>On a personal level I have been unhappy at how budgets have been framed during the past few years.  All the emphasis has been on reducing the top rate of tax, although the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent. Basically, if one is earning in the region of £10,000 to £15,000, the rate of tax is not all that important.  What is far more important are the tax-free allowances and the bands; yet during the past few years the emphasis has been geared to looking after the higher earner.  Last year the philosophy was that the high rate of tax would be reduced for the high earner, but that fringe benefit tax would be introduced. I remember listening and waiting to hear the proposals for the fringe benefit tax, but they also seem to have gone out the door.  I do not know whether that was Progressive Democrat thinking or otherwise.  I thought this was how the top earner would pay back something.  We have all heard various stories about mortgages, school fees, university fees, holidays and everything else being paid by some companies.  I understood this was the direction in which the Government of <Col N="1093" /> the past few years was going and that it would all balance out in the end.  I was disappointed to see that the fringe benefits tax had disappeared.  If we had gone through a few years of reducing the top rate of tax and felt we had gone too far and had to get revenue back into the Exchequer we should have taken it from the people who got off lightly during the past few years, and certainly not from the people on £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I hope the imposition of the levy will be for this year only.  The Minister did admit it was a crude way of doing things. If it remains, I hope it will be amended and that the people who have had their tax reduced in recent years will have to pay.  It would be better to have an imposition of 1 per cent for people earning in the region of £12,000 to £20,000 and 2 per cent or 3 per cent for people at the higher level.  That would have been more just.</P>
    <P>There are figures in today's newspapers concerning the residential property tax.  I know the changes this year have been slight but, when that tax was introduced some years ago, it did not appear to generate any revenue; nevertheless, the revenue has begun to build up.  As a member of a local authority I feel the take from that tax will soon equal the rates support grant.  Perhaps local authorities should have imposed a residential property tax for top earners from day one rather than water and service charges.  It appears to me that the rates support grant we receive from the Department of the Environment is reduced each year while revenue from the residential property tax is increasing.</P>
    <P>In regard to other taxation measures, I want to refer to the probate tax mentioned by an earlier speaker.  That tax has its merits although I met a constituent recently who expressed concern in regard to it.  He said that the Minister for Finance in his budget speech referred to a tax on resources passing from one generation to another and later implied that it would apply even in regard to the transfer of assets or cash from a spouse to a partner.  That person felt aggrieved <Col N="1094" /> because although he does not own a house his insurance policy will provide a lump sum on the death of either partner which may be used to cover the rental on the house.  That person cannot be evicted from his house but his rent may increase. He suggested that the £10,000 exemption limit is not enough for the person who does not own a house.  He considers that for a non-property holder the exemption should be in the order of £30,000 or £40,000 to compensate for the exemption to which the property holder is entitled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in regard to medical services, for example, the £20 million that has been allocated to reduce hospital waiting lists.  However, other changes were made in relation to eligibility for medical cards.  From dealing with constituents' queries it appears that the medical card is becoming more valuable year after year.  I feel sorry for people who do not qualify because they may be £2 or £3 over the income limit set for medical card eligibility.  Will the Minister review this scheme and perhaps introduce a two or three phase medical card scheme?  Such a scheme would provide for people who are at present entitled to free medicines and GPs' fees and a second category could be provided whereby people would be entitled to a 50 per cent or a 75 per cent reduction in their medical expenses.  The revenue derived from those people &mdash; for example, they might contribute £3 towards their GP's fee and £1 towards medicines &mdash; could provide for a third category that might be entitled to a reduction of 25 per cent in their medical expenses.  Current eligibility criteria are very stringent, people who are eligible are entitled to full medical benefits and those ineligible do not qualify for any.</P>
    <P>The budget in many ways is pro-jobs but I disagree with Deputy Broughan's comment on the Labour Party being totally against any form of workfare or job-sharing scheme.  We must face up to the reality that over 300,000 people are unemployed and that they will not disappear. If our economy begins to recover from the recession, perhaps over two or three years, 40,000 or 50,000 jobs might <Col N="1095" /> be generated and 20,000 or 30,000 people might emigrate if economies in the UK or elsewhere improve.  However, we will have a hard core of 200,000 people plus unemployed and we cannot just pay lip service to the magnitude of that problem. A workfare or job sharing scheme must be devised to provide work for people who are long term unemployed.  Trade unions, in which I was very active, object to such schemes as they say they constitute cheap labour.  However, work could be quantified at a daily rate of £30 or £35.  A person who receives £70 on the dole could be asked to give two days' work and by way of encouragement they could be offered a third day's work at £35 to enable them to supplement their income.  A person in receipt of £140 on the dole could be requested to give four days' work and offered another day as an incentive to participate in the scheme. Obviously, for the first few years such a scheme would have to be voluntary because it would not be able to cope with 250,000 unemployed.  However, some scheme must be devised and if its costs exceed the allocation made for it, they must be borne by taxpayers.  It seems extraordinary that people who wish to join social employment schemes are not being adequately catered for by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. They are work schemes and very little additional income is given to people participating in them.  It is regrettable that there appears to be difficulty in approving schemes for people who are prepared to work.</P>
    <P>A recent answer to a Dáil question stated that 84 per cent of pensioners are eligible for a medical card.  Two constituents of mine, a man and his wife, who are aged 90 and 91, respectively, are not eligible for medical cards.  The husband is an ex-civil servant and the couple have had frequent medical problems, but were just over the income eligibility limit for a medical card.  On making representations to a health board on their behalf I was told that if I could produce a letter to the effect that they were suffering from a terminal illness <Col N="1096" /> they would qualify for the medical card, but surely people aged 91 or 92 should be entitled to every consideration?</P>
    <P>The Minister in the budget stated that there would be an increase in public sector pay of £279 million.  Much of that increase relates to the negotiations with the unions a few years ago.  How much of that figure relates to decentralisation? As a Dublin Deputy I resent jobs being taken out of the city year after year. Decentralisation is costing the country a fortune.  I would like to know its exact cost.  The cost does not relate just to the provision of new office blocks in towns or cities around the country.  I heard that the Civil Service are finding it difficult to get people at all grade levels to transfer, particularly to smaller towns.  It appears there is much waste involved in decentralisation. People are being promoted out of turn and in some cases may get two promotions in order to make up the transfer numbers to decentralised offices. Other people who opt not to transfer are being made more or less redundant.  Not alone have their promotional prospects been damaged, in many cases people are being left in limbo and are not doing an honest day's work.  That is not their choice, the Department in which they are employed may not have any meaningful work for them.  In some cases they may be working in a lower grade.  Money is being wasted on decentralisation.  I heard that people were not prepared to transfer to Cavan and that a bus had to be provided to transport workers from Dublin to Cavan daily.  I am opposed to decentralisation because I object to jobs being taken out of the city.  I often think that when a factory in a rural area is closed the first demand is to move a few more jobs out of Dublin.  If that happens in future there will be also a case for transferring unemployed people from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the large increase in the capital programme.  As a local authority member I am aware of the problems created in recent years by the lack of a local authority house building programme. A previous speaker mentioned a figure of £150 million of asset sales.  I have no difficulty with that, particularly <Col N="1097" /> in relation to Greencore.  I am against privatisation since I work for a semi-State body, but the Greencore decision was made some years ago and little can be achieved by arguing about it now.</P>
    <P>The mortgage relief allowed in the budget was very welcome.  Even before interest rates began to decrease the issue of mortgage repayments was addressed in the budget.  It was innovative in that some mortgage holders who had small mortgages were penalised by the reduction of their mortgage relief by £200, which was transferred to others; but allowing 100 per cent interest relief for the first three years to first time buyers has solved that problem.  Six weeks after the budget the main winners are the people who are paying large mortgages because they fought a campaign which brought it to the attention of the Government.  They now have extra relief and, subsequently, rates have come down.  Obviously, that means more money in their pockets to spend on other items in the economy, including clothing, which has been mentioned by many people.  We all wish to see a low rate of VAT on everything but the figures given under the clothing heading created a lot of hype.  All Deputies were lobbied &mdash; we all have friends in the rag trade.  But the fact that 80 per cent of the clothing we buy is imported indicates that the VAT increases may affect sales in shops &mdash; they were in a recessionary period even before the budget &mdash; but it will not affect employment or manufacturing.  Manufacturing companies in the rag trade export almost three quarters of their produce. Now people will have more money in their pockets, which will lead to an increase in discretionary spending.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam páirt a ghlacdh i ndíospoiréacht na cáinaisnéise.  Tréaslaím don Aire Airgeadais toisc an chái-naisnéis mhaith a thug sé anseo ar son ár dtíre agus ar ndóigh ar son an Rialtais don bhliain atá os ár gcomhair amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, energy conservation <Col N="1098" /> is an important part of this Government's policy and will be promoted in all sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The programme undertaken over the last few years has resulted in considerable investment and significant energy savings. The benefits of previous expenditure will continue in the future and the benefits derived from energy conservation measures, therefore, are cumulative.</P>
    <P>The energy conservation programme of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is intended to encourage the efficient use of all forms of energy in all sectors of the economy in order to conserve scarce resources, to achieve financial savings and to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>Our Department's role is to persuade others to act.  Much of the energy savings which are possible will be realised through individual actions and improved practices.  This is the case in industry as much as it is in the home.  To this end education and awareness campaigns adminstered by Eolas and aimed at specific sectors of the economy are an important feature of our Department's programme.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include a selected group of companies working with Eolas support to develop a suitable auditing procedure and statement for energy accounts with a view to their publication in the companies' annual reports.</P>
    <P>In the domestic sector the energy/environment special telephone service provides free information, advice and leaflets on energy use to consumers. In 1993 this will include information on the energy labelling scheme for domestic appliances launched last December.  This scheme, which, I am sure, will be successful in promoting and achieving greater energy efficiency in the domestic sector of our economy, was developed following a study of the relative energy performance of domestic refrigerator appliances.  The results concluded that there were energy savings of up to £1 million per annum to be achieved through influencing purchasers to buy the more efficient models available.  Furthermore, <Col N="1099" /> these savings would amount to approximately £10 million per annum when the existing stock of refrigeration appliances is completely replaced.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the trade, labels have been developed for fridges and washing machines which enable consumers to readily identify the more efficient models.  For washing machines the &ldquo;smiling face&rdquo; label indicates that such machines are fitted with energy saving features and will reduce electricity costs by up to 30 per cent.  The second label will be applied to all refrigeration appliances which have been put forward by their suppliers for the scheme.  Here the label indicates the actual energy performance of the refrigeration appliance on a scale of one to ten.</P>
    <P>The labels are fully described in the support literature which is available in retail outlets displaying the labels.  This is just one example of the type of initiative we wish to see developed in 1993 and ensuing years.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the area of renewable energy, appropriate alternative sources will be promoted.  The Bellacorick wind farm, which became fully operational in late 1992, is an indication of what can be done.  It will produce about 17 million units of electricity per annum which will be fed into the national grid through the nearby ESB power station.  Further such initiatives will be encouraged, as will developments in relation to biomass and research in other energy sources.  Indeed, I am pleased that under the European Community Thermie Programme further support will be available for additional wind generating projects this year and next year.</P>
    <P>It is the role of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to facilitate in every way possible the achievement of a vibrant and responsible minerals sector.  At present there is an appreciable level of minerals exploration activity throughout the country with approximately 500 prospecting licences currently valid.  However, as the House is already aware, the most significant <Col N="1100" /> development in the minerals sector of late is the probability that two major zinc/lead projects are about to come on stream at Galmoy, County Kilkenny and Lisheen, County Tipperary, offering direct employment to between 500-600 people.</P>
    <P>However, I am also aware, that the whole issue of mining gives rise to concern on the part of those who, like myself and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, wish to see our natural environment protected.  It is important that I make clear to the House our position on this.  Deputy Browne has done this on many occasions and will do so in the future.  The Government is absolutely committed to the protection of the environment as evidenced by the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, which, I understand, will be set up in County Wexford in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will have full control over the licensing of water, air, noise and waste pollution for the mining industry.  This new integrated licensing system will provide a superior all round approach to environmental development and a more streamlined procedure for the processing of environmental licences.</P>
    <P>It is also Government policy that the potential contribution of our mineral resources at this critical stage in our economic development should be explored and exploited to the full, which is the Department's policy, but this must be done in a way which is compatible with the needs of the environment.  I am fully convinced that this balance can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, there has been a tendency on the part of some people to feel that mining should be banned altogether and to completely ignore the fact that minerals are an important natural resource and that their exploitation makes an essential contribution to the State's prosperity and quality of life.  There can be no blanket refusal to contemplate mining proposals leading to unnecessary sterlisation of mineral resources, provided of <Col N="1101" /> course that the relevant environmental and other local authority criteria are met. In this regard planning authorities must be seen to be both consistent and fair in their interpretation and application of Government policy and regulations on the environment.  They must recognise the priorities of Government policy, such as putting the country back to work by creating useful and productive new employment, taking full advantage of all our human and natural resources.</P>
    <P>With a view to easing the administrative burden on industry, stimulating prospecting activity and speeding up the prospecting application and renewal system, our Department is currently revising the prospecting licence and lease administrative procedures.  These new measures, which I will be introducing later in the year, will greatly streamline administrative procedures both for the industry and the Department and will establish a positive footing for the development of the industry in the nineties.</P>
    <P>The positive economic benefits of the availability of natural gas from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields illustrates the importance of actively promoting hydrocarbons exploration offshore Ireland.  There is undoubted potential for further significant commercial discoveries of oil and gas offshore Ireland.  The realisation of that potential, however, is utterly dependent on the existence of a sustained and substantial level of exploration activity.</P>
    <P>Those charged with deciding on the degree and location of investment in hydrocarbons exploration generally look to three crucial factors &mdash; world energy prices, the prospectivity of the areas under consideration and the local terms and conditions.  While we obviously have no control over the first two, we do have control over the terms and conditions which we apply to the exploration industry. This is an area in which positive steps have been taken in recent times.  I would like to pay special tribute to the Minister for Finance for the very positive way he has ensured that the terms have come <Col N="1102" /> on stream so that we can have further exploration.</P>
    <P>The introduction of revised licensing terms and the enactment of a comprehensive, fully-integrated regime of petroleum taxation legislation within the past year demonstrates clearly to the industry that Ireland holds a modern and progressive outlook towards oil and gas exploration and development.  The effect of these measures has been to make it explicitly clear to exploration investment planners that Ireland must now be viewed as a genuine contender for internationally mobile exploration investment.</P>
    <P>In this context it is heartening to know that a number of the major exploration companies have again turned their attention towards offshore Ireland.  I am confident that this renewed interest will lead to a significant increase in exploration activity in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined that the renewed impetus which has been given to the oil and gas exploration offshore Ireland will be sustained and developed.  If these exploration efforts meet with success, we can look forward to the further substantial economic and social benefits which will flow from the further development and production of hydrocarbons off our coasts.</P>
    <P>It has always been an important feature of our energy policy that a situation should be achieved where we are not overly dependent on any single fuel or source of supply.  Naturally, the discovery of gas in Kinsale and its subsequent development has helped to further that aim.  The added benefit of an indigenous supply has saved over £2 billion on our imported fuel bill.</P>
    <P>We now have a safe and modern gas industry with customers in the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors and in electricity generation.  Customers have come to appreciate the benefits of an efficient and versatile fuel, which is also and cleanest of all fossil fuels and, therefore, important to our environmental strategy.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that the gas industry will continue to exist, and indeed <Col N="1103" /> to expand, into the next century.  With this in mind a major project is now under way to link the Irish and British gas networks by way of a subsea interconnector pipeline.  The project is being constructed by Bord Gáis Éireann.  The cost of this project is estimated at £290 million and has been approved by the European Commission for funding at 35 per cent from its REGEN initiative.  The project is within budget and is on target for completion in October of this year.  The pipeline will run from north County Dublin to southern Scotland and its initial function will be to provide back-up in the event of an interruption in supplies from Kinsale. For this purpose a security gas agreement was concluded last year between Bord Gáis Éireann and National Power, the UK's largest fossil fuel powered electricity generation company.  Under this agreement, the first of its kind in these islands, a supply of gas will be guaranteed, in the event of disruption here, over a five year period.</P>
    <P>Additional gas will be needed before the end of this decade, as output from Kinsale reduces, and a full replacement of indigenous supplies will be required when Kinsale is depleted.  If further indigenous supplies are discovered, of course, our dependence on imports will be less; and, in the event that such supplies are surplus to our requirements, the pipeline will allow us to export them.  The pipeline will give access initially to the UK grid and eventually to the greater European gird, which will enable us to take advantage of the Single European Market for gas.</P>
    <P>The availability of natural gas has meant that our dependence on oil has decreased considerably over the last decade.  Oil, however, still accounts for almost 50 per cent of our energy use. Energy policy in the area of oil has two main bases: ensuring an adequate supply of oil and at the same time reducing its price, in so far as energy policy affects it.</P>
    <P>State involvement in the oil market is largely through ownership of the Whitegate Oil Refinery in Cork.  The House will be aware that our Department and <Col N="1104" /> the INPC have sought investment to upgrade the refinery.  While a number of negotiations reached quite advanced stages, it has not been possible to come to a deal.  However, the Government is committed to achieving an upgrade to ensure the continued operation of the refinery but enable it to operate without creating a diseconomy; and our Department, the INPC and consultants, who are experts in the area, are at present examining the options with a view to finding the optimum way of solving the problem.  I am confident that I will be able to come back to the House with outline plans for the future of the refinery later this year.</P>
    <P>I hope that these facts which I have put on the record are of assistance to the House and the people of the country in understanding that the Government is committed to a solid energy policy based on clear environmental criteria and that we will continue to explore all the resources available to us to ensure that our indigenous natural resources can be exploited to the maximum benefit of both our economy and the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> This budget has been framed against a background of difficult economic circumstances, including rising interest rates.  It is gratifying to see that since it was brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, a sharp decline in interest rates has already taken place.  This is a clear indication that the Government's strategy in managing the economy is already starting to bear fruit. The reduction in interest rates brings much needed relief to the hard-pressed mortgage holders, but one would have to question the slowness of some of our financial institutions and building societies in passing on the reduction in interest rates to their customers.  I feel that some of them are not being fair to their customers. It is not good enough to wait, in some instances until 1 May, to pass on the interest rate reductions.  That is totally unjustified and puts a major burden on mortgage holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I intend to focus during my contribution on the aspects of the budget which are particularly relevant to my responsibilities as Minister responsible for environmental protection.  This year's Public Capital Programme has increased by almost 27 per cent to a total of £2,340 million.  I am pleased to inform the House that this increase is fully reflected in the water and sanitary services programme.  This will ensure that the good progress of recent years can be accelerated, with the construction of many new water and sewerage schemes throughout the country.  The benefits from the programme will be confined not simply to enhancing the quality of our environment, although this must continue to be seen as the principal focus of our efforts.  The new water and sewerage schemes will also ensure that improved infrastructure is available for economic development as well as giving rise to significant job creation &mdash; about 1,800 in the current year &mdash; both from direct employment on the construction works involved and in ancillary industries and activities.</P>
    <P>The EC Cohesion Fund is a central component in planning and financing many priority schemes throughout the country.  I was very pleased to meet last Friday Commissioner Schmidhuber, who is responsible for the Cohesion Fund at European level, when we had a constructive and cordial meeting.  I impressed upon him the need for early approval of the schemes submitted so that work on these projects can commence at the earliest possible date.  The importance of the fund is immediately evident from the value of the expenditure forecast in 1993 on water and sewerage schemes alone; the amount involved exceeds £42 million.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the Cohesion Fund is to assist the member states concerned to meet their obligations under various Community directives, including the EC Waste Water Directive, which is aimed at enhanced sewerage treatment and cessation of marine-based dumping of sewage sludge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 8, 14, 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Fortunately last autumn's turbulence in international money markets had a relatively minor impact on tourism performance, coming as it did at the end of the 1992 peak season.  The fact that the major source of tourism growth in recent years has been in mainland Europe, outside the sterling area, also helped to minimise the impact.  Consequently, tourism was not designated as one of the short term priorities for assistance from the Market Development Fund launched in October 1992 and terminated last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The realignment of the punt within the EMS in January, coupled with stabilisation <Col N="1108" /> of interest rates since and well in advance of the 1993 tourist season, has helped significantly to restore the competitiveness of Irish tourism, particularly in important markets such as the UK and the US, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position last winter.</P>
    <P>The industry will also benefit from a number of EC funded initiatives scheduled for this year, including a £2 million special Bord Fáilte run marketing programme to increase business in shoulder and off peak periods; and a £10 million marketing package led by the industry targeted mainly at new markets and market segments.  Bord Fáilte are currently forecasting a 5 per cent increase in overseas visitors to 3.3 million for 1993 and a 7 per cent increase in overseas revenue.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that we have lost out to the Americans to the tune of about 15 per cent in our competitiveness on the Italian, Spanish and British markets, which were identified as growth areas for tourism?  Will he agree that there is a greater incentive for American tourists to visit England and Scotland than Ireland?  Will he agree also, in regard to the Italian and Spanish markets, that we need a more intensive advertising campaign to offset the adverse effects of the recent currency fluctuations?</P>

The Deputy is correct in saying that the trend would be in the other direction in regard to the Italian market but we are in a stronger position now than prior to devaluation in regard to all other European currencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a particularly strong position in regard to the US market <i>vis-à-vis</i> last year, if exchange rates are the only factor taken into account.  In the mid-August 1992 period the value of the dollar to the Irish pound was approximately DLDL1.83 whereas at present it is approximately DLDL1.50 to DLDL1.51. We are at a considerable advantage in <Col N="1109" /> that respect.  Most of the growth in the tourism sector has come from mainland Europe in the past number of years and we enjoy a competitive position as a result of devaluation.  Bord Fáilte have alerted overseas travel agents to the benefits of the increased spending power due to the currency situation and we are confident that the number of tourists from Europe this year will increase on last year, the exchange rate being a significant factor in that regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that, on the one hand, we have gained competitiveness in regard to the American market, but on the other, the English market is now more attractive to American visitors because the American dollar is considerably stronger in relation to sterling than the Irish pound?</P>

      <P>I gave the position of the Irish pound as against the US dollar in mid-August last year.  There has been a significant increase in the spending power of Americans here and that should increase the influx of such tourists.  The Deputy may be referring to the effects on UK tourists coming to Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the exchange rate between Ireland and England.  We do not foresee any great difficulties in that regard but, from a tourist point of view, it would be better if the exchange rate had remained at the level it was at last year.  However, present indications are that there will be a considerable increase in numbers of American tourists this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Supply constraints tend to arise within sectors of the tourism industry, including car hire, directly related to the traditional peaking nature of demand in the popular family holiday months of July and August.  Thanks to major new investment and marketing initiatives targeted at generating shoulder and off peak season business, the situation has improved in recent years.  However, short term supply difficulties continue in the car hire sector, particularly for a three week period at end July-early August.  Last year, in anticipation of such difficulties, the Government decided to allocate £1 million in the 1992 budget for a grant scheme to boost car hire supply to a level sufficient to meet expected 1992 peak demand.</P>
      <P>This year the Government has decided to adopt a different, more long term approach to help solve the problem, details of which were announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget. Under the new arrangement the Government proposes to introduce a scheme of partial repayment of vehicle registration tax in respect of cars being disposed of from the hire fleet.  Details of the scheme are currently being finalised by the Department of Finance in consultation with the Car Rental Council.  The additional resources which this scheme will inject into the sector, estimated at £3 million this year, will enable car hire operators to expand their fleets to cater for the peak season.  The problems relating to the car hire sector will continue to be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that I am currently in the process of preparing a new plan for the development of tourism which will include measures aimed at further spreading business to the off peak and shoulder seasons, thus further <Col N="1111" /> reducing the concentration of demand for car hire in the July-August period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the Bord Fáilte projections that there will be a shortage of approximately 3,000 cars at the peak of this year's tourist season, that this could lead to a loss of approximately £28 million in tourist revenue and that it will have a particularly damaging effect on the Italian, German and US markets?  Will he comment on the suggestion that the care hire sector should be allowed to import cars on a temporary basis at the peak of the tourist season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's last question, in his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance ruled out the temporary importation of cars. As the Deputy correctly stated, this problem in the car hire sector has existed for some time.  He also said that this shortage could lead to a loss of approximately £28 million in tourist revenue this year. However, I do not anticipate that this will be the case.  There are a number of reasons for the problems in the car hire sector.  The shortage of cars only arises for one or two months of the year.  Car hire costs are directly related to the underlying costs incurred by people in the car hire business, for example, the cost of cars, high insurance costs and so on.  A number of car hire companies are not inclined, for good business and commercial reasons, to buy extra cars to cater for the peak of the four to six week tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1992 the Government introduced a £1 million grant scheme which brought a number of cars onto the market. However, it has been decided to adopt a more long term approach this year by giving a partial rebate of vehicle registration tax to car hire companies.  There can be problems at the peak of the tourist season for a variety of sectors, not least of which is the car hire sector.  The Tourism Task Force addressed the problems experienced by the car hire sector and these problems have also been examined <Col N="1112" /> in special reports.  Those problems were exacerbated at the end of the 1991 tourist season when two of the major car hire companies decided to leave the Irish market.  There is also the further problem that car hire in Ireland is very expensive &mdash; it is more expensive here than in any other European country.  The Government believes that the approach being adopted this year should alleviate the problems in this sector in the long term and make it more profitable for car hire companies to put more cars onto the market.  I will continue to review this issue.  I accept that there is a problem in this sector, but it has existed for a number of years.  I will see how the approach adopted this year works, and I will introduce other alternatives if it does not work.</P>

Is he also aware that the impression given by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement was that the partial rebate of vehicle registration tax would not be deferred until such time as the cars were being sold?  In other words, the car industry were misled to the extent that they felt the rebate would be a greater incentive than it actually is.  This may not lead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not easy to solve this problem due to the fact that the demand for cars peaks at a certain time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, An Bord Tráchtála offers a comprehensive service to Irish industry in the areas of export promotion and marketing, and details of this and other related An Bord Tráchtála activities can be gleaned from the recently published An Bord Tráchtála Annual Review and Outlook.  I intend to confine my reply to new initiatives which have been recently put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a country, we need to look more and more to indigenous industry to provide the engine for sustainable growth, and this is particularly true in regard to growth in international markets.  It is, therefore, in this direction that the attention <Col N="1114" /> and efforts of both my Department and An Bord Tráchála will be firmly focused in the coming years.  Our mutual target is to increase indigenous exports by 50 per cent by the end of 1996, from the current IR£3.7 billion to IR£5.5 billion.</P>
    <P>To achieve this target, we will need to do many things, but first we must improve the level of our activity in international markets and our competence in selling there.  This requires a greater promotional spend and, to meet this, An Bord Tráchtála will this year receive £37.828 million in Exchequer grant-in-aid, an increase of 11 per cent on the 1992 outturn and over 80 per cent higher than the 1988 figure.  Given the many constraints and pressures on Exchequer spending at present, this represents a major commitment on the Government's behalf to supporting the efforts of Irish companies abroad.</P>
    <P>With the creation of the new Department of Tourism and Trade, a fresh impetus is also being given to the pursuit of a more effective co-ordination of Ireland's economic interests in overseas markets.  I have launched a consultancy study to make recommendations to me, in two to three months time, on what should be done to improve our effectiveness in selling our country, our services and our mechandise abroad.  I will consider these recommendations and formulate proposals for Government to introduce change wherever it is needed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to assist Irish companies to compete in Europe, I have established a single market unit in my Department to provide the necessary co-ordination and problem-solving functions to ensure that the concerns of Irish business and industry are fully met.</P>
    <P>On 1 March this year, I also announced the setting-up of the EUROPLACE Programme, which is intended to increase full-time salespeople in Europe from 60 to 150 in three years.  The objective is that Irish companies will develop a permanent presence in the marketplace.  An Bord Tráchtála has estimated that each new salesperson will generate in the region of IR£3 million per annum in extra sales. <Col N="1115" /> I have also initiated a customer support scheme, which will place back-up customer support staff in companies which do significant business with European customers.  It is planned to place people in 150 companies over three years at a total cost of IR£1.5 million, of which An Bord Tráchtála will contribute up to IR£600,000.</P>
    <P>I also want to help small firms who are trying to make their first breakthrough into the European market.  With this in mind, I have asked An Bord Tráchtála to fund up to ten group marketing schemes representing 50 exporters over the next three years.  It will co-finance market-based agents which represent a number of companies.  The total cost of this scheme over the three years will be IR£1.4 million, of which An Bord Tráchtála will contribute up to IR£500,000.</P>
    <P>On the promotional front, I will support An Bord Tráchtála in its biggest ever promotional programme, involving 120 major sales generating initiatives in which more than 1,300 Irish exporters will participate and which will include a strong Irish presence at leading trade fairs, trade missions, buyer trips to Ireland and programmes for first-time exporters.  For the first time, Ireland will have a stand at the China Aviation Fair in Beijing.  There will be trade missions to Eastern Europe, the CIS, the Asia-Pacific area, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. In relation to the US market, over 70 Irish companies, North and South, will take part in a major promotional drive termed &ldquo;The Look is Ireland&rdquo; in Chicago in June.</P>
    <P>A very important element of our export promotion policy in the coming years will be the EC's Structural Funds contribution to our marketing programmes. Officials in my Department and An Bord Tráchtála are currently working on a fresh and innovative marketing programme in order to maintain a high level of Structural Funds support for our marketing initiatives abroad in the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all these measures and initiatives will further boost export <Col N="1116" /> growth, particularly in the indigenous sector, and will continue to contribute significantly to employment here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of An Bord Tráchtála's responsibilities in relation to other Departments, it will continue, in accordance with section 6 of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991, to assist, wherever necessary and-or appropriate, the export efforts of any sector which is the responsibility of any other Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his long and very detailed answer in some respects.  The Minister said that he intended to increase indigenous exports by 50 per cent by 1996.  Has the Minister targeted particular industries from which that growth should come?  Is the growth expected to come from obvious sectors, and, if so, will the Minister say which industries are involved?  I should also like to know where it is expected the growth markets will be.  Is the 50 per cent increase targeted within the European Single Market or is a much broader market front targeted?  In the context of drafting legislation arising from the Culliton report, what are the responsibilities of An Bord Tráchtála to other Departments?  Are all the people sent to Europe skilled in foreign languages?  It seems important that those who take part in the sales placement programme are skilled in the language of the country to which they are sent.</P>

      <P>Question No. 4, tabled by Deputy Deenihan, relates to An Bord Tráchtála, so I shall deal with that aspect <Col N="1117" /> when we come to it.  The Deputy asked about the projected increase from £3.7 billion to £5.5 billion by 1996.  Markets and products will be targeted for growth by An Bord Tráchtála and there will be plans for the coming years for each of the markets and products concerned.  Each year An Bord Tráchtála works out particular programmes and the board is confident that the projected figure can be attained by 1996.  Deputy Cullen also asked about foreign languages.  An Bord Tráchtála will assist firms with regard to the Europlace programme and, naturally, proficiency in speaking a foreign language will be taken into account when someone is posted overseas.  The choosing of individual salespeople is a matter for the customer concerned and An Bord Tráchtála.  The business concerned would choose the most able applicant and I am sure that matters such as proficiency in language would be considered.  I recognise that the lack of language training is often a problem for salespeople abroad and anyone in business takes cognisance of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992, exports increased by nearly 11 per cent to £16.625 billion.  For 1993, An Bord Tráchtála estimates further growth of 4.3 per cent, which will bring our total exports to £17.1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the subjects of correlation between growth and employment and transfer pricing, I draw the attention of Deputies to report No. 94 of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) entitled &ldquo;The Association between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland&rdquo;, which was published in December 1992.  The report is the first of two by the NESC on the links between economic growth and employment growth.  It describes, <i>inter alia,</i> the historical association between the growth of output and employment in Ireland and in other Western economies over the past 30 years and highlights the way in which this relationship has varied over time.  In the second leg of the study, the NESC will focus on interpreting and explaining the different development patterns which the report describes and on identifying the policy options open to Ireland in seeking to secure an improved employment outcome in the future.  On the subject of transfer pricing, the report says that, by its nature, this is a hidden activity and that precise quantification of its significance is impossible.  The report does acknowledge, however, that the very high proportion of recent economic growth accounted for by the manufacturing sector and its exceptionally rapid rates of productivity growth have been overstated due to the effects of transfer pricing.  At the same time, the report indicates that, even without transfer pricing.  At the same time, the manufacturing output and productivity remains high relative to other countries. On the subject of a correlation between growth and jobs, the report concludes that the concentration of overseas industry in the rapidly growing high-tech sectors of manufacturing industry and the higher than average levels of productivity in overseas firms may have served to <Col N="1120" /> reduce the employment impact of Irish growth relative to that obtaining elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The need to develop indigenous industry has been recognised in successive reports from Telesis to Culliton.  Within my area of responsibility this has been given practical expression since 1989 by significantly increasing, with the assistance of the Structural Funds, the annual Exchequer grant in aid to An Bord Tráchtála to enable it to provide an expanding range of export promotional support services for indigenous industry.  Surveys conducted by An Bord Tráchtála of its target 1,200 companies indicate that they have achieved significant increases in exports and employment in recent years. Its survey for 1992 indicates that target companies increased exports by 11 per cent to £3.7 billion and increased employment by 3 per cent to 97,600.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is one of the great puzzles of our time that, from a position in which Ireland had a trade surplus of just over £300 million in 1985 to one in which there was a trade surplus of £3.5 billion in 1992, the jobs are still not coming?  I have read the report to which the Minister refers. Will the Minister not agree that we are engaging in self-delusion in continuing to profess that the fundamentals are sound, when, in relation to this one major fundamental of trade, both the NESC report to which the Minister refers and the recent CSO revision of methodology have shown that much of the trade in question is illusory and due to transfer pricing by continuance?</P>

      <P>I am sure that Deputy Rabbitte and I could have a long debate on some of the matters raised.  The <Col N="1121" /> Deputy referred to the CSO figures.  The trade figures were not in dispute in the recent adjustments made by the CSO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised did not concern trade figures, for which I am responsible, but related to other matters which have been spoken about in the House on other occasions.  As the NESC report concludes, transfer pricing has had an effect.  When I was a back-bench Deputy I referred to this matter in the House on a number of occasions. From the point of view of my Department, the figures in which I am most interested are the export figures from indigenous Irish firms which amounted to £3.7 billion of last year's total export figure of more than £16 billion.  Transfer pricing arrangements have an effect, as concluded by the NESC report, and which have been known for a long time by everybody in business.  The NESC report could come down with any hard and fast statement in relation to the effect and I agree with the Deputy, it has been a matter of mystery to and concern of successive Ministers and politicians &mdash; and to people outside &mdash; that we have achieved very high growth figures which have not been translated into jobs.  It is one of the mysteries of our time.  As someone who has always advocated what I term a climatology view of economics, I am considerably concerned that although we are getting the fundamentals right there has not been a necessary correlation in employment growth.  I am afraid we will have to wait for another day to pursue other aspects of it.  It is something that is of concern.  I am interested in getting indigenous firms to increase their exports, which should lead to a spin-off in jobs.</P>

      <P>There are 49 internal market measures overdue for implementation into Irish law.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for monitoring progress on the Internal Market programme and is vigorously pursuing the matter of implementation with the responsible Departments.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that implementation is not taking place as promptly as it should and have brought the present unsatisfactory state of affairs to the attention of the Government.  My objective now is to ensure that all that can be done will be done to bring about a significant improvement.  I will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why this delay has occurred?  Is it that officials of the various Departments do not regard compliance with this requirement as of a high priority, that it takes second place to other work, or is it that there are inadequate resources available in the parliamentary draftsman's office, or what is the reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that we have moved to the bottom portion of the league table in the implementation of measures.  I have brought this to the attention of Government.  There are a number of Departments involved.  It is a matter to which the Government has devoted some attention.  I can say that Departments are being actively encouraged, on foot of the discussions that took place at Government, to have these <Col N="1124" /> matters corrected.  I concede it is unsatisfactory that we have moved from a fairly high position on the league table to second last, depending on which figures one uses.  I reiterate that it is a matter of concern to me.  It would be my hope that in coming months we will be able to address this matter.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, to some extent at least, Ireland, as the largest net beneficiary in <i>per capita</i> terms of EC funds, has its case for continuing to receive additional amounts of such funds, undermined in part by latitude on the part of officials of Government Departments, and indeed Ministers, in complying with EC rules? Would he agree that to some extent he will be exposed to a measure of ridicule at European level if on the one hand he goes to Brussels looking for money and at the same time has to report that he, his colleagues and their officials are slow in implementing EC rules?</P>

We like to be able to say to our European colleagues that in all areas we have operated within the spirit and letter of the law.  It would be my hope that this position would be redressed in coming months.  I might add that there are various reasons for it relating to different Departments &mdash; Deputy Bruton will know this from his experience in Government &mdash; that perhaps some Departments may not have taken this matter as seriously as others.  As a result of this matter having been given attention by Government, in coming months all Departments should be in a position to ensure that we are reinstated to our proper place on the league table.</P>

      <P>Prior to the decision of the High Court last week there had been no constitutional difficulties encountered in this regard but there were others encountered, mainly in the drafting of regulations.  In regard to the decision of the High Court last week, as the Taoiseach announced in the House recently, that decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  We cannot anticipate the decision of the Supreme Court but, if the High Court decision is upheld, it would mean a considerable body of legislation would have to be introduced in the House to repeal many measures which have been implemented by way of regulation over the past 20 years or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no &mdash; the changed responsibility within departmental functions has not had any effect at all on the implementation of these measures.  It would not be fair to take such a view.  As Minister in charge of the internal market, it is the responsibility of my Department to pursue the implementation of these regulations by other Departments.  As Deputy John Bruton will know, it is the responsibility of each individual Department to put in train the regulations relating to its specific area of responsibility.  I am responsible for the operations of the Single Market and must report thereon to the Government, but thereafter each individual Minister has responsibility.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food.  I am the Minister responsible for monitoring progress of implementation of the Single Market. But each individual Department must bring in regulations relating to its area of responsibility, just as any Bill that comes before Government will be the responsibility of the appropriate Minister.  The problems relate to very many of these areas; some were mentioned by Deputy Bruton.  For example, many measures in some areas need to be translated into regulations.  There would be no purpose whatever in having somebody merely to co-ordinate them.  It is somewhat like any Bill or regulation: it must be produced by the relevant Department, sent to the parliamentary draftsman's office and then introduced in the House.  Therefore, to have somebody standing on top of a barrel saying &ldquo;I am co-ordinating all of this&rdquo; would not make any difference whatsoever.  My Department tries to exert pressure on individual Departments to go ahead and implement the particular measures appertaining to their area of responsibility.  It would be my hope that within a few months we would have a more satisfactory position obtaining.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that <Col N="1127" /> many of these directives have a considerable impact on the commercial life of this nation and its various sectoral interests?  Furthermore, would he not agree that all of these directives should be placed before a special committee of the House, before one of the new committees or a subcommittee of one of the new committees, so that their impact can be fully diagnosed, debated and realised? Second, would he agree that it is essential also to keep a sharp eye on our performance in relation to the discharge of our duties in taking them on board?</P>

Most of these directives &mdash; this procedure has been followed during the past 20 years &mdash; will be implemented by way of regulations which will be drawn up by the parliamentary draftsman.  This will take some time and I cannot give definite dates for their introduction but should it be necessary to introduce separate Bills for each directive the Order Paper would be clogged up.  In addition, if it proves necessary to bring a separate Bill before the House in respect of each of the 400 to 500 directives which have been implemented during the past 20 years as a result of the High Court decision, there will be considerable congestion in the Dáil timetable.</P>

      <P>In the twenties when we had a tiny Civil Service this House was able to pass more legislation than it has passed in any ten year period since. <Col N="1129" /> The problem is not the availability of technical advice but the political will to act; Ministers are unable to ensure that their officials comply with requirements in this matter.  This is not a minor issue, the Irish business organisations have expressed grave concern at the fact that this delay has given Ireland a bad reputation internationally and is preventing normal import and export business. Would the Minister agree that a decision should be taken by him to employ some of the barristers who are not earning large fees and are under-employed in the Law Library at present &mdash; there are many such barristers &mdash; in the parliamentary draftsman's office to draft these regulations and have the job done within six months at the most so that he will not have to come back into the House in six months time to make the same lame excuses that he has made during the past ten minutes?</P>

However, I would be more than happy if these matters could be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible to free the logjam.  As the Deputy is aware, reference is made in the Moriarty recommendations to the legislative process.  The Cabinet subcommittee, of which I am a member, which is examining the Culliton report will deal with this matter.

      <P>I am glad the Minister endorses the idea of using Irish language brand names.  However, I can think of very few Irish language brand names or descriptions.  Would the Minister agree <Col N="1131" /> that direct contact should be made with firms in order to point out to them the advantages to be gained having regard to the fact that an Irish language brand name or description can heighten one's awareness and create a feeling of guilt in the consumer in that one is unable to pass an Irish brand product?  Fiacla, the Irish toothpaste, has proved to be far more commercially attractive by virtue of the fact that it is an Irish brand name.  The same is true of Madra, the Irish petfood product.  In relation to product promotion Irish brand names such as these mean more than slogans or cliches.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said but this is a matter for consideration by the companies concerned. The Deputy mentioned one product which has proved to be a great success.  Market research shows that when people see the name they are conscious it is an Irish product.  Companies are taking this into account.  I should point out, however, that the Government is precluded because of a decision taken by the European Community in 1982 from launching a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. However, we have been using the &ldquo;Food Ireland&rdquo; slogan for some time.  Companies should be conscious of the matters the Deputy has raised because those using brand names have had considerable success.  It is our information that a number of other companies are thinking along those lines.  This State, and its agencies, are precluded under EC law from grant-aiding any such projects.  An Bord Tráchtála is conscious of this and companies should also take cognisance of the fact that those companies which use brand names have done very well.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> identified the lack of Irish salespeople abroad as a major constraint on the growth of our overseas sales.  If companies are to pursue market-led strategies it is essential that they know their customer, his or her tastes, preferences, likes and dislikes. That is why, at the launch of <i>An Bord Tráchtála's Review and Outlook</i> on 1 March 1993, I announced the setting up of a new Europlace programme which will increase the number of full-time salespeople on the ground in continental Europe from the current 60 to 150 in three years; that is an average of 30 companies each year.  The scheme will have a significant long term benefit because it will help companies to root themselves in the marketplace and be more responsive to future changes.  I would like to make the point that this is an intensive targeted programme; which will be aimed initially at firms which already have significant sales in continental markets.</P>

      <P>The question of the language has been raised many times.  We can see in a practical sense that the lack of language skills hinders our progress in export markets.  Will the Minister agree that the programme managers and others have a role to play in bringing pressure to bear on his colleagues in the Department of Education to look at the teaching of foreign languages at primary level? Will he further agree that this is a fundamental means of improving language skills instead of starting at second and third level?  Does he also agree it is important that we get this right as Europe becomes more and more integrated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter primarily for the Minister for Education.  As the Minister for Tourism and Trade I hope that people, especially those going into marketing, will have better language skills.  The evidence in the past number of years is that people who specialise in marketing have language skills.  I have found also that English is the most commonly spoken language in business and the fact that we use English is a great <Col N="1136" /> advantage.  English appears to be becoming more and more prevalent as the language of business throughout the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the view held by sections of industry trying to penetrate export markets that they would rather entrust the job of trying to win new markets abroad to the local network, in other words if they are trying to sell to Italy or Germany, they like to recruit Italians or Germans to sell into those markets?  Does he give credence to that viewpoint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the weaknesses of Irish exporting is that very few companies have people abroad selling directly for them.  Deputy Rabbitte is correct in that many Irish companies who sell abroad use the agents of that country to sell their products.  Companies who sell on an agency basis rather than by way of a direct marketing programme find this system very satisfactory.  In general agents use different methods of operating and their interests may not always be in line with the interests of the supplier back home.  The new Europlace programme was put in place to ensure that there are full-time sales people abroad to promote Irish products.</P>
      <P>Small companies, when they initially break into a foreign market, usually operate by way of an agent.  The Europlace programme will ensure that, as these companies grow, the number of direct sales people abroad will be increased. One of the weaknesses of Irish businesses selling abroad is that they rely on agents of the country in which they are selling, which is not always to the betterment of the product at home.  It is envisaged that the Europlace programme, which I announced on 1 March, will result in an increase in the number of Irish agents selling abroad.  What amazes me is that, as a trading nation depending on exports for our lifeblood, we have 60 sales people only selling abroad.  We hope to increase that number to 150 in the next two years.</P>

      <P>While it is desirable that <Col N="1137" /> marketing specialists have expertise in languages, will the Minister say in relation to constraints on the education system, particularly as it relates to the French and German languages, whether difficulties are experienced in certain countries due to lack of knowledge of fogeign languages?  I agree with the Minister that English is the common language in most countries.  Surely the Minister is aware that German companies who set up in this country expect their chief executive to speak fluent German? In those circumstances it is vital to have a knowledge of foreign languages.  Are problems experienced in regard to any particular language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence to that effect.  In conjunction with the Europlace programme there is also a customer support scheme which enables Irish companies at home to take on language graduates.  Irish companies breaking into foreign markets experience great difficulties with foreign languages and therefore it is important that they have expertise in that area at home.  I have no evidence of difficulties in any particular market due to lack of knowledge of foreign languages.  Young people who wish to pursue a career in marketing should ensure they have language skills.  In reply to Deputy Cullen's point, I suggested that, as English is the main spoken language in business, this problem is not as great as people might think.  When operating in any area, whether it be in business, farming or even when looking for votes, it is always an advantage to speak the punters' language.</P>

      <P>The allocation referred to relates to the payment of interest subsidies to cover the cost of concessionary export credit finance on OECD terms to capital goods exporters. The sale of capital goods may involve the provision of credit for a period of two to five years.  Where the State provides export credit insurance for such sales, the credit terms which may be offered are governed by an OECD arrangement, commonly known as the Consensus.  The Consensus interest rate is generally lower than the relevant market rates.  By bridging this interest rate difference my <Col N="1139" /> Department helps exporters of capital goods to raise finance in approved cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical question.  A very small amount of money is provided for this scheme &mdash; the outturn of the scheme in 1992 was only £57,000. In line with the amount provided last year, £100,000 was provided this year.  In 1990 the figure provided was £164,000, the highest figure in the last five years. The reason for the reduction relates to the near convergence of the Irish market rate with world market rates.  The £100,000 provided covers payment of interest subsidies to commercial banks to compensate them for the cost of providing concessionary export credit finance on OECD terms to capital goods exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the export credit insurance scheme specific project cover is available on a case by case basis to exporters of capital goods.  A specific contract policy covers a contract with a buyer for the export of capital goods on medium term credit, normally between two and five year's duration.  Where officially supported export credits are involved the credit terms which may be provided, which are set at a fixed rate for the duration of the contract, are governed by the arrangements and guidelines for officially supported export credit, which is administered by the OECD.  This arrangement, commonly known as the Consensus, sets guidelines in relation to the interest rates <Col N="1140" /> to be applied to the capital goods exporters.  The Consensus rates are generally lower than the market rates available from the banks for raising finance for exporters.  An exporter who receives export credit insurance can approach his bank and, on assignment of the insurance policy to it, receives the funds up front. In order to put the exporters in funds the bank will raise the necessary finance by way of a loan from another financial institution at market rates.  As indicated, these rates are generally higher than the rates determined by the Consensus and set out in the contract of the buyer.  As the buyer will now pay the bank the principal sum and interest as set out in the contract, the bank will incur a shortfall arising from the difference in the rates.  This shortfall incurred by the bank would be paid out for the credit financing of capital goods allocation.  The scheme exists so that exporters may not be obliged to carry the additional costs of ensuring that their banks do not incur a loss on interest costs, by financing the project.  In essence, the scheme was designed to help exporters raise finance for large capital goods projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will see if I can understand this.  The Minister is saying that this is a scheme operated between the OECD trading partners and that if I am an exporter I can go to the bank and get this concessionary rate, but that if there is a shortfall at the end of the trading period the shortfall is made up from a general fund to which our contribution share is £100,000, or is it made up by the domestic government of whichever country is at issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the export credit terms would be set on a fixed rate for the duration of the contract &mdash; this relates to the supply of capital goods &mdash; that arrangement would be governed by the OECD arrangement guidelines known as the Consensus, and a fixed interest rate is to be charged there, as agreed.  The exporter can go to the bank with his export credit insurance and the bank will put the money up front by <Col N="1141" /> borrowing the funds from another financial institution at normal commercial rates, but it can only lend to the exporter at the rates governed by the Consensus, the lower market rate.  Therefore, the bank is at the loss of the difference between the higher rate at which it borrowed the funds and the lower rate at which it is obliged to lend under the Consensus rate.  That is the difference covered by the £100,000 subhead in the Estimate this year.  There has been a subhead there for a number of years and the reason it has been reduced related to the convergence of international rates with the OECD rate.  The figure last year was about £57,000.  It is not a concession that goes to the exporters; it is to make up the shortfall which I have tried to explain.</P>

      <P>The value of North-South trade in 1992 was IR£1,294 million. The recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference which took place in Belfast on 23 March 1993 reviewed trade between both parts of the island and agreed a number of initiatives designed to give a further boost to this trade.</P>
      <P>Engineering events will be organised throughout Ireland by which suppliers from North and South can investigate the possibility of tendering for components imported by 150 major manufacturers. Events have already taken place in Belfast, Dundalk and Castlebar and further exhibitions are scheduled for Newbridge, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Tralee and Derry.</P>

Already officials from both administrations are in contact to discuss details of the organisation of this conference.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, planning is in progress for a major joint North/South trade promotion of giftware, jewellery and classical clothing to senior purchasing executives of US and Canadian retail outlets.  This joint Bord Tráchtála/Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland event is to be held in Chicago in June 1993 and will involve 120 small and medium sized companies, 30 from Northern Ireland.</P>

Perhaps the Minister would take the opportunity, now that the Ceann Comhairle is no longer in the Chair, to respond to my earlier question about tourism in this context of trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>The figure of £1,294 million is made up of exports from this country amounting to £826 million and imports from Northern Ireland amounting to £468 million.  At the recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference attended by me, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, I met my counterpart, Mr. Atkins, and discussed further initiatives in the areas of tourism and trade.  We co-operate with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to a considerable extent.  Recently I attended the IDB Conference <Col N="1144" /> in Berlin where the stand was a joint effort between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, funded by the International Fund for Ireland. The idea is to sell Ireland as one destination. I agree with the Taoiseach that there is scope for greater trade opportunities between North and South.  In the communiqué following the recent Anglo-Irish Conference we pointed out that this co-operation would apply to trade and tourism.  The Government and I believe that practical co-operation in economic and tourist areas could lead to a greater understanding by all peoples on this island.  My Department will actively pursue this issue.  As I said in my reply, we will have a number of conferences this year in various towns throughout Ireland as well as a joint trade promotion in Chicago in June.  Later this year we will have a business conference organised for the North and South.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the efforts by the CII &mdash; which, presumably, have intensified since the merger of the two organisations &mdash; to improve the trade relationship between the two parts of the island?  What role does the Minister see for his Department &mdash; since the trade element is separated from it &mdash; in encouraging and developing this trade relationship?  Does he envisage that An Bord Tráchtála will have a direct involvement with organisations on the frontline in creating trade relationships? Does he consider that there should be a new impetus in this area for trade on this island and, if so, what vehicle could be used to enhance those trade relationships? It needs a hands on approach as opposed to an aspirational one.</P>

      <P>We have agreed that a conference on cross-Border trade will be held later this year, sponsored by both Governments, and operated by An Bord Tráchtála and its Northern Ireland equivalent. That is a step towards developing co-operation.  My Department, along with other Government Departments, are anxious to promote co-operation on a number of fronts and trade and tourism <Col N="1145" /> are areas in which we can make strides. I have already outlined what we will do in the trade area this year.  When the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal opens to the public in June 1994 it will be operated by a joint authority.  There is continuous discussion concerning those matters and we will continue to seek increased co-operation in all areas of trade and tourism in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Sometimes we under-estimate the social dimension of tourism and are inclined to view it totally in economic terms.  Many of the arguments for increased tourism relate to better international understanding.  The Minister raised the matter of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, since the principle behind that kind of cross-Border co-operation is underpinned by EC Structural Funding is it possible to have that co-operation extended throughout the whole island?  Many projects could be embarked upon which would encourage tourism movement across the Border. People in the South are not inclined to cross the Border into the North and many projects could be encouraged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a result of the recent Anglo-Irish Conference a matter that will be considered is co-operation between the various hotel interests on both sides of the Border of having one book listing all the hotels of Ireland.  It is strange that some of the guides cover merely the 26 counties, that there are blank spaces for the six counties and <i>vice versa</i>.  When a person comes to Ireland they see a blank space for the North east corner of the country.  If the Deputy or anybody else has ideas about further areas of co-operation I, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board would be glad to have them investigated.  The level of co-operation between the two tourist boards is very satisfactory.  They operate well together and we would like to see even greater results.</P>

Will the Minister agree that we spend our time, year in year out, in a whole series of new launches, seminars and photocalls with the best intentions in the world? However, from the point of view of selling Ireland as a corporate entity we have failed miserably.  We should give our overseas embassies a tough commercial remit to ensure we have an aggressive pro-active campaign in relation to selling Ireland, both individually and as a unit. Is the Minister aware that in the trade fair in Taiwan, which is one of the largest in the world &mdash; and where we have an IDA office &mdash; there is not a single IDA or Bord Fáilte brochure or video although there is a massive turnover of people, 80,000 of whom came to Britain last year, not one of whom came to this country.</P>

I have some experience in that regard.  I agree with the Deputy that in some areas of the world we should focus a co-operative approach on the part of all our agencies and bring them together to sell Ireland as a unit.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>There is much public disquiet about alleged harassment, threats and attempts to extort money from members of the public in Athlone, County Westmeath by a serving member of the Garda Síochána. Since the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to prosecute this garda there has been tremendous public disquiet in the midlands about this case and how it has developed.  The incident occurred when the manager of a large retail outlet in Athlone received a telephone call demanding money and giving details of how this money should be handed over.</P>
      <P>There were threats in regard to the victim's family home being burned out and a fake bomb was subsequently found at his house.  The man's wife was also telephoned and threatened.  A bullet was left at the victim's car with a written message attached.  A garda was subsequently identified as the perpetrator of these threats and demands.  He was questioned and, I believe, admitted to these crimes.  The file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and after a long delay it was, incredibly, decided that no prosecution would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> There is much public disquiet and anger about this decision.  It is not only important that justice be done but that it should also be seen to be done.  Why was this case not referred to a court of law where the matter could be conducted in an open and public manner and the public could see exactly what was involved?</P>
    <P>Why is this garda still allowed to walk the streets of Athlone after inflicting, terror and distress on a family over a protracted period while his victims still live in fear and terror?  The garda in question is at present suspended from the Garda Síochána on full pay.  Why are serving members of the Garda Síochána now having to suffer the embarrassment and humiliation of being taunted by wrongdoers who say, &ldquo;if I was a garda I could get away with this and much worse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing to allay the anxiety of the frightened family who continue to live with those fears?  Can this family seek redress through the Garda Complaints Board?  I call on the Minister to give more transparency to the process of justice in order to allay the fears and concerns of the law abiding public who too often are the people who suffer as a result of wrongdoers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I appreciate the Deputy's concern in raising this matter on the Adjournment.  In May last year, a member of the Garda Síochána stationed in Athlone was involved in two incidents in the Athlone area.  Those two incidents were fully investigated by the Garda authorities in accordance with normal procedures and a file was prepared for submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the question of what charges, if any, should be preferred against the garda in question.  Having considered the matter, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided in January of this year that there be no prosecution of the member in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister need hardly remind the <Col N="1176" /> House of the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the discharge of his statutory functions and, as such, there is nothing further for her to say about this aspect of the matter.  The Garda authorities are currently conducting their own investigation into this matter and the member of the Garda Síochána in question is suspended from duty.  While this investigation is in progress, the House will appreciate that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Minister to make any further comment at this time.  The House may be assured, however, that all aspects of the matter are being inquired into by the Garda authorities and that this inquiry will be completed with no avoidable delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Since I first became a member of Dublin County Council some ten years ago, I have been campaigning for a coastal protection scheme at The Burrow, Portrane.  I can see the beach from my home and have witnessed the slow erosion of the dunes structure which has taken place over the past 20 years and has been exacerbated in recent years by increased incidents of storm damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Burrow area is saucer-shaped and the erosion has reached the tip of the saucer.  When it reaches the last remaining dune, hundreds of acres of lands, homes, both permanent and summer residences, will be destroyed.  The residents are deeply concerned and living in fear of another storm.  Similar problems exist at The Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, Loughshinny Harbour, North Shore, Skerries, Barnageera, areas south of Balbriggan Harbour and Corballis, Donabate. These areas have been identified by Dublin County Council to the Department.  These examples show the extent of coastal erosion problems nationwide.  I wish to compliment the County and City Engineers Association on publishing their report, Coastal Management, A case for Action.  I have read <Col N="1177" /> the report and recommended it to the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>Our total coastline is 5,800 kilometres. The report states that 1,500 kilometres of coastline are at risk at present and 490 kilometres require immediate attention at an approximate cost of £125 million. This is a staggering cost, given the Government's current financial position. We have never really appreciated our coastline and its unique potential in terms of the economy and environment.  Our coastline has great tourism potential but we must protect it before it is too late.  It is reported that within the next 30 years or so our coastline will come under increasing environmental pressure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the question of harbour and pier maintenance and to the neglect in that regard.  This is an area which is very important in terms of tourism and related activities and of the livelihoods of fishermen.  The harbours at Rush, Loughshinny, Skerries and Balbriggan, for instance, are in need of urgent attention.  As a member of a local authority, I am aware of the lack of funding generally but money must be found to deal with what I regard as a crisis so far as our coastline is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the past the EC has tended not to finance coastal protection schemes. However, I appeal to the Minister and the Government to make a submission for EC Structural Funding in this regard. This is an appropriate time to raise this issue and, if successful, it will enable us to implement a coastal management programme to protect and secure our coastline which is arguably one of the most scenic in Europe and, therefore, has great tourism potential.</P>
    <P>Having read the report I support the desirability of setting up a national coastal authority within the Department of the Marine.  This agency would be responsible for all coastal matters and would have a regulatory role in developing our coastline.  I know of the Minister's deep concern regarding these matters and look forward to his favourable response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully <Col N="1178" /> agree with the Deputy that coastal erosion is a serious and growing problem. I welcome the opportunity of putting on the record of the House my Department's intention in that regard.</P>
      <P>This is, in fact, recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government which states that &ldquo;increased emphasis is to be given to coastal protection programmes in the light of the growing problem of coastal erosion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As of now the Exchequer funds available are extremely limited.  This year's provision amounts to £200,000 only and is already committed to ongoing works.</P>
      <P>As regards Community funding, the only funding available to date for coastal protection is under the EC LIFE Directive.</P>
      <P>This funding has been obtained by way of a joint project involving the Department of the Marine, EOLAS and the local authorities for Wexford, Waterford, Kerry and Clare.  The project title is Environmentally Friendly Coast Protection (ECOPRO).  A total of 900,000 ECU in grant aid is provided over a two-and-a-half year period.  The objectives of the project are to assess the vulnerability of the coast to changes, including erosion, to consider needs for protection both now and in the near future and to examine the performance and environmental impact of existing coastal protection works, including a demonstration project.  The demonstration project is the construction of coast protection works at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.  This EC supported programme is a welcome start but much more needs to be done. Therefore, we have put forward in the context of the preparation for the next round of Structural Funds allocations, proposals for a comprehensive coastal protection programme to be implemented over the next six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of this programme is to protect through coastal protection works key coastal areas with significant economic infrastructure where, in the absence of such works, there would be a serious short to medium term risk of major damage.  The prioritisation <Col N="1179" /> criteria envisaged for the selection of projects would include the value of property and public infrastructure at risk, the degree of risk involved and, of course, the costs of the remedial works required.</P>
    <P>While as yet no decisions have been made on Structural Funds allocation, I am confident that the Government will accord a high priority to this programme. I would also mention in this context that we are reviewing the level of local authority contribution required for coastal protection projects with a view to working out a more satisfactory arrangement than applies at present.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse what Deputy Ryan said.  Some county coastlines are under serious threat at present.  I am seeking priority funding to protect these coastlines from the erosion which is now threatening not only roadways but railway lines and property which are in a very serious condition.  The Government have made this a priority in our submission to Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the plan proposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, local offices will have responsibility only for suckler cow, sheep premia, headage payments and area aid payments.  All premia relating to male beef cattle will be handled in a new office to be constructed in Portlaoise.  The centralisation of beef premia is expected to be in place by June this year.  It is understood that a temporary building will be leased in Dublin for one to two years while the new facility is being built in Portlaoise.  The Department has indicated that the move is aimed at improving the service to farmers and at speeding up payments.  Indeed, a spokesman for the Department said that the move involves the introduction of a high-tech computerised system aimed at reducing errors.  However, local staff point out that past delays were due to lack of staff at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> The IFA livestock chairman, Mr. Richard Booth, recently criticised the plan and said that the Department should bring their services closer to the farmer rather than centralise, particularly in the light of the extra complications associated with the plethora of form filling under the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  In <i>The Kerryman</i> this week the local IFA President said that this proposal, if implemented, will adversely affect up to 10,000 farmers throughout Kerry who previously processed their applications through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry office in Tralee.  This move will cause great inconvenience to farmers throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have represented people with problems relating to beef premia are aware that the local Departmental staff help farmers complete application forms and so on.  If a problem arises farmers have only to go into their local Department office.  In Kerry that office is in Tralee.  If the process is centralised in Portlaoise will farmers be expected to telephone with every query and wait for an answer, thus adding greatly to their telephone expenses?  It is not unusual to be kept waiting for five to ten minutes while someone checks a file. For instance, how will the Portlaoise office correlate files relating to TB with headage payment files for the purpose of sorting out invalid tag ownership, ages of animals etc?</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out also that under the area aid scheme farmers will want to know exactly how many livestock units they have applied for before completing suckler cow forms.  In some cases it may benefit the farmer to omit some sucklers to get the full benefit of the area aid. However, under the new system they will not know what is happening.  Herd owners applying to join the scheme for the first time will find it very difficult also.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of decentralisation.  I do not begrudge Portlaoise an office under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It is good that offices are being moved out of Dublin but what is proposed in this instance is a reversal of the whole decentralisation policy in the <Col N="1181" /> sense that it is taking services and power away from local offices, which is contrary to this Government's philosophy. In view of the hardship and confusion this move would cause for many farmers in rural Ireland I ask that it be reconsidered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform measures agreed by the Council of Ministers in December last switched the emphasis in the support system for the beef sector away from market support towards direct payments to farmers under livestock premium payments. These changes have major implications for the work levels in all the Department's offices.  In addition significant new work will arise from the implementation of the Single Market, particularly in the veterinary area.  My Department also has plans for the introduction of a major upgrading of its information technology area, including the introduction of a computerised animal movement permit system.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the very significant increase in the workload caused by all of these measures and the financial importance of these schemes to the farming community the Government allocated an additional £4.4 million in the budget to assist the Department in implementing these schemes and to undertake work in other areas.</P>
      <P>The principal changes under the Common Agricultural Policy reform involve substantial increases in rates and numbers of payments under the special beef premium and suckler cow premium, a new deseasonalisation slaughter premium, a new extensification premium and the introduction of quotas at national and/or individual farmer levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to veterinary controls, which were formerly operated in a cost effective way at the ports, the removal of frontier controls in the Single Market will necessitate the carrying out of these controls at the points of origin for exports and the points of distribution for imports. To ensure that the new system is effective, an EC Community-wide standard system of registration of holdings <Col N="1182" /> and identification of farm animals must be introduced and a computerised system of notification of live animal movements is also required.  All this work falls on the local offices.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the volume of applications under the various schemes will substantially increase in the years to come.  For example, between November 1992 and 31 March 1993 up to 250,000 applications under various schemes were received compared with fewer than 100,000 in the same period the previous year.  I expect that the total number of applications under these schemes will more than double in addition to our having to have to deal with area aid applications.  Moreover, the task of establishing individual quotas under various schemes will place a substantial burden on my Department which will have to examine thousands of individual files in order to establish the precise entitlements of farmers.  In addition, we will have to operate the arable crops scheme and the various headage payments will continue.  Overall, I expect that direct payments to farmers will exceed £650 million by 1995.</P>
    <P>My Department has reviewed the staffing levels and the overall operations of the local offices and it is clear that the radical Common Agricultural Policy reform measures, with a substantial increase in applications and the Single Market requirements, cannot be accommodated with existing staffing levels and structures.  Therefore, it is our intention to increase the numbers of staff in the local offices and in the existing central office in Castlebar.  It has also been decided that the payments under the special beef premium and slaughter premium schemes should be centralised in a special unit in Portlaoise as soon as accommodation can be provided.  This was decided after careful consideration of all options available and I believe it to be the best option having regard to the staffing and accommodation resources available to the Department.</P>
    <P>This centralisation achieves certain economies of scale which would not be available if the resources were dissipated throughout all of the local offices.  I <Col N="1183" /> should emphasise that, with the exception of these two schemes, all other services will remain in the local offices and indeed the inspections under these schemes will continue to be a function of local field staff.  Not only will we retain the existing structures but, as I have indicated, we will be augmenting the numbers attached to many of the offices.</P>
    <P>The various issues raised by the Department's proposals are under discussion with the various staff associations concerned.  I would appeal for their cooperation in ensuring the continuation of <Col N="1184" /> an effective service to the farming community. I would also like to assure the various farming bodies that my Department is committed to providing an effective service and that every facility will be provided to ensure that the new arrangements will operate smoothly.  What really matters is that farmers receive their grants as soon as possible after applying. That is the only reason for the proposed rationalisation I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 April 1993.</P>

      <P>Exchequer grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte for 1993 is £22.304 million, including £0.5 million in respect of capital development work.  In addition, the board expects to generate another £4.5 million in income which will also go towards its annual budget, giving a total budget for 1993 of £26.804 million.</P>
      <P>The total number employed by Bord Fáilte at 31 March 1993 was 276.  Bord Fáilte estimates that its total pay budget for 1993 is £10.071 million &mdash; £9.871 million of which will be met from the grant-in-aid and £0.2 million from its own resources.  A sum of £1.218 million is allocated towards the pay bill of the regional tourism organisations and £1 million towards superannuation.  Therefore, wages including superannuation, of Bord Fáilte employees account for £8.8 million.</P>
      <P>The board is also responsible under a global contract agreement with the European Commission for the disbursement this year of £23.216 million European Regional Development Fund assistance for a number of tourism development and promotional projects around the country, and for the disbursement of £1.381 million from the International Fund for Ireland for the promotion and development of tourism in the Border counties.</P>

      <P>In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic as the sole legal government of China.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will know work on this project has been suspended pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court on whether the Office of Public Works require planning permission for this development.  No decision will be <Col N="1154" /> taken on whether or not to continue with this project until the Supreme Court's decision is available.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a firm indication of the various operation costs that may be incurred should the visitor centre be completed.  The operation costs of other centres under the control of the Office of Public Works are met from the overall budget allocated for the management of the property generally. Monitoring and maintenance costs for the visitor centre would arise regardless of where the centre is located.  These costs would vary considerably depending on a number of factors, for example the materials used, the design, usage, etc. rather than on the location chosen.  There is no evidence that these costs would be significantly different if the proposed development was sited in a town or village nearby.</P>
    <P>The location of a visitor centre cannot be considered solely on direct costs.  The centre, to be effective, must try to achieve access objectives.  The management of visitor access is essential in order to ensure that conservation objectives are achieved.  On-site visitor facilities can contribute positively to the conservation of a natural heritage site such as the Burren National Park in a way that is not possible if those facilities are provided in towns and villages.  Visitors to the proposed centre can experience something of the essential quality of the park in a situation where it is possible to channel their movements to prevent undesirable impacts on it.  I would like to point out also that the proposed visitor centre and treatment plant has been approved by the local authority and complies will all the relevant EC Directives. Plants in existing villages do not all meet the same standard.</P>
    <P>The cost of consultancy fees in connection with the treatment/effluent aspects of the visitor centre amounts to £39,344.00.  The results of the investigations will be of benefit also in the management and protection of the park's natural resources.</P>

      <Quest>if she has considered the possibility of locating a courthouse in the northern suburbs of Dublin in order to make the courts more accessible and, in particular, to cut down on Garda time attending city centre courts where there is a real problem in the scheduling of cases to minimise the loss of Garda time.</Quest>

      <P>I have yet to be convinced that whatever financial advantages might accrue in terms of saving Garda time would outweigh the capital and other costs of building a courthouse in the northern suburbs of Dublin.  Moreover, it is by no means certain that there would be a saving in Garda time because the <Col N="1156" /> current centralised courts minimise the necessity for Garda to travel between various court locations to present their cases.</P>
      <P>There are a number of pressing demands from local authorities for funds for the refurbishment of existing court-houses, some of which are in poor condition. These remain the priority for the disbursement of capital funds for court-houses.</P>

It would be counter-productive to give details of these measures other than to say that they involve a combination of Garda operational measures and co-operation with the business community together <Col N="1157" /> with close contact with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>

The malfunction of this computer would be a very rare occurrence and, if it did happen, would be unlikely to delay processing for more than a few hours.  Therefore it would not delay payments and would not cause hardship to applicants.

I understand that, while the company's financial performance in 1992 was better than budgeted, this situation resulted from a number of favourable once-off developments.  Notwithstanding this performance, An Post still has accumulated losses of almost £14 million and the company's underlying problem of high operating costs remains.</P>

    <P>In accordance with a formula drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission last year, which identified certain priority recovery measures and also provided for negotiations on further measures at a later stage, detailed management/union negotiations on the priority measures have been taking place.  These measures include a transfer of overnight transport of mail from rail to road, introduction of single daily deliveries of mail in Dublin and provincial cities and the introduction of a new automated mails centre in Dublin, to replace the existing manually operated Central Sorting Office.  The negotiations are now at an advanced stage.  I understand that the Labour Relations Commission has agreed to provide urgent assistance in the completion of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the current negotiations and the introduction of resultant priority recovery measures, An Post proposes to enter into further negotiations with the unions as envisaged by the Labour Relations Commission's formula.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the industrial action referred to by the Deputy which has resulted in the withdrawal of social work support from homeless young people in the 16-18 year age group who are not previously known to the board.  However, I should point out that the two emergency hostels for the young homeless in Dublin are unaffected and homeless young people continue to have access to them.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board is seeking a further meeting with the trade union concerned with a view to resolving the dispute.  I sincerely hope that there will be an early resolution of the dispute and that normal services will be resumed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of the special allocations of £1 million and £2 million set aside in the budgets of 1991 and 1992, respectively, for the development of child care services has been used to develop new services and facilities for homeless children around the country.</P>
      <P>Over 40 extra hostel and other residential places for homeless youngsters have been developed in the Dublin area where the problem of youth homelessness is mainly concentrated.  An additional 30 places have been developed outside the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new developments initiated in the <Col N="1168" /> Eastern Health Board area to assist homeless children include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new emergency hostel providing 10 places for homeless girls at Sherrard House, Dublin 1;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new therapeutic unit for eight difficult adolescents (boys and girls) operated by the Eastern Health Board near Naas, County Kildare;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new residential unit for 10 boys operated by the Los Angeles Society in Dalkey;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the hostel for homeless boys at Percy Place run by the Catholic Social Service Conference has been re-located to refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street resulting in an increase from 10 to 12 in the number of places;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a new after-care service for up to four boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of an &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; social work service to deal exclusively with the young homeless;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a &ldquo;Carers for Young People Scheme&rdquo; to provide family care for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the recruitment of families to take young adolescents into their homes on an emergency basis;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of other short term accommodation such as digs, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is currently involved in negotiations with a number of voluntary groups in relation to the development of further residential facilities for homeless children.</P>
    <P>Provision for the full year cost of the various new service developments for homeless children initiated during 1991 and 1992 is included in the Eastern Health Board's 1993 allocation.</P>

    <P>National data on detailed age groups over 65 is not yet available from the 1991 Census.  Accordingly, it is not possible to calculate the percentage of the population within the age groups specified who hold medical cards.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. However, I do not think that it is justifiable to grant an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any particular group without reference to their means.</P>

      <P>A grant of £1.3 million has been allocated for the refurbishment and upgrading of Santry Stadium under my Department's multi-annual capital programme for the provision of major sports facilities which is funded from the proceeds of the national lottery.  The project includes the refurbishment of the athletic track and infield playing pitch, provision of a 1000 seat spectator stand, dressing rooms and an indoor synthetic training track.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the track refurbishment and associated works have recently been received from the consultants commissioned by Dublin County Council, who are the clients for the project.  The tenders for the spectator stand and associated buildings are presently under consideration by the consultants and their report and recommendation will shortly be submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>It is expected that construction work on the project will commence during the summer and be completed by early 1994.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Mary's national school, Saggart, County Dublin, there were 105 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1991.  The enrolment warranted a staff of principal plus 3 assistants.  The school also has the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>There were 92 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus 2 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  An enrolment of at least 94 pupils was required on that date in order to retain the post of third assistant for 1993-94.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. <Col N="1173" /> If the school authorities feel that the school might qualify for the retention of the post of third assistant under either of these exceptions, my Department would be happy to examine the position on receipt of details.</P>
