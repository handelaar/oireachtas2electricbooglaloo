      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton. I now call on Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate the specific and urgent matter of the stance taken to date by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in agreeing to a GATT deal which involves unmitigated and quantifiable losses for Irish Agriculture, with no balancing or compensating benefits to that sector, and noting the contrast between this and the stance of the French Government which has won specific compensating benefits for its farmers, notably in the cereal sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having fully considered the matter I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the Standing Order.  Accordingly, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are thousands of family farmers who would not agree with <Col N="1838" /> that decision.  Their livelihoods will be ruined by the present agreement and nothing is being done about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 17, 7, 13, 14 and 3.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted not later than 11.30 p.m.; (2) Nos. 17 and 7 shall be decided without debate and if a division is demanded on No. 7 it shall be taken forthwith; (3) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment; (4) the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m.; (5) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 3 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; and (6) Private Members' Business shall be No. 16 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree, in view of the Ceann Comhairle's <Col N="1839" /> decision not to allow my motion on the GATT deal, to give Government time to this matter?  There are many people in rural Ireland who feel that they are the first victims of the damage done to Ireland's reputation in Europe by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in regard to the £7.2 billion controversy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a country very dependent on trade it is important to have a GATT deal, nonetheless it would be a good idea if the Government provided time tommorrow, or at some stage before the weekend, to discuss Ireland's position in regard to GATT.  If the Government was agreeable to that request I would be happy to agree to the Order of Business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had quite a debate on this amendment on Committee Stage.  The issues that arise in relation to this amendment will arise later when we come to debate amendments dealing with the provision of school meals and the arrangements to be made with regard to school attendance. Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is unique in that it is inheriting structures from the former county council and the former borough council and is <Col N="1856" /> therefore inheriting county council structures geared to rural dwellers and urbanoriented borough corporation traditions. The law applying to rural areas is different from that applying to urban areas, for example, different social welfare arrangements apply for the payment of unemployment assistance, fuel vouchers and so on.  Admittedly, a great many of the differences have been eliminated but throughout the range of legislation based on local government boundaries it is possible there are measures which are applied differently in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill that the law which applies to county councils will apply to the three new county councils. That is fine as far as it goes and I have no dispute with it.  What I am disputing is the cutting off of the law that applies to the old borough corporation area.  The citizens of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown who had benefited from the fact that they lived in what was defined as urban areas should continue to carry those entitlements when the new county council area is established.</P>
    <P>The specific area where it will arise immediately is in relation to school attendance and school meals.  There are provisions on school attendance and schools meals later in the Bill that provide for a red circle arrangement for the old borough area, something that we will hotly debate.  It is not acceptable that in the new county council area one law applies to one part of the county and another law applies elsewhere in the county.  It is very difficult to explain to members of the public that children attending school on one side of the road will get school meals because the school is located in what was previously the borough corporation area, whereas a school on the other side of the road will not be entitled to avail of school meals because the school is located in the former county council area.  In the former county council area school attendance is within the remit of the gardaí whereas in the borough area school attendance is governed by school attendance Acts administered by school attendance officers.</P>
    <P>The rural areas have been developed <Col N="1857" /> and it is very hard to distinguish the old boundaries.  It was possible until now to explain why a child on one side of the boundary was getting school meals and a child across the road was not by informing them of the outdated local authority boundaries from the 19th century which were in the process of being changed, and that on 1 January 1994 we would have a new county council so that the same entitlements would apply right across the county.  We find in a later section in the Bill that this is not to be. When pressed on that point during the course of the Committee Stage the Minister explained that entitlements such as school meals, school attendance arrangements and so on could not be extended outside of the old borough area because of section 11 of this Bill applying the county law to all three counties.  I accept that there may be a drafting issue here and I am open to correction by the Minister on that, but the principle that the urban local government law should also apply in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area should be accepted.  If it is not, there will be loss of entitlement for people living in what was the old borough area or we will continue a dual system for school meals and school attendance which is not acceptable and will be greatly resented by the public and by the members of the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>I spoke strongly on this issue on Committee Stage and I am disappointed that the Minister has not come back with a response.  I am putting the issue again very strongly because it is an important matter not just for the recipients of the entitlements but for public credibility in this project.  Public credibility in this project will be seriously undermined if at the end of the day, despite what we have said about reorganisation of local government and the elimination of these old boundaries, the anomaly most visible to people &mdash; whether or not a child gets a school meal and whether or not school milk is provided in a school on Loughlinstown but not in Ballybrack &mdash; continues to exist.  People will wonder what it was all <Col N="1858" /> about if the same thing applies after 1 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I have tabled a number of amendments pertaining to this.  There was much discussion yesterday about identity and the naming of the councils, yet when we come to talk about what actually happens in a new county area we are starting off on the wrong foot.  The new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council will have one law for part of an area and a different one for another part.  Sallynoggin is a specific area readily identifiable within the county.  One part of Sallynoggin will benefit from school meals and another part will not.  Children who play with one another but go to different schools will have different facilities available.  The coming together of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has been a difficult process on which councillors, officials and the manager have worked very hard.  If we pursue the line the Minister wishes in this Bill, we will be starting from a negative base and it will be difficult to explain why there is discrimination in the provision of school meals and school attendance facilities.  Matters such as school meals, school attendance facilities and weights and measures should apply in the same manner to the whole county.</P>
      <P>My colleague will support me when I say that the word &ldquo;borough&rdquo; should disappear from this Bill.  As far as we are concerned as and from 1 January the notion of a borough is dead and we do not want to carry baggage into the future.</P>
      <P>It would be within the powers of the council to decide on the measures it should follow in relation to school meals and school attendance facilities but to have the new county council split in two as it would be on these issues would be a very negative beginning.  It is something the Minister should re-examine and if he is not happy with the wording of the amendment he should indicate that he will reconsider this amendment in the Seanad in order to take on board the arguments genuinely made by councillors from the area.</P>

      <P>I was not going to speak on this as I am not from the Dún Laoghaire area and I thought that on Report Stage an alternative would be a foregone conclusion.  I am surprised that the Minister has no alternative and seems set against resolving this problem.</P>
      <P>There are already a sizeable number of problems with this reorganisation, some unnecessary and some inevitable.  The Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown area, like other areas will have to get used to a different orientation, from coming into O'Connell Street to gravitating towards Dún Laoghaire.  There will be questions of access for the public.</P>

      <P>That is very unfortunate because the county and the city are now quite homogeneous in many ways in terms of transport and other issues which we face.  The lack of co-operation will also be a factor because of the traditional borough and county division in the area in question.  I would urge the Minister to offer some resolution to this historic problem which has been well defined in many of the measures that have developed separately in the two areas.</P>
      <P>Cities such as Budapest and other areas outside of Ireland have had to come together for historical and legislative reasons.  The Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown area will have to come together and work as one.  Any barrier to that co-operation, especially unnecessary barriers which can be overcome should be dealt with immediately before the administration is officially in place.  I urge the Minister not to force this to a vote as it will be seen as a bad omen for the start of the county.</P>

      <P>I have concerns in regard to this section and with the fact that the Minister, Deputy Smith, did not respond to the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  I have concerns also in regard to the amendment because it does not go <Col N="1860" /> far enough in giving equal treatment to all children in the greater Dublin area, particularly in regard to school meals. The amendment proposes to remove the nominal boundary provided for in the legislation between what was the borough area and the remainder of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county, providing that within what was the borough area the school meals programme would continue but would not be extended outside that area.  If school meals are provided for children in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, what will happen to children attending schools on the boundaries between Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin?  It appears there is no intention of including them in the school meals programme.  There is much more involved than the anomaly which will exist following the establishment in the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It is a question of treating children in all county council areas equally.</P>
      <P>The school meals programme is important, particularly for disadvantaged areas, but it should operate in all county council areas in Dublin and, indeed, throughout the country.  It is my understanding that the programme operates mainly in urban areas.  The amendment would extend the borough school meals programme to the entire Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area.  Would it not be logical to extend it to children in the South Dublin and Fingal County Council areas?  This matter is causing confusion and is an example of the Minister not considering fully the legislation and the knock-on effects of abolishing the Dún Laoghaire Borough area in terms of school meals, school attendances and other anomalies which may arise as a result of functions of the borough area being taken over by the new county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy with the Minister's proposals. He is taking an easy way out and did not give sufficient time or consideration to resolving the anomaly which will arise following the establishment of three new county councils in the greater Dublin area.  This amendment would perpetuate the anomaly by including more <Col N="1861" /> children in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area but children in Fingal and South Dublin would not be treated in an equal manner to those in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The provisions are a mess and the Minister has failed to meet the concerns articulated on Committee Stage.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment may go one step towards meeting those concerns, but its provisions would move the anomaly to the borders of the county rather than treating all children in the greater Dublin area equally.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> This amendment proposes to vest in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council those functions currently vested by law in Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  I am anxious that the new bodies function fully as county councils and for that reason section 11 (2) provides that the new county councils shall have the functions which are vested by law in county councils generally.  Furthermore, the local authority legislative code differs somewhat in its application to county councils and borough councils in respect of the law relating to meetings and procedures of local authorities, boundary alterations, application for change in the number of members and other minor matters.</P>
      <P>The majority of this legislation dates back to the 19th century.  The extension of the law as it currently applies in the borough area to the new county council area would inevitably lead to conflict and confusion as to the correct statutory provision to be followed.  The amendment, therefore, cannot be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not always agree with Deputy Doyle's comments, but extending the <Col N="1862" /> school meals programme to include only the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area would create problems. It would raise questions as to whether children in the Wicklow County Council area should be entitled to school meals.  The matter needs to be considered on a wider basis.  The Ministers for Social Welfare and Education have an input in this area and the matter should be considered on a national scale.  We do not have the power to deal with the matter today because the operation and funding of school meals is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and the operation and funding of school attendance provisions is a matter for the Minister for Education.  I do not wish to see the school meals programme operating for one school in an area and not for another.  Neither would it be acceptable to extend the programme to one county council area and not nationally.  I suggest that we ask the Minister for Education to consider the matter in the review that is taking place in regard to local educational structures.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, could also be asked to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 39 gives powers to other Ministers to make regulations.  I hope common sense will prevail with the Minister for Social Welfare.  He may not want a school in, say, Sallynoggin getting free meals and a school down the road not getting them.  Perhaps we could prevail on him to consider extending the scheme.</P>

At present the programme operates in urban and disadvantaged areas, but there are many large schools in rural areas to which the school meals programme should apply. The matter should be considered by the <Col N="1863" /> three Ministers involved and not under this legislation.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to address the provision in section 12 which effectively puts a cap on the membership of the three new local authorities, irrespective of population change or any other consideration.  While Deputy Gilmore made a specific recommendation in terms of the number of members with effect from the next elections, the substantive point is important.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State knows I mean no disrespect in saying it is disappointing for Opposition parties that the Minister is not present.  I would have expected him to respond to this type of argument.  I am not concerned about the figures which are agreed, but there ought not be a cap on membership.</P>
    <P>While some people may say this is an improvement in the context of the existing Dublin County Council, if we look at the ratios we will see that in County Leitrim, for example, there is one councillor for every 1,200 citizens whereas in <Col N="1864" /> the case of the three new county councils there will be one councillor for every 6,500 citizens.  I think the average works out at one councillor for every 2,500 citizens and that in a large urban area such as Limerick the ratio is 1: 3,000-3,500. Therefore there is a serious imbalance.</P>
    <P>Many experts on local government would argue &mdash; I am not arguing this &mdash; that we should have one representative per 1,200 people, which is the case in County Leitrim, for many reasons.  They envisage a different kind of local government system.  That is probably the extreme and in an urban area this may not be practicable.  Let us take, as an example, the Glencullen ward in County Dublin, where there are three elected members.  As it happens three new members were elected at the last election. It has a population which is greater than that of County Leitrim, but despite this only three members are elected.  The projections are that the population of this area will be 10,000 greater at the time the next local government elections are held. Therefore, it is completely unreasonable to put a cap on the number of members &mdash; three &mdash; elected in that area.  The projections are realistic, assuming that the county development plan is agreed later this week.  Provision has been made for a large number of extra dwellings in that beautiful part of County Dublin purely in the interests of employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The position therefore is that the population of this electoral ward is the equivalent to that of County Leitrim, that it is projected to increase by 10,000 between now and the date of the next local government elections and that the Minister is seeking to put a cap on the number of local representatives at three.  This does not make sense and I do not think any argument can be advanced in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of reasoned amendment that one would expect the Minister of State to respond to.  I hope he will be able to do so, because I cannot see any <Col N="1865" /> sense in engaging in what Deputy Keogh referred to in her speech on Second Stage as local government reorganisation rather than local government reform &mdash; nonetheless it is a step forward &mdash; and then restricting us in this fashion.  Incidentally, I did not pick Glencullen because it was a particular case; the ward I represent, Tallaght-Oldbawn, is larger. Having regard to the industry of Dublin county councillors, it will be much larger when the next local elections are held. Therefore this argument can be applied across the county, not just to Glencullen.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State say if the purpose of the Bill is to terminate the ludicrous situation whereby councillors completely unconnected with one part of the county make decisions for that part of the county?  We are trying to terminate that phenomenon.  It is illogical to proceed in the way the Minister of State suggests.  We have seen this at its most spectacular during the course of the debate on the county development plan when the Minister's party, as in so many other things, led the charge.  The arrangement is that one always gives freedom to the local councillor to vote with the people provided he rows in with the majority in his party when it comes to a different part of the county.  While not all of the rezoning decisions were bad, a small number were exceptionally bad. This is allowed to happen because local councillors are exempt in their own areas provided they vote in favour of rezoning elsewhere in the county.  We should bring this to an end; there should be direct accountability.  In having three members for a part of the county with a population the equivalent of County Leitrim, we are minimising accountability.  I therefore ask the Minister at this late stage to respond positively.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-ups about the wording of Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  If the Minister has an alternative wording which would leave the matter open in terms of future local elections this would be perfectly acceptable.  Deputy Gilmore has produced a particular ratio but it is not sacrosanct.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has raised some important issues which were discussed on Committee Stage.  The question of representation, the ratio of public representatives to the general public and the urban-rural divide need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner.  On the basis of the figures presented by Deputy Rabbitte the amendment does not address the imbalance in the greater Dublin area.  It has been suggested that the new South Dublin County Council, which will service an area with a population of 205,000, should have 33 councillors and that the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which will serve an area with a population of 185,000, should have 35 councillors.  This in itself would not address the imbalance.</P>
      <P>Given the projected increase in the size of the population, I hope that in the context of the new legislation which will be introduced next year a new mechanism will be put in place to deal with the matter in a comprehensive manner, not only in respect of the South Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils but right across the board, to allow public representatives and through them the public at large, not only in rural areas but also in the greater Dublin area, to make an input.  While, there is a need to deal with this issue, the amendment, as I said, would not resolve the problem.  Nonetheless it merits consideration and discussion.  Given the projected population increase in the greater Dublin area, there is a need for flexibility in the future and to put a new mechanism in place so that councillors would know where they stand rather than wait for the Minister to introduce regulations.</P>

      <P>Whatever about the numbers suggested by Deputy Gilmore, I support the spirit of the amendment.  It is disappointing that the Minister of State has been negative or, at best, non-committal about issues we have raised. Deputy Rabbitte referred to rezoning that took place in the recent past, not all of it bad.  I am beginning to wonder if there is not method in the madness of some councillors <Col N="1867" /> and perhaps the Minister's party is leading him by giving him an indication that there will be more people for them to represent and that he should look at other numbers of councillors involved. However, I do not know if they were that far seeing.  I would certainly take on board the question of imbalance between the three new counties.  I have no hang-ups about the representation in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and agree that any examination of representation in the future would have to take notice of the fact that there will be considerable expansion in the new Fingal county because of the amount of rezonings that took place there and the increased population.</P>
      <P>How local should local democracy be? It is important that there be accountability on the part of the elected representatives. Deputy Rabbitte referred to the ratio of population to councillors and the Minister's response to this on Committee Stage was not adequate. Does the Minister have any more information? On Committee Stage the Minister spoke vaguely about a forthcoming Local Government Bill.  I want to know exactly what the Minister has in mind in regard to the re-jigging of the structures of local government.  Representation on the three new county councils will not be adequate and it is unfortunate that such representation is to be limited.  That would not be good for democracy.  We should have a firm indication from the Minister that something specific would be done, not vague generalities or aspirations about the future.  A precise indication of exactly where we are going is required to answer the case that has been made to him a number of times about future representation.</P>

      <P>We should not let the importance of the real issue in this amendment escape us.  Yesterday I read a quote in <i>The Irish Times</i> that I heard before but had forgotten.  Dr. Tom Garvan echoed Tip O'Neill when he said that in the final analysis all democratic politics is local politics.  Given that most of us have come to national politics <Col N="1868" /> through local government, there is tremendous truth in that generalisation. It emphasises the importance of the amendment before us which is aimed at ensuring optimum representation at local level, not too many councillors and not too few.  There is obviously an optimum ratio which gives the people access to local government through their own locally elected representatives who understand the problems and needs of their area, bring them back to the table at council meetings and truly represent the people who elect them to do so.</P>
      <P>The mover of the amendment said he was not particularly hung up on numbers, but the message of the amendment is that the ratio is all wrong.  In Leitrim the ratio is 1:1,200 compared with 1:6,500 which is the proposed representation on the three new councils.  In Wexford the ratio is 1:5,000.  This begs the question whether we should not have incorporated the concept of support for local government in our Constitution.  It is an issue that is raised in the debating Chamber and in newspapers.  It is never followed through. Perhaps because we have had reason to hold referendums on many other issues, this never reached the top of the pile. The lack of protection of local government and the lack of prominence in our Constitution of the concept of local democracy results in the problem the amendment seeks to address.  Representation at national level and the number of Deputies in a Dáil constituency are tied into the Constitution. We talk about tolerance levels and set up commissions to move boundaries and make the geography fit the number of Deputies or, as we have done on one or two occasions, increase the number of Deputies in this House when it was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing representation at local council level is at the mercy of the business load on the agenda of any Minister for the Environment.  The promised legislation dealing with local government reform is to be through both Houses, the Dáil and the Seanad, by the end of March, although it has not been printed yet.  Given that the budget takes up most <Col N="1869" /> of February, that is quite an optimistic target.  However, assuming the Bill is passed by both Houses, can the Minister indicate whether the concerns expressed in this amendment will be dealt with in this legislation?  If, having exceeded an agreed tolerance level councils could increase their number or, conversely, decrease them, we would be more satisfied that the ratio was correct and that there was an accepted legal tolerance which, when reached, would trigger an increase in representation through whatever the legal mechanism the Minister may bring in.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the mover of the amendment is asking that the Minister recognise that the proposed number of members on the three new councils in the Dublin area is inadequate to properly represent the needs of the local population within these county councils.  We want recognition by the Minister that all politics is local politics and that it is critical that we get the ratio correct so that people really have access to their local government.</P>
    <P>In this context also, lest anyone think I am just delaying the House or being mischievous in any way, we are about to introduce a new tier government on 1 January and we are doing this without a word of debate, without even a discussion on the concept.  It flies in the face of the concept of democracy that we should do it.  There has been no debate about the ratio of representation from the county councils to that regional authority or on the functions of that regional authority. Particularly, there has been no debate about the Greater Dublin Authority which most of us agree is necessary because of the need for strategic planning and general co-ordination of the public service role, given the size of the area we are talking about with four local authorities now in the greater Dublin area. We have no idea what the Minister has in mind in terms of the concept of regional government.  It is incredible.  It is beyond belief that we should actually introduce a new tier of government in our country without debate.  What has gone wrong? Does that much abused expression <Col N="1870" />&ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; mean anything?  Has the size of the majority of this Government gone so much to their heads that they think they can just issue diktats saying that something is happening and that there will be no debate, no discussion and they do not want to know our views?</P>
    <P>If we believe in local democracy, local government, the people having access to their representatives and the people's views being brought to the table, we must debate the introduction of a new tier of government here.  In the context of the ratios outlined in the amendment a detailed debate on the role of the new tier of government to be introduced on 1 January should take place before the Christmas recess.  The Minister may say it is not possible to meet the 1 January deadline and that it might be extended to 1 March.  The Minister should at least tell us what is happening.</P>
    <P>The county councils being established under this legislation, together with Dublin Corporation, will represent a large proportion of the people.  The Dublin regional authority will be an important piece of the jigsaw in making the legislation a success.  We do not know what numbers from South Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will be represented on that regional authority or what their role will be in representing those who elected them.  The Minister should let us know what is in his mind in terms of the legislation dealing with the reform of local government, if there will be a degree of tolerance in that regard, the ratio of representation and if there will be a trigger mechanism to increase numbers in areas if the population shift so demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give the House an assurance that there will be a debate on the introduction of a new tier of government here before the commencement date for the establishment of the new local authorities.  He should indicate the representation from South Dublin, Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown on the Dublin Regional Authority and how the concept we are discussing today will be tied together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a follow through in relation to local government reform and it requires attention.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. The responsibility for representing a large population in Dublin and an increased population in the future is a consequence of many of the votes on rezonings.  Fianna Fáil has had a strong hand to play in that responsibility given its numbers of elected representatives. Fine Gael has also been meticulous in this area as well as some Progressive Democrat councillors.  Local government reform must take account of the large numbers living in the county council areas and other criteria, such as economic factors.  In the wider scheme of things common justice must prevail.</P>
      <P>If councillors from the various parties will be responsible for the welfare of new born babies and children in their respective areas, their responsibility is somewhat similar to that of parenthood.  They have, in a sense, a duty to follow through the responsibilities of a parent by providing representation and participation in local government.  We are seeking to provide for that level of responsibility. The large population in Dublin will increase, but the authority will have a lesser accountability because of a smaller proportionate number of councillors. The amendment is welcome as it seeks to address that position.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of a councillor's motivation to seek to have a local authority represent an increased population. That position gave rise to this amendment. A councillor who considered the proposals for rezoning in his area told me he was adamant and enthusiastic that his bailiwick should represent a larger population because he was popular in that area.  He would have a greater chance of securing a seat the next time around if rezoning occurred in that area.  That is not a good reason for making planning decisions and that sentiment should not be condoned.  The local population should be proportionately represented and account should be taken of an increase in the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party hold a motto of <Col N="1872" />&ldquo;thinking globally and acting locally&rdquo;.  It is important that acting locally is still possible.  The Green Party, which has only one or two councillors, represents a large population and inevitably, in many ways it will be denied access to the democratic process and as a result will be alienated.  The problems of alienation are present in Dublin and elsewhere.  The argument that Leitrim has a small population should not be taken at face value. The idea of local democracy is as much to do with the area one lives in and the responsibilities of a local authority to an area do not stop with human welfare.</P>
    <P>The agenda that must be addressed at local authority level is one which covers the area not only the population.  We are not dealing with headage payments.  This amendment does not represent the beginning and end of local government reform but a follow-through approach.  It is proposed as a result of activities some of which were brought about by councillors, by economic factors, or economic mismanagement, which has resulted in the population increase in Dublin.  I hope the example of the postponement of a by-election, where people have been without an elected representative for some time, will not be repeated in the area of local government.  The amendment provides an opportunity for the Minister to reinstate some goodwill in the area of local reform for the sake of democracy.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The membership proposed in the Bill coincides with that of the existing area committees, a membership provided for under section 13 (2) of the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985.

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This is a matter for consideration and decision in the first instance by the relevant local authorities and local elected representatives <Col N="1873" /> should make the first move. Article 25 of the Local Government Act, 1988, allows a county council to make an application to the Minister for the Environment to alter the number of members.  A public inquiry must be held and the Minister may then make an order altering the membership.  The Minister will consider any representation which will be made in the future in this regard. In 1979 such an order was made altering the membership of Dublin County Council to 36 following an application submitted by the council.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate on the amendment.  The importance of local politics must be recognised in all debates. As Deputy Doyle and other politicians have said, &ldquo;all politics is local politics&rdquo;, and most Members came up through the local system.  There are anomalies in relation to the membership of county councils.  County councils vary in size. There have been geographic changes in the move of population from rural to urban centres.</P>
      <P>There was a debate in Wexford County Council about the possibility of increasing the number of members but a decision in that regard appears to have been put on the back burner.  I believe it has not been addressed because Fianna Fáil believed that if the number of members were increased, Fine Gael might secure a seat and Fine Gael believed that if the number was increased Fianna Fáil might secure one or two extra seats.  Deputy Doyle suggested that this matter be considered in the proposed Local Government Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's response because a very cogent case has been made for alteration to section 12.  There is support for Deputy Gilmore's amendment, not only among all parties in Opposition, but Deputy Ryan of the Labour Party also supports it.  I suspect that is also the position of the Minister's party.  We cannot seriously make law based on the reality of local political advantage, on whether Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil wins an extra seat in Wexford.  I am sure this was uppermost in the minds of Wexford councillors when they were discussing this matter, but it is not something to be imported to national Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a reason for going ahead with local government reform.  The Minister made no argument against the amendment apart from saying that a recommendation in this regard was not made by the area committees operating in Dublin County Council or by Dublin County Council itself.  That is probably true, although I do not know how they could have done so since they did not see the legislation.  For a long time Dublin county councillors have accepted that the members elected in 1991 would constitute the three new councils.  It is not a formidable argument that the local <Col N="1875" /> area committees did not make a recommendation in this regard.  Many matters were not discussed by the local area committees and Dublin County Council.  For example, I do not recall discussing the implications of this provision for the GAA.  I am not a member of the committee that processed this Bill on Committee Stage and I do not know if this matter was referred to but it raises an interesting question in terms of whether there will be three county teams in the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I am not particularly anxious to import this matter into any of the new counties in Dublin.  Referees are relatively safe in County Dublin despite the views on petty crime in certain areas of the county.  This is a real question and I imagine that a great many young footballers and hurlers in Dublin who cannot manage to get their place in the first 15 would be very interested in a position where there are three county teams, considering that the population in each county would be far in excess of that in most counties.  As I said, many matters were not discussed by Dublin County Council but no doubt they will be discussed in the future.  The argument by the Minister is not a reason for not responding in a positive fashion to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined certain figures in making the argument for this amendment.  Deputy Doyle has drawn my attention to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 December by Michael O'Reagan, one of that newspaper's reporters in this House.  In the course of referring to the work by Dr. Tom Garvin on the question of local democracy in this State between the years 1919 and 1922 Michael O'Reagan concludes his article by referring to the comments of Dr. Tom Barrington.  Most of <Col N="1876" /> us in this House acknowledge that Dr. Tom Barrington is the leading expert on local government, has been a lone voice for very many years arguing for a real shift to local democracy.  He argues not only in terms of the intrinsic merits of such a system but that our existing system, in addition to its other disadvantages, stifles economic development. In this article Dr. Tom Barrington is referred to as making the argument that &ldquo;the Republic is now by far the most centalised state in Western and Middle Europe&rdquo;&mdash; I quote this article in response to the Minister who said he would not dare impose on Dublin county concillors a new ratio of elected members to citizens.  The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It is 50 per cent more centralised than the European norm, with a ratio of one councillor to some 2,200 of the population.  In France, there is a councillor for every 111 of the population.</P>
    <P>In this case, the average is 6,500, a long way from the figure of 2,200 referred to by Dr. Tom Barrington.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that the Minister could not make a more positive response in the sense that this section effectively imposes a cap on the representation.  As other speakers said in supporting this amendment, I am not hung up on the question of the ratio or inserting a precise figure, but to impose a cap at this stage in an area of this country which is the most rapidly expanding in terms of membership anywhere in western Europe &mdash; major development is taking place in the greater Dublin county &mdash; and to be so inflexible and rigid is regrettable.  The spirit of the amendment ought to have been taken on board by the Minister.  I very much regret the negative nature of his reply.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 38 to 40, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a)  As soon as may be after the making of an order under section 7 the person who is to be cathaoirleach of the relevant council shall, following consultation with the area manager for that committee, fix a day, being a day not later than ten days after the establishment day, to be the day of the first meeting of that council.</P>
      <P>(b)  If for any reason the day of the first meeting of such council is not fixed, or having been fixed such meeting is not held, the meeting shall be held on such day as the Minister may fix.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This provides that the chairman of each area committee will fix the day of the first meeting of the new county council.  This will be done as soon as may be after the fixing of the establishment day, by order, under section 7.  The Minister proposes to fix 1 January 1994 as the establishment day and to make the necessary order to this effect immediately following enactment of the Bill.  The amendment is in response to amendments tabled on Committee Stage by Deputies Sargent and Gilmore.  I ask Deputy Sargent to withdraw amendment No. 17, given that his concerns have been met by amendment No. 16.</P>
      <P>The reason for specifying a period within which the first meeting has to be held is to prevent any delay in the start up of the new councils as the estimates meeting must, under a separate order already made by the Minister, be held not later than 21 January 1994.  Paragraph (3)  (b) of the amendment is purely a contingency provision to deal with unforeseen and, in all probability, unlikely circumstances &mdash; for example, death or incapacitation of councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened that the Minister of State has seen fit to amend the Bill to some extent so as to allow for greater decision making at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> Earlier the Minister of State said he was not keen to meddle in the affairs of the council.  It would be very encouraging if this was the case in all circumstances. Unfortunately, we normally see the reverse of that sentiment in legislation.</P>
    <P>Fixing the date of a meeting is not a major issue.  One of the principles of The Green Party is that decisions should be taken at the lowest effective level.  Surely we can trust councillors and their chairpersons to be of sufficient sound mind and body to fix the date of a meeting.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the extent to which the Minister will be able to meddle in the affairs of the councils under the Bill.  It should not be necessary for me to put down an amendment which proposes that a simple decision-making power should be taken out of the hands of the Minister and given back to the county councils.  It is disappointing that this type of amendment has to be put down.</P>
    <P>It was disappointing also to hear the Minister of State talk about interference, perhaps unwittingly, in other local authority matters &mdash; for example, whether pupils should get school meals, etc.  Such a matter should not even enter into the debate.  This is a matter for local authorities. If the Wicklow and South Dublin County Councils want to provide meals for pupils then they should be allowed to do so.  The Minister should not be concerned about such minor issues. There are many areas of national importance which would better occupy his mind &mdash; for example, the crisis in regard to waste.  The naming of the councils should be a matter for the councils themselves and should not be debated in this House.</P>
    <P>God forbid that any of the cathaoirligh of the councils will pass away or abscond; indeed, I hope Deputy Rabbitte will be with us for many years to come.  Paragraph (3) (b) of the amendment covers the most unlikely of events and tends to keep the bata mór of the Minister in the background.  Perhaps it is underneath the desk, but it is still there.  I am not sure that this is necessary.  I will not push this point as I regard the eventuality covered <Col N="1879" /> in paragraph (3) (b)  of the amendment to be very unlikely.</P>

The number of choices proposed in the amendment is so limited that I believe the Minister must have learned something from Henry Ford, who said that one could have any colour of car so long as it was black.  The Minister is proposing a similar limitation in this amendment.  I do not know if there is much point in having these amendments put to a vote, but I would once again point out to the Minister that there is no use in him pretending to give power to the councils if he is not genuinely going to do so.  He either gives the councils power or he does not; a half-hearted gesture is not good enough in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A chathoirleach could be ill or abroad on business or pleasure when the order fixing the establishment day is made.  If the order is made on a Monday, the agenda for the meeting will probably be posted to members on Tuesday.  Most of them will receive it on Wednesday while others, due to the vagaries of our postal system, will not receive it until Thursday and the meeting will have to be held before the following Thursdays. This is very restrictive.  Once the order fixing the establishment day of the councils is made, a meeting will have to be called within 24 or 48 hours.  What is so important about the period of ten days? Why was it decided not to give the councils 14 days within which they would have to hold a meeting.  Is there a reason which I do not understand why the meetings will have to be held instantly?  Some formalities will have to be gone through at the first meeting and the ten day period <Col N="1880" /> could be very restrictive in practice.  For example, it may not suit the relevant cathaoirleach to hold a meeting within that period.  Further consideration needs to be given to this point.</P>
      <P>Having been a junior Minister, I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has a certain brief and has been told whether to say yes or no to our amendments before he has even heard our arguments.  He does not have the liberty to make decisions on our amendments. Effectively, he is not his own man in this debate; the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, will have told him to say certain things.  As a result we are going through the performance of making cases for our amendments in the knowledge that our arguments are falling on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>If a case can be made for extending the period to 14 days, I ask the Minister not to merely read out the note he got this morning before he even heard the argument. Perhaps there is a good legal reason why the meeting must be held within ten days.  If there is, I would be glad to listen to it.  However, having been a member of a local authority for 19 years, I believe that tying a Cathaoirleach to holding the first meeting of the council within ten days could give rise to logistical difficulties.  I would give the Cathaoirligh the power to call the first meeting within 21 days so as to enable any problems which may arise to be dealt with.  I believe the Cathaoirligh would like to be present at the first meetings of the councils and I should like them to be given some latitude if they cannot attend because of illness or work.  I ask the Minister to replace the period of ten days with a period of 21 days so as to make the provision more workable and manageable.</P>

What would be the position if it was felt necessary or desirable to extend the deadline beyond 31 December in order to facilitate, for example, the making of a development plan?</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a legal challenge to the plan.  He will know also that an <i>ex parte</i> injunction has been granted to a community organisation and that no date has been set for the judicial review that has been granted by the courts.  We have scheduled Friday of this week for the final issuing of the plan after five and a half years work. If, for example, that meeting cannot go ahead or is unable to complete the plan or if it is unable to reach agreement and, apropos the earlier argument about the ratio and the number of councillors, difficulties may arise.  It is a council comprised of 78 members, and apart from the Dáil it is the largest democratic gathering in the State, it is larger than the Seanad. Difficulties may well be posed, I cannot anticipate that but having spent five and a half years working on this plan, and notwithstanding the enormous criticism it has attracted, I took the view from the outset that the plan ought to be completed. I would like to see the Minister exercise his right under the 1963 Act after certain matters in the plan and to exercise his power to change a small number of decisions but that will come only into play after the plan is made and the seal is affixed by Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens if, arising from the legal <Col N="1882" /> challenge, we are unable to proceed to completion of the plan in terms of the Minister's amendment which states that it shall be &ldquo;a day not later than ten days after the establishment day&rdquo;?  Where precisely does that leave us?  For example, what would happen if a majority of the council considered that it would take us until some date in January to complete the process?  I say this conscious of the fact that a number of councillors, including, perhaps, Deputies Gilmore and Sargent, might think it a good idea if the plan was not made having regard to the number of rezonings that are unacceptable to them.  I attended a meeting recently in my constituency where a Cabinet Minister argued it was desirable that the collapse of the plan ought to be contrived because of the number of rezonings that were unacceptable to him.  It is fair to point out to him that as a member of the Cabinet he has close access to the Minister for the Environment and no doubt will use that contact to give effect to challenge the changes he finds so unacceptable. I am sure he will do that and will tell his constituents in Tallaght that he is doing so.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> To deal with Deputy Doyle's question first, it is obvious that this amendment provides the chairman with the power to fix the first meeting of the new council and that will be done in 1994.  The first meeting of the new council will be held in 1994, not later than ten days after the establishment date, the reason being that the estimates meeting was already fixed by the Minister for 21 January.  Therefore, <Col N="1883" /> there cannot be a time lag in between. The first meeting will be ten days from the establishment date and 21 January is the date set for the estimates meeting. The Minister has made that order.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Rabbitte and others that whether the plan is adopted, with or without the Robswall rezonine, before the end of the year, in conformity with any orders made by the courts, the actual position is that a valid development plan, either the adopted plan or the current 1983 plan will be in existence on the establishment day.  Article 7 of the Second Schedule provides that whatever development plans are in operation at the end of this year become the development plans for the three new counties in so far as they relate to each area.</P>

      <P>That leaves it hanging rather dangerously.  May I ask the Minister to consider increasing the ten days to 14, if we are looking at the first fortnight in January which is what he is saying.  I do not see why the Minister cannot give a little latitude to the three councils to gather their members.  Will the Minister simply say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  It is an important issue and a very important point has arisen from Deputy Rabbitte's last contribution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are related and amendment No. 20 is an alternative to No. 19.  Is it agreed that amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 20 be discussed together?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 17, line 14, after &ldquo;transfer.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Every post held by such an employee shall be deemed to become a post under the county council to which its holder is so designated or <Col N="1884" /> deemed to be so designated for transfer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said, I was not a member of the select committee that processed the Bill and I do not know how much attention this matter received.  Perhaps my colleagues are more familiar with it but an important point is being sought to be made in amendment No. 18, and amendment No. 20 is related.  This amendment seeks to insert effectively a new section or a continuation of that section that would require that every post held by such an employee shall be deemed to become a post under the county council to which its holder is so designated or deemed to be so designated for transfer.</P>
    <P>The main point in this amendment is that there is a difference in the treatment of officer grades from non-officer grades or servant grades as they were known in the past.  In other words, if there are 30 posts in the existing Dublin County Council and if, having regard to the reorganisation process that is virtually complete within Dublin County Council, there are, say, two vacancies, as I understand the Bill it requires those vacancies to be filled by whichever is the relevant new council and it protects those posts in that situation.  That presumably would mean that two new persons would be recruited in due course and the positions are protected.  However, that protection does not extend to the bulk of county council employees and it seeks to reintroduce an invidious distinction as between officer and servant grade.  In other words, one might have a situation where 30 people are working on refuse bins collections at any given depot and if there is a shortfall of two posts due to retirement, illness or whatever, there is no guarantee that those posts are protected.</P>
    <P>That is the worry in the case of what happened resulting from of the MacSharry proposals in respect of the early retirement/voluntary redundancy package introduced within the term of office of the 1987 to 1989 Government.  I suppose this would not be unique to Dublin County Council, but in the case of Dublin <Col N="1885" /> County Council, unfortunately, what happened was that those who offered to accept the severance terms were concentrated at the coal face.  In other words, it was the blue collar workers who in the main opted for redundancy.  This resulted in there being few enough takers from the white collar, professional or technical area; but in the case of the people who had to go out and implement the decisions of the council in regard to environmental works, refuse collection and so on, it was there that the &ldquo;down sliding&rdquo;, to use that dreadful term, took place.</P>
    <P>I would be worried that the position would be exacerbated by this.  I do not know why it has been found necessary to draw a distinction between officer and non-officer grades.  Essentially, the object of Deputy Gilmore's amendments, Nos. 18 and 20, is to provide a safeguard against that eventuality.</P>
    <P>In the case of Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 18, I might point out that these people are in the post already. In the case of amendment No. 20, we are talking about circumstances in which the process has begun, the jobs have been advertised, or whatever is necessary will have been completed.  It is an important point from the industrial relations point of view, from the manpower planning point of view and indeed the point of view of people who work for Dublin County Council at present.  I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Deputy Gilmore's amendments Nos. 18 and 20 relate to employees of the dissolved bodies who will transfer to the three new local authorities. First, I should like to draw Deputies' attention to section 17 (7), which applies to officers and employees. The provisions of this subsection give a clear commitment that no worsening in pay or conditions of service will arise as a result of the transfers.  Second, the position is that the arrangements for transfers have been agreed locally between management and the unions concerned.  I should like to express my appreciation to all concerned of the effort <Col N="1886" /> put in by all sides in reaching such a satisfactory conclusion.  In so far as staffing is concerned, the provisions of this Bill are limited to the arrangements for the transfer of staff from the dissolved bodies to the new local authorities.  The relevant provision in the Bill must take on board existing law relating to officers and other employees.</P>
      <P>Detailed provisions relating to officers of local authorities are contained in a number of Local Government Acts and regulations.  These include the regulation of the creation and abolition of offices, the procedures for the making of appointments, the remuneration of officers, the control of officers, their suspension and removal from office and so on.  In the case of the creation and abolition of officers, for example, the Minister's sanction is required.  It is for that reason that certain detail in relation to offices is included in the present Bill.  On the other hand, the employment of persons as local authority non-officers is governed by general legislation and practice.  Indeed, the local government legislative code does not contain any provisions in relation to posts held by such employees.  Any questions arising in relation to the creation and abolition of such posts is a matter entirely for the local authority concerned. It is for that reason that the detail contained in amendments Nos. 18 and 20 in relation to the transfer of employee posts is not considered appropriate.</P>
      <P>However, I accept that it is desirable to put beyond doubt the position of any person who may be in the course of being offered employment in a non-officer post by any of the existing local authorities on the establishment day, that is any person who is midstream, so to speak, on that day.  My amendment No. 19 will ensure that this process is completed following the establishment of the new counties, rendering it clear that on appointment such person will automatically become an employee of the local authority specified in the relevant designation of the post concerned under the 1993 regulations. My amendment No. 19 to a large extent meets the concerns expressed in Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> Deputies will appreciate that the wider, somewhat complex question of the legal and other provisions applicable to the terms and conditions of officers and employees would not be appropriate to this Bill, which in general in relation to staffing is limited to the arrangements for the transfer of staff from the dissolved bodies to the new local authorities being created.</P>

      <P>I am not endeavouring to score any point off the Minister here because I know he has not been dealing with the detailed provisions of this Bill, but when he says that he has been assured agreement has been reached at local level on these matters, I should like to believe that that is the position.  However, I have some reason to believe that that is not the position.  I would have thought that the rights of any such workers would be protected within the spirit of the legislation generally, that is, that nobody would find themselves in an inferior post with an attendant loss of income and so on.  I should like to think that that criterion would apply, that distinctions would not be drawn, leaving anybody, especially anyone with a considerable period of service with Dublin County Council, in circumstances in which they are deprived of their livelihood or whatever.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 4, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Earlier this morning we discussed the importance of getting the representation ratio correct and the importance of local democracy on the basis that all politics are local politics.  This amendment is a further extension of that principle.  The proposed representation from the three new county councils on the Eastern Health Board would leave Dubliners with a much less satisfactory ratio of representation than those in neighbouring counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. The ratio is completely out of balance with that of the neighbouring counties.  In view of the importance of proper local representation and of the need for the issues in each locality to be properly brought to the table and articulated, I consider that four representatives from each of the three new county councils would bring the ratio more in line with the other county councils that have representatives on the Eastern Health Board.  Without rehearsing the argument we had earlier about the need for the correct ratio and and the need for local representation, I ask the Minister to accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion on this and similar amendments on Committee Stage.  We are concerned here with the principle of equity.  As Deputy Doyle has rightly said the representation on the Eastern Health Board is 1:68,000 constituents whereas in the neighbouring constituency of Wicklow the ratio is <Col N="1891" /> 1:43,000 constituents.  We have said much about local democracy and and about giving power to local representatives. It seems a nonsense then to continue to curtail the representation of local representatives.  Even on the numbers game it makes sense to make the proposed change.</P>
      <P>This is a small amendment but it is a serious one which has implications for each of the new councils.  From the point of view of treating the setting up of the new councils with due seriousness, acceptance of this amendment would make enormous sense.  Also it would indicate a willingness by the Minister to listen to the local representatives as well as representatives from other areas who are concerned with equity.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree with all the politics which Tip O'Neill engaged in.  I recall reading his biography and being struck by the phrase &ldquo;all politics are local&rdquo;.  It behoves every representative to fight for democracy at its truest level. In relation to health boards it would be appropriate for the Minister to give a positive response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The effect of these amendments, which were discussed at length on Committee Stage, would be to allow each of the new councils to appoint four members to the Eastern Health Board.  Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation between them appoint six members to the health board and the proposal in the Bill provides for three members to be appointed by each of the new county councils &mdash; a 50 per cent increase in the present representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister on Committee Stage, the proposal in the Bill represents a very favourable outcome for the new councils given that the Eastern Health Board will have the highest proportion of local authority members of all the health boards.  Acceptance of the amendments tabled would further increase the level of local authority representation on the health board.  This has implications for the overall composition <Col N="1892" /> of the board with increased representation likely to be demanded by medical and other interests.</P>
    <P>The question of the effectiveness and efficient operation of a much enlarged board also arises.  Furthermore, Dublin Corporation, with an equivalent population to that of the three new councils, has seven members and would, no doubt, feel an increase in their membership was also justified.  If that were to happen the board would become unwieldy, unmanageable and unworkable.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is also preparing a national health strategy and the organisational structures in the Eastern Health Board area are under review by the Minister for Health who will introduce any required legislation.  I do not see any merit in the argument that the new councils will be underrepresented on the health board <i>vis-á-vis</i> Wicklow and Kildare.  I do not consider it appropriate to increase their level of representation above three because of the distortions it would cause and the demands it would place for greater representation from the non-local authority sector and also from, possibly, Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about a distortion, but not that referred to by the Minster.  He has referred to the combined representation of the three new councils being increased from an existing level of six to nine and stated that that was an increase of 50 per cent.  What he has omitted to tell us is that the population which these people serve has almost trebled since that level of representation was established in 1970.  When the representation was decided under the Health Act &mdash; four for Dublin Corporation and two for Dún Laoghaire Corporation &mdash; the combined population of Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire was around 200,000.  The combined population of the three new counties is of the order of 600,000 people.  We are talking about a period, during which the population has exploded and with it the health needs of the people and the demands on the health <Col N="1893" /> services.  We are talking about the huge demands on community care provided by the health boards, hospital services and medical services.</P>
      <P>When the Minister speaks about distorting the ratio of representation between public representatives and the other categories who are represented on the health boards, he is saying in effect that the people who represent the interests of the patients should have their number kept down.  The number of people to whom health services is delivered has increased enormously and with that should go a corresponding increase in the level of representation through elected representatives.  The Minister's argument does not stand up.  If he wished, he could increase the level of representation. There is nothing to stop him doing so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;other than some fixation on setting the level at three and not moving from that.  I am extremely disappointed at the way the Minister of State and the Minister have responded to the debate on this legislation.  When the Bill was published there was a general welcome for it and all Members were willing to co-operate in its passage through the House.  It was made clear that there was a number of modest improvements which the Opposition parties as well as local authority members were seeking.  Deputations from the local authorities went to see the Minister with a brief list of minor items which would have an impact on the delivery of services. There was nothing that would involve a huge cost or have a major impact on the way the Government does its business.  The deputation of local authority members asked that their representation on the health board be increased.  However, on virtually everything the Government has been asked to do, it has declined.  That is a very bad way to start out on the road to the new local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speeches on devolving functions to local authorities do not mean anything <Col N="1894" /> when a request from the local authority to increase its representation on the health boards is being turned down.  I ask the Minister to think again on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has expressed our disappointment.  The Ministerial response to this amendment is indicative of the Government's treatment of the Opposition.  The spirit of co-operation appeared to be evidence on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage when our concerns and objections were voiced not only on our own behalf but also on behalf of those deputations from the local authorities who have been to see the Minister.</P>
      <P>It would have been an indication of the Minister's generosity to accede to relatively small amendments such as this on Report Stage.  It is small in the context of the overall legislation but it is most important in terms of the representation of the consumer of health services in the Eastern Health Board area.  I do not think it is a defence to state that if he increases representation for public representatives he will have to increase the medical representation.  That does not have to be the case.  As the Minister knows, there is no ratio of particular significance between the public representation and the medical representation on the health boards. There is absolutely no reason that the ratio of public representatives to the population they represent should not be safeguarded.  That is all we are asking for.  We are asking for the minimum number of local representatives necessary to safeguard real representative democracy on the Eastern Health Board so that the councillor on the health board can represent the views of people of the area from which he is elected.  If there is any spirit of generosity the way the Bill is being taken I ask the Minister to concede to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to do so not only because of the intrinsic importance of the amendment but as an indication of the Minister's generosity.  Some of the major issues are debated without a hope of having them accepted but amendments <Col N="1895" /> like this should be accepted without any quibble.  In fact, it should have been done on Committee Stage.  If the Minister cannot give on the small issues which are important to the delivery of the service, what is the chance that he will listen to the Opposition points on larger issues?</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 12, to delete &ldquo;borough&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. Members of the local authority concerned, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council, made a request to the Minister to amend a number of items in the Bill. The Minister graciously received an all-party deputation from the council and during their visit they identified half a dozen items that they wished him to amend in the Bill.  In particular, they asked him to amend this section and I will now explain why they sought this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are two different regimes in relation to school attendance and school meals applying in the area covered by the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  In the former borough corporation area the children attending certain primary schools get school meals.  In addition, their school attendance is governed by school attendance Acts and the council appoints school <Col N="1896" /> attendance officers, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education. In the county area school attendance is governed by the gardaí who effectively are school attendance officers.  When the report on reorganisation was submitted to the Minister, the members of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council asked specifically that the same arrangements with regard to school meals and school attendance should apply right across the new county and that different regimes should not apply in the borough corporation area and the former county council area.  It is very difficult to explain to a parent that school meals are provided on one side of the road but not on the other and that different school attendance regimes apply in different schools. We expected the Bill to reflect that when published, but it did not.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to continue the old arrangement in the borough area and that is causing problems.  The public are asking why these old boundaries are being kept in force for the functions of a new county council.  It is causing a problem for the service because the councils specifically asked that the same rules should apply across the new county.  As I explained on Committee Stage, we have moved from the idea of having a borough and a county.  We have a unique project in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council in that we have to marry two local authority areas, the old borough corporation and the county council.  Much work has been done on that by the manager, staff and members of the council, we are adamant we should operate as a single county and that there should not be a borough and a county.  If that concept is kept it will sink the project.  I explained this at considerable length on Committee Stage when debating the amendments on section 11.  Deputies Doyle, Keogh and I spoke about this repeatedly on Second and Committee Stages and again this morning.  I expected that by now we would have had a ministerial amendment acceding to our request.  I am disappointed that is not the case and that the Minister for the Environment, who made such a big deal about this legislation <Col N="1897" /> and who was present for two days right through the Committee Stage debate where he would have picked up the nuances and emphases we were putting on the various points, is not here to respond.  I know he had to attend an important meeting abroad on the day after the Committee Stage debate, but I would like to know if he gave any consideration to what we said on Committee Stage.  Did we waste two days proposing amendments which the Minister has simply forgotten about?  Will the Minister now accept my amendment?  If not I intend to press it.</P>

      <P>As the House will have gathered from Deputy Gilmore's contribution, the members of the proposed new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council feel very strongly about this.  I gave a commitment to the Minister on this Bill but I intend to press my three amendments and to support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  We have argued for about an hour and a half about the identity of the new county council and how we want to leave the borough council behind.  The Minister will have heard us talk fondly about our farewell do the other night for the borough council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We bade farewell to the borough council.  If we have what will amount to discrimination in the services provided to the people there will be total confusion among the people of the new county council area.  We are trying to make a new start.  We have enough problems about the financing of the new county council and we are carrying a huge debt with us.  The Minister should at least give us the opportunity to start off with the operations of the county council being on the same footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle did not totally support the amendment put down by Deputy Gilmore <Col N="1898" /> initially in relation to the services being provided only in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council and that is why I tabled an amendment to the effect that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Each new council shall become and be a school attendance area for the purposes of the School Attendance Acts, 1926 to 1967, and there shall accordingly be a school attendance committee for each area.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discriminate between the county councils we are setting up but the same services should be available to our children right across the country. Obviously the Minister for the Environment did not listen to my arguments but I reiterate it is inconceivable that, for instance, one area of Sallynoggin should have a school attendance officer and school meals available and that another should not.  I made that point about the value of the school attendance committees and school attendance officers very forcefully on Second and Committee Stages.  It should apply right across the country and it is something which I will also put to the Minister for Education. Will the Minister for the Environment liaise with the Minister for Education so that we could have what amounts to a school welfare officer?  Deputy Gilmore and I could point the Minister to the areas that desperately require these services. We are talking about disadvantaged areas where children desperately need support services.  In this Bill we are saying that in one small part of our area facilities will be available but not in another.  I am not willing to explain this to my constituents or to take the blame for something about which I feel so strongly.  It is unworthy of the Minister for the Environment to totally ignore all our arguments. When we co-operate with the broad thrust of the Bill it is ridiculous that specific amendments are ignored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore and I were part of the delegation which went to the Minister on the specific difficulties which the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area committee had with the Bill.  We were well received by him, he made pleasant noises, smiled and nodded but gave us nothing.  There <Col N="1899" /> may be a small concession on finance but we are starting with a huge debt.  We are not getting consideration on relatively minor matters which would not cost a penny but which would give the councils, in particular the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council, the kind of autonomy they should have.</P>
    <P>I gather that Deputy Doyle, who spoke strongly about the school attendance committees, will support this amendment. I am putting the Minister on notice that unless he gives a positive response to these amendments I intend to press each of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the well articulated amendment and the case put by Deputies Gilmore and Keogh.  They are speaking from an intimate knowledge of the functional area concerned.  There is little point in perpetuating the concept of a borough if the point of this legislation is to dissolve a borough, a borough council and Dublin County Council and to replace them with three new county council administrative areas.  I will ask the Minister to take on board the good sense of the case already made here and treat all county council areas similarly?</P>
      <P>In terms of school attendance and school meals, all the children in the greater Dublin area should be treated equally.  There should not be a border between Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and south Dublin in relation to the services given to children.  I intend to support these amendments but my real concern is that all the children in the greater Dublin area should be treated equally.</P>
      <P>With the announcement of the increase in planning application fees this morning, there will be some latitude in terms of the rate struck this year and in funding the extension of the service.  There will be a means of funding the service if it is extended to all children in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area and the other county council areas.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to pay a series of official visits to Central Eastern European countries, which were formerly run by Communist regimes, and where there is tremendous goodwill towards Ireland, and also a magnitude of new business contacts and opportunities.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully recognises the importance of systematic contacts as a means of developing mutually beneficial relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  Since taking office, I have had very useful bilateral meetings with the Heads of State or Government of the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Slovenia, Lithuania and Estonia.  I would also point out that both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Tourism and Trade have in the recent past paid visits to countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  All these contacts are designed to further political and economic links between Ireland and these countries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Government intends to actively continue the forging of new and improved links with the countries in question.  I will play a full part in this process both by way of official visits as appropriate and through bilateral contact when suitable opportunities present themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply; he might have referred also to the President's official visit to Hungary in the past few weeks.  There is tremendous goodwill towards Ireland in Eastern Europe.  As a member of the Council of Europe I visited a number of those countries and an official visit by the Taoiseach to some of them would be very beneficial.  Our fellow members of the European Union, particularly the Germans, the French and the British, avail of every opportunity to promote trade <Col N="1901" /> for the future.  We need representation at the highest level, for example, we should expand our diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister has a busy schedule at present, particularly in regard to the Northern Ireland talks, but I would like to make an observation in that regard.  A surplus of arms is readily available in Eastern European countries at very little cost to paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and that poses a tremendous danger to future peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, Sir.  In conclusion, I ask the Taoiseach to make a special effort to visit those countries and impress on him the necessity to ensure that there is not a flow of surplus arms or war equipment to Northern Ireland because of the need for hard currency in such countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I will avail of ever possible opportunity to further economic links between Ireland and the countries he mentionied.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, has visited a number of such countries already and has plans to visit others.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Poland and Hungary this year and other visits are planned to Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation.  A visit was arranged to Hungary but was postponed at their request.  I also envisage a programme of visits here by my counterparts. Indeed, at the summit of European states held in Vienna recently I met the head of the Czech Republic and invited him to visit Ireland.  The Deputy can rest assured that no effort will be spared in developing closer links with Central and Eastern European countries.  We will always take the opportunity to point out to countries where there is a surplus of arms that it is undesirable to supply them <Col N="1902" /> to Northern Ireland because of the uses to which they will be put.</P>

      <P>I reject the implication in the Deputy's question that the figures for tourism are either unreliable of inaccurate.  The overseas tourism and travel staistics published by the Central Statistics Office, the CSO, cover all visits and related expenditure by nonresidents to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of any grouping of nonresidents from these statistics for reasons of purpose of journey, nationality and/or country of birth, could not be considered. Any such exclusion would mean that the resulting statistics would not properly cover Ireland's international tourism and travel balance of payments transactions.</P>
      <P>Overseas visitors to Ireland are classsified by route of travel, area of residence and reason of journey.  The details published annually in respect of calendar years give separate estimates for four categories of reason for journey &mdash; tourist; business; visit to relatives and other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State accepts that by including the people I mention in the question, the statistics, to say the least, are misleading.  Will he take account of a case that is now quite common, of someone resident here, whose family lives here but who works in Britain and comes home every weekend? That person, assuming that he takes two weeks' holidays in the year, is classified in the statistics as 50 British tourists.  In fact, he is one Irishman commuting to and from Britain.  That is one example of what I have in mind and it is grossly <Col N="1903" /> misleading.  In the question I was referring not only to the CSO figures &mdash; I tabled this question to the Minister for Tourism and Trade &mdash; but also to the Bord Fáilte figures.  Is the Minister of State aware that in the first week of January each year, through some miraculous inspiration, Bord Fáilte is able to publish the figures for the period up to 31 December of the previous year?  While each year is considered a success the latest year is always the greatest of them all.  How does the Minister of State square this with the fact that at least half the tourist hotels are for sale, if they can get a buyer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the figures are not misleading, they are accurate and can be broken down.  They are compiled in accordance with international practice. There would be complaints in this House and internationally if we were to adopt a parochial approach to the figures which, as I said, can be broken down.  I do not know what method Bord Fáilte uses in producing its figures at the beginning of each year but I am aware that the CSO supplies it with basic data.  Bord Fáilte then produces its own figures which also cover Northern Ireland.  I should say that there is little difference in the figures produced by the CSO and Bord Fáilte. As I said, the figures are accurate and reliable.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned the person who travels back and forth every weekend from Britain.  Our definition is in accordance with the international definition.  The figures compiled by the CSO cover mainly the international tourism and travel balance of payments transactions which are accurate. Those who commute back and forth from Britain spend money here.  That is the purpose of the CSO keeping statistics, Bord Fáilte may have other reasons for doing so.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree, in regard to the example I gave which he appears not to dispute, that the man in question who travels to and from this country 50 times a year is classified in these statistics as 50 British <Col N="1904" /> tourists, as someone who enters the country 50 times from Britain, which is misleading? In fact, he is one Irish resident who commutes 50 times during the year.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister of State.  Is he saying that we cannot alter the way in which the information is gathered or that we have chosen not to because it is compiled in accordance with international practice?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we exclude certain groupings from our tourist figures who are regarded internationally as tourists then there would be distortion and we would not be comparing like with like. As I said, the annual report on overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the CSO provides a breakdown of the figures.</P>
      <P>If one does not wish to define people who visit relatives as tourists, one only has to extract the number of such people from the annual report.  There is a breakdown and if people want to use figures for particular purposes they can do so. The role of the Central Statistics Office is to supply statistics accurately and in accordance with international practice. We can argue as to whether the figures are right or wrong and which figures should be included, but I reject any implication that the CSO is distorting them or giving inaccurate figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 47 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 November last, I announced details of a special £3 million consumer marketing campaign, aimed at the North American tourist market.  In effect, it heralds a new approach to that market, based on active partnership between the public and private sectors and will be driven by the latter's commercial assessment of how best to complement the traditional marketing efforts in the market.</P>
      <P>The campaign will be co-funded by the Exchequer, the EU and the tourism industry.  It will be overseen by the Department of Tourism and Trade, in partnership with the tourism industry, including hoteliers, tour operators and carriers.  Bord Fáilte will also be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the new campaign are to: (1) create a greater awareness of Ireland as a desirable and affordable destination; (2) reverse the trend of decline in visitor traffic expenditure and loss of market share; (3) secure more <Col N="1907" /> business, particularly shoulder and off-peak traffic; (4) support expanded airline capacity for 1994 and beyond; and (5) complement Bord Fáilte's trade promotional campaigns.</P>
    <P>The campaign will be an intensive consumer campaign in two phases, the first will be active early in the new year and the second later in the year.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the industry has taken a lead role in this initiative, as it meets the challenge of increasing its own marketing activity and spend.  Overall, the effect of the initiative will be to supplement greatly Bord Fáilte's regular expenditure in the marketplace, both with the additional Exchequer moneys being directly provided and the incremental spend on the market being committed also by the private sector participants.</P>
    <P>With regard to 1993 performance, the American market to Ireland, in common with other American travel to Europe, was weak in the early part of the year.  A strong recovery in the autumn, however, is likely to result in total numbers and revenue for 1993 being approximately the same as in 1992.  As to 1994 and later years, on foot of the new initiative I have just described, I am confident that we can look forward to greatly improved performances from the North American market for the rest of the decade.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that his Department's initiative undermines the credibility of Bord Fáilte, not alone at home but abroad?  Is it part of his campaign to scrap Bord Fáilte in the long run?  Will the Minister clarify recent statements he made <i>vis-á-vis</i> Bord Fáilte that some empires may have to fall?  It is important to clarify both statements.</P>

      <P>We will not anticipate them; I would not like to be disorderly. I do not think this initiative undermines the credibility of Bord Fáilte.  Since I became Minister for Tourism and Trade &mdash; and previously &mdash; I heard from the industry and others involved that if they had money they could do the job as well as Bord Fáilte.  The only way to find out if that is true is to put it to the test. Since I became Minister I have said I was willing to give private operators an opportunity to invest in the market-place with some funding from the State and the EU.  Some groups in the industry came forward with this initiative and I was glad to be able to accommodate them.  This initiative is meant to complement the activities of Bord Fáilte in the North American market-place.  For a small amount of money we will find out whether people in the industry can do the job better.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for recent statements about Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an indication that the Minister could still scrap Bord Fáilte?  Will he accept that its bad performance in America in recent years is the result of lack of funding rather than lack of extensive marketing?  Is he aware that for every $600 spent on the promotion of travel and tourism in America only $1 or less is spent in Ireland and that is money given to Bord Fáilte to market Ireland?  Is the Minister further aware that the British Tourist Board spends over $30 million a year while Bord Fáilte with Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines, spends only $3 million.  Will the Minister agree, therefore, that his statements were unfair to Bord Fáilte and that it should be allowed to prove itself by heading up this campaign, given the extra resources now to hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get away from the idea that hoteliers mind their business, that Bord Fáilte looks after promotion and that never the twain shall meet.  Bord Fáilte might say that nobody knows more about marketing than it but that is not true.  People involved in the <Col N="1909" /> industry whose bread and butter it is to make profits to repay their financial institutions are as likely to give as good value for money as any State organisation. Here is an opportunity to complement the activities of Bord Fáilte in the North American market for a small amount of money as that market has not increased for a number of years.  The out-turn for 1993 will be roughly the same as for last year.  We have not yet reached the figure that obtained in 1990, our peak year.  A number of factors figure in the sluggishness of the North American market in relation to Ireland.  This initiative is an effort to target one market to see if, with some extra promotion and drive in the next few years, with EU and State money, the industry, complementing the activities of Bord Fáilte, will be able to rejuvenate the North American market.  We will attempt it and we hope to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, at a time when we are trying to have focused marketing drives all over the world for Ireland, this will lead to fragmentation? There will now be two agencies promoting Ireland in America, Bord Fáilte doing mainstream promotion and the Department carrying out its own initiative.  This is a bad way to do business.</P>
      <P>The decline in the number of visitors from America results mainly from a lack of funding.  Bord Fáilte funding reduced from £35 million in 1985 to approximately £21.5 million in 1992.  Is the Minister aware that during the past ten years the number of American tourists visiting Scotland increased by approximately 200,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there will be fragmentation in regard to this initiative.  My Department will co-ordinate the activity of this group.  As I stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> when announcing this initiative, the industry will operate this activity.  Our Department will have a co-ordinating role.  The industry has funded <Col N="1910" /> this activity, but the State and EU have also contributed funding and, therefore the Department should have a co-ordinating role in the activity.  The industry will spearhead this marketing drive and the Department will have a public watchdog role as State moneys have been contributed. The Department will not direct operations, that job will be left to the industry.  Bord Fáilte will be consulted to ensure there will be no duplication of its activities in the North American market.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the sluggishness of the North American tourist market for the past number of years is due mainly to lack of funds.  A myriad of other factors must be taken into account, not least the problem of access from North America to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The preparation of the proposed new Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, is nearing completion in my Department.  However, publication of the programme is subject to the prior approval and agreement of the EU Commission, who are currently engaged in the examination of Ireland's National Development Plan 1994-1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy that information as I would be <Col N="1911" /> speculating.  The operational programme must be submitted to the Commission for approval and that may not take place for a considerable time.  Therefore, I could not be expected to outline the various matters that may be considered in the operational programme, but a certain amount of money will be provided in the National Development Plan for tourism in the period 1994-99.  It would not be helpful to give specific details at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree we could lose out on development for a season if details of the programme are not announced shortly because operators will not invest if an announcement is not made before the spring?  This is a matter of urgency.  It is important for tourism that details of the programme should be announced in the near future to provide much needed facilities, projects and products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is down to logistics as well as other considerations.  The broad thrust of the National Development Plan as it relates to tourism has been discussed with the Commission and details of the operational programme have yet to be submitted to it.  The amount of money available for the tourism programme in the 1989-93 plan is exhausted but it has not been brought to my notice that worthwhile projects did not proceed.  I recognise that the sooner the operational programme is published, the better as it will provide certainty for future planning. I intend to expedite this matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 9, 13, 42, 43 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report referred to by the Deputies <Col N="1913" /> is intended as a basis for discussion by members of the European Parliament. While the report is available on request from the European Parliament's Office in Dublin it was not submitted to me formally, nor are its recommendations the subject of discussions in any Community fora in which my Department is represented.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, Ireland supports the strengthening and integration of the tourism services in the EU Commission, as recommended by the consultants, with the development of a new tourism action programme.  However, any detailed proposals that may emerge would have to be examined carefully from the point of view of the implications such changes might have for the operation of the Structural Funds in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>The recommendation for the establishment of advice centres for tourism appear to be consistent with the activities already undertaken by Bord Fáilte, the restructured RTOs, CERT and the newly formed county enterprise partnership boards.  In the circumstances, in any Community discussions in this area, I would be most anxious to avoid duplication between EU and national efforts in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extensive report which contains many important recommendations.  As the EU has suffered a decline in its share of global tourism in recent years will the Minister agree there is a need for a more integrated tourism policy in the Community?  Does he also agree with the recommendation in the report that there should be a tourist policy division within the EU?  The recommendation does not go so far as to say there should be a special tourism Commissioner but that might be considered having regard to the importance of tourism for the Community and that 10 per cent of employment in the Community is tourism based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed in the report are those of its authors, not of the European Parliament.  The report has been submitted to the European Parliament <Col N="1914" /> and will be debated there.  I accept it is interesting, but its detailed examination at present would not benefit Ireland.  Since becoming Minister for Tourism and Trade, I have found I could fill half of this Chamber with tourism reports commissioned by Government Departments, agencies under the responsibility of various Ministers and private reports prepared for various organisations.  The tourism sector has been reported on to a greater extent than many others.  However, action needs to be taken in regard to tourism.</P>
      <P>Interesting issues are raised in the report.  It makes the case that Europe's share of world tourism declined from 62 per cent in 1970 to 53 per cent in 1991 and that most of the business was lost to the Asia-Pacific area.  Ireland's share of EU tourism grew from 1.3 per cent in 1980 to 1.5 per cent in 1991.  Interesting matters raised in the report have been commented on already in various Irish reports.  I will await with interest the views of the European Parliament on the report and it will probably surface in other fora of the European Union at a future date.  I hope our views will be taken on board at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised the Minister is dismissive of this report. Is it not important for his Department to have a clear policy on tourism in a European context as opposed to a national context?  If so, the Minister should be looking quite closely at this report.  Earlier he explained how he came to a decision as regards a major promotional <Col N="1915" /> drive in America, but it seems he depended more on his instinct for gambling than on any intellectual exercise in policy making.  Surely the question of tourism development in a European context must be considered by this national body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This report was compiled by a group of consultants for the European Parliament and it has yet to be discussed in that Parliament and taken on board by the Commission.  Naturally my Department takes account of various reports that are produced.  I do not wish to downgrade this report nor to elevate it to a very high status.  The report consists of the views of the consultants, Fitzpatrick Associates, on tourism in the European context.  Some of the ideas in the report have been incorporated in the development of Ireland's tourism policy and I will be taking on board others.  I am not being dismissive of the report but regard it as an important contribution to tourism, particularly in a European context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 7, 11, 21, 23, 29, 32, 36 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed review of the co-ordination of tourism at regional level as recommended by the Tourism Task Force and confirmed in the Programme for Government, the House will be aware that I reached agreement with representatives of the Regional Tourism Organisation on 29 October 1993 to <Col N="1919" /> establish more appropriate institutional structures for Irish tourism at regional and county level.  Resulting from that agreement a new structure based upon county divisions will be established to replace the existing regional councils of the RTOs.  Consequently each county will be represented by a county tourism committee comprising representatives of the various membership categories within each RTO including members of voluntary groups and organisations.  In addition, new slimmed-down boards of management will be established to replace the existing management committees.</P>
    <P>In general, county tourism committees will be involved in the &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; development at county-area level while the RTOs will continue to have responsibility for tourism development at regional level, including co-ordination, promotions, tourist information networks and accommodation standards. Committees will be responsible for stimulating and co-ordinating projects in the tourism sector by identifying, influencing and bringing forward new products and initiatives in the remit of their operational area.  The committees will also have responsibility for formulating county tourism action plans for incorporating into the county enterprise action plans produced by the county enterprise boards and the regional tourism plans produced by the RTOs.  The RTO will convene three meetings per annum with each committee and organise an annual regional forum of all committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of these days we will become very confused by the various boards that are being set up.  If the same people are sitting on many boards their time will be totally taken up with these matters.  Will the Minister explain the relationship between the proposed county tourism boards and the county enterprise boards?  Would he agree that the county enterprise boards, of one of which I am a member, could easily do the work of the proposed county tourism boards in view of the fact that the tourism <Col N="1920" /> industry is very well represented on these boards?  Would the Minister agree that this is just another layer of bureaucracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that argument because in some cases tourism is not represented on the county enterprise boards.  That may not be the case in the Deputy's constituency but it is in other areas.  When the decision to set up the county enterprise boards was taken initially it was decided to disband the regional tourism organisations and shortly after there was a general election. This gave rise to negotiations for a partnership Government, which took some time.  The Programme for a Partnership Government recommended that consideration should be given to setting up organisations which would deal with tourism on a regional basis.  This was in line with the recommendation in the November 1992 report of the tourism task force.</P>
      <P>Following a series of meetings, which concluded in March, I decided to restructure the regional tourism organisations. Negotiations took place with those organisations during the summer regarding the setting up of the county tourism committees.  Under the new system the regional tourism organisations have been slimmed down dramatically and each county will have its own tourism committee which will have a hands-on approach to the development of the tourism industry in its area.  I hope this system will be devoid of bureaucracy.  There is a very good county tourism committee in Deputy Fox's constituency and a pretty good one in mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to that point later.  As I said, people will be able to come together under the new county tourism committee structure to ensure a hands-on approach to the development of the tourism industry in that area.  The slimmed down regional tourism organisations will deal with the regional aspects of the industry, for example, the provision <Col N="1921" /> of tourism information networks, etc.  I hope everyone involved in the tourism industry, including Bord Fáilte, will be singing off the one hymn sheet, so to speak, in regard to the development of this industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed that the new county tourism committees will have their own budgets?  In other words, will they have a promotional or a developmental role?  What relationship will the committee in Kerry have with SFADCo, which promotes part of Kerry, the Cork-Kerry tourism organisation and Údarás na Gaeltachta?  It strikes me that the Minister is adding a further layer of bureaucracy to the three agencies already promoting tourism in the Kerry area.  In addition, the Leader programme and the county enterprise boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily disagree with the point made by the Deputy &mdash; one can get confused when a number of organisations are dealing with the promotion of tourism in the one county.  The county tourism committees will not have a budget, apart from the funds they raise themselves or which are given to them by the regional tourism organisations.  The county tourism committees in Counties Kildare and Wicklow, the areas I know best, have operated very successfully for a number of years. The people interested in tourism in those two counties got together to promote it in their areas: one committee is called Kildare Fáilte and the other the Wicklow Tourism Committee.  These committees are representative of the people who own caravan parks, hotels and guesthouses in those areas.  I will allow individuals at county level to operate these committees. As I said, the regional tourism organisations have worked very well in some areas but not in others.  There is no point in turning a blind eye to this fact.  The <Col N="1922" /> county tourism committees will have a hands-on approach to the development of the tourism industry in their areas, a system which I believe will work very well.  Interim committees will be set up between now and April when the regional tourism organisations have their annual general meetings and we will monitor them after that.  If the system is seen not to be working this time next year I will not have any hesitation in making further changes in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that many countries in central and eastern Europe have changed to free market economies, does the Minister consider that we might do likewise, particularly in regard to our tourism industry?  The Minister has innovative ideas and perhaps he will consider replacing the present tourist boards, which are extremely expensive, clumsy and, as many people perceive, highly inefficient, with private promoters who would be paid on the basis of their results.  A number of people involved in the tourism industry in my constituency do not use the services of Bord Fáilte.  I am referring in particular to hoteliers who carry out their own promotions.  Will the Minister agree there is a need for a second opinion in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad my good friend Deputy Deasy has come into the House without being prompted by me to do so.  The purpose behind the marketing initiative I announced less than a month ago was to allow people in the industry to do their own thing without the heavy hand of State bureaucracy placed on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>I am willing to consider further initiatives in this regard and, as I said previously in the House, to allow people directly involved in the industry to control their own destiny and carry out their own promotions.  The marketing initiative is along those lines.  I outlined <Col N="1923" /> my thinking on this issue earlier in reply to a question from Deputy Deenihan and others.  I hope to take further steps in this area in the coming years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that we are not talking only about private money in terms of a marketing initiative but also about public money.  If people in the private sector want to sell their own wares they should be allowed to do so.  I do not think anyone disagrees with this.  However, it should be remembered that we are talking about public money.  I suggest to the Minister that his policy now is to buy a dog and bark himself.  Will the Minister agree it would be a pity if the successful ventures in Counties Wicklow and Kildare were used as a stick with which to beat other county tourism committees?  The venture in my county has been successful because scarce public money was put into its establishment by the local authority.  The Minister might underestimate the difficulties experienced by the county enterprise boards if he is simply leaving it to each county to formulate its own arrangements in regard to those committees and to raise its own funding &mdash; he said they could not expect to get any funding apart from what they get from the regional tourism organisations.  He should look at the Leader programme which adopts a much more flexible approach to this issue.  Under the programme counties make their own arrangements, it may well be that a country enterprise board is willing and able to take on responsibility for the development of the tourism industry in its area.  Instead of setting out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In case I have not made my views on this issue clear today and on other occasions, I am not making the setting up of county tourism committees compulsory.  If a better arrangement can be put forward by some counties that is acceptable.  I have made that clear to the regional tourism organisations at various meetings and it is part of the agreement.  Those organisations will help to set up county tourism committees in areas in which there are none at present.  It is in the interests of the people involved in tourism in any county to operate within the structure which best suits them.  We have set out what we believe is the best structure to get these committees up and running.  The committees in Counties Kildare and Wicklow are good examples of the type which can be established.  The local authorities in both areas provided the seed capital for setting up these committees.  It is also true that some other organisations did not want them to be set up.  I was quite adamant that the committees in Counties Kildare and Wicklow have worked well and should be allowed to remain as they are.</P>

He is obviously bringing the degree of dynamism to his Department that he displayed as a backbencher and it is a breath of fresh air to tourism that is very welcome.  His ideas are taking root and they must be nurtured considerably if they are to come to fruition. Will the Minister consider the re-direction of some of the funds that are currently allocated to the regional tourism organisations to county enterprise boards and county tourism organisation?  It is all very well to set up county tourism organisations but it is of no value when no budget is available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must first see how this system will operate.  We are trying to <Col N="1926" /> put a structure in place and this time next year we should have an idea as to how it is opening.  I am quite certain that what will operate well in one country will not operate well in another.  I am certain also that some county tourism organisations will have a very good working relationship with the RTOs and with the county enterprise partnership boards while others will not.  When we have the system up and running we can then see what changes might have to be made.  I would not rule out the possibility that funding might be redirected at some stage in the future but it is important that we get the system off the ground.</P>
      <P>Some of my ideas about tourism will be wrong, they will not work, but it is better to make some changes and have some successs than not do anything.  Just because something has been done the same way for the past 20, 30 or 40 years does not mean that that should continue. It is time to make some changes and if some ideas fail I hope the ideas that work will be a huge success in tourism.  We should not be locked into structures that have been in place for many years, we should be prepared to try something different.  That is what I intend to do and I hope the ideas will work but if they do not at least we will have tried.</P>

      <P>In relation to the county tourism committees, the Minister clarified that they do not have a budget and that he has no specific mandate to form a country tourism committee.  In midwest region we have an organisation mandated to promote tourism.  We have a county enterprise board whose objective is set up a business plan, which will be the objective of every county enterprise board.  Would the Minister agree that part of that business plan would be the tourism emphasis?  Is the Minister saying that county tourism promotion is strictly the wish of people involved in the tourism trade or does he see them dovetailing into the county enterprise plan, into what Shannon Development is doing in our <Col N="1927" /> area or does he see them operating on an autonomous basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that in a place such as west Limerick the people will come together, form groups and produce innovative ideas in regard to tourism.  I have met such groups throughout the country but I also see them dovetailing into the overall national plan, particularly into the SFADCo plan.  I am not a believer in stringent bureaucracy and I accept that the number of bodies with which one has to communicate is very confusing.  However, when the county tourism committees are in operation and with the slimmed down RTOs people with ideas will know to whom they should go to obtain some State assistance. People around the country who produce a plan should have their ideas adopted in the regional plan for their area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, many questions were taken together.  The Minister mentioned that he will be looking at <Col N="1928" /> the role of the regional tourism organisations. Does he intend to examine their geographic basis because at the moment some problems exist.  For example, my county, and the Minister's county, have no real meaning.  They are simply the leftovers from the other regions.  Would the Minister accept that it would be beneficial to cluster counties within some regional structure where they have a common interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have undertaken the restructuring of the RTOs.  That was announced some time ago and it was finalised in October.  In regard to the Deputy's other point, I try not to bite off more than I can chew although sometimes I am inclined to do so.  However, I am prepared to look at that matter because the East Regional Tourism Organisation covers a very wide area and there are many counties involved.  Rather than making a change in that regard I am prepared to leave that for another day.  I have no plans at present but I accept the Deputy's contention that the situation is not satisfactory.  I do not want to set up another structure which will probably be equally as unsatisfactory.  I will consider the matter in the future but not in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the Tourism Task Force, the Government has identified the tourism sector as a key area for future employment growth.  In allocating more than £370 million EC aid to tourism in the National Development Plan 1994-99 the Government is doubling the £171 million in Structural Funds resources available in the current Community Support Framework.</P>
      <P>The emphasis on increased marketing of Ireland as a holiday destination abroad is also reflected in the Government's proposals, as are measures to improve the seasonality profile of the industry.  The Government will shortly submit its detailed investment proposals to the EC Commission for consideration.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, several other key recommendations have been implemented. These include the setting up of the tourism council and the establishment of product development groups or companies in a number of niche product areas.  I have also reached agreement with representatives of the regional tourism organisations to establish more appropriate institutional structures for Irish tourism at regional and county level.</P>
      <P>Finally, there are still some remaining recommendations which are currently under consideration within my Department and are also being looked at by the subcommittees which I have set up under the tourism council.  I will take decisions on these issues when these processes have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously everybody in the tourism business would welcome the proposed doubling of funding under the National Development Plan.  In regard to the report that will be submitted to the Commission, will it be published here before going to the Commission?  The last time the National Development Plan was submitted, it was all done behind <Col N="1930" /> closed doors and people, with vast experience and knowledge of the tourism industry, or public representatives, did not have their say in what went into it. Will the report be made public before going to the Commission?</P>
      <P>On the question of a European policy in regard to marketing Ireland and the fact that there is an expanding market, particularly in Asian countries, would the Minister agree that it would be of benefit to Ireland to perceive itself as part of the European product, if I might put it that way, rather than our merely carrying on as simply an isolated island somewhere in the Atlantic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the first question the Deputy asked was whether the operational programme which will be submitted to Brussels will come before the House beforehand.  &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to that question because it has to be approved by the Commission.  I am not going to publish the operational programme details nor was that done on the last occasion.  However, since assuming office I have ensured that all of the submissions by groups, such as the regional tourism organisations and the various county development teams in regard to tourism, will be taken on board in the preparation of the operational programme. Their ideas were taken on board in the preparation of the National Development Plan.  However, the operational programme involves the minutiae of the areas which will be assisted under the provisions of the next programme.  I am endeavouring to build into that programme a considerable amount of flexibility because what might appear to be a very good idea for 1994-95 may not prove to be a very good idea in 1998-99.  To have all of that stuck down in rigid little boxes would not be appropriate.  Therefore, the details of the operation programme will not be announced before being submitted to and agreed by Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's second question was a very interesting one, on persuading tourists who come to Europe to travel on to Ireland.  I agree with Deputy McManus <Col N="1931" /> that millions of people come to Europe, in particular to London or Paris &mdash; those places do not have to advertise themselves as we would have to do in the case of Kerry, great and all as the latter may be.  Also thousands of people come to Europe from Latin America and, increasingly from the Asian and Pacific countries since they constitute a growing affluent region.  My Department is examining how we can tap into that Euro-type tourism, leading to the dispersement of the Euro product, and get such tourists to travel on to Ireland.  In that regard any ideas in the previous report of which the Deputy spoke will be incorporated in our examination of such possibilities.  We are examining those areas because probably they constitute the key to the successful growth of Irish tourism, that is to tap into the tourist potential created by those travelling to Europe and have that dispersed to the outer regions such as Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a good look through the report of the Tourism Task Force before this Question Time and apart from the establishment of the tourism council, to which the Minister referred, I could observe very few of their recommendations having been put in place by the Minister to date.  For example, does the Minister intend to put in place a registration system, as recommended in the report of the Tourism Task Force which, stated that all providers of tourist accommodation should be licensed or registered according to objective criteria and standards.  I noted also a strong recommendation that similarly, all food outlets, should be registered and graded for quality.  Does the Minister intend doing so?  I also observed that there was a recommendation regarding the entertainments committee, to inject professionalism in to the provision of entertainment for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the matter of getting tourists to travel on from the Continent to Ireland.  What steps has he taken &mdash; this too is contained in the report of the Tourism Task Force &mdash; to accommodate <Col N="1932" /> tourists wishing to come to Ireland on long-haul air routes, such as those from Japan, South America and other points to London so that people who fly from such places to London can continue to travel on to Ireland for the same fare?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that I have not put into effect many of the recommendations of the Tourism Task Force.  For example, I established the tourism council which is working quite well and I have restructured the regional tourism organisations.  The Tourism Task Force expressed the view that they should not be disbanded unless and until an equally effective alternative regional co-ordination mechanism could be put in place.  I have done that.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the licensing of all tourist accommodation, there have been previous questions in the House in that regard when I made my views known.  I will not go into that debate now but I will be bringing forward some proposals in the near future.  The national entertainments committee is a matter for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht but I can confirm that that matter is at present being considered by the tourism council.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan was not published until it went to the Commission and, to date, it has not been passed.  On what grounds is the Minister refusing to publish the operational programme?  If there is a European directive or some legislative provision to the effect that it cannot be made public?  Has there been a Cabinet decision taken that this operational strategy cannot be made public?  I do not know whether the Minister is aware but I was in Brussels when the National Development Plan was published, when there was general amazement at the secretiveness that operates within our Government when it comes to any of these plans.  The Minister is arguing that he has adopted a new, open approach, that he is out to change things, that he is not hide bound by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This will not become the operational programme under which projects can be submitted for grant-aid until it has been approved by the European Commission.  This is not the result of a Cabinet or any other kind of decision; it was purely an administrative one on my part.  I will take on board all the ideas submitted in recent times in regard to the types of projects that should be grant-aided under the provisions of the next operational programme.  I might point out to the Deputy that, if every Minister had to submit every regulation to committees of this House, there is no doubt but that no Minister would ever get any regulation or programme through.</P>

      <P>The total EC aid allocation in the National Development Plan to the private sector for marketing over the period 1994-99 will be in the region of £40 million.  It is estimated that this will lever additional marketing investment of £74 million by the industry itself in matching funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the achievement of marketing spending that took place in the course of the last national plan?  That plan gave a commitment that the Irish share of imports of other EC countries would double from 1.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent but, in contrast, during the period of that plan the Irish share actually diminished. Will the Minister comment on the fact that the previous plan gave a commitment to the effect that small and medium Irish enterprises would radically <Col N="1935" /> expand their sales by £2 billion whereas one-third only of that target was achieved?  Does he not feel that the programmes he designed for developing successful marketing by Ireland abroad must be questioned?</P>

      <P>I strongly supported the points made by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Keogh before we adjourned at 1.30 p.m.  This Bill divides the greater Dublin area into three new county councils but it also dissolves the borough council of Dún Laoghaire.  The whole concept of a borough will be superfluous from now on.  It is disappointing that the views expressed on Second and Committee Stages, were not taken on board by the Minister.  It reflects our handicap in the House when the Cabinet Minister responsible for the Environment is not with us today.  This is no reflection on the Minister of State, who is merely substituting and riding to instructions.  As we all said, and it bears reiterating, no matter how good or cogent a case is put from the Opposition the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, <Col N="1969" /> Deputy Browne, does not have the authority to accept our amendments &mdash; or even their substance &mdash; and refer them to the Seanad for change.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): Before lunch we had a lengthy debate on the question of school attendance.  The first point I make is that the matter has already been taken up with the Department of Education, the responsible Department, which is currently reviewing the arrangements for the operation of this service. Second, I am having an amendment to section 39 circulated which will provide a ready mechanism for the Minister for Education to apply the borough arrangements throughout Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the three new counties.  This should meet the concerns expressed.  I am sure the Department of Education will give the matter urgent attention.  As a former Minister of State, Deputy Doyle will understand, because of the cost implications and the fact that payment for school attendance is the responsibility of the Department of Education, I am not in a position to include any of the amendments put forward from the opposite side of the House.  However, the amendment to section 39 will make it possible for the Minister for Education to apply the borough arrangements throughout the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council and the three new counties. The Minister for Education represents that constituency and is aware of the concerns raised today.  Deputy Doyle lived in that constituency formerly and I am sure she will put pressure on the Minister for Education to put into effect what I am now providing for in this Bill.  That is as far as I can go.  I am willing to go part of the way towards meeting the concerns of Deputies but, because of the cost implications and the involvement of another Minister, I cannot stitch into the Bill any of the amendments tabled.</P>

      <P>The section we are debating deals with the establishment of a school attendance committee and allows for the entire county area to have school <Col N="1971" /> attendance committees in the normal way.  That is a matter for local government and this is a local government Bill. When replying on Committee Stage the Minister appeared to be attempting to drop the Minister for Education in the mire when he seemed to be suggesting that he would be quite happy to go along with our amendment but that the Minister for Education was conducting a review of the School Attendance Acts. Indeed, we have heard about this review for a long time.  In fact, the position is that the State is in breach of the School Attendance Act, 1926 because it does not have a sufficient number of school attendance officers in Dún Laoghaire.  A proposal that went more than 12 months ago to the Department of Education from Dún Laoghaire Corporation asking that it provide school attendance officers has not yet been sanctioned.</P>
      <P>I do not have any great confidence that an amendment stating that regulations will be made under subsection (2) (a) in respect of the School Attendance Acts, 1926 to 1967 will amount to anything.  It is interesting to note the ease with which &mdash; it is not my purpose to offer a defence for the Minister for Education &mdash; the Minister for the Environment attempted to slip the buck back so nastily in this case.  This is local government legislation and it should be provided for in this Bill. We want to have a right as an entire county council to appoint a school attendance committee and we want the concept of the borough &mdash; which we have moved away from at local level &mdash; terminated. We do not want to see it continue in legislative form, as proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a long discussion on this matter both on Committee and Report Stages.  It is a very interesting test of the Government's real commitment to the idea of local democracy and devolving powers to local government.  This Government is great at devolving powers to local government when there are bits and pieces of irritating administration which the Minister wishes to pass back to <Col N="1972" /> local authorities but without providing them with adequate finance.  That is this Government's version of devolving power to local authorities.  When the Minister does not want to make a decision, as he did not want to make a decision in the Chamber last night on the simple question of the name for the local authorities, he can say he will let the local authority members decide.</P>
    <P>When the Minister wants to duck out of the high-minded statements he made last July on the review of the County Dublin development plan he can issue a response, as he did in a reply to a parliamentary question last week to me to the effect he would not want to interfere in decision-making at local level by the members.  That is fine but the members of the local authority are asking the Minister to have a school attendance committee to cover the entire county area instead of half of it.  They want the School Attendance Acts to apply across the entire county instead of a part of it or make the reasonable case, as we have done here, that there is no justification for boxing it off at Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown and that it should apply to every child so that no child in County Dublin should be treated less favourably than another child simply because of where they live.  The absurdity is that a child of a couple who have been housed out of the inner city in a corporation house located in the county area would get a school meal if he or she was still living in the inner city but not where he or she is presently housed.  This is discrimination against children.  It is a disgraceful way for the Government to behave.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have to divide on this issue.  Certainly it was my hope that on Report Stage we would have a degree of response from the Minister so that we would not have to divide.  I regret that on a number of occasions on Report Stage of a Bill which should not be controversial we have had to divide because of the Government's attitude.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  to co-operate in regular joint meetings of elected representatives and officials from the respective local authorities in the metropolitan as shall be called by request from one or more of the Dublin local authorities,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Failtím roimh an leasú atá curtha ag an Aire Comhshaoil atá ag teacht díreach i ndiaidh mo leasú.  Ag an ám céanna, áfách, ba bhreá liom cúpla ceist a chur maidir leis an bun smaoineamh atá taobh thiar den dá leasú ach go mór-mhór maidir leis an ceann im' ainm-sa.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer in particular to the Minister's amendment which relates to the holding of joint meetings of members of the new authorities in County Dublin. Provision is to be made for this in the legislation dealing with regional government which is still an unknown quantity but I hope not for long.  As we will have to depend on this legislation in the intervening period it is important to clarify the matter now.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment states that local authorities may hold such joint meetings of members of the authorities as may be necessary for the purposes of this section.  Being reasonable people the chances are that the Minister and I will agree on this matter but we should bear in mind that a local authority comprises a wide diversity of people and that various authorities may not agree it is necessary to hold a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the words &ldquo;as shall be called <Col N="1978" /> by request from one or more of the Dublin local authorities&rdquo; are used in my amendment can the Minister say who will decide that it is necessary to hold a meeting?  Will a number of county councillors be able to request a meeting?  If that is the case, a meeting could be called without the full agreement of the county council.  Will the Minister indicate how a meeting may be called if one of the major participants feels it is unnecessary and a complete waste of time?</P>
    <P>This is not a hypothetical question as this issue has arisen in Dublin &mdash; housing comes to mind immediately.  As the Minister is aware there have been occasions when one council requested a meeting but another felt that no useful purpose would be served by such a meeting.  If in the view of one authority, no useful purpose can be served, does that mean there will be stalemate?  My amendment provides that if one authority calls a meeting it must take place.  Is there another alternative of which I am not aware? Will the Minister enlighten us?  Although I agree that the sentiment of my amendment has been taken on board, which I welcome, the Minister's amendment lacks the clarity to provide for the meeting taking place.  I would like clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Amendment No. 28 allows the members of the principal authorities to hold such joint meetings as they feel may be necessary for the purposes of co-ordination.  This matter was raised by Deputy Sargent on Committee Stage.  I, therefore, ask him to consider withdrawing amendment No. 27 which meets the points raised regarding joint meetings.</P>
      <P>The amendment would also allow for joint meetings with other local authorities and the question of joint meetings between Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Bray UDC was raised by Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of joint committees may be raised.  The provisions in the Local Government Act, 1991, regarding committees and joint committees have not been implemented.  Pending the outcome <Col N="1979" /> of the review of sub-county structures which is now at an advanced stage, that Part of the 1991 Act dealing with committees and joint committees will be implemented in the light of Government decision as to future sub-county arrangements which is expected shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment briefly on the Minister's response, particularly in relation to the establishment of committees and joint committees under the 1991 Act. When the 1991 Act was introduced, the provision was built into it &mdash; indeed it was flaunted at the time as one of the very attractive provisions in the legislation &mdash; that local authorities would have the freedom to establish committees which would involve a wider membership than members of the local authority.  If, for example, a local authority wanted to involve the regular users of the library service on a library committee, sports clubs on the committees governing sports facilities or residents' associations on a committee dealing with traffic matters, it would have the freedom to do so.  The local authorities could also devolve to those committees certain functions of the local authorities themselves. A typical situation which might arise is where the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg would regularly send directives to local authorities with regard to housing, one of which related to the question of establishing some kind of local management structures for housing estates etc., which is a very good idea.  The mechanism which was to be used to establish those was the committees provided for in the 1991 Act.  In addition, local authorities could establish joint committees with other local authorities and those joint committees in turn, could have certain functions devolved to them.  For example, the management of the Liffey Valley, which has been the subject of discussion previously, could be by way of a joint committee between the respective local authorities and that joint committee, in turn, could involve community and environmental interests from the local <Col N="1980" /> area.  The excuse the Minister of State has given here this evening for not implementing those sections of the 1991 Act does not relate to what he calls the sub-county structures.  This review of the town councils, urban councils and town commissioners does not relate to the 1991 Act.  The fact that that review is going on does not prevent county councils, city councils or borough councils from having committees or joint committees.  This is only an excuse.  I would like to know the real reason these committees are not being set up.  Is there lobbying by people who do not want this style of local government?  It is absurd that we passed legislation in 1991 allowing for structures to be established at local level but that the Act cannot be implemented because the regulations have not been introduced. I am sick and tired of passing legislation here with Ministers reserving to themselves the right to make regulations, including the right to implement the legislation.  Everything from film censorship to local government is now subject to ministerial directive and regulations.  First of all Ministers insist in the primary legislation that they must implement the legislation and make the regulations.  Having got the power in the primary legislation they will not do it and everybody else must wait for them.  It is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief to give other Deputies the opportunity to get in before the deadline.  Some comments by the two previous Deputies aroused my interest. The Liffey Valley was specifically mentioned. I made it well known that I would not consider even the establishment of powerful joint committees as sufficient to preserve and improve the amenity of our greatest asset.  The Liffey Valley is, potentially, Ireland's answer to the Loire Valley.  Therefore, we require an authority to look after its amenities and environmental interests in keeping with its importance and significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed particularly what Deputy Gilmore said about wider membership of these committees.  I have the highest respect for councillors; I was once a councillor <Col N="1981" /> myself, although not in this jurisdiction. However, when dealing with environmental and amenity matters it seems there is a very strong argument for the involvement of amenity and environmental interests.  This would be particularly necessary in the case of the Liffey Valley.  Such joint authorities should include those additional interests.  I want to allow others the opportunity to speak but I would press the case of the Liffey Valley and the importance of an authority commensurate with its importance nationally and internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I really need clarification &mdash; I am not sure how I will get it in the time left &mdash; of the Minister's amendment which provides that the principal authority may hold such meetings of members of the authority and other principal authorities. Would that include meetings of one of the local authorities with the Dublin Regional Authority?  A nod from the Minister would satisfy my requirements in relation to that.  I feel strongly that as we have not had the opportunity to debate the structures and functions of the new tier of government being introduced by diktat by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, we need to know how it will inter-relate with the local authorities in Dublin.  We also need to know what co-ordinating and strategic planning function the Dublin Regional Authority may or may not have and as my next amendment &mdash; which will probably not be reached&mdash;indicates, there are certain areas of concern, particularly housing that will need strategic planning and co-operation right across the four local authorities that will now cover the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister's amendment will allow for joint meetings of local authorities and the Dublin Regional Authority.  We do not know how representation from the local authorities to the regional authority will be organised. In the absence of a debate we do not know what is happening.  I wish to record my deep disgust and disdain at the manner in which this Government is operating in regard to introducing a new <Col N="1982" /> tier of regional government without debate in the House.  Clarification is needed on amendment No. 28 and in respect of the strategic planning of the Dublin Regional Authority, and the co-ordinating of public services which will be the responsibility of four local authorities in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Points in relation to the amendment have been well made and I am aware that time is marching on.  I wish to comment on amendment No. 28. There has been a debate on the regional authorities, their roles and the Minister's thinking in that regard.  I was struck by the vagueness of the amendment.  It is not specific.  It states:</P>
      <P>...A principal authority may hold such joint meetings of members of the authority and other principal authorities or local authorities as may be necessary for the purposes of this section.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State knows the Minister's reasoning behind that amendment.  Will the Minister indicate its precise meaning?  Deputy Sargent's amendment is more specific and understandable.  The Minister's amendment which was an attempt to head off Deputy Sargent's amendment, is too vague.  The section does not clarify matters for me or, I am sure, for other Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has more to say on this matter and I look forward to hearing his comments.  His earlier comments did not address my main concern.  I thank the other speakers who, apart from their words of wisdom, have given the Minister time to reflect and, hopefully, as Deputy Keogh said head off my amendment.  The Minister's amendment goes some way towards addressing the issue but, nonetheless, further clarification is required.  The Bill should include some measure that will allow the holding of meetings rather than them being postponed and, in many cases, not held as has happened.  That has been my experience in relation to <Col N="1983" /> meetings of Dublin County Council. Joint meetings are not being held as often as they should because one or other authority decides they are not necessary.  That point must be addressed in the amendment which I will have to press if this matter is not clarified.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will include a provision that will provide for the requisitioning of a meeting between local authorities. Unlike Deputy Doyle who spoke from a wider viewpoint having regard to her interests in Wexford, I referred to the Dublin local authorities as the title of the Bill indicates this legislation provides for local authorities in Dublin.  The proposed legislation on regional authorities will provide the answers to many of the other questions raised.  I hope the legislation will not be restrictive.</P>

      <Col N="1989" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I commended the Minister for introducing the Bill and I commend her also for taking this action in relation to apprenticeships here.</P>
      <P>As we speak, a total of 300,000 people are out of work.  A very high percentage of the unemployed are young people under the age of 25.  The young people who are hardest hit are those who leave school without any qualifications, who do not get proper training and who stand to be condemned to a life of long term unemployment.  It is of crucial importance that urgent action be taken with regard to these people.  To enable the Minister to address this problem it is fundamentally important we put in place a proper system of apprenticeship.</P>
      <P>Parents who are concerned about the future of their children say that the best that is on offer at present are short courses with no long term prospects.  When they seek access for young people to apprenticeship schemes they find it almost impossible because the current entry system is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to put in place a procedure whereby persons seeking apprenticeships are officially registered so that employers seeking to take on apprentices would draw them from persons on that register.  That would be the most sensible way of introducing an equitable entry to apprenticeship schemes.  In addition, I urge the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to talk to the construction industry.  Time was when the construction industry and its members took on a number of apprentices but, with the changes in the industry in recent times, fewer places are available.  The system needs to be examined.  The only way the position can be remedied is by the Minister negotiating with the industry and extracting a commitment to taking on a number of apprentices on a systematic basis.  A great deal needs to be done but <Col N="1990" /> we must begin somewhere.  The construction industry used to create opportunities in a very basic skill.</P>
    <P>Apart from our worry about the high rate of youth unemployment there is the additional worry that this country could face a shortage of skills.  Would it not be an irony to have so many young people unemployed if, at the same time, when jobs came on stream, we did not have people sufficiently well qualified in the requisite skills to take on those jobs?  We should look to Germany if we want a model for a good combination of education and training that fits people for life, giving them not alone the skills they need but the motivation to undertake the work.  They also acquire management skills, so that a number of them will not merely find employment but go on to become employers themselves.  That must be the ideal objective.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very concerned to get this done well but there are a number of areas in which we need to bring ourselves into line with European standards.  We are spending billions on our roads and bridges, on the physical infrastructure of the country.  It is equally important to make an investment in our young people, to bring the level and standard of their training and education up to those in our competitor countries within the European Union.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and commend what the Minister of State is doing.  However, it constitutes only one small but key element in what needs to be done to tackle the overall matter of apprenticeships because the present position is chaotic and serves nobody well.  The Minister of State has a large task in hand, but the sooner it is tackled the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a modest measure designed to give expression to some of the case that has been made over very many years now, not least by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for reforms of the apprenticeship system as we have known it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in her introductory remarks on Second Stage, set out clearly that although the traditional time-served <Col N="1991" /> apprenticeship system, in the context of its time, did a reasonable job, it left a great deal to be desired.  I would not quibble with many of the things the Minister of State said in terms of identifying the inadequacies of the old apprenticeship system.  It was indeed fragmented and lacked coherence so that, at the end of the period of apprenticeship, there was still no certification of skills, no certificate acceptable or exchangeable internationally.</P>
    <P>For example, a discussion document produced by the Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Labour in 1990, pointed to a number of shortcomings in the current apprenticeship scheme. Among them were the absence of compulsory standards &mdash; there was no compulsory competancy-based standard which an apprentice must attain to operate as a craft worker; inadequate provision for evolving technology &mdash; the current system was regarded as having been too rigid to cope with the requirements of updating of skills in the light of new technology and inequity of entry because the entry mechanism was not always based on the best candidate getting the apprenticeship.  These are serious, limiting criticisms of the old apprenticeship system.  For example, there was no variation of tasks.  This could mean that an apprentice could not move to a second employer.  On the matter of inequity at entry, too much of the old system was based on the favoured son.  In other words, if somebody had the ear of the boss, then the son, and it was usually the son&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the boss's friend always had an unfair advantage in terms of gaining access to an apprenticeship scheme.  Of course, it is unacceptable that qualified young people should be ignored for access to a particular craft simply because of selection, if made purely on the basis of the relationship to the owner <Col N="1992" /> of the company, or on whether one's father happened to be a friend of the owner.</P>
      <P>There is a further disturbing aspect to this question of inequity at entry which relates to the very poor level of participation by women in apprenticeship. According to FÁS's own figures, in 1992 there were 13,632 registered apprentices, of whom just 196 were female, representing 1.4 per cent of the total.  Even allowing for traditional attitudes, this is an abysmal figure and there has been virtually no increase in the overall percentage of female apprenticeships in recent years.  I cannot find any reference to this in the Minister's introductory remarks, although I am quite certain she did refer to it in her introduction.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for more effective measures to increase the number of women participating in the new apprenticeship scheme.  I acknowledge that part of the problem has been that traditional occupations designated for apprentices, such as electricians, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, printers and mechanics have been male-dominated while the occupations with traditionally high levels of female participation, such as hairdressing, textiles, clothing, distribution and so on, were not designated under the 1959 Apprenticeship Act. Clearly, the attitudes of some employers has also been an obstacle.  Indeed, I confess that some of the more traditionalist trade union attitudes have also demonstrated a reluctance to encourage the opening up of these areas to women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be part of the reason there has been so little progress in regard to closing the gap between male and female earnings, as apprenticeship is the recognised path to many of the more highly paid skills in trades.  The most recent figures to which I have access, published by the Central Statistics Office, show the average male industrial weekly earnings at £283.87 while those for women were just £176.41, a gap of £107.46.  For example, in September 1985 the respective figures were £205.07 for men and £114.58 for women.  Therefore, in seven years the gap between male and female <Col N="1993" /> earnings had increased by £17 per week. In September 1985 female earnings represented approximately 55 per cent of the male equivalent whereas, by September 1992, that ratio had crept up to 62 per cent only.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is a comment on the effectiveness of equal pay legislation.  It is clear that traditional attitudes to apprenticeship provide one part of the explanation.  In addition to the need to strengthen the terms of both the 1974 Act and the 1977 Employment Equality Act, there is a need to address the structural inequalities resulting in so many women going into low-earning industries.  Clearly apprenticeships have an important role to play in this regard.  I would like to hear the Minister state clearly what measures she proposes to take that will oblige employers and, indeed, anyone else who seeks to obstruct the process, to permit an increase in the level of participation of women in apprenticeships.  There may have been a paragraph in the Minister's speech which I missed but I would like to tempt her again to tell the House precisely what measures she proposes to take.  We have seen that exhortation alone is not sufficient.  If my memory serves me correctly, the Minister said that £30 million from the Exchequer is going towards the apprenticeship system.  I am not sure how that is calculated but I do not query the figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a huge sum of taxpayers' money and in return we are entitled to assert some principles in the area.  As I understand it, Forfás operates a system of bursaries for employers who take on women apprentices in addition to male apprentices, which I think is of the order of £2,400.  I understand that sum is for the duration of the apprenticeship scheme rather than per annum. I do not know whether it is envisaged that the fund we are creating as a result of this legislation will mean that it will be paid from this fund in future or whether additional bursaries will be dispensed <Col N="1994" /> from the new fund.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
      <P>I approach this Bill from the point of view of the necessity to upgrade the skills base of Irish workers.  If we are to have an enhanced economic performance it is important that we have the most skilled and mobile workforce possible, capable of competing with any international standards. There is no difficulty for Irish workers matching the skills levels of other European countries provided we get this right.  Obviously, in the context of the internal market it is more important than ever that that is the case.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Quill refer to the German system.  The German system is quite interesting and fundamentally different from the system we operate.  I would refer the Minister to a document from the Department of Education and Science in Britain, produced by Her Majesty's inspectorate entitled &ldquo;Aspects of vocational education and training in the Federal Republic of Germany&rdquo;.  That probably dates it a little but not a great deal.  It is a very interesting assessment made on behalf of the British Government of the system in Germany.  For example, I should like to refer to a few points in this report:</P>
      <P>Ninety per cent of all school leavers in the FRG receive vocational education and training.  By law, all young people in training or employment must continue in part-time education up to the age of 18.  Seventy-two per cent of the school leavers at 16 enter training through the Dual System.</P>
      <P>They are stark statistics and probably go some considerable way towards explaining the success of Germany as an economic power.  The report continues:</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Vocational Training Act, employers may take on apprentices in any of 378 recognised training occupations only on the basis of a contract whereby they guarantee to provide appropriate training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our crafts, designed under the Apprenticeship Act, have been rather limited and old fashioned and operate very much <Col N="1995" /> in the male dominated world.  I presume without having gone into it in any great detail, that the 378 recognised training occupations implies that there is almost no activity that is not considered eligible in the German economy.  I was interested to hear from the director of FÁS in my own region &mdash; at a different function last night &mdash; that he was rather chuffed at having secured a system of placement which &mdash; as the area is dominated by women &mdash; I presume is for women.  This system will be with the retail trade and in effect is an apprenticeship.  The places had been provided by the companies in the Tallaght area and this appears to be worthwhile.  I quote again from the report as follows:</P>
    <P>Trainees are assessed for their vocational certificate solely through the intermediate and final examinations...</P>
    <P>Progression routes through the educational system of the FRG to higher education appear to be well understood by students...In the FRG, vocational schools are often mono-technics and concentrate on provision for a particular category of student...There is greater parity of esteem in the FRG than in the United Kingdom between academic and vocational courses and their respective qualifications.  Sixteen per cent of all trainees in the Dual System hold the <i>Abitur</i> (leaving certificate from the <i>Gymnasium</i> and the university entrance qualification) and commence their apprenticeship at the age of 18 or 19; some then progress to higher education after gaining their vocational certificate.</P>
    <P>It is a markedly different approach to the question of apprenticeship and is one well worth examining.  The Minister refers to it in her script where she refers to the changes identified in the White Paper. She said employers were not taking sufficient responsibility for training apprentices compared with the German system where employers must provide adequate on-the-job training and release apprentices <Col N="1996" /> for off-the-job training.  Irish employers, were, for the most part, not committed to apprenticeship training. That is the key point and it has much to do with our economic performance because in this country too many employers regard training as a cost rather than an investment.  That is the point being made by the Minister.  Employers regard training as a cost, unlike the Germans who regard it as an investment.  For example, there is no difficulty in Germany when somebody has completed their apprenticeship about their being poached by another company because the system provides the basic level of training.  Here that has been a big problem because many companies have gone out of their way to avoid their contribution but at the same time have been confident that they can poach apprentices as soon as they have served their time. In the experience of the trade unions, this has been a factor here.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, up to now off-the-job training has not been compulsory. As a result a great many employers simply would not pay for off-the-job training.  That has been one of the key defects.  I do not know whether the Minister knows how effectively the Bill will cope with that phenomenon. Take, for example the phenomenal changes that have taken place in the construction industry in recent years and the proliferation of sub-contractors.  You cannot contract a building company now to do any kind of work without the contractor, in turn, sub-contracting it 100 times.  There is a proliferation of what used to be called C2 certificates, now C45 certificates.</P>
    <P>Everybody is a self-employed contractor and I do not know how we will bring them within the ambit of this levy. I do not envisage these hard-nosed self-employed contractors volunteering to pay their share of the levy.  Of course, the proliferation of these one man companies militates against the necessary range of skills and variation of tasks being acquired by apprentices.</P>
    <P>The Bill really is defined in terms of its relationship to the social welfare legistracto <Col N="1997" /> lation and I do not know if there is any other yardstick that we might apply to try to get these contractors into the net or if other labour legislation might prove more effective in that area.  I note that the Minister may vary the amount of the levy by order.  As far as I can see there is no provision in the Bill that requires the Minister to consult on that, but I think it is desirable that she should consult in this matter.  I think it is entirely appropriate that the Minister has this power as it may very well be necessary to vary the levy for a variety of reasons. I am not sure I understand how the figure of 0.25 per cent was arrived at.  I know the Irish Congress of Trade Unions started out from the position of seeking a 1 per cent levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Another 1 per cent levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>An irony that it should be seeking a 1 per cent levy, having regard to the other 1 per cent levy.  That was the position.  I do not know whether it has been calculated that the 0.25 per cent levy will meet the cost of training, having regard to the number of apprentices in the system and the provision of approximately 40 weeks off-the-job training over the course of the apprenticeship. Presumably, the Minister may have to use the facility to vary the levy, but I think this should be done only after consultation.  Before we increase the levy we should look at the question of those who seek to evade their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which is a reforming measure, is broadly welcome.  I hope it will put an end to the system that obtained up to now of employers being reluctant to train apprentices in off-the-job and on-the-job skills because in many cases they lost them after they had served their time.  There is a need to focus on the construction industry because it is very slow to change.  The latest figures that FÁS has suggest that 1,000 apprentices in the construction industry have been laid off.  That was never the case before we introduced the system of scaled fees.  In the old days, when apprentices <Col N="1998" /> were taken on for £10 a week, they were regarded as a source of cheap labour for the construction industry and were never laid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It was almost sacrosanct in the past that the last person to be laid off was the apprentice, although in many cases he may have been making the tea or painting the gasometer for the four years of his training, which did not enhance his repertoire of skills, but he was not let go.  Regrettably, they are now frequently let go and the construction industry is one of the worst offenders in this regard.  As far as I know, training is well up to standard in the print industry. The same applies to engineering and the change in pace of technology has required the industry to stay in touch. The fixed location has been a factor also. In the construction industry by definition workers have to follow their work and therefore it is more difficult to monitor and supervise the industry than it is in the case of the engineering sector. The whole situation has drastically changed in the motor industry in terms of car maintenance and other requirements in that area.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, I am concerned that the Minister would examine with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions her ability to police and impose the spirit of the Bill in what have traditionally been known as the wet trades.  In these trades the phenomenon of the one-man operation is proliferation and I am concerned where it will lead in terms of skilled manpower in the years ahead.  That is particularly important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will again address the German dual system of vocational schooling.  In many ways it can be said that this system respects everybody and all of the talents. The system has not just a strong vocational content but is closely linked to industry.  An important point, as I said already, is that industry accepts that involvement voluntarily.  I am not seeking to make an argument in favour of <Col N="1999" /> turning schools into &ldquo;skill factories&rdquo; for industry, but I make a plea to those who run our education system and to industry to take all students, all talents and all abilities seriously.</P>
    <P>I believe a policy on human capital must be at the centre of indigenous industrial development, or we will not have that development.  It is as simple as that. Our vocational schools have become by and large &ldquo;me too&rdquo; secondary schools chasing the leaving certificate, which is run for the benefit of the universities.  I think our education system has done very well within its own terms, but if one considers the traditional vocational system of the sixties it was a second rate system for the working class.  The introduction of free secondary education gave the working class an opportunity to pass judgment on the system, which they did, by and large by rejecting it.</P>
    <P>Now we have secondary schools, comprehensive schools, community schools and vocational schools, all different in name but essentially doing the same thing &mdash; academic education.  What else do we have?  FÁS community based workshops are in effect involved in retraining and remedial education through various schemes.  There may well be an argument to consider spinning off some of the excellent community workshop effort into a new vocational education system. Essentially, I believe that is what FÁS is doing.  We should give FÁS credit for what it is doing, as well as the resources to do it well, and put its work off limits to the entire education system.</P>
    <P>I know that a great many in the education system would object to that notion, but when one examines the situation one sees that we have a work environment that is characterised by the following features.  Well over half of Irish employees receive no training of any sort in any year.  Only one-fifth receive formal off-the-job training and only one-fifth receive on-the-job training.  Expenditure on training per employee is £97 per annum compared with £328 in Britain, which, as we have just seen, is no great shakes, and certainly no great shakes <Col N="2000" /> when compared with Germany; 65 per cent of employees in very small firms receive no formal training and 10 per cent of employees of large firms get training. Only 30 per cent of managers get training compared with 50 per cent in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  It is a long overdue improvement on the traditional apprenticeship system we have had.  It has taken a long time to get this far.  We can deal with matters in detail on Committee Stage.  The literature produced by FÁS looks very well and it suggests that people in FÁS are taking the question of apprenticeship seriously.  Apprentices are likely to have their prospects enhanced as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. I have been involved in teaching apprentices for many years and I am very much aware that it is important to introduce some reforming measure.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, employers did not always take the training role seriously and, not-withstanding the old adage that the apprentice was the last one to be let go, at this stage he was the last one to be taken on.</P>
      <P>In introducing a new scheme we should note the success of the old apprentice training scheme and acknowledge the excellence of the standards achieved by teachers, instructors and employers who gave apprentices on the job training.  We can be proud that many of our apprentices have won gold, silver and bronze medals at the skills olympics.  I take pride that the Regional College, Cork, has produced many medal winners over the years, including one gold medal winner this year.  We should not throw everything away as there were good aspects to the old apprenticeship scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education element in any apprentice <Col N="2001" /> scheme is very important as are communications and social skills.  In the past a very narrow view of apprenticeship training was propounded.  Apprenticeship was seen in a narrow technical light and it was pitiful to see young men and women with excellent skills but without communications skills when it came to the theoretical side of examinations. The Minister should make certain that the education element is maintained in any new scheme introduced.  I am delighted that the Minister decided to introduce a new apprenticeship scheme on a phased basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister graciously received a number of deputations and the end product has satisfied teachers in the regional colleges.  However, there are still a number of worrying trends. Deputy Rabbitte pinpointed building sites.  I understand that the 15 trades introduced on a phased basis in the pilot scheme this September represent about 20 per cent of the apprentice intake.  I also understand that there could be up to a 50 per cent drop in the number of people participating in these trades so far this year.  I understand that the printing, vehicle light body and agricultural machinery courses have their usual intake; but in painting, where last year there were over 60 apprentices, we may take on perhaps only four this year.</P>
      <P>There has been a dramatic change in the building trade; gone are the days when the main contractor had 150 to 200 workers on site.  If he now has four or five on site, that is the limit of it.  There are subcontractors employing people on a self-employed basis.  That removes the initiative to take on apprentices.  When reviewing this we would want to have regard to that important sector of the economy and ensure that numbers are increased in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in her speech indicated that a training and assessment programme can allow apprentices to progress to technician level and obtain other <Col N="2002" /> qualifications.  I envisage a number of difficulties here in that somebody who takes up an apprenticeship tends to stick to the chosen trade and only a low percentage have opted for further education. Practical difficulties will also arise, given that we have never had proper synchronisation between the technician course and the subject matter pursued by the apprentice.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Education the Minister will know that certification of technician courses comes within the ambit of the National Council of Educational Awards, CERT has the NCBB and the universities have their own certification. We are now introducing a fourth or fifth element of certification.  At the end of the day we want certification achieved in Ireland to be recognised internationally.  Will the Minister consider, given that apprentices can progress to technician courses, whether it would be worthwhile establishing an umbrella body with overall responsibility for certification in the three or four areas mentioned, which certification would be internationally recognised, while at the same time we could have a sub-element giving certification for the individual achievements?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was important to cover an adequate number of skills but that it was also important to update skills on an ongoing basis.  In the present system where is there provision for updating skills on an ongoing basis? By and large, management in Ireland is very slow to invest in training programmes. We probably have one of the lowest percentage rates for employer involvement in training in Europe.  We must encourage employers to invest in additional training.  It is estimated that the Minister will take in £4 million every year through the levy, which is very well structured and even handed and does not place a great burden on industry.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that over a period we will have a surplus, having regard to the levy and the amount of money to be paid out.  The Minister in her speech mentioned that if there was a surplus it would be carried forward from year to year. <Col N="2003" /> Perhaps it might be worth considering setting up a fund for ongoing training for further incentives to ensure that the flexibility and adaptability of our craftspersons are kept up to date and that they are on a par with those in other member states and internationally.  When the UK economy was booming our apprentices were far more adaptable and better trained than those in the UK.  Will the Minister ensure the skills of our apprentices and craftspeople are kept up-to-date by setting up such a fund?</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the inequitable access to apprenticeships and I welcome the Minister's commitment to review that matter.  Perhaps she would make it mandatory for employers taking on an apprentice to have a FÁS official as part and parcel of the interviewing process.  It is demoralising for young people to feel they have not got a fair crack of the whip; where possible, the best applicant should get the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.  I want to highlight two matters, the first relates to the cost to industry of employing apprentices. A number of industries in my constituency, such as the Irish Sugar Company and a German company called Lapple who have produced international gold winners during the past number of years, are to the fore in training apprentices. One of the problems those companies continually highlight is the cost of training them.  The Minister stated that a contribution will be made to industry for off-site training for apprentices.  In an increasingly competitive commercial environment all industries must examine their costs and this contribution will go some way towards covering some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received many complaints about the manner in which some companies recruit apprentices.  It is accepted, rightly or wrongly, that such companies recruit only the sons or daughters of their managers or employees.  I do not know how the problem can be tackled but it might <Col N="2004" /> be of assistance to have officials from an outside agency involved in interviewing potential apprentices.  There appears to be a great deal of inequality in the manner in which some industries select their apprentices.  Another matter of concern is that when such well qualified young persons are unable to secure apprenticeships they have great difficulty in finding industrial sponsors elsewhere. That problem must be addressed.  Also, in the past there have been far too few female apprentices in the trades and I hope that will be rectified under this legislation. I acknowledge the Minister made that point in her speech.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the fact that the new system will be based on standards achieved rather than on the traditional time served.  That is an important point and it is important also that the standards achieved under the old apprenticeship system are maintained because, internationally, we are noted for our excellent standards and I would not like them to slip.  I welcome that in future craftspeople will have to hold a national craft certificate and that special provision will be made to encourage the recruitment of female apprentices.  The new system will be based on uniform pre-specified and industry-agreed standards.  Because of the large number of multinational companies locating here our standards will be continually reviewed by their parent companies and, therefore, it is important to maintain high standards.  I wish the Minister success with the legislation because it will improve the old system and tidy up some loose ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation which will strengthen and boost our training and apprenticeship programmes.  I compliment the Minister for the manner in which she presented the legislation and the fact that she met various groups and took on board many of their suggestions in the run-up to the introduction of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I started my career as an apprentice in CIE and I want to outline the achievements of the apprenticeship schemes <Col N="2005" /> down through the years.  From the 1960s onwards our apprentices have been of the highest quality and served our country excellently in various international competitions. Obviously, with the change in industry over the years it was necessary to improve the apprenticeship scheme and this legislation is the next step.  There has always been an element of training and education in apprenticeship schemes and I would not like to see the education element put on the back burner.  In the past many apprentices who did not have an opportunity to take up third level education used apprenticeship schemes to gain further education and many of them proceeded to third level education.  The apprenticeship scheme is tried and tested and has a long history.  It is a system of education and should provide apprentices with as broad a range of skills and talents as possible.  Apprentices should be given an opportunity to learn a wide range of skills covering the entire discipline within a trade rather than the skills of one employment.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the levy will assist apprentices in employment.  However, what will happen a young person who has attained an apprenticeship and the firm goes out of operation with the loss of his or her job?  Who will assist that person? It should be possible for such people to continue training with FÁS and for the system to endeavour to find a possible employer for them.</P>
    <P>Every person should have an opportunity to avail of apprenticeship training without having to depend on someone they know, like their father or mother. In addition, we should encourage more women to avail of this training.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister of State to provide more places so that people will be able to avail of job opportunities.  In conclusion, I compliment the Minister of State on what she has achieved to date.</P>

      <P>One would have thought that the process of change and reform identified in the 1986 White Paper on Manpower would have led long before now to the measures introduced by the Minister of State.  Unfortunately, it took some time to complete the analysis.  In 1987, FÁS was asked to modernise the training system and to make recommendations. In 1989, a discussion document was produced and it drew the inevitable response by way of a raft of submissions.  A report was presented to the Minister for Labour in 1990.  In 1991 under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a national apprenticeship advisory committee was established which was followed by the Culliton report and the report of the Moriarty Task Force.  Finally, in 1993 the changes in the funding arrangements and the apprenticeship training system were announced and now this legislation has been introduced. I wish to pay tribute to the Minister of State who within three months of her appointment announced that she would introduce this Bill and an apprenticeship scheme which she hoped would serve the country well for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures designed to introduce changes for the better are welcome but I am extremely worried that many of the problems that have arisen as the current apprenticeship scheme falls into disrepute have not been resolved.  Time and again our hearts have gone out to those who have come to our clinics with what one might describe as &ldquo;two good hands and a good head&rdquo;, who have spent months hawking his or her talents to the medium and small employer circuit and who are punch drunk and demoralised having been told repeatedly, &ldquo;sorry, we have no place for you&rdquo;.  I have seen <Col N="2007" /> dozens of people from my constituency end up with sledgehammers and pickaxes doing raw boned labour on building sites in Dublin or Dundee living not alone on much lower wages but also with the bottled up frustration associated with untapped talent and, in some cases, downright genius.</P>
    <P>The reason is that over the years FÁS has progressively reduced the number of direct FÁS-sponsored places in its training centres and switched the emphasis in the direction in which the new proposals are based, that is, insisting that more apprentices must be sponsored by employers.  It is this policy which has led to the merry-go-round of myriad refusals and the eventual exclusion of many talented young people.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the best employers of young apprentices have, traditionally, been the small and medium-sized businesses but the economic recession has wreaked havoc on these and, by extension, on the apprenticeship scheme. Deputy Rabbitte alluded to the fact that far too many employers regard training as a cost; they do not see the benefit for their company in skill enhancement.  We have to accept that many companies which have traditionally employed apprentices cannot afford to sponsor them.  In many cases, we are talking about companies with slender profit margins, huge overheads such as rates, levies, PRSI, over-extended credit and cashflow problems.  Many are barely able to keep their heads above water with excessive bank charges.  Many of the good traditional sponsors of apprentices under the old National Manpower and FÁS schemes were soured by their experiences. They were snowed under and bewildered by the paperwork involved in taking on an apprentice electrician, carpenter or plumber.  We seem to be obsessed with red tape and this is killing jobs, enthusiasm and initiative and it has led to the closing off of opportunities for many young people to avail of apprenticeship training.</P>
    <P>I am aware that FÁS will deny this but I have seen it happen; when a person <Col N="2008" /> from a reasonably comfortable background, without the same manual skills and ability as someone from a less well off background, was unable to obtain sponsorship their parents were able to go to an employer, for example, in my constituency, and undertake to pay the wages, the PRSI and do the paperwork if they would be allowed to use the company name and stamp as sponsor.  That is the only way they could get around or circumvent the system and it worked but the problem was that the talented young person in many cases was excluded. There is a danger that this will happen again because companies are genuinely reluctant, for financial considerations, to enter sponsorship arrangements.</P>
    <P>The number of companies who support apprentices has been reduced considerably because employers were disgruntled at the fact that FÁS was tardy in reimbursing them for apprentices' wages and other additional costs.  This red tape and foot-dragging killed the goodwill not alone of the many employers who were well disposed but also frightened off many other prospective sponsors.  Even if the economic recession lifts and there is a tendency or a willingness on the part of a company to sponsor more apprentices companies will not be amenable unless there is a major public relations drive to sell the new apprenticeship arrangement and erase the bad memories some companies had under the former scheme.  In this regard, it is vital that career guidance counsellors &mdash; there is a number of excellent career guidance counsellors &mdash; and FÁS officials establish a bridgehead immediately with employers, a portfolio of receptive companies and dismantle whatever barriers exist and dispel any anxiety or worries companies may have.  Any new scheme will have to be simplified, modified, streamlined and devoid of red tape.</P>
    <P>Measures designed to introduce changes for the better are welcome.  Ultimately, what I want to know and, more importantly, what numerous would-be apprentices want to know is whether we can guarantee that the manually gifted young people, many of whom have failed <Col N="2009" /> to gain access to apprenticeship courses up to now, will be guaranteed access and entry under the new appenticeship arrangements.  I am extremely apprehensive that the small but valuable number of directly sponsored FÁS apprenticeships will not be a feature of the new scheme.  In his contribution Deputy Ryan asked what would happen if an apprentice two years into his course found that the company had gone out of business.  There will have to be a safety net to rescue these people.  Apart from this, a number of places should be retained by FÁS.</P>
    <P>This scheme will be employer led and unless a person can get an employer to sponsor him or her there is no way that they will be able to avail of apprenticeship training.  We have been told that the number of apprentices will be increased but I cannot see this happening because this scheme will be employer led and, irrespective of the way we might encourage companies in the interests of skill enhancement which is vitally important, companies will not be in a position to give a commitment to guarantee employment for an apprenticeship for a minimum of three years allowing intermittent breaks to attend off-the-job training at FÁS centres, regional technical colleges and so on.  Undoubtedly, some companies will, but I cannot envisage the anticipated boom envisaged by supporters of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I like the mix whereby there will be seven phases.  Phases one, three, five and seven will involve on-the-job training while phase two will involve training with FÁS and phases four and six will involve training with the regional technical colleges or the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  It is a good mix but, again, I seek clarification.  Like Deputies O'Keeffe, Ryan and other speakers, I believe there should be no dilution of the education content.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland expressed reservations about this aspect.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the Minister's comments as the Teachers' Union of Ireland has reacted.  The Minister makes a valid point that many apprentices are <Col N="2010" /> now going in with leaving certificates; heretofore they were going in with group certificates.  From the point of view of receptivity, flexibility and adaptability, the maximum education component possible should be retained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill spoke about the drastic shortage of working opportunities for young people nowadays.  The crisis in unemployment for young people is underlined by the fact that the Dublin City Manager recently confirmed that a public advertisement to fill two vacancies for fire brigade staff attracted 2,319 applications. The ESB's annual advertisement for electrical apprentices this year attracted responses from 7,500 applicants but there were only 50 apprenticeships; 7,450 young people were disappointed. For training in its three constituent companies, Iarnrod Éireann, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus, CIE had 2,500 applications for 53 apprenticeship positions. The 36 Army apprenticeship and 30 Air Corps apprenticeships attracted over 4,000 applications.  Bord na Móna, which for years trained a large number of high quality apprentices, took on only four apprentices last September in the peat energy section and another two apprentices in the solid fuels section.  The situation, therefore, is critical.</P>
    <P>Over 15,000 students doing the leaving certificate each year do not get into college either because they do not meet the academic criteria for entry or because of financial circumstances.  We should be seriously looking at whether the apprenticeship scheme will meet the requirements of these students.  In light of the fact that many of these companies receive substantial amounts of Government equity the Minister should talk to these companies to see if they might lead the way by taking on additional apprentices.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in relation to apprenticeships for girls.  One of the problems seems to be psychological as evidenced by the ESB report in which it is stated that they cannot induce girls to apply for ESB positions even though they are very well paid and have the opportunity to reach the top level.  For example, there are 1,037 male electricians <Col N="2011" /> and only six female electricians. The ratio is somewhat better at apprentice level with 15 women and 184 men but there is still much work to be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the proposed National Training and Certification Board.  I look forward to graduates coming out with an enhanced qualification which will enable them to ply their wares on world markets and receive recognition, apart from what it will do for our economy.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts about this new apprenticeship scheme.  I would have preferred to allow the two pilot projects to continue and be evaluated.  However, as the Bill had such a tortuous passage to its present stage, I suppose we could not wait any longer.  We await the Committee Stage debate when I hope we will have more input.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing the House on this Bill.  A number of good things have been said about the Bill but some reservations have been expressed to me.  In the short time available to me I hope to outline some of those reservations.  They centre particularly on the educational content of the future apprenticeship training course.</P>
      <P>The needs and values of a soundly based apprenticeship system cannot be over-emphasised.  A strong apprenticeship base will be the key to success within many of our high-employment sectors across the country.  The apprentices of today will be the tradespersons, business people and entrepreneurs of tomorrow. I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 9 March 1993.  Christina Murphy, education correspondent said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going into an apprenticeship and becoming a successful tradesperson may be a more common route to establishing one's own business than acquiring a third level education.  According to a recent survey of successful apprentices, 59 out of 180 tradespeople interviewed, <Col N="2012" /> one in three had set up in business.  Of the winners of the national apprenticeship competition since 1973, who have been traced, one-third had set up their own business, 24 per cent were in senior management or supervisory roles.  Another 20 per cent were still employed in the company with which they had trained, 13 per cent were employed in teaching or instructing and 8 per cent had gone on to further education.  Only 2 per cent were unemployed.</P>
    <P>The fact that one-third of these people were running their own business now proves that there are good business opportunities for qualified people and we should of course encourage people to develop in this area.  This is also an endorsement of the successful apprenticeship scheme, which, until now, operated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The OECD in its report &ldquo;Education and Economy in a Changing Society&rdquo; placed emphasis on the need for &ldquo;A high quality of basic education&rdquo; as an essential prerequisite for a vocationally skilled and adaptable labour force.  I quote again from that report: &ldquo;The role played by initial education and training in OECD countries is crucial for the successful performance of their economies and in broader terms their full functioning as democratic societies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper on Education it stated:</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the achievement of economic growth and industrial development is dependent, to a significant degree, on the availability of qualified personnel, with the necessary technical and vocational skills and competences.  The availability of skilled personnel is, in turn, dependent on the efficiency and effectiveness in the vocational education and training system.  Within the European Community, it is evident that, to a significant extent, the relatively high rate of economic development in countries such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands is due to their well-developed <Col N="2013" /> vocational education and training systems.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper goes on to make the following recommendations.  First, training must be broad-based rather than job-specific and be such as to encourage the development of a spirit of enterprise and of flexibility of approach to problem-solving situations.  Second, standards of general education must be maintained and enhanced as an essential basis for development of higher-level skills and competences.  Third, the relationship between the education and training systems and the economy they serve must be strengthened, in order to ensure that the providers of education and training programmes can obtain immediate and clear information on the nature, scope and extent of skills required for economic growth and development.  Those recommendations are directly at variance with the new apprenticeship training scheme, as initiated by this Minister.  The new modular system, based on apprentice competence, is narrow in its perspective and will lead to a lowering of standards within the apprenticeship system, as previously operated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The broad-based training of the past is being replaced by a narrow &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; curriculum.  The broader educational components such as mathematics, craft calculations, etc., and other theoretical subjects will be severely curtailed in this new scheme.  This must surely be a retrograde step and will lead to tradespersons with fewer academic skills who will be poorly motivated towards advancement to supervisory and management grades in their chosen professions. This is the result of the down-grading of the educational inputs into the new apprenticeship scheme and will close the door to job opportunities that were open to our craftspersons in the past.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of giving apprentices an education for living &mdash; an awareness and an understanding of relationships and their role in society, an appreciation of themselves, as persons, and an understanding of their responsibilities to society.  This new apprenticeship <Col N="2014" /> course will not give this.  The standards of training within the new scheme will be subject to a variety of standards.  The seven phase module system provides for four of these to be assessed and monitored by the local employer.  Let me put forward a possible scenario: a builder, with five employees, takes on an apprentice carpenter.  He is approached by this young person to say that he has to be assessed on the geometry of roofing a house.  Since the builder is at that stage on his present job the apprentice sees it as an opportunity to prove his skills.  I can guess the response from that builder when the apprentice asks if he can roof the house.  It will be to sign the document and get on with the job of roofing the house in the usual way. Is that not a real worry?  Who is going to standardise the testing of these apprentices on the job?  Will standards not be in danger of erosion?  Will there be outside monitoring?  Who will pay for the materials used in these assessments?  Why abandon the tried and tested systems available in the Department of Education? These are crucial questions which need answers.</P>

    <P>In addition to the recruitment drop, there are now more than 1,000 redundant apprentices.  There are a further 451 redundant apprentices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister <Col N="2016" /> on introducing this legislation, which is badly needed at present.  We have awaited a standard based system for apprentices for too long.  We need more courses, more places, more training officers and increased training allowances and expenses for apprentices.</P>
      <P>I welcome the concept of a national craft certificate which must be attained by craft workers and which recognises national and international standards. There were many main shortcomings under the old scheme.  Apprentices could qualify without reaching predefined standards, because the system was not standard based.  It was too restrictive in regard to the number of trades designated and covered only a small number of entrants to the workforce annually. Employers did not take sufficient responsibility for training apprentices. The system was an inflexible one, as the Minister stated when introducing the Bill.  It was not capable of ensuring that apprentices had either an adequate skills base or that skills were updated on an ongoing basis.  That was particularly relevant in trades where technology was rapidly changing.  It provided too few opportunities for women and did not facilitate late entry for mature students. It did not reflect that a higher educational entry standard applies in respect of apprentices today than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new system should be based on standards achieved rather than the traditional time served system.  It is only right that in future recognised craft workers must have attained the national craft certificate. There will be a minimum entry requirement and responsibility for recruitment will rest with industry with the assistance and co-operation of FÁS. Special provision should be made to encourage groups, such as the disadvantaged, to become apprentices.  I welcome the Minister's proposal to accommodate people with disability and mature students.  The new system will be modular with periods of on and off the job training.  I am pleased that the new system is standard based.  It will be based on uniform, pre-specified and industrial agreed standards.  The standards will be <Col N="2017" /> based on the highest standards of international practice.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the national craft certificate, which will be a compulsory requirement for craftperson's status, as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The new apprenticeship system will have nationally and internationally recognised certification.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal that the new apprenticeship levy will apply to the principal craft sectors of industry.  This will ensure that individual employers will not be directly out of pocket as a result of releasing apprentices for off the job training or education.  It will provide an incentive to employers to conform with the requirements of the apprenticeship curricula.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that in so far as possible favouritism is avoided and that the recruitment process is equitable.  I know of many cases where complaints were made, particularly in regard to recruitment to sponsorship courses, that they were not fair and equitable.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in future the recruitment system will be fair and equitable particularly in regard to sponsorship.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I thank the Minister.  I want to make two points.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  As Deputy O'Leary said, I hope it will lead to a more equitable system. Unfortunately, during the past number of years, we have seen a return to the old system where if one had money, one could buy an apprenticeship.  That is disappointing. That rules out many trained and skilled people from entry to an apprenticeship.  I hope the Bill will go some way towards redressing that position.  It took many years to change that practice and it is sad now that there is a return to it.  I look forward to its removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> I urge employers to respond to this initiative.  Deputy McGrath mentioned the decline in the number of apprentices. There are many reasons for that.  My experience from being involved in the sector for a number of years is that many employers wanted trained people but did not want the expense of training them. There are supports in place now to urge employers to provide training and I urge employers to avail of them for the good of our overall workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate, namely, Deputies Richard Bruton, Quill, Rabbitte, Batt O'Keeffe, Nolan, Seán Ryan, Jim Higgins, McGrath, O'Leary and Gallagher.  A large number of Deputies contributed and many others who wished to contribute will have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage. Many points were raised, but due to time constraints I will not be able to reply to them all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, while generally favouring the introduction of the new scheme, struck a chord with me when he asked if we were dealing with something which has a slightly old fashioned ring to it because of the way we stuck to designated trades, the number of years and the continuation of the narrowing of focus on one trade as distinct from equipping people with multi-skills.  His point was well made and I noted it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill generally approved the Bill and talked of the need to remedy the inequity and to establish a register which would provide a proper system to allow employers make an evaluation at the interview stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte welcomed the levy. He referred to the dual system in Germany and bemoaned the lack of acclaim we attribute to vocational skills here.  We still tend to acclaim the academic standards and do not give sufficient weight to vocational skills which may be gained by our young people.  We could learn a lesson from the German system.  Our second level schools, community schools, <Col N="2019" /> vocational schools and secondary schools have concentrated on academic subjects. A change has been made in this area.  It is everybody's wish that schools offer the traditional academic and vocational skills under one roof.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said we should keep the best of the old and mix it with the new, and that is a fair dictum.  When introducing a new scheme in any area there are always those who look back as well as those who look forward.  It is acceptable to mix old skills with new. Deputy Nolan, in welcoming the new scheme, spoke of his experience within his constituency in Carlow and the awards won through Lapple.  He also spoke about the Irish Sugar Company in the town of Carlow and the great tradition of skills and apprenticeships there. Deputy Sean Ryan spoke sound commonsense. While welcoming the new scheme he hoped that the strong educational base evident in the old scheme would be retained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins, in a very fine contribution, said that there is too much red tape and that it makes matters very difficult for small businesses in carrying out their business.  He said that a PR exercise is necessary to ensure the new scheme makes its mark and that industries respond to it.  He also spoke of the need for the scheme to be industry-led. Our intention is to ensure that is the case so that people will accept it.  I agree that some industries are experiencing difficulties and are reluctant to implement the scheme.  Industries should not take a short term view of the matter.  Like all Deputies, Deputy Higgins knows many bright young people whose confidence was diminished due to lack of access to apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Higgins, Deputy Paul McGrath does not agree with the modular system.  Obviously everybody has their own view on the matter.  The points put forward by Deputy McGrath have a sound educational basis and I am sure he had extensive consultation on the matter, which is to be welcomed.  I will certainly consider his views.  The Deputy said the <Col N="2020" /> new system is to blame for making apprentices redundant, but that is not the case because the scheme has not been in operation for long.  There is a large quantum of redundant apprentices as a result of the old system, for whom we have to make extensive accommodation arrangements.  Some Deputies, including Deputy John O'Leary, expressed the wish that these people be retrained or put on the new scheme of apprenticeships.  I repeat there are no redundant apprentices in the new scheme because it has only started.  Therefore, it is a fallacious argument.  I agree with the Deputy's point on the need for the whole person, the mind, heart and hand, to be engaged in the process of education and training. Clearly where this is the case the best work is done.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary spoke strongly about standards and favouritism.  It is my wish that the system is free of favouritism and strong on standards.  I am not prepared to stand over the type of activity evident in some quarters whereby favouritism is exhibited towards certain people.  In a country which contributes £30 million to the apprenticeship system it is unacceptable that that practice is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies from all sides raised the lack of sponsorship and its effect on the future.  In the drawing up of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and other documents published as far back as 1986, there was much talk about the new apprenticeship system but nothing seems to have been done.  The idea was that the system would be industry-led, hence the levy, and that it would apply to all industry.  A difficulty has arisen with regard to the withdrawal of FÁS sponsorship.  This is a problem of which I was conscious long before the new scheme was set up.  I am reviewing this matter with a view to devising a system whereby we can retain the industry-led concept while allowing for an element of sponsorship.  I hope that these points will be elaborated on Committee Stage.  Many Deputies said that some people will be willing to pay for the scheme, but that is unacceptable.  Previously <Col N="2021" /> in this country coal and iron were the main components of industry, but now they are people and skills.  We can learn from other countries and do much ourselves.</P>
    <P>The intake of women involves conditioning in the home and school, peer pressure, industry and the general environment, all of which form an enveloping fog through which many young women find it very difficult to make their way into the traditional trades.  I visited one FÁS workshop in which there are 11 young men and one young woman who was introduced to me as a wonderful oddity.  When I asked this person if she was enjoying her apprenticeship she said she was but that she felt isolated.  There is no moral back-up for women in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the extension of apprenticeship to traineeship, I share Deputy Bruton's trepidation as to whether, as is the case in many other apprenticeships, restrictions will apply in this regard.  I insist on calling the expansion &ldquo;traineeship&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;. Apprenticeship is a fine concept whereby people learn a trade and we will certainly extend its concept to traineeship in many designated areas. The higher the level of skills achieved the higher the level of certification.  We hope to establish a national certification board which will provide a passport to young people to ensure their skills are interchangeable and recognised in other countries. I will be working with FÁS and the educational establishments to ensure that such a board is set up.</P>
    <P>I will take on board Deputy Gallagher's points in regard to equity and access and the need to include as many people as possible in the new scheme. Difficulties arise in all transitions.  Going from the old to the new poses challenges, but for the sake of the country we have to get this matter right.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Care of the Elderly: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Flanagan on Tuesday, 7 December 1993:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of carers in the provision of care to the elderly, deplores the recent comments of Deputy Emmet Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, wherein he described nursing homes as &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; and calls on the Government to recognise, encourage and support the carer and the dependent in this, the European Year of Older People, by reforming the carer's allowance and introducing a charter for carers to ensure appropriate assistance to the dependent and by guaranteeing institutionalised care where families can no longer cope. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the <Col N="2023" /> Government for the broad range of activities which were initiated to mark the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations; in particular, commends the Minister for Health for the introduction, on 1 September 1993, of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which provides a framework for the registration of nursing homes and a new system of subvention towards the cost of nursing home care for those who need such care and cannot afford the cost and for his commitment to introduce a Health Charter for the Elderly; and further commends the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare for their continued support of the carer's allowance, for the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to maintaining the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the income of pensioners and for their support of the elderly generally.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, is present in the House to listen to the rest of the music, so to speak.  I am sorry he did not avail of the opportunity afforded him last night to withdraw the strong and very unfair attack he launched on private nursing homes and the concept of private nursing homes.  If he had been willing to climb down from his high horse last night and admit that his remarks were somewhat too strong, we would have looked differently on the matter.  However, the fact that he used the opportunity afforded him last night to defend his earlier remarks is unforgivable.  The silence of the Minister of State's Fianna Fáil colleagues in Government on this matter is quite deafening.  I hope this is not an indication that they support the Minister of State's comments but rather that they are ashamed of what he said.  Hopefully, some Fianna Fáil Deputies will clarify <Col N="2024" /> tonight their party's views on the Minister of State's comments.</P>
      <P>The point must be made that private nursing homes have more than filled the very wide gap created by the lack of State funding for people who need care. Private nursing homes, their proprietors and staffs have gone beyond the call of duty in this respect.  They have provided much needed care and attention to many thousands of elderly people in a very dignified way and should be congratulated on their record in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the assistance which has been given to private nursing homes by way of the subsidy which has been put in place.  Unfortunately, the amount of the subsidy is not always sufficient and the regulations governing payment are formulated in such a fashion that it is very difficult for many needy people to obtain it.  I hope the Minister for Health will look at the regulations governing this subsidy in 1994 and at the gap which needs to be filled.  As I said, the private nursing homes have made a major contribution in this area.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the carer's allowance.  This issue has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> with various Ministers at Question Time.  Nevertheless, the point has to be made that when the carer's allowance scheme was first announced amid a fanfare of trumpets the then Minister put it on record that the allowance would help up to 28,000 people.  On the most conservative estimate 3,000 to 3,500 people &mdash; if one was being a bit more generous one could say up to 5,000 people &mdash; have benefited under the scheme.  This is not good enough and the regulations governing the scheme need to be changed.  It should be remembered that all those receiving a carer's allowance are helping the State in the long run: by looking after elderly people in their homes they are saving the State money.  I appeal to the Minister in the European Year of Older People to amend the carer's allowance scheme so as to make it more meaningful for people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's description of private nursing homes as <Col N="2025" />&ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; led to a debate last night which was like the film &ldquo;Gunfight at the OK Corral&rdquo;.  The Minister of State said that he wanted to provoke discussion on the issue, but I would regard his comments as most unwise.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to my experience of nursing homes.  My brother-in-law contracted multiple sclerosis and were it not for the kindness of the local nursing home and its staff I shudder to think what would have happened to him.  He could not be catered for within our health care system. There are long waiting lists for the Cheshire Homes including the home in my constituency, which do tremendous work.  However, these homes cannot cater for the number of people who want to gain access to them.  I was very upset when I read the Minister's comments.</P>
      <P>I know most of the nursing home proprietors in County Limerick and on several occasions I have tried to garner information for them.  Even though the Health (Nursing Homes) Act was passed in 1990, I see from literature that it could take the Minister another few months to put in place regulations governing nursing homes.  It is very unfortunate that all these aspects were not teased out before the legislation was passed.  Nevertheless, the nursing homes appreciate the subvention now being paid in respect of patients.  I would like to add a caveat to my remarks, that is, that the maximum payment of £120 is insufficient as the cost of keeping a patient in a nursing home is in excess of £200 per week.  This deficit needs to be made up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nursing homes have played a very useful role in our health system in the past and will do so in the future.  Hospitals which cater for the elderly &mdash; I do not like to use the word &ldquo;geriatric&rdquo; because of the improper connotations which have been attached to that word in recent times &mdash; have long waiting lists.  The best possible solution to this problem is to pay people to look after the elderly at home. In many cases people who provide home help work for a very small income and work considerably longer hours than the number of hours for which they are compensated. These people, who are normally <Col N="2026" /> paid £2 per hour and who make great sacrifices, are the true champions of our system of care for the elderly. I have tremendous admiration for the women who carry out this work.  In a recent television debate a woman who provides home help said she wanted to unite all the people working in this area in calling for a proper hourly rate for their work.  These people should be properly compensated for the care they provide for the elderly.</P>
    <P>One can see many examples of neglect of the elderly by the Government.  Unfortunately, the only thing many people will remember about the European Year of Older People are the Minister of State's comments.  Even though he may have made his comments in an overall context, they have been remarked upon by people throughout the country.  Many people running nursing homes around the country have told me that they regarded the Minister's statement as very disrespectful.</P>

      <P>I want to support the Government's amendment.  Of course, any member of Fianna Fáil would be proud of the contribution that our party has made to the development of services for the elderly going right back to the time when we first came into Government in 1932.  It is no harm to refer to those innovations which were unique in Europe such as the free electricity scheme, free television licence, free travel and free telephone rental, in addition to the housing that was provided and the range of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I believe that the remarks attributed to the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, were insensitive to the patients, to the staff who look after the patients and <Col N="2027" /> to their relatives, nevertheless, I am glad he is in the House because as Deputy Finucane has said, the ideal for the elderly is that they should be able to live in their own homes and in their own communities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of excellent schemes in operation to improve the housing for the elderly but the time has come to streamline them.  These include the essential repairs grant, the disabled person's reconstruction grant, the scheme for the elderly operated by the health boards and the new scheme introduced in recent years under a Fianna Fáil Government, the £10,000 grant in lieu of local authority housing.  While I believe that these schemes are worthy, they are implemented in far too rigid a manner and there must be more flexibility.  There is great variation from one county to another in how they are implemented. A scheme such as the disabled person's reconstruction grant should be applied liberally to any family who wish to build a room to house an elderly relative.  Apart from the fact that the elderly like to live with their own families in their own communities, it is much more economical to provide a grant of £5,000 than to pay £10,000 a year to maintain a person in an institution.</P>
    <P>Special dwellings for elderly people have been provided and these have been very beneficial in helping people to live in the community.  There are also excellent support systems for people living in the community.  Some people say they are insufficient but there would be no reason for us to be here if we were satisfied that everything was right and that nothing new needed to be done.  There is the excellent home help scheme, the public health nursing scheme, day care facilities and day hostels.  When I was Minister for Health in 1987 I was very anxious that more respite beds would be available for people who perhaps were confined to a wheelchair and indeed for the carers who needed to get away for a holiday, because of illness or whatever.  Provision was made for the elderly to be maintained for a short period of time and I am glad to <Col N="2028" /> say that more beds have been provided for respite care.</P>
    <P>We must recognise in Ireland that the great carers are the families and it is significant that less than 10 per cent of the elderly are maintained in institutional care.  In other words, over 90 per cent are still maintained in the community. Reference was made to the carer's allowance by Deputy Bradford.  It is important to look at what Deputy Woods did as Minister for Social Welfare.  Under the prescribed relative's allowance the maximum payable was £28 per week and one had to be an immediate relative in order to qualify for that scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a woman in her eighties who was suffering from arthritis, who could not leave her chair and who had her adopted son looking after her.  He did not qualify for that allowance because he was adopted even though it was essential that he be there with her.  When Deputy Woods introduced the carer's allowance not only did the rate of payment increase from £28 to £50 at the time &mdash; it is now £60 &mdash; but the range of people who qualified as carers was considerably extended to the advantage of many people in this country.  We would all like those who look after an elderly person to receive a carer's allowance but I am sure every Deputy recognises that that is not practical and that the cost of it would be prohibitive.  However, where the person being looked after is totally dependent, the means test should be waived so that those who are caring for elderly, or younger people who are totally dependent, would receive a carer's allowance.  That would not be very costly.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I wish to refer to the Health (Nursing Homes) Act which I, as Minister for Health, piloted through this House in 1990.  That Act had two objectives: the first was to ensure a high standard of accommodation for the elderly, including adequate staffing and a high quality of staff, and the second was to financially assist dependent persons in paying their nursing home bill.  In addition, under that legislation people were assessed both in terms of their own means and also on <Col N="2029" /> the degree of dependency and a larger allocation could be paid by the health board where the person was more dependent. Nursing homes are obliged to register with the health board and my experience has been that there is a very high standard of care in nursing homes in Ireland.  That is something of which we should be very proud.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the carers. We are very fortunate in Ireland that we are a caring people and that the elderly are well looked after both by the State and by the voluntary organisations.  We should always recognise the contribution that they make but even if the State was in a position to provide the necessary funding for all the care that people needed, it would be unfortunate if we did not have the voluntary organisations who assist community development and make such an important contribution to the care of those in need.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to compliment all those who care for the elderly and I can assure the House that Fianna Fáil, as they did in the past, will continue in the future to ensure that our services are developed to meet the needs of the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy O'Hanlon for sharing his time with me tonight and giving me an opportunity to participate in this very important debate.</P>
      <P>The whole question of caring for the elderly is one that will increase in importance in the years ahead as our elderly population, in line with European Union trends, continues to grow.  Therefore, we should try in so far as we can to put in place services and facilities to meet the needs of the elderly.</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of elderly people places certain demands on the finances available and we must ensure that we utilise those resources which are always scarce.  When it comes to matters close to our hearts we must ensure that we get the best possible value for money as well as providing the best possible service.  The role of carers in relation to dependent elderly people obviously comes very much into focus in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> I support the comments of Deputy O'Hanlon, a former Minister for Health, who has great experience, a person who, in his time was very committed to the elderly in his region.  My aim is to ensure that elderly people are allowed to live an active, independent life, in so far as possible, within their own community and the services we put in place should have that objective in mind.  Of course, there will be circumstances in which an elderly person will become dependent and find it difficult to continue to live alone within the community, which is when the role of the carer comes into play.  The role of the carer has not been acknowledged although there have been debates and studies undertaken, particularly an excellent report published in 1988 for the National Council for the Aged by Professor Joyce O'Connor, which spelled out very clearly for the first time the role and work undertaken by carers and the difficulties they experience.</P>
    <P>We can improve support for carers by putting in place a number of facilities which, until fairly recently, had not been afforded very high priority.  These would include, for example, respite care since we must remember that a substantial number of carers are on call 24 hours a day, which places a tremendous strain on them.  Therefore, we must provide respite care to give carers an annual break as some of them do not get away from year to year, which can place enormous stress on them and lead to circumstances touched on by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg.  While we might not agree with the manner in which he made those comments, I am glad there has been some attempt to focus on the overall issue of elderly people and their movement towards either institutional or private nursing home care.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House in their clinics will have come across elderly people saying they are thinking of disposing of their family home and moving in with a son or daughter.  I am becoming increasingly concerned at that trend.  Frequently the same elderly people return <Col N="2031" /> to the clinic seeking independent, local authority housing because relationships broke down when they moved in with the relative.  That highlights the difficulties for elderly people when problems arise within their families and they need to find alternative accommodation.  There may well be a trend emerging that too many elderly people who could, with support, survive and lead independent lives in the community, for family reasons, are directed towards institutional care.  That may well be an unfortunate development in our society which we will have to face if we are to genuinely meet the needs of the elderly within our community.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister for Health has now brought into effect the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which, for the first time, laid down the procedure for the registration of nursing homes and the level of care and accommodation which must be maintained in nursing homes with two or more elderly people.</P>
    <P>There is also an onus on the respective health boards, through their public health nurses, to monitor the operation of the provisions of that Act with regard to nursing homes, something for which all sides of this House had been calling for some time.  I predict the provisions of that Act will constitute a major contribution in terms of maintaining the standards of nursing homes at levels acceptable to elderly persons and their families when they cannot remain in their former abode.  It is important that, in so far as possible, we give health boards nationwide the necessary resources to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in nursing homes.  In addition, the provisions of that Act give the health boards discretion with regard to the payment of a subvention, a problem in the past which placed great difficulties on individuals and families with regard to the costs of maintaining an elderly person in a private nursing home. Now the relevant health boards have some discretion up to an optimum figure which is much more realistic.  In this Year of the Elderly it is important that the <Col N="2032" /> provisions of that Act are implemented. I am delighted that has been the case.</P>
    <P>The physical work undertaken by carers is very substantial and has often gone unrecognised.  Many of them are on 24-hour call which, as I said, places an enormous strain on them and may well lead to circumstances in which a carer will be unable to continue to provide the type of service he or she would wish.</P>
    <P>If, in developing services for the elderly, we provide more respite care places, that would be a help to those who wish to continue to care for an elderly relative.  In addition, we need to expand the home help service, a good service, but probably a Cinderella one in terms of resources because, most certainly, we get tremendous value for money.  More resources should be allocated to that service because the people working as a home help are at the coalface and provide an enormous service for those with whom they come in contact.</P>
    <P>We can vastly improve the lives of elderly people by the provision of additional day care services.  Carers need training or counselling when difficulties arise in relation to care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>There is a whole range of issues to be tackled in so far as improving the lot of carers is concerned.  If we tackle them on a progressive basis, identifying weaknesses in the system, then the lives of our carers will be improved, thereby encouraging more people to support the elderly in our community, and ensuring that they do not need institutional care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government amendment to this motion.  The Year of the Elderly, an initiative of the European Parliament rather than the Commission, helped to highlight the problems of the elderly, getting people <Col N="2033" /> focusing on and thinking about the extra care and attention the elderly should be given.</P>
      <P>The Government took a number of measures during the year in respect of the elderly.  Certainly, the Minister for Health, with the co-ordinating body, made almost £500,000 available, ensuring that the statutory authorities, voluntary bodies and various other groups would work together to highlight the positive contribution the elderly make to society.  I believe there were up to 5,000 events held nationwide focusing on that very issue.</P>
      <P>The original motion referred to the fact that only 4,000 people are in receipt of the carer's allowance.  We know where we want to go in that respect.  As many other Members said, we all meet people who provide round the clock care for elderly people.  We would like to be able to give them some financial reward in recognition of what they do since, at present, under the means test, they do not even qualify for a sum of £20 or £25 per week.  I hope that in coming years matters generally will improve and that such people will be given recognition.</P>
      <P>In the past year the Minister for Social Welfare announced a respite care fund which will be of tremendous benefit to people who look after the elderly, some of whom are constantly tied to the house. This fund has allowed various groups to spring up around the country.  Volunteers can move in and give a carer an occasional day, week or month off so that carers are now able to take the odd holiday.  Things are moving in the right direction.  The Minister contributed last night and I am sure he did his best to defend the comments he had made previously. I can well understand the reason some people took offence at them.  Some elderly people have a certain fear of institutional care which goes back to the old workhouse or county home mentality. Any comments in that regard help to worsen their fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points I should like to make in relation to the elderly.  At a certain age people should get the medical card as of right.  I had a case of a husband, <Col N="2034" /> aged 91, and his wife, aged 92.  He was an ex-civil servant and he was in receipt of a pension of £180 or £190 a week.  At a certain stage I would like to hear a Government say: &ldquo;Unless you are a millionaire, you would get a medical card as of right&rdquo;.  I realise that if a person has a letter stating that they are suffering from a terminal disease they qualify for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The issue of nursing homes has been mentioned.  Progress in this area is very slow, but I hope it speeds up.  There appears to be a delay in my constituency regarding registration of some of the homes.  Perhaps I had better give way to Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the subventions are of great assistance but the registration process appears to be working slowly.  I know there are many homes to be registered and that much work remains to be done.  Since September progress has been slow.  I am surprised at the terms of three stages of subvention, but I am aware it rests with medical opinion.  I have been amazed at some of the people who were allocated the lower subvention of £70.  I do not know how bad one's condition must be to obtain the higher subvention.  Certainly, some of those who have got the £70 subvention need full-time institutional care.  Nevertheless, it is a great improvement from what obtained previously and we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Regarding the elderly, as Deputy O'Hanlon said, Fianna Fáil is always very proud of what it has done for old people. The value of the pension in recent years has maintained its real value.  The campaign ten or 15 years ago to boost the old age pension succeeded, but perhaps it needs another campaign to give it a further boost.  In recent years it has maintained its value and most years they have obtained a real increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read an article in a newspaper the other day concerning the Christmas <Col N="2035" /> bonus in England, which is £10 and £15. In that context what we do for the elderly, together with the free schemes, is tremendous and means a great deal to many people.  Indeed, some ex-local authority staff or ex-civil servants, who traditionally may have been in receipt of a good pension, would now dearly love to qualify for even 10p of a social welfare pension so that the door would open to all the free schemes.  The free schemes have made an enormous difference to the elderly.  This is a reflection of the care and concern which Irish people have for their old folk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank previous speakers for sharing their time with me.  At the outset I wish to compliment Deputy O'Hanlon on his initiative, while Minister for Health, in introducing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I know from speaking with people in the nursing homes association and health board officials, particularly in my own health board area, that he was most amenable to their proposals and suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by the Minister for Health.  It is opportune as the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations draws to a close.  It is appropriate for this House to look back on the series of special initiatives which the Government has taken during the past 12 months, particularly in the area of social welfare.  We in Ireland have gained a reputation throughout Europe for the imaginative and caring way in which we look after our old folk.  Their position and status in our community stems directly from the respect which Irish people have always held for older and retired people.  In particular, Fianna Fáil has always recognised their immeasurable contribution to the economic and social life of this country. In Government Fianna Fáil will continue to combine imagination with concern to ensure that our policies meet their needs. We have done so in the firm belief that after a lifetime of service to the nation, elderly people should be able to retire <Col N="2036" /> with the dignity they deserve.  Fianna Fáil is firmly committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments and to protect the position of pensioners.  I am confident that this Government will honour that commitment and improve the situation where possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to the carer's allowance.  This is one of the most important initiatives taken and Deputy Dr. Woods, as Minister for Social Welfare, over a number of years is worthy of commendation for his work in introducing this scheme.  There are thousands of people all over the country, many of whom are women, who are looking after elderly and incapacitated relatives at home.  That scheme was introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, to provide a secure income for those carers who have no independent income of their own.  I know the Minister would like to see more flexibility with regard to the income criteria and the time conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>We all hope it will be possible during the coming years to improve that scheme. However, we must realise that some £10 million is being provided for the scheme and about 5,000 carers are in receipt of a regular weekly payment.  I am disappointed that some politicians in this House and outside have tried continuously to undermine the carer's allowance since it was first launched.  The reality is that £10 million per year is being provided where it was not provided previously. Almost 5,000 carers throughout the country are receiving a payment which they did not receive previously. We are giving tangible financial recognition to the work of carers on low incomes, who unselfishly, day in and day out, care for elderly and incapacitated social welfare pensioners.  The reality is that the Government this year increased that allowance by almost 12 per cent, bringing the maximum payment to £59.20 per week.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year the Minister for Social Welare, introduced the respite care trust fund.  I would hope that that <Col N="2037" /> fund can be increased and more scope given to it.  Nobody can doubt the commitment of this Government and particularly the commitment of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, or their determination to improve housing conditions throughout the country. The improvements mentioned by the Minister of State last night are worthwhile, but much more is needed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and to the Minister for the Environment to plan more effectively and to provide a better spread of housing units for the elderly.  Those units should be provided in all our villages.  There should be a mix of housing to ensure that all age groups are caterd for within the schemes.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to ensure that more beds are made available in what may be termed district hospitals for people who no longer need an acute hospital bed but have no relative to return home to.  The establishment of proper day care units and district hospitals would be very important in rural parts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most peculiar transformations that has taken place since this <Col N="2038" /> Government assumed office is the change in Deputy Stagg since he became Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  From being one of the Members on the Left he seems to have transferred his allegiance somewhere to the Right of the Progressive Democrats. Some time ago he intended to sell off local authority houses to the banks and only denied this when he discovered the odium that was about to be heaped upon him.  His opposition to the service charges in Kildare has suddenly evaporated and now he has decided to take the stick to the carers who look after the elderly and disabled in Irish society.  I am not quite sure what they have done to deserve this but they have certainly got it in the neck.</P>
    <P>The Minister's views on the provision of care for the elderly are on a par with those of Norman Tebbitt whose advice to the unemployed was to &ldquo;get on your bike&rdquo;.  Last night Fine Gael was concerned about the socialist baggage being carried by the Labour Party.  I would have thought that the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, confirms that not only has the Labour Party no socialist baggage but no socialist principles either.</P>
    <P>The essential message from the Minister of State is that regardless of one's circumstances and whether one has the physical, emotional, mental or financial capacity one must keep one's elderly relatives at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tell the Minister a thing or two about the elderly because it is clear he knows nothing about the matter.  When we speak about the elderly we are talking primarily about people over 75 years old.  People are living longer and there will be many more elderly in the future.  Old age is a time of particular need, very often related to loss, either the loss of a relative, the death of a spouse or even the loss of income.</P>
      <P>Old age is not a question of death but a question of degeneration, the degeneration of cognitive faculties, of the intellect, sight, hearing, taste and smell as well as the reduction of independence and the loss of mobility.  Incontinence is a major feature in relation to the elderly. It is estimated that 40 per cent of elderly people suffer from incontinence and carers have to provide for that particular need.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg should know this; if for no other reason, he should know it having displayed such incontinence of language.  I wonder how much experience of incontinence he has had in his life; and how many incontinence pads he has changed and, in particular, how many double incontinence pads he has changed.  There are many thousands of carers who have had that experience on a daily basis and I would trust their views on the care of the elderly more quickly than those of the Minister of State.  These are the unsung heroes and heroines of Ireland.  Their role in society is one of anonymity and it has never been given full recognition.  It has a low status and will continue to have unless there is a radical transformation in the way the State acknowledges their job and the important role they play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a personal level, we hold the elderly <Col N="2040" /> in high regard but at public level we do not and those who care for the elderly are not regarded as important people. The work is very often carried out by women alone at home, for whom the provision of a carer's allowance is denied or, when granted, so minimal as to reinforce the view that their job is unimportant. These people are vital to the good of society and to the health of families.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Ministers of State are cared for.  Their needs are met by a whole range of carers, be it the driver, the secretary, the person who cooks the meals or answers the telephone, the adviser, the civil servant.  These people all bolster and reinforce the message that Ministers and Ministers of State are important people.  Who provides that message for the carer?  Who supports them when they fall ill or are at the end of their tether? Who provides them with the ego massage that Ministers enjoy?  An individual may spend years caring for an elderly relative who may be cranky, disoriented, physically strong yet mentally feeble and who requires constant daily attention, but who cares for the carers?</P>
    <P>Many elderly people do not experience problems in old age and live full and active lives right up to the end.  There are many families who, when the health of an elderly relative starts to degenerate, take on the role of caring in a willing, able and loving way.  Obviously, the ideal for everybody concerned is that the elderly person should live out his or her days being well looked after and in familiar surroundings in the family home if possible and surrounded by those who love them.  That is the best of all possible worlds and Irish people have shown that they are in accord with it.  At a personal level, families have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility towards the elderly but unfortunately this respect is not matched in the public arena.  However, that kind of arrangement is not always possible as it is not always possible to keep an elderly person at home.</P>
    <P>There are many needs that must be met including the frailty of the elderly. Some persons require special nursing <Col N="2041" /> care that simply does not exist in the home.  We are talking about a group in society who are subject to all the chronic diseases of the heart, the circulatory system, strokes, which are extremely incapacitating, arthritis, brain damage, digestive conditions, Parkinson's disease and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is now a major factor in old age.  In America, the number of people over 85 years of age with Alzheimer's disease is now 50 per cent of this category.  This has major implications for future health care.  Our elderly population is growing and requires professional services that can be provided in nursing homes along with the care that can be provided by relatives.  This growth in the elderly population is a phenomenon that has to be faced up to.  It is a feature that should be included in the national health strategy.  Goals need to be set.  The care of the elderly requires a whole range of services which must dovetail with one another, from the general practitioner to the public health nurses to the home help service and the district units of meals on wheels.  The objective of the care must be to maintain the independence, dignity, health and happiness of elderly people in familiar and loving surroundings, wherever they be.</P>
    <P>What was so shocking about the Minister of State's comments was his depth of ignorance about the whole question of the care for the elderly.  He represents a Government who, with such fanfare, introduced the year of the elderly, that mouths aspirations about solidarity across the ages but when the mask slipped we heard the views expressed by the new found Right as represented by Deputy Stagg which is sending out the message to keep your elderly at home, this is a private solution to a private problem and people should not lean on the State.</P>
    <P>Let me tell the Minister that the reaction of nursing home owners &mdash; I live in Bray where there are a great many nursing homes &mdash; is one of sheer and unadulterated rage that the Minister should display such ignorance and such arrogance. He complains that nursing homes <Col N="2042" /> operate by making a profit but I would like him to show me a nursing home that could operate by making a loss and still continue to provide a decent service for its residents.  The Nursing Homes Act is beginning to make a difference.  I, for one, would never defend the rogue nursing homes that have created a bad reputation for nursing homes throughout the country.  However, they are a minority and the Nursing Homes Act is making a difference. The majority of nursing homes are providing good quality care and the better ones, which unfortunately are more expensive, are providing an extremely high quality of life for their residents.</P>
    <P>The Minister also ignores the fact that many residents in nursing homes choose to live in them.  They do so out of choice rather than out of compulsion.  He prefers to feed the understandable guilt that many families have about choosing a nursing home option.  He has also stirred up fears among the elderly.  I do not believe that Irish people need to be told how to care for their elderly and they certainly do not need lectures from the Minister of State about their responsibilities. The evidence is that people willingly and lovingly take up that responsibility but they need support in making the right decision.  Indeed, the elderly themselves need support in making the right decision.  The misinformation and the unjustified attack that the Minister indulged himself in is an example of how far we are from a decent service that supports the elderly and is based on essential principles that are in tune with the needs of people, both the elderly and the carers, and are also appropriate to the demand that will continue to grow into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>We have a carer's allowance, a pittance which is offered to people who spend many long hours caring for relatives, sometimes even up to 24 hours a day, watching over relatives who are in need of care.  Yet, not all carers get their allowance. In 1992 the number of people who applied for the allowance and were refused was almost as high as the number who were granted it.  We have only to <Col N="2043" /> look at the home help service to observe the low status this kind of work has, where grown women caring for elderly people in their own homes are being paid less than a 14 year-old baby-sitter.</P>
    <P>An ESRI report in 1992 described the reality, not the sentimental sludge I heard from the Minister last night, of caring for the elderly.  The care is almost always provided by one individual, usually a woman who is found to work on average 46 hours a week and as the age of the elderly person rises the number of hours worked rises to 85 hours a week and even more.  The carers were found to suffer physical stress and physical and emotional strain.  The level of stress was found to be so high in many of them that they required medical attention.  This reality is what led the authors of the report to recommend that health policy should ensure that the elderly are not institutionalised because of lack of community support.  They also recommended that a carer should not be obliged to undertake the caring role, that it should be a question of choice.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Cullen gave the impression that health spending here was high compared with other European countries, but that is not the case.  We are cost effective considering our population profile.  Our problem has to do with equality rather than overspending. Equality also relates to nursing homes. Our problem is not with the nursing homes but with the cost of keeping patients in nursing homes and the fact that many people cannot afford the cost of good quality nursing home care particularly as many families are caring for their young as well as caring for their elderly at the same time.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the elderly, and their families, have the right to choose what kind of care they wish to have without feeling guilty or fearful.  That right must be protected by the Minister for Health.  This right was undermined in a most despicable way by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and the Government should disown his statements in relation to carers and nursing homes.  The Minister for Health carries a particular <Col N="2044" /> responsibility to disown those statements. The dignity and peace of mind of the elderly and their carers demands nothing less.</P>

      <P>Members of this House are well aware of my concern for wildlife. Reference was made last night to stag hunting.  In the context of the Minister's appalling reference to nursing homes as corrals of death, it seems to me that his reference somewhat missed the point.  A stag is a regal creature which comports itself with dignity and never engages in vicious attacks unless seriously provoked or at risk of death.  It is a timid and gracious animal which would never use its antlers to charge friend or foe without good cause.  In contrast, a bull is an ill-tempered, irritable, ill-mannered animal with an overweening sense of its own importance, never slow to deploy its horns in injuring others for no apparent reason other than its own glory and self satisfaction.  The most innocent bystander is at risk when a bull is on the loose.  The same can never be said of the stag.  In the context of the appalling, inhumane and insensitive reference made by the Minister of State to the position of the elderly cared for in nursing homes, the Minister's behaviour does not so much accord with that of the stage in the forest but more with that of the bull in the China shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, I am generally opposed to blood sports.  The Fine Gael Party is not engaging in &ldquo;Stagg&rdquo; hunting but has tabled this motion to stop the ministerial bull charging mindlessly at innocent bystanders, such as the elderly who cannot care for themselves, and to stop his using them as pawns in his political rhetoric.  The fact that the stag is a protected species under the wildlife Acts does not render this Minister exempt from political criticism for his behaviour.  If a similar comment had been <Col N="2045" /> made last year when the Minister was on the Opposition side of the House by one of the Minister's present Fianna Fáil colleagues, he would have resembled Mount Vesuvius as he erupted with righteous indignation; but since the Labour Party has taken the shilling, the level of righteous indignation has surprisingly subsided.</P>
    <P>The Minister, from the Opposition side of the House, frequently wore his conscience on his sleeve.  If he has genuine concern for the elderly he should take action to ensure that the public sector provides adequate nursing home care for the elderly in circumstances where such care is required and where families lack the essential finance to provide for private care.  He should also ensure that the carer's allowance is at a level which enables more families to care for elderly sick parents in their homes.  He should not camouflage the inadequacies of Government policies by the use of hurtful thoughtless political rhetoric.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context, it is note-worthy that no mention was made by the Minister in his speech of the many instances in the past when he has, as a constituency TD, used his position to obtain much sought after care in private nursing homes for elderly constituents or the elderly parents of constituents. Perhaps the Minister will take time to tell us about that this evening.  We all presume that when advising his constituents of the success of the representations made by him he did not at the same time in the letters he was sending state that he was successful in placing their elderly relations in corrals of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister in his contribution last night engaged in a mock and feeble attack on Fine Gael Deputies and has continued tonight to interrupt Opposition Deputies with snide remarks.  The Minister should simply have had the good grace to withdraw the remark made by him and accept that it was utterly inappropriate.  In future when the Minister's utterances run ahead of his <Col N="2046" /> thought processes he should think of the people at the end of the sound bite sitting in nursing homes perhaps because there is no other way they can be cared for as their health requires 24 hours a day care. The Minister should think about how they might feel when they hear him referring to the place in which they are living as a corral of death and think about what that does to their quality of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has hurled an unparalleled blow and an appalling insult at those excellent nursing homes where the most caring and dedicated people in society work by describing them in the cruel term of corrals of death.  All politicians are embarrassed that a Minister should stoop so low, displaying not only his ignorance of the excellent care and support provided for elderly patients but scant regard for those in need of nursing home care.  His remarks have caused anxiety and stress for the many families who unfortunately cannot care for their elderly at home and have no choice but to opt for nursing home care.  His remark has caused justifiable anger and bitterness among those involved in the provision of nursing home care, the owners of nursing homes and the nurses who provide this invaluable service without adequate resources or support from the Government.  The Minister's remarks shattered the confidence of the patients who at the most sensitive period of their lives need encouragement and support and need to have confidence in the quality of life provided for them in the nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider how hollow and insensitive are the Minister's remarks when I recall the excellent care my mother received for eight years in a nursing home.  I consider how ignorant and blatantly unfair are the Minister's remarks when I think of the excellent nursing homes in my constituency of South Tipperary.  Despite the viciousness of the Minister's remarks there was not a murmur of criticism from Deputy Stagg's colleagues in the Labour Party or from his partners in Government. If they were honest they would <Col N="2047" /> have to admit that they share our anger and embarrassment.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Stagg compounded his blunder by trying to justify his remarks as being to provoke debate.  Is the Minister serious?  He says he is justified in ridiculing nursing homes to open up a debate.  Would the Minister ridicule the Garda if he wanted a debate on crime or ridicule teachers if he wanted a debate on education?</P>
    <P>I support this motion tonight because it calls for a better deal for carers of the ill and the elderly.  I support it because it calls for justice and fairness for the numerous women who are the unsung heroines in our society and who provide care, love and affection for their elderly parents or handicapped relatives.  Their work is, unfortunately, unappreciated, unrecognised, undervalued and, above all, underpaid.  In fact, they carry the can for the Government who willingly allows them continue their work.  We must remember that their contributions are given at immense personal cost in terms of their physical and mental health. Therefore, it is unacceptable that they should also shoulder the financial strain caused by having an elderly parent in their home.</P>
    <P>It is to our shame that a mere 1,500 people qualify for the carer's allowance, which in no way pays them for their work, but it is at least a symbol of recognition for their contribution.  That should not only be estimated in terms of financial cost; we should recognise also the comfort they give to elderly people while allowing them end their twilight years in the comfort of their homes and surrounded by family.  The statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, that nursing homes are &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; was unfortunate.  He would serve everybody better by having the courage and humility to apologise for making such an appalling remark.</P>
    <P>The elderly are the most vulnerable group in our society and the Minister and his Government should hasten the registration of nursing homes so that <Col N="2048" /> many people at present in dire need of beds in nursing homes can at least qualify for subvention.  That will not be possible until nursing homes are registered.  The Minister of State should devote his energies to that rather than making outlandish statements which are hurtful to those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The motivation behind the Fine Gael decision to table this motion was the unfortunate remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, when he referred to nursing homes as &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo;.  The Minister of State made a vicious attack on Fine Gael last night for tabling this motion and stated that we were only stirring up the matter. I have news for the Minister of State. At a Western Health Board meeting on Monday &mdash; this is in the area in which the Minister of State made those remarks &mdash; a sustained attack was made on the Minister, not by the Fine Gael members of the health board, but by Deputy Leyden, a former Minister of State, who was appointed to the Western Health Board by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.  He engaged in a sustained attack on the Minister of State for his remarks at Knock and was supported by most Government members of that board.  Therefore, the Minister of State cannot single out Fine Gael for the attack on him.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion, which I support, calls on the Government to recognise, encourage and support the carer and the dependant in this, the European Year of the Elderly.  I hope some good will come from this debate.  If we continue to highlight the great work being done by carers in their homes, the Minister for Social Welfare may eventually take heed of what we are saying and make the carer's allowance available to people doing that very necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare introduced the carer's allowance in the Social Welfare Bill, 1990, I welcomed its introduction and stated that I hoped the majority of the 66,000 carers would qualify for the allowance and that over-conscientious social welfare officers would <Col N="2049" /> not debar carers from receiving it.  At that time the Minister informed the Dáil that he believed more than 8,000 carers would qualify in the first year.  However, three years later, with a much increased budget, a far fewer number have qualified. Deputy Ahearn stated that out of an estimated 66,000 carers approximately 2,000 have qualified for the full carer's allowance and 2,200 for part of the allowance. Unfortunately, the high hopes created by the Minister for Social Welfare at that time were dashed and many were disappointed.  At that time, and on many occasions since when I raised the matter at Question Time and on other occasions, the Minister asked us to bring to his attention cases of hardship where people do not qualify for the allowance. I have brought a number of such cases to the Minister's attention without success and without response in some cases.</P>
    <P>I will cite one or two cases for the Minister's information.  A small farmer's wife in the east Galway area cares for her mother-in-law who is confined to bed and incontinent.  She cares for her 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.  She was refused the carer's allowance because her husband's farming income from 12 cattle and 40 sheep was considered to be 9p over the stated guidelines.  Her reference number is 245687580B.  It took six months and three visits from a social welfare officer to deal with that case.  What did it cost the Department of Social Welfare to discover that her husband's income was 9p over the guidelines?  A woman in south Galway cares for her husband's two elderly aunts, one of whom has been confined to bed for ten years and the other for 12.  She applied for the carer's allowance when it was introduced.  A social welfare officer visited her home on two occasions and, instead of giving her the carer's allowance, succeeded in reducing one of the elderly ladies old age pension by £3.  One of the aunts is now deceased.  Thankfully, because of the commitment of those two ladies, they have continued to care for their relatives.</P>
    <P>I will draw the Minister's attention to another case raised at Question Time <Col N="2050" /> during the past month.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare is listening to the debate.  A person from the Oughterard area of Galway came home from America to mind her father when her mother died.  She received about £25 per week in carer's allowance.  Approximately six months ago that person married a small farmer living some 25 miles from her home and her carer's allowance was discontinued despite the fact that she travels 25 miles every day in a 1978 Morris Minor car to care for her father.  The carer's allowance should not disqualify people. Social welfare officers should use their common sense to allow people qualify for the allowance.  It would lessen the demand for beds in the nursing homes about which the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, has such a bad opinion.</P>

I would like also to convey the apologies of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea, who is indisposed.</P>

      <P>In his speech the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, paid copious tribute to the good nursing homes around the country. What he said was: &ldquo;I am worried about those old people who want to live in their own homes or with their families and who for the lack of a little consideration cannot do so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister went on to say that by all means institutional care should be provided for older people, when necessary and as a last resort, but that many elderly people on entering a home quickly lose heart and rapidly become institutionalised and that no one should enter a nursing home until all other options have been exhausted.</P>
      <P>I listened to what Deputy Ahearn had to say.  Like many other Members, I have personal experience of many nursing homes in the sense that some of my relatives need full-time nursing care.  I have no wish to criticise the work done in nursing homes.  Indeed, the first nursing home to be registered is located in my constituency and it is a splendid home; but there other nursing homes which do not meet acceptable standards and the Government is doing everything it can to ensure that proper standards prevail. Those Deputies who have personal experience of nursing homes will be aware that unfortunately one tends to find a line of chairs along the wall and that there is a lack of stimulation in some nursing homes.  They also referred to the many excellent homes around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a discussion about carers.  Again, I wish to pay tribute to the <Col N="2052" /> 60,000 carers around the country who look after elderly and incapacitated people in their own homes.  These play a vital and essential role in society whether for a few hours a day on a part-time basis or on a full-time around the clock basis. In turn, society owes them an enormous debt.  This can never be adequately recognised, but the weekly carer's allowance payable by my Department goes some way towards helping carers.  In response to Deputy Ahearn, there are currently over 4,700 people in receipt of the carer's allowance at a cost of almost £11 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I am concerned solely and exclusively about the good name of nursing homes.  I have no intention or ambition to seek to score political points at the expense of the Government or the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment directly involved.  In fairness, it has to be said that he has a fine record in this House, not least when it comes to the question of care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>However, the use of the term &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; to describe nursing homes for the elderly was unfortunate in the extreme and I am using the mildest possible language to get my point across.  A corral is a pen or enclosure for holding or containing animals, usually wild animals. The phrase &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; is horrifying when the concept is fully analysed.  No one knows how much damage has been done to all nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Much of this damage might be of a temporary or transitory nature but, in addition to being a nasty phrase, &ldquo;corrals of death&rdquo; is also a catchy phrase likely to attract media attention, which, unfortunately, it did.  Last night in an extraordinary statement the Minister of State told the House that he used this phrase deliberately to open a debate.  This is hard to conceive.</P>
      <P>All politicians who have studied good and bad publicity know something about the matter.  I am aware that it is not once-off publicity that counts in building up an image for good or evil, but regular or continuous publicity.  However, there are exceptions and this is one where one phrase can have a devastating result.  If we were to carry out a survey today on the perception among the public of nursing homes we would discover what impact this phrase has had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> Now that the damage has been done there is an obligation on all of us to seek to re-establish the reputation of nursing homes.  The Minister of State should have devoted his speech last night solely and exclusively to that task and not to the defence of what he said.  There are some things for which there is no defence and this is definitely one of them.</P>
    <P>Small nursing homes for the elderly located around the country, perhaps adjacent to a small town, have a key role to play in the west.  As we are aware, the vast majority of these are excellent, comfortable and provide a good standard of care, but the extra dimension is that they are local for the residents who live in them.  This means that when they go to live in a nursing home they will not lose their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Politicians in the west have failed to get the message across to their colleagues here that there has been a decline in the population &mdash;&ldquo;depopulation&rdquo; is a better word.  As we are all aware, there have been sweeping changes.  For example, the population of County Leitrim has decreased by a half in 40 years, but it is not realised that the population of townland after townland is being wiped out. Unfortunately, this trend is continuing with the result that the populations of many areas are now under threat from the GATT which is being finalised in Geneva and even from the excellent farmer retirement scheme.  The reality is that with a declining and ageing population the small nursing home for the elderly has a vital role to play.</P>
    <P>Despite the great caring tradition in that area &mdash; the meitheal, as the Minister of State knows well &mdash; and the fact that facilities have been improved, some people will need to be cared for permanently in a nursing home.  We should try to provide this care &mdash; the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon wanted to do this &mdash; in small nursing homes where elderly people can be visited by their families, friends and neighbours and by their grandchildren, grandnieces and grandnephews on their way home from school.  That is the ideal. <Col N="2056" /> What the Government should do is help the nursing homes and pay the subventions, as they promised to do in the Nursing Homes Act.  In the meantime all of us have a serious obligation to restore the rightful reputation challenged so unexpectedly and so outrageously in the name of the Government.</P>

      <P>When in Opposition the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg was an open-minded individual who put forward radical views on behalf of the people he represented.  As a Government Minister he has a social conscience which has been numbed by the anaesthetic of power. This is typical of many of the Labour TDs at present.  We heard the Minister of State here tonight giving a pathetic explanation.  She seems to have lost all her socialist principles since she attained the trappings of power.  The perspective they now have from the inside of a State car seems to contrast in a big way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>He is looking now through rose tinted ministerial glasses.  Minister Stagg's recent comments in County Mayo have caused alarm and concern to the elderly and have caused distress and <Col N="2057" /> upset to the thousands of carers in Irish society.  Without the voluntary support of individuals and organisations here many of our social services would collapse and for Minister Stagg to insult the services both voluntary and professional provided by organisations is beneath contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do that.  That should be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The carers and organisations have been abused by the State in recent years.  The level of payments made to carers and home helps is an insult.  The level of support both from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare to organisations dealing with the elderly leaves much to be desired.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I referred to the anti-family element of the social welfare code. These must be addressed by the Minister. A particularly harsh anti-family element relates to the care of the elderly.  How can we tolerate elderly people losing their secondary benefits, such as free electricity, television licence, etc., if they arrange to have a companion live with them for security reasons?  In recent times the Taoiseach voiced his concern for the elderly.  I call that paying lip-service when at the same time he presides over a social welfare system which prevents elderly people from bringing a companion into their homes for security reasons.</P>
      <P>How can the system tolerate elderly people being committed to long-stay institutional care costing the State £150 a week per person when the carer's allowance is so restrictive that only 4,600 have qualified nationwide, many of whom do not get the maximum amount?  All of this is happening at a time when home helps are paid at rates as low as £2 per hour.  It is slave labour, but for many it is a labour of love.  It is an abuse of the good nature and good will of these people and as such it must be despised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is European Year of the Elderly but what we so often see here is lip-service to the elderly with no real progress in our treatment of them.  For example, what <Col N="2058" /> has been done in regard to barriers to employment?  What is being done by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform about widespread discrimination against elderly people in the workplace?  What is he doing about the forced redundancy of so many people because of age?  The elderly are not first or second class citizens; they are not even third class citizens. They do not rate in the legislative programme of this Government.  Voluntary groups are working on a shoe-string. Many are dependent on flag days and the charity of the general public.</P>
    <P>There must be a major review of the State's attitude to the elderly.  There must also be a major review of the carer's allowance scheme and a co-ordinated approach between the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and the Environment. What we have at present is unco-ordinated and fragmented.  The carer's allowance scheme, if properly structured, would be attractive enough to reduce the pressure on our nursing homes and acute hospitals and would create a far healthier family environment for elderly people. Many Members are aware of the hundreds of acute hospital beds occupied by elderly people because there is no other place for them to go.  They are also aware that the State pays up to £150 a week in subvention for patients in nursing homes. Surely it would be socially desirable and more cost-effective to introduce a more comprehensive carer's allowance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was about to apologise to the nation for his remarks but he has disappointed me again.  I will give him a chance to do so if he wishes.  The Minister should apologise to the people he has upset.  This year there was an increase in the allowance but the same barriers still face people who wish to apply for the carer's allowance. As a result only 4,500 people are eligible out of the 60,000 applications that were made.  The ageing of the Irish population has many implications for families and social policy.  The response should be to place greater emphasis on community care as a way of meeting the needs of frail and dependent elderly persons. However, at the moment community care is care by the family and, often, this care is given by women.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a short term and a long term policy in this area.  The Minister may plead budgetary constraints but much of the cost could be saved in the area of acute hospital and nursing home care if there was a proper carer's policy. The Minister for Social Welfare must create priority principles in relation to the carer's allowance scheme and make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the needs of our elderly are fully met without imposing impossible constraints on the carers.  As a previous speaker dealt with the ESRI report which shows that care in the home is given almost exclusively by women I will not dwell on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to payments being made, I requested an analysis from the statistics unit of the Department of Social Welfare and it appears that the cost of increasing the carer's allowance by £10 a week would be about £2.3 million per year. Therefore, an increase of £40 a week would cost the State £9.2 million in one year.  Savings made in other areas of the health and social welfare system would balance this expenditure and create a healthier social environment for the elderly. If the Tánaiste did without some of <Col N="2060" /> his trappings of power the money saved would go a long way towards paying the increase.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government have once again gone for the easy option of just increasing the allowance.  We heard the Minister, and the Minister of State, this week talking about increases in the budget but the restrictions in the scheme are not being addressed.</P>

    <P>Is mór agam an deis seo a fháil chun <Col N="2063" /> an díospóireacht ar an mBille um Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Leasú), 1993, a oscailt go hoifigiúil anseo i nDáil Éireann.  Tá mé sásta go dtabharfaidh an Bille seo deis chuí do Theachtaí Dála staid ár dtionscail scannáin agus éist-fís a phlé go cuimsitheach.  Tá mé ag súil le díospóireacht bhríomhar ar an téama seo.</P>
    <P>Níl ach aidhm amháin ag an mBille seo atá ós comhair na Dála inniú.  Is í an aidhm sin ná méadú a dhéanamh ar an méid airgid &mdash; idir infheistíochtaí, iasachtaí, deontais, nó aon fhreagrachtaí eile&mdash; gur féidir le Bord Scannán na hÉireann a chaitheamh sna blianta atá romhainn.  Is é an t-uasmhéid gur féidir leis an mBord a chaitheamh sa tslí seo faoi alt 10 den Acht um Bord Scannán na hÉireann, 1980, ná £4,100,000.  Ós rud é go bhfuil an t-uasmhéid sin bainte amach anois i mbliana, tá mé ag moladh don Oireachtas sa Bhille seo go n-árdofaí an t-uasmhéid seo go dtí £15,000,000.  Má ghlacann an tOireachtas leis an mBille seo, leanfar leis an gcóras faoina gcuirfear an ciste airgeadais do Bhord Scannán na hÉireann os comhair na Dála gach bliain faoi Vóta 42 de na Meastacháin don Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar mór sásaimh domsa, a Cheann Chomhairle, go bhfuil géarghá le reachtáil an Bhille seo anois toisc go bhfuil mé, la lán-tacaíocht ón Rialtas, tar éis polasaí cuimsitheach a chur i bhfeidhm i leith tionscal scannáin agus éist-fís na tíre seo cheana féin.  Go dtí seo, tá trí pholasaí fé leith curtha i bhfeidhm agam, agus is iad sin ná: ath-bhunú Bhord Scannán na hÉireann, agus Meastachán Forlíontach a fháil don Bhord i rith na bliana seo a chuir £1,145,000 ar fáil dóibh i 1993; reachtáil an Achta um Údarás Craolacháin (Leasú), 1993, i Mí an Mheithimh seo caite; agus reachtáil an Achta Airgeadais, 1993, a chuir trí leasuithe tábhachtacha i bhfeidhm i gcorás cánach na tíre seo i leith an tionscail.  Mar is eol do Theachtaí Dála cheana féin, tá mé ag plé fé láthair le céim pholasaí eile &mdash; bunú corás nua Theilefís na Gaeilge &mdash; agus tá mé sásta go mbeidh gach gné de héileamh <Col N="2064" /> an tionscail seo freagraithe agam nuair a chuirfidh mé an corás nua sin ar bun.</P>
    <P>It gives me particular pleasure to open this debate on Second Stage of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 1993.  The debate will afford Deputies the opportunity to outline their views on the measures which I, with the full support of the Government, have taken to promote the Irish film and audiovisual production industry in the short time since I was appointed Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the future priorities and needs of the industry.  I would like to say from the outset that, in so far as future policy orientations for the Irish film and audiovisual production industry are concerned, I would welcome and I am prepared to seriously consider any constructive suggestions which might emanate from this debate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is to increase the limit of the total amount of funds which can be expended, by way of investments, loans, grants or other liabilities, by Bord Scannán an hÉireann&mdash;the Irish Film Board &mdash; under section 10 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, from the present limit of £4.1 million to £15 million. In raising this limit on the amount of funds which the board can spend, the provisions of section 5 of the 1980 Act still remain in force.  Section 5 provides that &ldquo;the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, grants to the board to enable it to perform its functions and to meet its administrative and general expenses&rdquo;.  If Oireachtas approval is given to this Bill, the effect of raising the limit of the amount to be spent by the board to £15 million will be that, through the annual Estimates process, Dáil Éireann can vote moneys to the board annually through the Vote for An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta up to this new limit.  Therefore, I must emphasise to Deputies that the Bill is essentially enabling legislation which does not automatically give rise to Exchequr costs. However, the position is that the £4.1 <Col N="2065" /> million limit under section 10 of the 1980 Act has now been exhausted and it will not be possible for the House to vote funds for the Irish Film Board in 1994 or subsequent years unless this limit is increased as envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In recommending the Bill to Deputies, I believe it would be worthwhile to place the measure in the context of the history of the rather fragmented efforts which successive Governments have taken to promote a film and audiovisual industry in this country.  The history of film making in Ireland has been one of many brave beginnings, some dispiriting episodes and, above all, ongoing debate about whether film is a commercial enterprise on the one hand or a cultural activity on the other.</P>
    <P>Many attempts have been made to create an Irish film industry, which began with the first indigenous Irish films &mdash; Denis Johnston's <i>Guest of the Nation,</i> from the Frank O'Connor story, made in 1935, and Tom Cooper's <i>The Dawn,</i> which was made in Kerry the following year.  There were interventions by American film companies making films on Irish subjects; there was the establishment of Irish cinema newsreels and support by Government for documentary films.  In this connection I should record my personal admiration of the efforts of Gael Linn in this process &mdash; it produced a weekly newsreel in Irish for many years as well as the highly acclaimed films &ldquo;Mise Éire&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Saoirse&rdquo;.  There was also a growing consciousness that our rich theatre and story telling tradition, our narrative ability, and our acting talent would provide the basic resources to attract international production companies here &mdash; with a concomitant financial return to the Irish economy &mdash; and, very importantly, the opportunity to build up a pool of skills and expertise in Ireland to form a future core of native film workers, writers, actors, directors and producers, all the skills involved in the production of films.</P>
    <P>These were some of the concerns that led to the founding in 1958 of Ardmore Studios, a private enterprise that had the backing of the State-owned Industrial <Col N="2066" /> Credit Company Limited.  Two years later, in 1960, the Irish Film Finance Corporation &mdash; a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company &mdash; began to offer loans to foreign producers using Ardmore. However, it quickly became evident that visiting production companies were importing most of their own expertise and that the networks for the distribution of film were owned and operated by American studios, thus diminishing the opportunity for Irish film makers to reach markets and audiences.  Within a period of two years, the Irish Film Finance Corporation had ceased to operate.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Telefís Éireann on New Year's Eve 1961 began a process of film and television broadcasting that reinforced interest from Irish viewers, and decisively engaged in the training of technical and production sectors.  While the vast majority of drama and documentary work was handled by RTE's own staff, the late 1960s saw the first green shoots of independent film work coming from a variety of Irish sources, both documentary and fiction, together with growing activity in the making of advertisements and commercials.  At the same time it must be said that the arrival of television in Ireland, in line with experience elsewhere, led to a decline in cinemagoing.  Indeed, the decline in cinema attendance worldwide led to a serious decline in the quality of film, which I am glad to say has been redressed in recent years.</P>
    <P>To return to the long history of events leading to the enactment of the Film Board Act, 1980, an invitation by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to the film director John Huston to chair a commission on the Irish film industry led to the Huston report in 1968, one of the most important documents in Irish film history.  As a consequence of this report a Film Industry Bill was presented to the Oireachtas in 1970 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Unhappily, the Bill lapsed due, in some part, to the trauma of political events around that time.</P>
    <P>The next decade saw some, albeit modest, developments.  The enactment <Col N="2067" /> of the Arts Act, 1972, empowered An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, to promote low-budget film-making as well as some training, and also to provide support for film festivals and the work of the Irish Film Institute.  The fortunes of Ardmore Studios waxed and waned.  In 1978 the Government again intervened, this time commissioning a British-based firm, A.D. Little, to survey the scene and to propose a stategy.  Following its report, and wide-ranging representations from the film community, the Film Industry Bill was revised.  The Bill informed the basis of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, and the board met for the first time on 24 August 1981.  Six years later, on 25 June 1987, the then Taoiseach announced the winding down of the board and its replacement by a tax-based incentive for corporate investment in Irish film projects.</P>
    <P>In retrospect &mdash; and I acknowledge that it is easy for us all to be wise after the event &mdash; perhaps expectations for the first Film Board were unrealistic. There had been talk of a revolving fund, reinvesting returns from commercially profitable films to top up the board's modest resources; and expectations that these returns would follow in a relatively short space of time &mdash; perhaps this calculation was unrealistic &mdash; and a perception of film which laid greater emphasis on its character within a manufacturing and business ethos than as cultural enterprise providing Irish employment and a return to the economy within an immense and complex industry.</P>
    <P>I believe the work of the Film Board has been underestimated.  I should like to pay tribute this evening to the range of work it undertook and to the successes it achieved.  Apart from supporting screen plays and film and television projects, the board also ran notable training courses, especially for producers &mdash; which proved very valuable later on &mdash; helped in the establishment of a national film archive, provided a presence for Ireland at markets and festivals abroad, assisted Irish film festivals and events and formed co-production partnerships and <Col N="2068" /> vital contacts with the international film sector.  The board was also involved in the early negotiations for Ireland's participation in the very successful MEDIA programme of the EC, now the European Union.</P>
    <P>In the course of its life, the first board supported over 25 shorts and documentaries and enabled more than a dozen feature length films to reach cinema and television screens at home and around the world.  It achieved an approximate 10 per cent return on its investment, raised the level of skills and employment, enabled new facility houses to contribute to the economy and gave a start to many careers &mdash; some of whom, like Neil Jordan, have now become international household names &mdash; as well as encouraging talent still in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The demise of the first board was greeted with widespread dismay by the industry.  In the period from 1987 it was only those with the power to secure international funding who found it possible to exploit the Irish tax incentives which replaced the Film Board.  Although there were significant successes&mdash;such as &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;&mdash; in this period, the scene for medium and low budget indigenous projects to achieve production was now bleak indeed.  This period lasted until the opening of the new Irish Film Centre in September 1992, and the initiative of the Taoiseach in establishing the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry, which promptly reported to him on Christmas Eve 1992.  Subsequently the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997 committed the new Government to three specific measures &mdash; the preparation of a White Paper on the film industry; the creation of a new regulatory framework for broadcasting and the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a third channel with limited broadcasting hours.  The Programme for Government also indicated that consideration would be given to the reintroduction of the Film Board and to increasing and extending tax incentives for the film industry.</P>
    <P>Any objective assessment of the events <Col N="2069" /> in the relatively short period since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will conclude that this Government has already gone well beyond its commitments in the Programme for Government.  When one recalls that those commitments were in respect of the lifetime of this Government, rather than simply its first year of operation, the significance of the measures which I have taken to promote the industry is all the more apparent.</P>
    <P>Taking the Programme for Government and the report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry as my starting reference documents, Deputies will by now be aware that I have taken the following measures to promote the Irish film and audiovisual industry.  First, I moved promptly to re-establish the Irish Film Board last April, thus avoiding what I believe would have been a time-consuming exercise in preparing a White Paper for the industry.  A Supplementary Estimate to enable the board to function was passed by this House last July, this enabled me to provide £200,000 for the administrative costs of the board in 1993 and £945,000 for capital expenditure, thus exhausting the limit of £4.1 million under section 10 of the 1980 Act and creating the need for the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>Second, I promoted the enactment last June of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, which obliges Radio Telefís Éireann to make specific amounts available for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector every year.  The amount to be set aside for this purpose will be £5 million in 1994, rising in stages to £10 million in 1998 and 20 per cent of television expenditure in 1999 and thereafter, or £12.5 million, whichever is the greater.  The amount of £12.5 million will be adjusted annually in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Third, following strong representations which I made to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, the Finance Act, 1993 included three major tax concessions for the industry.  These included the raising of the limit for section 35 relief <Col N="2070" /> from £200,000 to £350,000 per annum or from a total of £600,000 to £1,050,000 over a three year period; the extension of section 35 relief to individuals who will now be able to invest up to £25,000 in a section 35 film investment each year; and the waiving of the 75 per cent Irish production test for qualifying films under section 35, provided the film in question is a co-production with other countries and at least 10 per cent of the production work is carried out in the State.</P>
    <P>The fourth and final measure which I am now about to embark upon is the establishment of the new Teilifís na Gaeilge service as a separate channel. Deputies opposite will agree that the establishment of this service represents the most important initiative by a Government in relation to our national language since the establishment of Raidió na Gaeltachta some 21 years ago.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn an céim tábhachtach nua seo go bhfuil mé fhéin agus an Rialtas dáirire ó thaobh ár dteanga dúchais a chaomhnú agus a neartú don todhchaí.  Le cabhair ó Theilifís na Gaeilge, beidh ar chumas tuismitheoirí a thaispeáint dá bpáistí gur rud beo, bríomhar, nua-aoiseach í an Ghaeilge, agus gur cuid dá saol laethúil í freisin.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil tionchar thar a bheith tábhachtach ag meán na teilifíse ar ár saol agus ar ár n-iompar, agus le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge beidh deis againn anois leas a bhaint as an méan an-chumhachtach seo chun ár gcultúr agus ár n-oidhreacht féin a shaibhriú, agus lámh a bheith againn in ár gcinniúint féin mar phobal.</P>
    <P>The new Teilifís na Gaeilge service will also have an important impact on the development of the Irish audiovisual industry.  The intention is that programmes will be commissioned from the independent sector, with Radio Telefís Éireann contributing approximately an hour of programming per day.  It is estimated that the new service will create 230 jobs directly &mdash; 200 of these in the independent sector.  The new television service, together with the measures arising from the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, will mean that our independent production sector will <Col N="2071" /> now experience significant new opportunities for development and expansion. They will have two important platforms for launching their products.  This, I believe, is as it should be, because this sector has already proved itself to be capable of producing a range of high quality programming.  The sector has a strong export orientation and, to realise its full potential of creating significant employment and value added to the economy, it requires a guaranteed domestic base.  I am now ensuring such a guaranteed base by the broadcasting measures already enacted and by the new Teilifís na Gaeilge service.  These measures should unleash the great reservoir of talent which exists in the independent production sector &mdash; talent which has been demonstrated already by a series of Irish films and films made in Ireland in recent years which have received wide popular acclaim, both nationally and internationally.  The unique feature of talent is, of course, that it cannot be measured in terms of population size or geography, nor is its potential dependent on market share. Talent provides the potential for wealth creation and jobs if it is developed properly and sensitively.  All the measures have now been put in place by this Government to develop Ireland's considerable talent to the full in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I would also like to advise Deputies that I have taken steps to ensure that the considerable investment which the State is now putting into the Irish film and audiovisual industry &mdash; directly by way of seed funding, and indirectly by way of tax concessions and programme commissioning in the Irish and English languages &mdash; will be complemented by the activities of the semi-State sector.  It is enormously important that all remaining obstacles to the full flowering of this industry be tackled over time.  Among those remaining obstacles I cite the absence of a film commission to facilitate offshore and indigenous production companies by the semi-State sector; the need for new training strategies to ensure <Col N="2072" /> that the uptake of activity in the industry will be matched by the coming on stream of new skilled practitioners; the whole question of distribution of Irish films for Irish audiences, including metropolitan/ regional imbalances, the promotion of Irish films abroad and the question of the Irish language and film.</P>
    <P>It is an earnest of my determination not to be complacent about the future requirements of the industry, not-withstanding the significant measures already taken by me, that I have secured nominations from the relevant Ministers of senior officials of the semi-State sector who will participate in a new committee established by the Irish Film Board under section 16 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.  This committee will address the issues I have just listed, as well as others, over time.  The committee is being chaired by the Irish Film Board and comprises senior representatives of Radio Telefís Éireann, Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Industrial Development Authority, FÁS, An Bord Tráchtála and Bórd Fáilte.  My Department is also represented on the committee. I am confident that this committee will ensure that the concerted efforts by the semi-State sector will remove any remaining obstacles to the development of the industry.  However, in the event that wider issues may arise which cannot be addressed by this committee, I intend to take such matters up directly with the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>The success of the Irish Film Board will be measured by employment and value-added to the Irish economy which can be achieved over time by virtue of its existence.  A report by Messrs.  Coopers and Lybrand last year indicated that, for every £1 million spent on feature film or television programming, the equivalent of some 48-50 full-time jobs are created for one year.  The significance of Film Board activities is that, by providing seed funding of around 10 per cent of the cost of a project, it has a significant multiplier effect on activity in the sector.  Thus, if the Film Board was to spend, say, £2 million on production finance for films with a large commercial potential in a <Col N="2073" /> given year, this could generate up to £20 million of production activity and the equivalent of some 1,000 full-time jobs for one year would be created.  When one considers that, in some cases, as much as 80 per cent of the budgets for feature film and television film and drama is sourced from abroad by way of pre-sales and distribution deals, the foreign investment which this level of activity would generate represents a most important level of value-added to the economy.</P>
    <P>However, while what I quoted is helpful as an indication of the impact of my measures on the film and audiovisual sector, it is important that my Department and, indeed, the Irish taxpayer should have access to some effective monitoring.  I might add that a monitoring system is being established to gauge the real impact of these measures over time.  Therefore, I am pleased to inform the House that the industry, through the Audiovisual Production Federation of IBEC, has already adopted a very responsible position in this regard. In full consultation with my Department and with the Irish Film Board, the federation has devised a draft economic data base form which it is intended will be completed by all practitioners in receipt of State support for their projects, whether in the form of direct Film Board assistance, section 35 finance, or programme commissioning from either Radio Telefís Éireann or Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Procedures will also have to be put in place to ensure that there will be no duplication of information contained in the data base in respect of projects which would be in receipt of more than one source of assistance, for example, from the Irish Film Board and from section 35 allowances.</P>
    <P>I wish to warmly congratulate the Irish film and audiovisual industry, through the Irish Film Board and the Audiovisual Production Federation, on their foresight in proceeding with the establishment of this economic data base.  Indeed, the measure could be construed as a form of monitoring by the industry.  This is a very true indicator of the commitment now existing within the film community.  I am <Col N="2074" /> pleased that the federation will provide the resources for the ongoing running of the data base.  In this connection I should mention to Deputies that, when I launched the report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry last July in the company of a wide cross section of industry representatives, I made it clear that, while I am of course anxious that the measures I have taken will benefit those industry practitioners who have operated under very difficult conditions for many years &mdash; I was anxious to remove the atmosphere of gloom that had descended on the film community &mdash; I am equally anxious that the measures will also benefit the many talented and committed women and men who are graduating from our dedicated educational institutions each year.  I stated then that these measures must serve to bring along a new generation of film and television practitioners who will produce projects of quality and of interest to the cinema-going and television-viewing public both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I further pointed out to the industry representatives on that occasion that I believe that the main obstacles which hindered the growth of the film and audio-visual industry here have now been removed.  I stated that it was now the responsibility of the industry to respond to these favourable conditions and, indeed, to deliver on the promises &mdash; in terms of job creation and value-added to the economy &mdash; which they had made in their submission to the special working group.  The industry decision to establish this new economic data base is an indication of how seriously they have taken my remarks on that occasion and, much more important, of how serious they intend to address the issue of delivering on the promises they made.  For my part, I am confident that these measures will bring the anticipated results.  I welcome the responsible stance of the industry in endeavouring, from the outset, to establish objective machinery to gauge the impact of these and other measures over time.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the current Irish <Col N="2075" /> Film Board under its very able chairperson, Lelia Doolan.  I wish to thank those who have agreed to serve on the board at this important time in the history of the film industry.  I should also like to explain why the Bill is confined to just one measure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that, since its re-establishment last April, the new board has decided to concentrate its activities on the provision of development loans and production loans in the form of investment in production.  The board does not propose at this stage, therefore, to avail of its powers under the 1980 Act to provide grants or guarantees.</P>
    <P>The development loans which the board offers are up to a maximum of £25,000 and will be repayable on the first day of principal photography. These will be essentially research and development/feasibility loans, and no interest rates will be charged on them. However, if the loan is not repaid on the first day of principal photography, it will be rolled up in the production budget and an interest rate of 10 per cent will be charged from that day.  No charge will be taken by the board on copyright as this would inhibit the producer's options in gaining co-financiers and would therefore, defeat the purpose of the development loan function.</P>
    <P>In the case of production loans, the criteria adopted by the board, with a keen awareness of accountability and transparency, relate to the artistic quality of the product; previous production track record; the Irish employment content at all grades and the expected spend in Ireland on ancillary services and facilities; distribution-sale deals, and the potential for equity recoupment.  The form of assistance given is investment in the production and its sales for cinema, television, video and ancillary markets&mdash; cable, satellite, box office etc. &mdash; both in Ireland and worldwide.  The investment will not entail an interest charge, but will be subject to rigorous measures for recoupment and subject to contract.  The economic data base to which I referred, and which is designed to identify performance <Col N="2076" /> in employment and value-added, will be applied by the board in the monitoring of projects.</P>
    <P>There are already encouraging signs that the Irish film community is gearing up to meet all of the new opportunities and challenges provided by the Film Board.  The Film Board has reported an enthusiastic response to the first and second rounds of submissions which it invited since its establishment last April. In the first round last July, there were 67 applications for development loans and 26 for feature length fiction; there was, as it were, a pent up demand.  Seventeen development and five production loans were approved.  In the current round &mdash; lest one might think it was pent up demand alone &mdash; there were almost 100 applications for both fiction and documentary assistance.  The board is now in the process of offering 13 development, eight production and five documentary development loans.</P>
    <P>In terms of quality, Deputies will be particularly pleased to learn of the board's perception that this is exceptionally high.  It is the board's intention to balance economic and cultural factors, mixing their selection between medium to high budget films aimed at commercial markets and larger popular audiences, with lower budget cultural work that may play successfully at festivals and art house cinemas, as well as on television.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I look to the board to find a wise equilibrium between the cultural and commercial aspects of Irish cinema &mdash; to which I referred &mdash; and so create a fresh and vibrant synthesis in this long-standing discourse.  It is a matter of national urgency that this talented and productive national asset should find outlets and audiences at home and abroad. The diversity of Irish culture and the dynamic of our multi-faceted debates demands no less.  For, in the end, cultural pluralism, not cultural domination is our destiny.</P>
    <P>I have informed the House that the last Film Board secured a return of some 10 per cent on its investments.  The current board proposes to pursue outstanding repayments vigorously.  To this end, I <Col N="2077" /> hope to see the establishment of a production collection agency in Ireland to police production loans rather than relying, as at present, on the British Film Trustee Company, a subsidiary of British Screen, which handles such agreements internationally.</P>
    <P>I engaged in extensive consultation with a wide range of industry interests, as well as the relevant Government Departments, in addressing the question of the amendment of the 1980 Act.  In the many responses which I received in the matter, I was heartened by the fact that the industry seems to accept that the 1980 Act is generally well drafted and still remains pertinent to the needs of the industry in the 1990s.  As I already explained to Deputies, my overriding priority is to secure Oireachtas approval to raise the currently exhausted limit under section 10 of the 1980 Act, which will have the effect of enabling the House to vote funds to the Irish Film Board from 1994 onwards.  In the time available, it was not open to me to sponsor any other amendments.  However, I want to say to those who made submissions and to Members who may have further suggestions to make that I am committed to undertaking an interim assessment of the Irish Film Board's performance after its first two years of operation.  I concluded it was wise to give it two years to operate and see what the experience was. This review will be in mid-1995.  I assure the House that in the light of that assessment, the submissions I received from the industry and the thoughtful contributions of Deputies this evening, I will consider any amendments of the 1980 Act which are warranted at that stage.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, molaim an Bille seo don Dáil.  I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As the Minister said, it gives us an opportunity to reflect on this industry and plans for the future.  I wish the Minister luck in his meetings with the Minister for Finance, given the budgetary implications in the Bill for Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> Can the Minister give any indication of the amount which the Irish Film Board considers necessary in 1994 to satisfy the pace of investment it would like to make in relation to film?  Clearly the £15 million is the top amount and, as the Minister said, this is enabling legislation.  In relation to Teilifís na Gaeilge I press the Minister to publish the technical report on the station.  In the interests of transparency that should be available while the decision is being discussed.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to give some more detail to the House in relation to funding of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I would be particularly interested in whether any European funding is available for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister took an historic approach to this discussions in relation to the film industry.  I will do likewise to a degree.  I compliment the Minister on the detail in his speech and on some of his initiatives, to which I will refer later. When we look at the current position of the film industry and speculate about the future possibilities for that industry it is important to do our thinking in the right context.</P>
    <P>Film is arguably the most potent art form the world has known with its capacity to imprint images, crystallise attitudes, record history and, indeed, influence the way we see the world.  The nature of the way we encounter film has changed dramatically during the past 20 years.  Prior to television the cinema was a place to be visited frequently to enjoy newly issued movies.  You might go back to see a film which had made a particular impact but for the most part it was a once off experience.</P>
    <P>The arrival of television changed all that.  It made the films of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s strangely current, so that we have grown used to seeing different decades of the same face appearing on our small screens over a period of a week, whether that face belongs to Paul Newman, Marlon Brando or whoever.</P>
    <P>In addition to keeping film history current, television, allied to video sales and video rentals, means that films, once watched on a vast screen, can be taken <Col N="2079" /> home and viewed again and again.  It is no accident that so many of the lines from films are quoted often enough to become common currency.  Film is much more than an art form or an entertainment medium.</P>
    <P>Historians would argue that there are essentially three kinds of power: financial, military and intellectual.  During the dark ages, Ireland owned one of those forms of power.  Intellectually, the Irish scholars had a lead over the rest of Europe.  The manuscripts they carried across Europe were the conduits of the truths they sought to impart, and they themselves had a driven certainty that motivated their work and made their impact immeasurable.</P>
    <P>The arrival of print changed the mindset of the world, and the intellectual powerbase broadened.  Nonetheless, through our writers, we continued to have a substantial presence in the world of letters and, through our painters, a presence in the world of the visual arts.</P>
    <P>It is very significant, however, that at the turn of the century, at a time when Ireland was reasserting her nationhood, the multifaceted talent in the country was finding expression in the theatre.  The Abbey Theatre pulled together the poets and the dreamers, the writers and the actors, the artists and the artisans in a unique way.</P>
    <P>The Abbey allowed poets to explore a quite different medium from the white page in front of them.  It was a profoundly pluralist force.  I fully agree with the Minister's comments about the aim being to have a pluralist culture.</P>
    <P>Long before the world became a global village the Abbey allowed people from all parts of Dublin to sit in a darkened auditorium and share the agony of a woman whose children, one by one, had been lost at sea as they tried to eke a living as fishermen off the western seaboard. At a time when most of Dublin could convince itself that prostitution was something that happened in other countries, the Abbey was the place where a young O'Casey character told Dublin a different and true story.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> Also, just before the arrival of the mass media, the Abbey was the place where Augusta Gregory, fascinated by the myths and legends of the west of Ireland recorded them in small dramas.</P>
    <P>The reason I mentioned this is that the Abbey Theatre, in its early days, presented a model which should not be overlooked when we examine the potential of the film industry in Ireland.  It shows us what can happen when the creative tensions of various writers like Yeats, Synge and O'Casey are brought together.  The individual talents become surer and more individual.  The tensions are productive.  The early days of the Abbey also gave our actors a very special outlet.  It was much more than employment. It was a context within which an understanding of theatre and a specifically Irish style developed.  The Irish style of acting was sure-footed, understated and well illustrated by Barry Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make about the early days of the Abbey Theatre as a model for today's film industry is that the Abbey became internationally influential because it was rooted in the regional realities of Irish life.  It never copied theatrical conventions from other countries; it was constantly seeking to break through to a simplicity and a reality which was wholly Irish.  Not only was it rooted in Irish realities, it was rooted in the complexity of those realities.  Above all, it knew what it wanted to achieve long before it had the money to achieve it. The great benefactor of the Abbey, Miss Horniman, whose inheritance from her family tea business did so much to sustain Irish theatre at a vulnerable point in its development, was not a significant directional influence.</P>
    <P>When we look at the film industry at present what we see is a context which parallels, on a different scale, the context out of which the early Abbey Theatre grew.  If the Ireland of the early days of this century was an Ireland eager to assert itself at home and shake off a memory of repression, I believe the Ireland at the latter days of this century is an Ireland eager to assert itself at home and abroad, confident of its own ideas and increasingly <Col N="2081" /> unthreatened by the exploration of its changing values.</P>
    <P>Against that contextual background we can place many of the same assets which were at the disposal of the Abbey &mdash; actors, writers, designers and directors. If we do it right, in ten years' time Ireland should be regarded as a source of entertaining, thought-provoking high quality films and as a location uniquely attractive to overseas film makers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a vital building block in all of this.  We in Fine Gael welcome the Bill and the increase in funding provided. We welcome very much the reintroduction of the Irish Film Board and I wish its chair and members success in their work in the years ahead.  I see it as a very positive indicator about the future of the indigenous film industry.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board's essential task is to support and develop indigenous production. This is an apparently narrow task, but it is as narrow or as broad as the task that faced the Abbey Theatre. When we talk about an indigenous film industry it is possible I suppose, to associate the phrase, pejoratively with what is small, with what is local, with what is inconsequential.  But, obviously, that is a totally false association.  Great art is always local.  Great films, like great novels, take what is local, what is small and specific to a neighbourhood and a period in time, and make that understandable to a wider world and a wider audience.  I think that is what happened with the film &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;.  What could be smaller in scale than the story of a young man experiencing handicap and living in a home hampered by poverty? And yet Christy Browne emerged triumphantly accessible to filmgoers who had never set foot in Ireland or in Dublin. &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; made a massive impression, not in spite of the unique and local background but because of it.</P>
    <P>We must hope therefore that the Irish Film Board, in supporting and developing indigenous production, helps to develop confidence among Irish film makers in the themes, the language &mdash; I think that is very important &mdash; and the images which are distinctively Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> I suppose when we talk about supporting and developing it, that may not sound very dynamic.  But, dynamism is what is called for at this stage of the industry's story.  Many would say that at this stage, in terms of the potential of the industry, we are really only at about 5 per cent of what is achieveable.  We have had success, but as the Minister has said it has been sporadic.  What we need, of course, is the more broadly based confidence and competence that we are seeing in Irish literature at the moment, with the wide range of Irish writers gaining international success.  Thankfully, this time they do not have to leave the country.  In the past we censored them and exiled the best we produced, but hopefully they can now produce work at home and yet enjoy international success.</P>
    <P>We need to achieve the same kind of break through in the area of film.  We must encourage major film making here. I think we have to start to encourage it as early as possible.  That can best be done by reaching young people so that their understanding of film is not passive and spongelike but active and participatory. I feel very strongly that an awareness of film culture in primary and secondary schools is a prerequisite to developing what might be called an enterprise culture in film.  It is very important in the current climate that good quality films are made accessible to all, especially children.  Children need education in film appreciation in order to learn how to judge quality films.  I believe it is critical that media studies should be developed and encouraged during the junior cycle in school.  I know that the Minister was disappointed with the approach to arts and culture in the Green Paper on Education. I know the Minister has had discussions with the Minister for Education and I hope they have been fruitful; in fact, I would like to hear if they have been fruitful.  I hope that this point I am making on media studies will be taken up.  I think it is important also that Irish children see Irish films which represent their culture and their way of life.  If we can create the sort of enterprise culture that is needed, and to which the Minister <Col N="2083" /> referred, we can create jobs in filming, and not just seasonal jobs or jobs depending on the visitations of foreign directors. Such visits have become legends &mdash; for example, the wonderfully long contracts so many actors and film makers got during the making of &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;. We also need an enterprise culture that empowers people to embrace the freelance nature of film making and to make the very best of what the business offers.  I am not talking here about developing flexibility among individual film makers but about developing collective corporate flexibility in the State agencies.  I note the Minister has established a committee to look at this further. I think the State agencies have not always been good at coping with and facilitating the type of employment practices one may need in the film making industry.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs greater emphasis is the question of film education and training.  This brings me to one of the worries I have about the plan.  I accept the Minister's point that he is not doing an overview of the whole film sector but looking at the particular area of funding. But I wonder if we have the overall planning that we need to develop a policy at national level for film.  The Minister referred to the question of film commissions. Do we need regional film commissions, for example, to encourage local participation and to develop skills based on emerging technologies?  I think we need to see the expansion of post-production facilities such as editing, dubbing and sound track recording, much of which now goes to the UK.  There is no earthly reason that Ireland should not become the post production focus of Europe, if there was a vision and an overall strategy.  Do we have a national plan for production development and film culture?  I think the Minister will have to develop that national plan.  What is needed in this particular area of the arts is a clear directional plan which takes account of the huge potential this area offers for enrichment in culture and in employment.  Film archives should be developed and seen as an important part <Col N="2084" /> of our cultural heritage; obviously, both historical and contemporary films should be conserved.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on how he sees this developing.  I think it is important to develop this area further.</P>
    <P>The success of the Irish Film Centre, which recently celebrated its first birthday, and the Irish Film Institute is indicative of the public's appetite for the type of films which are being shown there.  An organisation like the Irish Film Institute, which gets 9.2 per cent of its funding from the Arts Council &mdash; quite low when you compare it with what other national institutions get &mdash; could do a lot more work in this area and in the area of education and regional linkages.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the success of film festivals around the country which are yet another indicator of the wide accessibility of this art form.  There is no doubt that film is moving from the margins to the centre of Irish culture, as the Minister remarked in his speech.  The initiatives under section 35 have been very helpful and I think the industry will use them well.  Many aspects come together in order to create that lively centre, and obviously the energy between different organisations and activities will ensure that the industry develops and grows in the next few years.  The Maastricht Treaty will ensure also that culture and cultural activities play a more central role in our lives and the European Union will do much to encourage this as well.  This obviously makes it an exciting time for developments in this area.  We can discuss further the role of RTE, for example, in showing Irish made films and having special events in relation to Irish film making.  That has been underdeveloped to a degree and we need a wider debate on it.</P>
    <P>The points I have mentioned augur well for the development of the industry in the immediate future.  The report of the special working group on the film production industry mentions that the Community's audiovisual production will grow by 40 per cent overall, including a growth of 50 per cent in television broadcast volumes by the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> The report projected that in the mid-nineties demand would be far in excess of the European industry's existing production capacity.  I would like to think that the Irish film industry will be in a position to satisfy much of the demand.</P>
    <P>Obviously the State has a role to play, particularly in the area of seed money for projects, but this must also be seen as an industry which is attractive to the private sector despite the risks.  It is interesting that we are discussing this Bill at a time when the whole question of protecting European film and television is current in the GATT negotiations.  Many of the European initiatives have originated in positive action within the European industry to help them deal with US competition which can make life very difficult for film makers in Europe.</P>
    <P>Obviously, national initiatives are very important in developing the film industry not just because of the employment and income created but because of the absolute necessity for us to portray our culture in our own way through our film industry. It is not an easy time for the industry because of the international economic recession.  It is to the credit of Irish film makers that we have had the sort of success we have had with films over the last number of years.  It augurs well for the industry that we have had these successes at a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about the economic database and in relation to monitoring.  It is important to have those criteria in place.  I also welcome the news from the Irish Film Board regarding the number of applications which have been made.  They will be looking for money to support them and that may give rise to difficulty.  I welcome the response they are getting at this stage from film makers.  I hope that over the coming year we will see many of our young film makers getting opportunities to develop and exploit their talents through training, skills development and the sort of seed funding which they need for film making.</P>

      <P>As we are moving towards 10 p.m. if this debate was being held in a <Col N="2086" /> cinema it would be called the late showing. Like Deputy Fitzgerald I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>Ag an tosach dúirt an tAire go raibh sé ag súil le díospóireacht shuimiúil ar an mBille seo.  Tá ábhar díospóireachta sa Bhille go deimhin ach is beag ábhar conspóideach atá ann.  Thug an tAire cur síos suimiúil ar bhunús an tionscail scannáin agus éist/fís sa tír seo ina óráid.</P>
      <P>My contribution will be a more philosophic discourse than Deputy Fitzgerald's, and infinitely more prosaic.  This Bill extends the budget of the newly constituted Irish Film Board.  As such, it is to be welcomed and supported in the House.  Over the years our film industry has earned a fine reputation at home and abroad and it has a capacity to grow, to generate jobs in a wide variety of disciplines, to enhance the image of Ireland abroad, to attract inward investment and energise whole communities.  In that respect, I will briefly recall the sense of excitement in west Cork during the summer around the making of &ldquo;The War of the Buttons&rdquo;, particularly the excitement in classrooms in Cork city when auditions were being held for young actors to play a role in that film.  Young people's imaginations were lit up by the film and that will have a lasting impact in the area long after the production unit has been dismantled.  That film will have a positive impact in creating a critical audience for films in the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be hard to overestimate the importance of film making and the film industry.  It can be justifiably argued that the industry deserves a level of State investment.  There is good economic justification for State investment.  We need look no further than the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report which was quoted in detail by the Minister.  The report told us that for every £1 million spent on feature film or television programming the equivalent of some 48 to 50 full time jobs for one year is created.  That is impressive.  The report also says that every £2 million invested by the film board will generate the spending of another £18 million, and that too is impressive.  The film board must go on to develop good policy priorities <Col N="2087" /> as to how this money is to be spent. Essentially this money must go in the first instance to promote good script writing and to fund production development. Good producers are the key to making things happen.  It is crucially important that producers be given seed funding at an early stage of the development of the project.  Timing is as important as the granting of the money.  It is important that this seed money can then be used to generate further finance.</P>
    <P>We must be honest in saying that Ireland will never be a major producer of full length feature movies but it has the capacity to generate a substantial number of good quality feature films. To enable it to do that, it will never be possible to provide 100 per cent indigenous investment on the scale required. For that reason I was particularly pleased with the finance measures introduced in the budget last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the three key measures, three major tax concessions for the industry which are crucially important.  One was the raising of the limit for section 35 relief from £200,000 to £350,000 per annum, or from a total of £600,000 to £1,050,000 over a three-year period.  That is fundamental and should act as an incentive for domestic and overseas investment in the private sector.  It is a move which, in conjunction with the other three measures outlined by the Minister, is welcome. It is encouraging to note that the Minister successfully carried through the proposals made at budget time last year. Nevertheless, the impact of the measures should be monitored.  The Minister should tell us if they are achieving the desired result and if we have the necessary money and incentives to generate further moneys; in other words, is the combination correct?  I would welcome an occasional report from the Minister in that regard.  It is important that the mix and formula is right because, given the level of financing from various sources, there is considerable potential in that area.  We have the writing and acting skills and proven capacity at the level of <Col N="2088" /> directing films.  We also have the technical resources, although not always in full measure, to originate first class feature films &mdash; our track record proves that. The Minister and Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned some of the great films made here in the past.</P>
    <P>Primarily, film is an art form but it is a type of hybrid because it is also an industry and must be viewed from both angles. It is the most spectacular and potent art form on the 20th century.  In its dayto-day operations the film board should concern itself primarily with the art of film making because that is the bedrock of the business.  Good films must be marketed aggressively at home and abroad. Accordingly, the Minister should seek to put in place a special section within existing State marketing bodies, such as CTT and the overseas division of the IDA, with a specific commitment to marketing films abroad.  Very often good film makers do not have the skills or expertise to market their films and require assistance from such State bodies.  If the film industry is to be put on a par with other industries in terms of its importance to the Irish economy, should we not expect CTT and the overseas division of the IDA to pay due attention to the marketing of Irish films abroad?  We should also seek to build into the film industry a marketing expertise so that there would be in-house skills within the industry to complement the efforts put into marketing by the State bodies to which I referred.  Marketing and distribution are important factors in the promotion of the film industry.</P>
    <P>Feature films should be marketed first in Ireland and then abroad.  There are two principal markets, namely, commercial and art house, and the film board should direct its attention equally to the various requirements of those two markets. Access to international films in Ireland generally is poor at present. While the Irish film centre provides an excellent service it is almost impossible, except during film festival time, for audiences outside Dublin to have access to a wide range of world films and that concerns me.  How will we cultivate a critical audience if film boards in the provinces <Col N="2089" /> are fed constantly on mass productions from the United States?  If the young generation is fed consistently on a diet of junk food they are unlikely to adapt overnight to <i>nouvelle cuisine.</i> If Irish film goers in rural areas are fed a diet of American films they will not make good audiences for art films made at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined his achievements to date and I accept they are impressive.  Nevertheless, he could introduce many other measures.  For example, he should consider creating a mechanism that would establish a network of film exhibitions for the regions so that the quality and nature of films seen by Dublin film goers at the Irish Film Centre are more accessible in provincipal towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The film board must also concern itself with short films such as fiction and documentaries, the medium by which young Irish film makers ply their trade and learn their craft.  It is the cradle of the industry of tomorrow.  The Minister attended the Cork Film Festival at which many exceptionally good short films by a number of Irish film makers were shown.  Those films were intrinsically good in their own right and give me confidence that in time and with experience those young film makers will improve their short films and, perhaps, become part of the making of feature films.  The short film is a very important art form in the same way as the short story.  With people such as O'Connor and O'Faoláin we have seen the strong development of the short story in Irish literature.  Some of the best short stories in modern European literature originated here and there is equal potential for the making of good short fiction films and documentaries.</P>
    <P>I would like to see RTE and the Irish Film Board encouraging the making, exhibition and marketing of short films and documentaries.  There is potential for the production by the independent sector of a series of documentaries for transmission on RTE and we referred to that some months ago in the context of the broadcasting Bill.  There is great potential also for co-production between RTE and BBC Northern Ireland.  I would like to see <Col N="2090" /> that area explored and exploited more fully.</P>
    <P>We have a wealth of good script writers, but by their very nature writers tend to operate in isolation.  We need to develop a mechanism that would create a culture of collaboration among writers to underpin the film industry and it would be easier to do that with the young generation. There is a pyramid of good writers here at the top of which are people such as Séamus Heaney and Eavan Boland, if I may draw an analogy with poetry in this context.  There is a layer of good middle-aged poets &mdash; if I may use that phrase &mdash; and a further layer of young and promising poets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, the point I am trying to make is that it may be easier to promote this culture of collaboration among young writers given that a number of our very good writers wrote at a time when there was less emphasis on the potential of scriptwriting for films and fewer opportunities for scriptwriters to underpin the film industry.  Therefore, the culture of collaboration is not as strong among some of our older writers. However, it should be easy to cultivate it now that there is potential, opportunities and a challenge.  This is important because the good script and story is the key or cornerstone of the good film.  It is important, therefore, that we should pay some attention to this matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the GATT negotiations, now drawing to a close. This has been the great epic of our time. We do not know what the outcome will be or if the French film industry will be affected, but I very much hope that it will not be injured unduly when the final agreement is signed on Friday or Saturday. We are living in the age of the <Col N="2091" /> open market and &mdash; this is a paradox&mdash; of conflicting forces; in many ways we are breaking down barriers.  It is important at the same time that we cultivate, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, &ldquo;the local&rdquo; because this is the key to a good story. The great stories of the world centre on a small incident, not in terms of its impact but of its geographical location.</P>
    <P>My memory is not as good as it was but in one of his great poems Patrick Kavanagh wrote about the little field where the most important things in the world happen, where the most important emotions are unleashed and where the most important relationships are built up or dismantled.  I very much hope that the French film industry will be allowed to retain the advantage it has on the world stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the idea of imposing a small levy on a cinema seat was mooted in this country on a number of occasions, &mdash; it was abandoned in England &mdash; and it is worth considering.  This would be a good idea and filmgoers and the film industry could sustain it.  It could be used to create a fighting fund for the fledgling Irish film industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that he will.  I put it forward as an idea worthy of consideration.  While there is a limit to what the State can provide directly &mdash; money is not flaithiúlach &mdash; there is much potential and an extraordinary amount of young talent.  We must revise our ideas as to where jobs can be created.  In Germany today there are more jobs available in the arts-media-film-entertainment-broadcasting industry than in the motor car manufacturing industry.  This is an extraordinary development in a country such as Germany which is the home of the great Volkswagen.  The same can happen here.  We must look to the industry to provide a number of the jobs we so badly need; it has the capacity to do this but we have to provide funding.  I think we can justify generating this funding by way of <Col N="2092" /> the seat levy.  I do not know if the Minister will have the capacity to introduce such a levy under these extraordinary regulations that are being foisted upon us from all sources but, if so, it would be worth his while carrying out some market research to see if it would be feasible and to assess the spin-off effects.</P>
      <P>I foresee a great future for the film industry and I commend the Minister for reconstituting the Irish Film Board, appointing as its head the dynamic Ms Lelia Doolan and introducing all the measures outlined in his speech this evening.  Films such as &ldquo;The Crying Game&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, to mention but two, have gained for this country an enviable reputation on the world stage at a time when other aspects of Irish life are doing little to enhance it abroad.  I refer specifically to the troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Films like &ldquo;Into the West&rdquo;, Pat Murphy's &ldquo;Anne Devlin&rdquo; and Cathal Black's &ldquo;Pigs&rdquo; are of the highest quality which could have made a stronger mark in the international art house market if they had been better marketed.  I discussed this matter recently with someone who feels strongly that there is a need to market our films better abroad.  We have learned many lessons during the past ten years. We now know what films are worth investing in and that it is necessary to market and distribute them if the industry is to thrive.  It is well positioned to expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for paying attention to these matters.  I am glad that he has said the operations of the Irish Film Board will be addressed in 1995. This is important because if a more detailed assessment of the progress made by the Irish Film Board prior to 1987 had been carried out and if there had been a more open debate, it might not have been abolished.  It is important to discuss at intervals what progress has been made. Film making has enormous potential. However, it can fail occasionally and we must acknowledge that and be prepared for it.  It is in the nature of the business that not every film will succeed.  We must not be disheartened if occasionally we <Col N="2093" /> have a failure.  I have no doubt that any failure will attract a huge level of public comment.  We should anticipate that and, if necessary, come in and discuss it logically in the House in the context of the ambitions for the film industry in the next five years.  I think five years is a reasonable time, but I would be very appreciative if the Minister would come in, put his cards on the table and tell us how the industry is doing, what measures are succeeding and which need to be topped up and which scaled down.  That would be a sensible, constructive and creative way to approach the whole business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I want to welcome the Bill the Minister is introducing here tonight.  It is a very welcome development which is long overdue.  The reactivation of the film board will be remembered of this Minister and of this Government, because the abolition of that board in the first instance was as much a reflection of the attitude to film and to culture as it was of the balanced books and perhaps it was the attitude towards balancing books which dictated the attitude to culture as well.</P>
      <P>I am one of that generation that spent their childhood in the cinema, as it is called nowadays &mdash; when I was a child we went to the pictures.  The new younger generation are going back to the cinema. They are going back for a variety of reasons but particularly because now, more and more these days, it reflects what are perhaps universal values, messages and stories about human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking again at the pictures we <Col N="2094" /> saw as children, as we often do when looking at television, I realise how much World War II propaganda I imbibed at the time without realising it.  They were at the time exciting adventure stories.  It took the best part of 40 years to realise that what was produced, certainly from the American Industry, was very much propaganda in support of the war aims of the Allies of that time.  I make that point because, clearly, cinema is not objective in terms of what it produces.  Many factors go into making a film.  The script that the scriptwriter produces is then given to a producer, who, it is hoped, will get the finance for the film.  The finance, no doubt, will have an influence on the script as well and the director will have an influence on how that is subsequently defined and put on the screen. At the end of the day the way the film is cut will have an impact on what the message is.  There are many different elements that go into making a film and many different attitudes and views.  Perhaps the most powerful influence is exercised by the institutions or individuals who actually provide the finance because they can pull the plug or let the film live as they choose.  It is important to bear that in mind when we talk about film and the way it can be developed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When I knew the question of the film board was to be debated this week, it struck me to wonder to what extent if any we would touch on the video industry.  I have not had the time to do the research I would like to do on that area, but in the last number of weeks the papers have been full of stories of how it was claimed videos effected the actions of two ten year old boys in Britain who murdered an unfortunate little baby.  It is an area that I am not in any sense an expert on and I do not pretend to be.  However, if we are developing a film industry we must be conscious that the film industry will inevitably be a video industry and we must be aware that this, in its own way and in its own time, will create dilemmas for us about the kind of film industry <Col N="2095" /> we want, the kind of material that is produced and the kind of market that it is directed towards.</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer to these questions.  I simply put the marker down that we are essentially entering into an era where we must all be much more conscious of the effects of cinema and television, either benign or malign.  I am not completely convinced that television or cinema have the power that people claim they have.  I spent most of my youth in the cinema and I do not believe that I took away from the cinema views or attitudes about violence, death or crime and, in the nature of things, most of the films I saw were about war, bank robberies, etc.  It is an issue that we need to be aware of.  We need to incorporate this question of how one reads a film into our education system in some way.  I do not know how the education system can do everything it is expected to do, but a lifeskills programme in our schools could touch on that area.  It seems that it would be of value.  A person sitting looking at a television or cinema screen will not have to have a PhD in cinema in order to be able to understand what the messages are and that the message, whether it be a bloody one or otherwise, is not simply that which flashes on the screen.</P>
    <P>The reactivation of the Irish Film Board goes a long way towards repairing the damage caused by the axing of the original board in 1987.  The Minister has also let it be known that the new film board should be seen in the context of the overall strategy for the audio-visual industry, which includes the lifting of the advertising cap on RTE, the establishment of a fund for independent film makers in the station's budget and the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge, all of which I support and welcome.  The reactivation of the film board has been widely welcomed and has added to the mood of optimism in the film industry created by the success of films such as &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo;, <Col N="2096" />&ldquo;The Crying Game&rdquo; and indeed, &ldquo;The Snapper&rdquo;.  It is significant that all of those pictures avoided, and deliberately avoided, seeking to portray the stereotypical Irishman or women or situation. Their success on that basis alone has importance for the development of an Irish film industry.  The basis for future success exists.  The talent is here in terms of writing, directing, acting and in regard to the other aspects that constitute the film making process.  However, there has been a reluctance on the part of the investors to play their part in the success story of the Irish film industry.  While &ldquo;The Crying Game&rdquo; yielded profits of £55 million, the director Neil Jordan could not raise the £800,000 necessary to make the film here and it was mostly made in England, thus depriving Ireland of both jobs and profits.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It will not be resolved simply by the amendment to section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, welcome as that is.  As a result of this amendment investors can now claim tax allowances of up to £400,000 on a maximum investment of £1.05 million.</P>
    <P>Banks do not understand the business and are generally wary of what they regard as a notoriously risky sector.  In the words of one banker: &ldquo;it is regarded as fairly exotic, particularly by lenders&rdquo;. This wariness may be overcome if full advantage is taken of the facilities offered by the film financing body Euro Media Garanties (EMG) which operates within the framework of the EC Media 95 Programme and Eureke Audiovisual.  EMG offers to guarantee loans advanced to EC producers for film and television co-productions involving partners from two other member countries of the Council of Europe.  EMG will underwrite 70 per cent of a bank's investment in a film project.  That should help the banks to overcome their fear of the exotic and commit some of their substantial profits to realising the great potential of the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>Cash is needed for more than actors, <Col N="2097" /> sets and straightforward filming.  Pre-production costs for a medium budget Irish film can be up to £100,000.  Given the advances made in establishing new sources of development finance and distribution and marketing initiatives, there is a case for the film board to operate solely as a development and production fund which promotes and generates employment within the film industry in Ireland.  With this in mind Irish projects should be looked on more favourably than co-productions that emphasise non-Irish talent.  Projects involving Irish scriptwriters, producers, directors, lighting-camera people, art directors, costume designers and editors should be strongly supported by the board.</P>
    <P>In relation to training and skills development, the film board should grant aid the production of short films, which provide invaluable hands on experience at all levels and should liaise with producers and the unions to establish a structured goal orientated trainee apprenticeship system on all film board funded projects.  Bureaucracy should be kept to a minimum and the film board's annual budget should be aimed at genuine production rather than administration or organisation.</P>
    <P>I referred to the values inherent in film making.  There is no film made that does not convey a message, no matter how banal.  While we have argued for a long time over money and the lack of available funds, as a result of the Minister's initiative we have to some degree moved forward from that argument.  We must find the will to develop the industry.  It should be aimed at supporting projects which have a cultural meaning and for which we can seek co-producers abroad.  We should seek to generate Irish projects and seek foreign co-producers as opposed to engaging in projects similar to those already being generated abroad in which we would become co-producers.</P>
    <P>No one will buy an Irish film simply because it is Irish.  It must have a value in itself and sell itself to audiences.  The <Col N="2098" /> stereotypical Irish film has sold in the past and will continue to sell for as long as ignorance about Ireland prevails.  The Irish image on the commercial screen is still conditioned by the propaganda of the late 19th century.  It could be changed by a clear-sighted policy towards making Irish films in Ireland.  The world finds it difficult to take us seriously and that is partly our fault.  To some extent we tend to play up to our stereotypical image.  In Ireland in the second part of the 19th century the patriotic melodrama was invented for the popular audience.  Those plays presented a mythical land of blarney and blather people by patriotic heroes of exclusively aristocratic descent, betrayed by villians and informers and mourned by impossibly innocent maidens.</P>
    <P>By adopting that type of approach we will not build an Irish film industry that will have any possibility of being a vibrant one, vibrant in terms of the numbers employed in the industry and the improvement of our self image as a result of the image we present, warts and all.  I am not talking about producing films which present Ireland or the Irish as pure as the driven snow, but an industry which presents us as we are.  We must decide to accept ourselves as serious drama producers in the real sense and to avoid endorsing the Irish stereotype in deference to what we are told the world wants.  It is not enough to want high quality films, because a great deal of high quality trash is produced.  We can see it every day on our television screens. There must also be high quality content. I am talking about content and not about presenting glowing pictures.  We need to be conscious of scriptwriters as they form the basis of a good, strong film industry.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the European market as an area on which we should concentrate.  The stereotypical Irish film will sell in the United States, although the success of &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; and other Irish films in America gives one hope that that image may be to some extent <Col N="2099" /> changing.  The possibility of building a strong industry purely on the American market is likely to fail.  If we aim to build our reputation on good quality films for the European market, the Americans will inevitably accept them, as they usually follow the example of the Europeans.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points in relation to GATT to which reference was made earlier.  One of the reasons the GATT negotiations have been held, particularly by the United States, is as a result of its film lobby, who claim that the European Union is unfairly subsidising its audio-visual industry.  The idea that US films are being undermined by European subsidies is simply laughable.  The US film industry is probably one of the most successful film industries in the world.  The American share of the European cinema market is now estimated at 75 per cent compared with 60 per cent eight years ago.  Last year US audio-visual exports to Europe were worth a staggering $3.7 billion whereas audio-visual exports from Europe to the United States were worth only $288 million.  It can be argued that, because efforts have been concentrated on artistic themes which do not have a mass audience appeal, European subsidies have probably facilitated inroads into Europe of American films for mass audiences.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there is a very strong case for mounting a challenge to America's divine right to make world-scale movies before that country gets a total monopoly simly by default.  The draft European Union White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment has specifically mentioned the audio-visual industry as a potential for huge growth.  It will take more than a few subsidies to develop a European film Industry capable of taking on the United States.  What is needed is a coherent strategy and a new approach to film finance. It is time to construct a second force in the film industry and, depending on the policies pursued, the willingness of investors <Col N="2100" /> and so on, Ireland could play a significant role in such a development.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Ardmore Studios. The Minister said he intends to set up a film school, and that is welcome. Ardmore Studios is a ready-made location for such a school.  I do not know whether the Minister has other ideas &mdash; I hope he does not &mdash; but Ardmore Studios is the only such film studio on this island which continues to operate as a studio.  It had a chequered history but it is still functioning and has a store of local expertise in the making of films. With its facilities it is an ideal location for a film school.</P>
    <P>Those are my ideas on this important area of Irish life.  It is not just an economic issue or an issue of jobs; it is very much an issue of culture, of how we see ourselves and present ourselves to the world, warts and all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation.  I warmly welcome the Bill in that it proposes to establish on a sound financial basis a film and audio-visual industry. The Minister has outlined the chequered history of the industry.  I recall, as I am sure does the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the close association our constituency has had with this industry.  I hope the film industry will be established on such a firm footing that it will not experience the difficulties experienced in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may recall the establishment of Ardmore Studios many years ago by his former colleague in the Labour Party, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Just in Keating.  I recall as a young TD attending the opening of that establishment about which there was much controversy.  Some of the people who attended the opening believed that the Minister should have established an indigenous Irish-speaking film industry while others believed he should attract big productions from abroad.  It was very difficult to get consensus on the matter and there was tension in that regard from <Col N="2101" /> the start.  I do not believe the Minister will be faced with these problems today because since that time we have gained great experience in marrying the two types of production, in producing highly successful indigenous films and also attracting big productions from abroad.</P>
    <P>Wicklow was the location for many very successful films, the earliest of which I can remember was &ldquo;The List of Adrian Messenger&rdquo; in which Frank Sinatra starred. Others included, &ldquo;Shake Hands With The Devil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zardos&rdquo;, John Boorman's film &mdash; Mr. Boorman still resides in the constituency &mdash;&ldquo;Purple Taxi&rdquo; starring Fred Astaire and &ldquo;The Blue Max&rdquo; starring George Peppard, during filming of which an unfortunate accident occurred over Wicklow Harbour.  All these films were made in and around County Wicklow.  The film industry brought considerable employment to County Wicklow and other areas.  With the decline in film production the county suffered a great loss.  Many films were staged in Ardmore Studios which was owned by several concerns in the past including MTM.  I hope the Minister will realise that there is a great amount of expertise in this area which could be used in the event of his proposals coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>The Irish film and audio-visual industry has received a great boost from the Minister's persistence in ensuring that it formed part of the Programme for Government. After his appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht he quickly set about establishing the industry and bringing his proposals to Government for acceptance.  The Minister has approached this matter from the best possible base, ensuring that the proper financial arrangements are in place so as to attract money not only locally but also from abroad.  If the proposals as outlined by the Minister come to fruition a great deal of foreign investment will be attracted to this country.  It is important that there be a very strong film board and <Col N="2102" /> the Minister has succeeded in attracting people with expertise to the board.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Irish film and audiovisual industry has been established with four main objectives, namely, the re-establishment of the film board; RTE to make a financial contribution to independent television production; tax concessions to be given to attract funding for the industry and the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  While these elements are important to the success of the industry, they have not met with universal approval from various quarters.  As regards financial contributions from RTE, there seems to be a lobby in RTE who believe that nobody except RTE should spend its money.  I would remind that lobby that RTE is financed by the taxpayer through the licence fee and advertising and it is not its money.  The Government runs the country and I hope it still runs RTE in terms of its finance. RTE is very fortunate to have these two strands of finance.  It obviously has a commitment to ensure that the film and audiovisual industries are assisted by what I would call this captive finance.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that, having demanded a second television channel, some RTE employees seem to be opposed to the setting up of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I listened to Gay Byrne on his morning radio programme and he does not seem to be in favour of an Irish language television station.  He even went so far as to conduct a telepoll in the expectation that there would be widespread opposition to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I think he was shocked to find that the general public is more in favour of an Irish language television station than he had thought.  I do not agree with telepolls, which are confined to people who have telephones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="2103" /> Such polls should never be regarded as giving a balanced view of any argument and I hope they will be discouraged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Their purpose is to make money for RTE or Telecom Éireann. They are outrageous and should be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interruption which I welcome and with which I agree. I am not in favour of banning these polls but their results should be discredited.  I think the radio programme which conducted this telepoll was surprised at the result.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an idea that the moneys to be provided by the Minister for the wider audiovisual industry will be set against the expenditure on Teilifís na Gaeilge.  There is a need for the Minister to explain to the public why we need an Irish language television station.  Those of us living on the east coast and who are interested in Irish have had to watch the Welsh television stations which transmit two programmes in the Welsh language. This must be of great benefit to young people in Wales who are not very conversant with the Welsh language.  An Irish language station would be of great benefit to those of us who have never had any great Irish language tradition in our areas and to students who have to sit examinations.  The Minister has to promote the need for an Irish language television station.  I hope he can persuade people that this station is not simply for people living in Gaeltacht areas but that it will be of benefit to everyone.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the committee to be set up under section 16 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.  The Minister set out the obstacles which remain in the way of full development of the film industry.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among these remaining obstacles I would cite the absence of a film commission to facilitate offshore and indigenous production companies by <Col N="2104" /> the semi-State sector; the need for new training strategies to ensure that the uptake of activity in the industry will be matched by the coming on stream of new skilled practitioners; the whole question of distribution of Irish films for Irish audiences, including metropolitan-regional imbalances; the promotion of Irish films abroad; and the question of the Irish language and film.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is necessary for a film commission or a committee to be established in conjunction with the board.  The Minister said the committee would comprise senior representatives of Radio Telefís Éireann &mdash; I should say that I am not totally against this organisation which has done a wonderful job but which sometimes seems to be totally independent of the rest of us &mdash; Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Comhairle Ealaíon, the Industrial Development Authority, FÁS, An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte.  I believe there is a place for local authority representation on that committee.  I know the extent to which local authorities have gone to promote the arts and our heritage. When the Minister visited my constituency he saw the work being done by the local authority in the area of the arts, for example, the renaissance gallery set up in the county council offices where young artists can display their sculptures and painting.  There are promotional activities in that gallery every week.  It has also set up a new heritage centre and developed on old jail which will be of great advantage in showing off the history of this part of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>It is also important that local authorities be represented on this committee for the very good reason that film makers will have to get the approval of local authorities to open or close roads or have areas made available for filming.  A person who wants to make a film in New York can simply walk into a separate department which issues licences and ask for a licence to film on a particular street. I think I have made the case for local <Col N="2105" /> authority representation on the committee.</P>
    <P>I wanted to contribute to the debate as I represent a constituency which has a long and honourable tradition in this industry.  I hope this point will not be forgotten if, as suggested by Deputy De Rossa, consideration is being given in the future to the setting up a film school. Indeed, Wicklow is ideally suited as a location for the headquarters of the board &mdash; it is close to Dublin and has some of the most attractive scenery in the country.  I wish the Minister well with the Bill, for which there is general welcome. I hope the Bill will be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess so that the work can proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible so that Deputy Ryan who, like me, has been waiting a long time, will have an opportunity to contribute.  We are all very grateful to the Minister for the detailed history he gave us of the Irish film industry and, in passing, a little history of his deeds as Minister with responsibility for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I am sure this history will be very useful to researchers in years to come.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will increase the limit of the amount which can be spent by the Irish Film Board from £4.1 million to £15 million.  As the Minister explained, this is enabling legislation. Therefore, there is no obligation on him to say how much more money will be available.  Arising out of this debate it will be generally perceived that the Irish Film Board will receive £15 million, thus leading to more kudos for the Minister. However, the Bill will do nothing of the sort.  I should like the Minister in his reply to say whether any extra money and, if so, how much, has been promised at this stage by the Minister for Finance for the board.  I should also like him to say if the projects run by the Irish Film Board receive any European funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> Let us not be petty about this.  I welcome the enabling legislation, it is quite a contrast to the action of the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 which effectively scrapped Bord Scannán na hÉireann. That was a disaster for the Irish film industry but the Minister did not refer to it in his speech.  He said that the Taoiseach announced the winding down of the board and its replacement by a tax based incentive for corporate investment in Irish film projects.  That is a very timid way of describing a disaster and what, in another mood, the Minister opposite me might have described as cultural vandalism. I am delighted with the Minister's action which will be belated compensation for the previous action.</P>
    <P>The last film board, on a very modest budget, between 1981 and 1987 was responsible for a dozen feature films, which is not remarkable until we consider that from the foundation of the State until 1981, as the Minister stated, only one major feature film was made, an amateur film of Tom Cooper's &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo; in 1936.  We do not want to disparage many of the films made here and I know the Minister appreciates their value. &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Blue Max&rdquo; and &ldquo;Excalibur&rdquo; were all made in Ireland, they had the effect of making audiences all over the world aware of Ireland and its attractions and continue to attract tourists.  On an Irish film the creative talents include writers, directors, cameramen, producers, art editors and art directors and this is what creates an understanding of Ireland and its culture.</P>
    <P>During the period when it was in operation, Bord Scannán na hÉireann did a very good job, its first production was &ldquo;Angel&rdquo;, a Neil Jordan film.  For a modest investment of £100,000 &mdash; the remainder of the money, £500,000 was put up by Channel 4 &mdash; we produced a vehicle for the talent of Neil Jordan, a Sligo man incidentally.  Would his Oscar-winning talent have flourished worldwide if that investment had not been made?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> Due tribute must be paid to Bord Scannán na hÉireann as it operated in the previous period and the Minister should always realise that the key aspect of this industry is the seed money.  Without that investment screenplays cannot be written, budgets cannot be prepared and packages cannot be put together.  Of course, development finance is also the most speculative of all finance.  People will invest in films but not in the pre-filming work.  This is the key area and we must always ensure it is the one on which the new Irish Film Board concentrates.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who never lacked courage, say that the expectations of the previous film board were unrealistic.  Of course, it was ambitious, it tried to break new frontiers and push out the parameters a little but it should not be criticised for that.  On a very modest expenditure, on which the Minister is now claiming he received a 10 per cent income as far as I understand, the board carried out tremendous work.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid a great tribute to the new chairperson of the film board, Ms Lelia Doolan, a person with whom I worked and for whom I have the greatest admiration.  She is an extremely dedicated person who will make a success of that position but I would also like to pay a tribute to Muiris Mac Conghail, the chairman of Bord Scannán na hÉireann, who carried out the work I outlined and who deserves great credit.</P>
    <P>Development loans, modest as they are, must be repaid on the first day of shooting.  What if the film, as very often happens, never gets to the shooting stage?  That does not mean all the preliminary development work should not have been done or that it was not a wise invesment which should have been pursued. I would like the Minister to outline what will happen in that situation.</P>
    <P>Will production loans be given on merit as determined by the film board taking the various risks into account or <Col N="2108" /> on collateral?  What happens if a return cannot be made?</P>
    <P>I see the Minister is providing for a production collection agency.  I am aware of the present intricate system but the establishment of a production collection agency, which is really a debt collection agency, is going a little overboard.  As far as the films are concerned, we do not want a sheriff in the industry, only the sheriff who appears in the films.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is replacing the British system with an Irish system.  If the Deputy reads the script he will see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks ominous but I am happy to accept the Minister's reassurance in that regard.  I would be surprised if he took that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the script.  The Deputy need not rely on my assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard much in recent days about the dominance of the US in the audio-visual area and indeed Deputy De Rossa referred to this.  Will the Minister elaborate the effect this might have on the measures he is taking in this Bill?  I am glad that in regard to Teilifís na Gaeilge he will be commissioning approximately two thirds of its requirements to the independent production agencies in Dublin and the rest of the country, as well as in the Gaeltacht area, where I hope many of them will be based.  I believe that will have a very beneficial effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Kavanagh earlier, the Minister should examine the situation where Radio Telefís Éireann and, indeed, the newspapers, run competitions, without alerting the public, for &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; or some other major area in which they have an interest with the main objective of raising money for themselves and for Telecom Éireann.  They should be obliged to divulge the amount of money they make <Col N="2109" /> out of these activities on the backs of innocent punters.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish the Minister well, I believe the film industry is an extremely resilient one although it has faced an enormous number of setbacks.  The people involved are dedicated and enthusiastic and are often foolishly more interested in the end product than in the lifestyle it can offer.  I know the Minister and Ms Lelia Doolan will seek to preside over the development of a distinct Irish film industry that reflects Irish culture and our way of life.  We have unique qualities of storytelling and writing that will enable us to have that and I sincerely hope this is not yet another false take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on his various initiatives in regard to developing the audo-visual industry.  I also congratulate the Taoiseach on setting up a working party to report back on how to develop that industry, many of the initiatives the Minister has taken come from that report.</P>
      <P>All the major proposals contained in that report have been tackled.  For example, the provisions of section 35 of the Finance Act, 1989, have been improved significantly and are functioning well.  RTE's recent appointment of Clare Duignan as commissioning editor for independent programming has been widely welcomed.  Continued commitment to international initiatives &mdash; such as those of the Council of Europe, Eurimages, Co-production Fund, the EC's media programme &mdash; are all very welcome, as is the intention to improve our international commitments through co-operation by way of co-production treaties with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's main achievement has been the reinstatement of the Irish Film Board.  I should like to welcome the appointment of Lelia Doolan as its chairperson, a very imaginative appointment. I have no doubt but that she will do an excellent job in the coming years.  Within <Col N="2110" /> a very short period the board has been established and is actively supporting the development of projects and the making of films.  One film &mdash; Joe Comerford's &ldquo;High Boot Benny&rdquo;&mdash; has been released with the board's participation being acknowledged in the credits.  Hopefully, many others are either in production or on the way.</P>
    <P>The Minister consulted the industry widely regarding changes in the 1980 Act. However, there are two elements of that Act which have not been changed and which I consider warrant some comment. First, section 8 gives the board specific responsibility in the matter of training.  A committee of State agencies, who might have a useful role to play in respect of film and television, has recently been established on the Minister's initiative which includes FÁS among its members. That committee may play a useful role in initiating essential research into the training requirements of the film industry but the Irish Film Board does not have the necessary resources to tackle the problem of fundamental training.  The Minister is aware of this and, hopefully, will take some action in that regard because such training within the film industry is vital and has been neglected over the years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of that Act refers to a National Film Archive.  It should be pointed out that 23 April 1996 will be the centenary of the arrival of cinema in Ireland.  The Minister and the Government should have put in place all the necessary infrastructure for the film industry and film culture by that date.  A key element of this is the preservation of our film heritage in an appropriate institution.  Ireland's history as an independent country is recorded on film but, as a society, we have treated this heritage extraordinarily badly.  As a former member of the Irish Film Institute I know the extraordinary amount of film that exists.  Unfortunately, much of it is not in Ireland.  Full credit must be given to the Irish Film Institute for retrieving so much film from abroad, much of which is of great interest and should be preserved. However, a great deal of film has been <Col N="2111" /> lost irretrievably.  Since the enactment of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, the Irish Film Institute, of which I was a member, established such an archive in a new Irish Film Centre located in Temple Bar which is considerably underfunded.  As the Irish Film Board has statutory responsibility in this area the requisite funds for this archive are vital to the preservation of and accessibility to Ireland's audiovisual heritage.  The Irish Film Institute has run many exhibitions of old Irish films in the new Irish Film Centre, much of enormous interest.  They were well attended by schoolchildren and students generally. This archive could be developed to a much greater extent if the Irish Film Centre were allocated more funds.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Irish Film Institute and the Irish Film Centre on the establishment of this centre which is a very fine venue having been beautifully restored. Indeed it is probably the first really good building to be refurbished in the Temple Bar area.  I have no doubt but that it will go from strength to strength even though such places always suffer from a lack of funding.</P>
    <P>Our film industry could be one of the most exciting growth sectors here but, if we are to produce more Jim Sheridans and Brenda Frickers we need to protect our film industry from ruthless and unfair competition.  We should be clear about one thing, the United States dominates the film and television industries of the world.  The American audio-visual sector has become the second largest export earner of United States' industry. Indeed, the United States has now set its sights on a full scale assault on European markets in which it has already made huge inroads.  Television programmes from the United States or Japan are flooding the European market broadcast from regulation-free &ldquo;shelters&rdquo;, carried by digital technology, picked up by satellite dishes.</P>
    <P>The ardour with which the European Commission will defend the interests of the European audio-visual sector must match the Americans' relentless pressure <Col N="2112" /> to prevent a European cultural derogation from the GATT agreement.  The following figures prove that, for Europe, the stake is economic and commercial. Since the audio-visual programme is not a product like others it is important that the European Union bear in mind one of the objectives of the founding fathers of Europe, that being a European cultural identity.</P>
    <P>For example, in the United Kingdom, the balance of trade in programmes has deteriorated from a £25 million surplus in 1985 to a £100 million deficit in 1991. Indeed some people expect that the deficit there by the turn of the century will be of the order of £600 million.  In France, practically one out of every two hours of drama &mdash; that is, serials, TV films, series and cartoons &mdash; is imported from America, which proportion increased between 1989 and 1992 from 43 per cent to 45 per cent of programmes broadcast by their national channels, that in a country which fought relentlessly to maintain its own independent film industry. Deputy De Rossa gave a wider view of the amount of film being imported into Europe from America.  The figures are staggering.</P>
    <P>The American audio-visual programme industry has become the second export earner of United States' industry and a source of massive profits.  Furthermore, it faces good prospects in Europe.  Why is this American determination to export without barriers not taken as evidence of the strategic importance of our sector by the negotiators in Brussels?</P>
    <P>Let us examine the relevant facts.  Over the next five years most economists forecast a decline in industrial output in the main sectors in France.  There is a consensus that the sectors that will best cope will be computer services, semi-conductors, telecommunications services, telecommunications hardware and audio-visual services, in other words, all the elements of the image chain &mdash; television sets, cable, satellite, programmes <Col N="2113" /> involving audio-visual and computing interaction &mdash; are tipped to grow at between 5 to 10 per cent over the next five years.  I heard the Minister speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and the figure he mentioned was that 940,000 jobs would be created in this sector, some of which will be in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we on this side of the Atlantic remain in doubt about the strategic nature of these activities the Americans stopped wondering long ago and are willing to take advantage of this European growth potential since there is sharp competition on their own saturated market between themselves and Japan.  Audio-visual versus sea transport is the bartering deal the Commission is tempted to strike.  We had better have a more dynamic view of our markets in order to encourage future industrial expansion at home.  The requirements of the European audio-visual sector are based on the concept of a level playing field in trade and the following principles: the European audio-visual sector must obtain unequivocable access to the American market; the American market is at present completely locked to EC product and on the programme level, no United States broadcaster is prepared to broadcast a dubbed European programme since the Americans are the only people worldwide who reject such programmes.  In broadcasting no American broadcaster is controlled by a European broadcaster; indeed such would not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Before the American market becomes genuinely open for business we must protect our audio-visual sector by obtaining acknowledgement of the cultural derogation for Europe.  Let us be clear about the notion of cultural exemption.  It is not a matter of incorporating a vague notion in the GATT agreement stipulating that audio-visual programmes should not be treated like any other goods or commodities but rather to negotiate exemption from the most favoured nation principle.  If audio-visual services cannot be excluded from the GATT agreement <Col N="2114" /> then the Television Without Frontier Directive must be maintained along the lines of the network of financial mechanisms created for the support of a European cultural industry.</P>
    <P>The United States must be made to agree to the same type of cultural specificity agreed in bilateral treaties which they have negotiated with Australia and Canada.  The Canadians and Australians demanded, and won, the right to control the level of support for and protection of their national film and broadcasting sectors.  We must demand no less.  The Government, in particular the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, must do their utmost to protect our film industry since it has too much to offer this nation to allow it be smothered by the one-sided interests of the United States.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well aware of these problems.  I listened to him with interest on the radio this morning.  He is doing great work and sees the huge opportunities from our film industry.  The potential for development is enormous. The world is our oyster in this regard.  As an English speaking country we could build up a huge base for film making and a core of film workers who would attract more and more filming in the future.  Our location is ideal.  We should be going out seeking not only small films, as some people have said, but also the major films.  I have spoken to a number of people, some of whom are not Irish, who have said that one of our problems in this area is that our costs are too high.  The Minister should examine this area because the making of sets is very expensive here in comparison with other countries. In major films the making of sets is a huge part of the cost.</P>
    <P>Many people have commented on the interest shown by the general public when a film is being made.  For example, when a film was being made in Cork during the year there was enormous interest by the local people, many of whom were employed on it for a time.</P>
    <P>As a former member of the IFI, I can <Col N="2115" /> say that the mood then in the film industry was not good, but now the mood is extremely buoyant and positive.  People feel there is a future for the film industry. Only last week I attended a media desk breakfast in Bewleys where people in the industry gathered.  I had not been with members of the IFI for a long time and I have to say the atmosphere was completely different.  They were all gungho and out to do business.  I believe we will see a number of films both large and small in Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister on his initiative regarding Teilifís na Gaeilge.  In this day and age we must protect our culture and our language. Things are changing so fast that we could be smothered culturally if we are not careful.  The Government and the people must provide Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Nobody else will do it for us.</P>

      <P>I want to say how grateful I am to Deputies for the attitude and the spirit of their contributions this evening.  It is very interesting for us to be able to say that across all parties and those who spoke this evening there is general recognition of the importance of the film initiatives being taken.  There is also a great anxiety that everything should be done to ensure the industry is put on a firm footing. There is a general recognition of the commitment of the film industry, who have given a testament to their commitment by coming through the lean times when assistance may not have been available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with a number of issues, but first I would like to deal with one which was touched on by a number of Deputies.  That is the environment in which we find ourselves as people who <Col N="2116" /> are interested in film.  Reference has been made to the GATT negotiations.  I spoke about this, as many Members have said, earlier this morning on a programme.  I have held those views for some time and they have not changed during the day.  I should like to put it very simply.  Speaking in Gdánsk on Tuesday, 21 September, when receiving an honorary doctorate, the President of France, Francois Mitterrand, said what was behind the French position:</P>
    <P>Is it protectionist when two-thirds of its cinema box office receipts comes from American films?  And what about collusion between distributors who occupy dominant positions in defiance of their own rules and ours?  What about the refusal to dub European films in American whereas the American film industry earns its revenues in Europe from dubbed films?</P>
    <P>President Mitterrand quoted as only he could a Frenchman, Jean-Claude Carríere, when he wrote:</P>
    <P>Imagine if the Germans were to say to the Irish: you listen to Bach and Beethoven far more often than your own composers.  So, it's quite simple, just stop making music.  And if the French said to the Portuguese: you read Balzac and Proust more than your own authors, so you should stop writing.</P>
    <P>President Mitterrand put it well when he said the issue is whether the making of images will come from a single source in the world.  He was calling attention to the fact that what we were looking at was a crisis as between the integrity of cultural diversity and culture domination by regarding audio-visual products as simply commodities.</P>
    <P>I want to assure all Deputies who contributed that right from the Danish Presidency these issues were raised by me with my colleagues on the Council of Ministers in Europe, but it was during the Belgium Presidency at a seminar in Mons that we <Col N="2117" /> were able to focus exactly on what was important.  On that occasion we were able to brief Commissioner Pinheiro very thoroughly on what was available to us between the three stratgies in the GATT negotiations: exclusion, exemption and specificity &mdash; the latter would seek to preserve what was already in place.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the committee in Geneva and have advised a very strong position on exemption while seeking to strengthen and develop an even stronger position between exemption and specificity.  I am satisfied that every issue raised this evening is represented in the Commission offer.  It has done so with the intention of not merely protecting what we have but also protecting the space of the future.</P>
    <P>I speak very explicitly about future co-production and other arrangements in relation to broadcasting.  I am grateful to Deputies for drawing attention to this important dimension.  It is important too that I temper this, and many will say it is unusual coming from me.  There is nothing anti American in all this. Frankly, some of the finest films we have seen have been made in the United States.  In a curious way the benefits of cultural diversity, which we seek to protect will fall to the United States in the future where some of the finest films are made by young black film producers, film writers in New York and the Hispanic community, which has yet to flower in terms of its contribution to the American cinema.</P>
    <P>The interests and concerns of Deputies have been well represented.  The film industry is a matter of concern and I dwell on it only because we cannot realise how significant it is.  What kind of a relationship is there between the images, ourselves and our world if over 90 per cent of the images we look at in films come from a single source?  Those who may not have been enthusiastic in the past about those values which I have sought to defend in public service broadcasting, those who wanted deregulation and the <Col N="2118" /> laws of the marketplace in cultural products produced isolated, alienated, fragmented bits and pieces of market sectors instead of culturally active interactive citizens and so forth.  As they now in their isolated and alienated position rent videos, we face the prospect of turning the citizens of Europe into mindless consumers of audio-visual products like those in a shop rather than citizens in a culture.  If that happens we will simply also give away all the jobs of that sector in Europe to the places that are producing something over which we have no control. That is the terrible vista which is opened up by those who had low standards in relation to the application of competitive criteria in the cultural area.</P>
    <P>A number of specific points have been raised and I will answer as many as possible. There are hopeful things to look forward to, for example, in 1996 a major exhibition <i>L'Imaginaire Irlandais</i> will be organised in Paris around St. Patrick's Day and will run for three months.  This will be a wonderful opportunity for the film industry and the film community to exhibit its renaissance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital funding for Teilifís na Gaeilge will come from the accumulated moneys under the &ldquo;cap&rdquo;, as indicated in the Government programme.  There will be sufficient capital moneys for the coming year and it is my hope that this important broadcasting initiative, which sadly did not recommend itself to that group of people known as young Fine Gael, whoever they may be, will have money to commission from January next. Let me respond in the same spirit as the contributions this evening because every Member who contributed this evening spoke in favour of Teilifís na Gaeilge&mdash;<Col N="2120" /> tá mé thar a bheith buíoch díobh as sin. I think that is a very reasonable response by the Legislature and I am very grateful to Members on all sides who welcomed this initiative.  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald asked about the publication of the report and in principle I have no difficulty with publishing those reports, the report of the founding committee and the Coiste Teicniúil, but as a courtesy, I have to consult with those who served and discuss the matter with them but I have no problem about that.  I have noted the points made about the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke about media studies and film culture.  I am very interested in that and I have had meetings with the Minister for Education. Members are right in noting my dissatisfaction with the Green Paper on Education but I believe I have made progress in relation to this which will be reflected in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There were many references to film archives and their future development. Section 4 outlines the functions of the board and states that it may engage in the establishment of a film archive and with the demise of the board, as it were, when it ceased to be funded in 1987, a national film archive was accommodated in a new Irish Film Centre so the film board role has effectively been overtaken by events.  In recent weeks, however, the Film Institute of Ireland has submitted proposals to me in relation to archives for separate legislation for a national film archive.  I have a totally open mind on this and I see the value of a film archive and I need to consider, not the principle of the suggestion, but the best way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I have answered a number of the points raised by Deputy Quill and I have noted the points she made in relation to the question of the value of film made locally. She mentioned the &ldquo;War of the Buttons&rdquo; and its significance.  She also made a number of points in relation to marketing. I fully share the Deputy's views on the need for a strong marketing role <Col N="2121" /> and An Bord Tráchtála is already assisting in this by hosting Ireland on screen presentations at major European festivals, such as that at Cannes.  An Bord Tráchtála also participates fully in the marketing arm of the European Union media programme and the new State committee, which includes An Bord Tráchtála, and the committee will consider as a priority how the marketing function can be strengthened.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will be pleased to learn that the Estimates submitted to me for 1994 by the Irish Film Board, Board Scannán na hÉireann, has targeted the need for a special cinemas in the region initiative next year and what will be involved is the provision of finance for prints and advertising in addition to production finance.  Let me tell Deputy Quill that I welcome this focus by the board so early in its lifetime and I hope to be able to accommodate it with some funding next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned the Euro Media Guarantee under the EU media programme and I take his point about the nervous banking sector that needs assurances beyond assurances.  He will be glad to hear of the Euro Media Guarantee &mdash; EMG &mdash; and he will be able to reassure the banks as well that EMG was granted to a new Irish film &ldquo;Words Upon the Window Pane&rdquo;.  It has been successful already and finished shooting on location in Dublin four weeks ago, it has now moved to a studio in Luxembourg.  The significance of Euro Media Guarantee is that it is one of 19 projects under the European Union media programme and some £1.8 million came to Irish producers under this programme in 1991-92, before I made any changes.  Members can also see the significance I attach to media in general and it is something from which we will benefit.  Its activities must be protected in whatever arrangements come from the meeting in Geneva.</P>
    <P>On future occasions I will dwell in more detail on the points made by Members.  Ireland is a member of Euro <Col N="2122" /> Images since September 1992 and this demonstrates our European credentials. Deputy Kavanagh spoke about the advantages of the studio in Ardmore as indeed did Deputy De Rossa.  I am well aware of the advantages of Ardmore.  I visited them recently and I could feel all these ghosts speak to me, but much more importantly many of the people were very glad that there was a new atmosphere in the film industry and that there were jobs at home.  There will be a future for Ardmore and certainly I will bear its resources in mind.  I am trying to create an atmosphere in which things can happen.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction between the State committee and the commission.  The commission is certainly a body upon which local authorities, as was suggested, should be represented.  I have noted Deputy Ryan's point which largely concentrated &mdash; and he was correct to do this &mdash; on the GATT.  Deputy Nealon asked if the money for the film board will attract European money.  The reply to that is simply that I have succeeded in securing a focused level of funding under the industrial operational programme for the period 1994-99 and the amount involved is £13 million towards the capital expenditure of the film board.  There will be money and the film board will be funded. I was asked also about training&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

In relation to the training fund the Irish Film Board should run dedicated courses and that is their role.  I will make sure that provision is made by my colleagues and others in relation to the general provision of a training infrastructure but I will address this matter in some detail when I carry out the two-year review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank all Deputies both for <Col N="2123" /> the positive spirit they have brought to the debate and for the welcome they have given to the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>A community that has stayed with the commitment to something which is the essence of the Irish personality has contributed to an excitement that is there now and will give a great yield in the future.  That has obviously affected Deputies on all sides and I welcome it. In welcoming the different initiatives I have taken Deputies remarked that I said that the fourth leg of this was Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I emphasise that nothing could be further from the truth than the depiction in a cartoon in a paper recently of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a carrier of every old piece of baggage coming from the past.</P>

      <P>This case refers to an application for deserted wife's allowance in 1988 by a constituent.  The woman <Col N="2124" /> applied in the usual way, was refused and appealed against the decision.  The oral hearing was attended by the applicant and her husband.  In the final analysis the deciding officer decided against her on the basis that she had contributed to her own misfortune.  If she had contributed to her own misfortune it would have resulted in her being barred from the house or being asked to leave in the ordinary way.  If that had been legally done I would not have a case to make tonight, but that is not what happened.</P>
      <P>The woman was seriously assaulted, severely beaten by her husband.  The deciding officer took that into account but decided that she was still a contributor to her own misfortune.  The fact that a severe assault occurred seriously brings into question the decision of the deciding officer because the woman was forced to leave the family home.  A Garda report on file will verify that.  The Garda report was brought to the attention of the deciding officer at the time but he decided against her.  From what legal advice I have been able to get it is clear that if she took her case to court she would win.</P>
      <P>The Minister should concentrate on the fact that the woman had to leave the house because she was beaten, and that a child's welfare is also involved.  The woman was not a contributor to her own misfortune as she was forced to leave the house.  She was destitute and penniless as she is to this day.  It is crucial that the Minister set aside the decision of that deciding officer on the basis that he should have taken into account that she had no option but to leave the family home.  The Minister has that discretion which I ask him to use.  This is not a major case which will set a precedent.</P>
      <P>Once there was coercion and there was a Garda report the woman had a good case.  She still has a good case although she has been deprived of her deserted wife's allowance because of the deciding officer's decision that she had contributed to her own misfortune.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): To qualify for deserted wife's benefit, a claimant must satisfy a number of conditions.  It is a condition of the scheme that the claimant's husband must have left her voluntarily or that she had to leave him.  The person concerned married in August 1985 and separated from her husband shortly after the marriage. She later returned to her husband but left him in June 1986 and has not lived with him since.  A claim for deserted wife's benefit was made in 1985.  This claim was disallowed on the grounds the husband did not of his own volition leave her.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is familiar with the details in this case.  The Minister assures him again that all the relevant facts were taken into account by the Department of Social Welfare.  It would not be appropriate to discuss this couple's business in this House.  In reaching this conclusion the Minister was strongly influenced by the fact that there are also the interests of a child to be protected.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed the deciding officer's decision.  Following an oral hearing of the appeal on 12 September 1988, the independent appeals officer ruled that she did not qualify for a deserted wife's benefit because she was not a deserted wife within the meaning of section 195 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, in that her husband did not leave her of his own volition.  For constructive desertion to be proved, it has to be established that the wife was forced to leave the family home.</P>
      <P>Having considered all the facts the appeals officer was not satisfied that this was a case of desertion within the terms of the legislation.  The appeals officer's ruling is final and conclusive except in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case of marriage break-up, a lone parent's allowance is available where a person has an income need.  The lone parent's allowance legislation does not require that desertion be proved, simply that separation has occurred.  The <Col N="2126" /> person concerned has in fact applied for a lone parent's allowance but has not supplied full information in relation to all her means.  As soon as she supplies the information sought, and I strongly encourage her to do so to enable the Department to help her, her lone parent's allowance claim will be processed and finalised by the Department without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will have good news in response to my query in relation to a South African driving licence and reciprocal arrangements here.  On 30 November last I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment asking him to indicate the reason a South African driving licence is not accepted here in view of the fact that strict written and practical driving tests are required in South Africa where they speak the same language as us and drive on the same side of the road. Only that week the Minister issued an order on exchange arrangements for foreign driving licences in relation to Australia, Austria, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of driving licence exchange under the terms of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989, we recognised those states, Up to then only EC member states and Japan were recognised for the purposes of driving licence exchanges.  The effect of the Minister's order allowed holders of licences in those states exchange their licences for equivalent Irish licences without having to sit a driving test here. Reciprocally, holders of Irish licences could exchange them for local licences. Will the Minister extend to South Africa the arrangement for exchanging foreign driving licences?  In reply to the parliamentary question to which I referred the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South African driving licences do <Col N="2127" /> not distinguish between drivers who have passed driving tests in vehicles with automatic transmission and drivers who qualified in vehicles with manual transmission.  Since the EC Directive on driving licences requires that drivers who pass tests in vehicles with automatic transmission should only be given licences limited to that category of vehicle, it would not be appropriate to give recognition to South African licences for exchange purposes.</P>
    <P>The gentleman in respect of whom I am raising this question represents seven or eight others in Wexford.  When I gave him a copy of the Minister's reply to my parliamentary question he went to the trouble of getting documentary proof from the South African traffic authorities which I have with me.  I have photocopies of several South African licences from which it is clear that limitation G on a South African driving licence is for automatic transmission only.  In other words, if people in South Africa do their test in an automatic car the limitation G is put on their licence.  Limitation A indicates that there are no limitations to the type of vehicle that can be driven by people holding such licences and that the test was done in a manual vehicle.  If that was the Minister's only difficulty in refusing my previous request, will he re-examine the South African regulations and indicate his reason for refusing to recognise South African driving licences here?  The copies of the driving licences I have illustrate that when a test is done in an automatic vehicle a limitation is put on the driving licence restricting driving to automatic vehicles only.  Given the reason for the Minister's refusal and my information which appears to contradict the information from the Department of the Environment, can I assume the matter will be reviewed and that all bona fide South African licences will be recognised here and exchanged without the holders having to resit their test?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would first like to thank Deputy Doyle for raising the question of the recognition of South African driving licences for exchange purposes in this country and for giving me an opportunity to clarify why South African licences are not recognised.  I would also like to outline the criteria used in this country for determining whether to recognise other countries for driving licence exchange purposes and to justify and explain the non-recognition of South African licences here.</P>
      <P>As a member of the European Union, Ireland is party to an arrangement whereby a driving licence issued in any one member state is recognised for exchange purposes in all the other member states.  This mutual exchange arrangement has been enhanced by the adoption, in 1980, of a First EC Directive on driver licensing, the main objectives of which were to provide closer harmonisation of driving test standards among all of the member states, to arrange for a situation where the vehicle category arrangements for driver licensing purposes were fairly uniform among the member states, and to introduce a standard format of driving licence throughout the Union.  In effect, the purpose of the First Directive was to provide for a scenario whereby the arrangements in relation to obtaining driving licences in all the member states would be uniform. All member states now have fairly similar driving test standards and driver licensing arrangements.  A Second EC Directive on driver licensing was adopted by the member states in 1991, which they are required to implement by 1996.  This Second EC Directive provides for even more detailed harmonisation of the driver testing and driver licensing arrangements already provided for in the First EC Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Directives provide for member states recognising and exchanging driving licences issued by third countries i.e. non-European Union states, though each member state has discretion in this <Col N="2129" /> regard.  When considering the question of recognising a third country for licence exchange purposes, the driver testing system operated in that country is examined to see if a reasonable standard is applied and, if not, we do not offer recognition. Other factors to be taken into account in this regard are reciprocity and whether the country in question differentiates between automatic and manual transmission in its driver testing and licensing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter some detailed consideration and research, the only non-European Union countries which have so far been declared as recognised states for licence exchange purposes in Ireland are as follows: Japan, Australia, Austria, Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  Indeed, the latter seven were only so declared last month.  Each of these countries has satisfied the criteria necessary for being declared as recognised states for driving licence exchange purposes in this country.</P>
    <P>The main problem with South Africa, and indeed a number of other countries also, is that unrestricted licences are granted to persons who pass tests in vehicles with automatic transmission.  In effect, as stated in a written reply to Deputy Doyle on this issue last week, South African driving licences do not distinguish between drivers who have passed tests in vehicles with automatic transmission and drivers who qualified in vehicles with manual transmission.  In other words, a person who passes a test in a vehicle with automatic transmission in South Africa will automatically pick up entitlement to drive vehicles with manual transmission even though that person will not have undergone a test in a vehicle with manual transmission.</P>

      <P>That is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne (Wexford)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely accepted that there is a distinct difference between driving vehicles with manual and automatic transmission and the vast <Col N="2130" /> majority of the developed countries provide for this distinction in their driver testing and licensing arrangements. Indeed, it can be strongly argued that there are possible serious road safety implications in not making this distinction. Furthermore, the First EC Directive on driver licensing which is currently being implemented here, specifically requires that drivers who pass tests in vehicles with automatic transmission should only be given licences limited to that category of vehicle.  The Second Directive, which as already stated is required to be implemented by the member states by 1996, reaffirms this provision.</P>
      <P>It should also be mentioned in this connection that the United Kingdom, which would be regarded as having fairly close links with South Africa, does not recognise South African driving licences for exchange purposes.</P>
      <P>I trust the foregoing clarifies the logic behind the non-recognition of South African driving licences in this country for exchange purposes.  However, if the Deputy supplies me with the documentation she has with her, I will ask Mr. Farrelly in the Department of the Environment to see if we can facilitate her request.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am not expecting the Minister to wave a magic wand and suddenly announce that extra funding is available for Cork County Council at this stage.  Nevertheless, I hope he will give Deputy Mulvihill and me a sympathetic hearing and inform the Minister for the Environment that Cork County Council <Col N="2131" /> is endeavouring to deal with this problem in a reasonable manner.</P>
      <P>Following three meetings and debate, discussion and analysis at Cork County Council level, the councillors took what was for them an unprecedented decision to reject the annual council estimate, a clear signal that local authority financing is a shambles.  Each year as local authorities throughout the country struggled through their estimates debate, sought extra Government funding and brought their council to the brink of dissolution, Cork County Council without fuss or favour, accepted the recommendation of council management and the Department. The fact that the majority of Cork county councillors, including members of the Labour Party who support the partnership Government, said this must stop should be a clear signal to the Minister, Deputy Smith, that Cork County Council has been pushed over the edge by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Everybody in Cork County Council accepts the need for local government reform and to review the financing of local government.  As a first step in the right direction and to bring this difficult problem to a successful conclusion, the Minister should meet councillors representative of the county and council management and tease out a formula which will address the crisis.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State to accede to the request of the chairman of Cork County Council for an extension of time and to consider meeting an all-party deputation from the council to discuss the matter and find a solution to this serious problem.  As I said, this is the first time that Cork County Council has rejected an estimate.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time that the manager has introduced an estimate.  I commend him for his efforts given that this problem has been threatening for a number of years.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to meet a deputation from the council as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Bradford and his colleague for raising the matter and affording me, in the Minister's absence, an opportunity to respond on this matter.  Naturally the Minister would be concerned at the failure of Cork County Council or any local authority to adopt its estimate of expenses and strike a rate for 1994. Where a local authority fails to adopt an estimate, the ultimate sanction provided by law would involve the removal of the councillors from office and their replacement by a commissioner who would discharge the functions of the elected councillors.  The Minister would very much regret having to resort to action of this kind and being forced to remove from office public representatives elected by the people of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's over-riding concern, as Minister, must be the provision and maintenance of essential local authority services for the people of County Cork and the protection of related employment. It is imperative, therefore, that this statutory estimates process, which underpins the provision of these services, is satisfactorily completed.  This is one of the fundamental responsibilities of local authority elected members but if they refuse or fail to discharge the responsibility <Col N="2133" /> it then becomes the Minister's duty to make other arrangements in the interests of the whole community.</P>
    <P>My Department received a letter yesterday from the Cork county manager, Mr. Noel Dillon, reporting the refusal of the council to fulfil its statutory duty to adopt an estimate and determine a rate for 1994.  The manager's letter also conveys a request by the chairman of the council for an extension of time to allow the council to reconsider its decision.  The position now is that the Department has today written to the county manager requesting a full report on all the circumstances leading up to the refusal by the council to adopt an estimate and strike a rate.  It is necessary to get the full facts of what exactly happened right from the start of the statutory estimates meeting on 16 November right through the adjourned meetings on 29 November and 6 December.  When the report from the manager is received, the Minister will consider all aspects of the situation and he will then make his final decision.</P>
    <P>I will convey the Deputies request for a meeting with the Minister and ask him to communicate with them as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for allowing me to raise this important matter tonight.  Without any disrespect to the Minister of State sitting opposite, I believe we have created a precedent in that four matters have been selected to be raised on the Adjournment with the Ministers for Social Welfare, Health and the Environment and no member of the Cabinet has felt it necessary to come into the House to reply.  On the three occasions that he has replied, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, indicated that he would convey messages to the appropriate Minister.  The Government has shown scant regard for the Adjournment debate.  When one considers that it has a large majority the Cabinet is being <Col N="2134" /> disrespectful.  Given the hour of the night and the fact that Members regard it as a privilege when the Ceann Comhairle selects them to raise a matter of importance some committee of the House should consider the matter.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am seriously concerned about a report which appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 5 December on a study that is at present being carried out which shows that over 50 children have serious limb abnormalities, mostly arm defects and missing hands.  These children were born in the east and south, in counties Wicklow, Kildare and Cork during a five year period in the 1980s. This means, in effect, that they are in clusters which gives rise to concern.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health should investigate these claims.  It appears from the statistics that more children with limb defects are born in the east and the south than in any other part of Europe.  It appears also that none of the children identified comes from a family with a history of limb defects.  The parents are extremely worried and they believe it would not be as difficult in the future to come to terms with this problem if a link or common cause could be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to speculate on the reasons for these abnormalities; I am not an expert in the field and I am not going to pretend that I am but the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment should, if necessary, undertake a study in the form of an investigation to find out more about this problem as it is important to allay the fears of the community given that people were alarmed by the newspaper report. The question must be posed as to whether there is a link between the location and the number of abnormalities in that area. The Department of Health and the Government would go a long way towards allaying the fears of parents by instituting an investigation.  The least the parents and families can expect is an explanation which can only be given following <Col N="2135" /> a ministerial inquiry which may shed some light on the problem.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising the issue.  I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health who is out of the country on Government business and the junior Minister, Deputy O'Dea, who is ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the media reports referred to by the Deputy but my Department is not aware of a formal study as suggested, or of reports from the health boards concerned of a higher than average incidence of limb defects.  Statements regarding this matter have been attributed in the press to a retired paediatrician. My Department has been in contact with the paediatrician referred to <Col N="2136" /> and has been informed that no such report has been prepared or is in the course of preparation.  However, I would be concerned with any reports indicating a significant statistical variation in the number of babies born with limb deformities. Because of this I am asking the health boards concerned to investigate the statements further and report to me as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Asia-Pacific region is experiencing phenomenal growth rates at present.  The Chinese economy grew by 12.8 per cent in 1992.  The countries of South-East Asia are recording an average annual growth rate of around 7 per cent. While many of these countries are becoming major exporters of merchandise goods, their rate of growth and economic development make them significant importers of internationally traded services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Irish exporters were showing an increasing interest in these markets I asked An Bord Tráchtála to review its representation in the region.  As a result of the review ABT is increasing its presence in the Chinese market and it will <Col N="1937" /> shortly open a new office in Malaysia.  At present ABT has offices in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and is represented by trade consultants in a number of other countries.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I led a number of trade missions to the region already this year.  In April I led an aviation sector trade mission to China and Hong Kong.  In May I accompanied the Taoiseach on a trade mission to Malaysia and in November I led a trade mission to Japan and Korea.  While in Korea I signed an agreement on economic co-operation which, I hope, will lead to increased economic and trading contacts.</P>

      <P>In 1982, the European Court of Justice found that involvement by the Government or any of its State or semi-State agencies in the promotion of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; type campaigns was inconsistent with our obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  That judgement rules out any reactivation of a State-supported promotional campaign.</P>
      <P>Buy Irish campaigns are being organised by private groups and companies, such as Guaranteed Irish Limited.  While these promotional activities help to remind Irish consumers of the direct link between supporting Irish goods and building employment at home, I believe that import substitution can best be achieved through Irish firms being in a position to compete successfully with imports in terms of price, quality, product development and delivery performance. The extensive services and expertise of the State agencies are available to assist Irish industry in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 22, 27, 39, 50 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Council of the European Union held discussions on the progress of the GATT negotiations on 2, 6 and 7 December 1993. These discussions were on the basis of reports from the European Commission on their recent meetings with representatives of the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> Commission and US representatives are now in Geneva continuing the negotiations in a GATT multilateral context. It is expected that the Council of Ministers will meet again, before the end of this week to further consider the position. Together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I represented Ireland at the Council meetings.</P>
    <P>The current position in relation to agricultural issues in the negotiations was set out in the House yesterday in reply to questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Elements of the agreement emerging between the EU and the US in relation to non-agriculture areas also appear to address concerns that I have highlighted in the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy exporting over 70 per cent of its production, a stable world trade environment would be of considerable benefit to Ireland.  The conclusion of a global and balanced Uruguay Round agreement would serve to create such an environment and would give a much needed boost to the world economy generally.  Such an agreement could be anticipated to create opportunities for Irish industry to further develop its export potential.  If these opportunities are grasped, the overall impact on industrial employment in Ireland will be positive.</P>
    <P>Irish exports of services, whether incorporated in goods or delivered directly to customers, will gain from the expected buoyancy in world trade.  Any projected gain in services exports relates, of course, to the vigour with which opportunities are pursued by service generators in all sectors and will be dependent on the maintenance of Ireland's competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> alternative suppliers.</P>
    <P>The Government is keenly aware of the importance of the services sector.  It was for this reason that the Task Force on Jobs in Services was established and I expect that the report of that task force will give rise to a major focus on the systematic development of domestic and internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1942" /> The intensive discussions which will continue in Geneva for the next week will determine not only the success or otherwise of the Uruguay Round, but also whether the world economy will continue to grow as it has for much of this century by opening up trade governed by multilateral trading arrangements.  The alternative is to revert to all the negative practices of trade and protectionism.  Our national interest as a member of the European Union is undoubtedly in continued growth on the world economy and I and my Government colleagues will continue to work tirelessly over the next week to ensure the achievement of our vital interests in this context.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the operation and administration of Bord Fáilte to both the Chairman and the chief executive of the board.  I would like to make two points:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Bord Fáilte has done excellent work over the years.</P>
      <P>&mdash; My main concern is to get all strands to this industry, which has unparalleled potential, working as a cohesive unit. This applies from the policy making for which I am responsible as Minister for Tourism, to the executive agency responsibilities of Bord Fáilte, to the industry itself including investors, practitioners, community and voluntary groups.  All of the developments I have undertaken since becoming Minister for Tourism spring from this singular objective.  They include the reorganisation of tourism at county and regional level, to the setting up of Tourism Council, to the publication shortly of my plan for the next six years which will see the largest investment ever in Irish tourism.  </P>
      <P>Finally, I want to make it clear that I am prepared to look at new ways of doing business in Irish tourism.  In particular, I want to see greater participation by people directly involved in the tourism business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While access transport is, of course, the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I have arranged that the Tourism Council consider the subject of access specifically in one of the Sub-Committees it has recently established. The Access Sub-Committee, as it is called, includes a representative from Aer Lingus and will be examining the question of common rating in detail.  The <Col N="1945" /> Sub-Committee expects to be in a position to report in the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should add that the interline agreements which can provide for commorated fares are primarily a matter for negotiation between airlines themselves.  So far, my Department has not approached any airlines in this regard and is unlikely to do so until the tourism councils deliberations have been completed.</P>

A large trade delegation from the services sector with a particular focus on education, health care, engineering consultancy and aviation participated in the visit.

During the course of the visit, business worth $60 million was negotiated as I indicated in response to a written question in June.</P>
      <P>There are, as yet, no published trade figures available which can be used to make a statistical comparison on previous years.

There has also been increased contact at political level and both the Malaysian Ministers for Education and Energy have visited here recently.</P>

      <P>One of the fundamental aims of the future planning of post-primary education will continue to be the achievement of a reasonable equality of education opportunity for all pupils.  The post-primary school of the future will need to be of a sufficient size to offer a comprehensive programme suitable for a wide range of abilities and aptitudes and strike a balance between academic and practical subjects.  In addition to the junior and senior cycle programmes, schools will be expected to contribute to the development of adult and continuing education, including community education.</P>
