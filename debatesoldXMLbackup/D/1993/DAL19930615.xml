      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Task Force on Services, which I have established, held its first meeting on Thursday, 10 June 1993. A list of the members of the task force will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the task force are as follows: to examine the existing structure of the services sector of the Irish economy and to assess its potential for development and jobs; to consider the <Col N="594" /> contribution which specific subsectors of the services sector can make in producing more jobs; to decide what issues can be progressed to policy recommendation by September and if any require a longer timescale for consideration; and to produce specific proposals by end-September, for consideration by Government, on measures to significantly increase the number of jobs in the services sector.</P>
    <P>As regards a reporting date, the Deputy will note that the terms of reference in themselves require by end-September that the task force prepare proposals for consideration by the Government.  Areas requiring longer-term study will also be identified.</P>
    <P>Employment in service activities, which include those in firms in all sectors of the economy, accounts for some 70 per cent of total employment in the more developed countries.  In the United States, for example, the service sector, broadly defined, now accounts for 77 per cent of all jobs.  In contrast, employment in manufacturing has declined erratically, but in a continuous downward trend, over the past 15 years to 16 per cent of total employment.  The corresponding proportions of total employment for Ireland are 59 per cent for services and 28 per cent for manufacturing respectively. Not all countries will go the way of the United States, but I believe it is critically important to ensure that any policy changes in this country, necessitated by trends such as those I have mentioned, be considered by Government and, if approved, be implemented quickly.  In that context I look forward to the report of the task force at the end of September.</P>
    <P>I understand that significant progress has been made by the task force in mapping out the areas it will examine in the coming months and I look forward to its report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and welcome his announcement that the task force has been set up.  Can he indicate in what specific sectors he believes there is scope for improvement? Can he indicate what investment will be required and if it will involve Structural Funding from the European Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little early to make any assessment as to what funding may be required or the specific areas which can make the greatest contribution. We will leave that job to the task force which has been well chosen from the various sectors.  It is a matter for them to examine where the greatest contributions can be made and to pass that information back to Government for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that in establishing the task force the Taoiseach must have had some idea as to where jobs could be created as a result of this initiative.  Will he indicate what specific sectors can make the greatest contribution in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any exclusions in the services sector.  I have set up a task force to carry out a range of assessments throughout the whole sector. <Col N="596" /> It is clear we need more jobs and every area must contribute to the maximum extent possible.  I believe there is a greater contribution to be made by the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Taoiseach aware that the perceived growth in jobs in the services sector, both domestically and internationally, is due partly to the fact that services provided in-house in manufacturing industry such as cleaning, maintenance and catering, were previously defined as manufacturing jobs but now because they are contracted out they are defined as services jobs?  I would ask the Taoiseach to draw the attention of the task force to that point so that any evaluation is made on the real premise rather than on a false premise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The membership of the task force clearly understands the trend to which Deputy Noonan has referred. In recent years there has been a trend in that direction in Ireland and in other countries.  The Deputy can take it from me that the task force will bear that in mind when making that assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that, to a large extent, official policy has discriminated against the services <Col N="597" /> sector?  Will the task force have the opportunity to make recommendations on taxation issues?  He will recognise that VAT at 21 per cent on personal services, tax at 40 per cent on profits on the services sector and the PRSI burdens mean that creating employment in this sector is particularly handicapped by tax impositions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach whether the terms of reference permitted the task force to recommend on taxation issues which is central to a successful strategy to promote the services sector. Therefore, it relates directly to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning your ruling, Sir, I am merely questioning whether the taxation policy on the services sector would be legitimately within the terms of reference of the task force. In my view it is and this question should be allowed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat them again.  As I stated, the terms of reference of the task force are as follows: to examine the existing structure of the services sector of the Irish economy and to assess its potential for development and jobs; to consider the contribution which specific sub-sectors of the services sector can make in producing more jobs; to decide what issues can be progressed to policy recommendation by September and if any require a longer timescale for consideration; and to produce specific proposals by end-September, for consideration by Government, on measures to significantly increase the number of jobs in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to matters which can be progressed to policy, will the Taoiseach ask the task force to examine two issues, first, the discrimination against the services sector in the tax code and, second, the impact on job creation in the services sector of delays by the Government in fulfilling its promised legislative programme in regard to matters such as conveyancing, the Land Registry, the law on business tenancies and the law on occupiers' liability, all of which inhibit the development of the services sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unreasonable to expect the task force to question matters relating to a programme for Government or to question why the Government is not implementing its recommendations.  That is a matter for this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton asked the Taoiseach a question regarding the tax code and instanced the case of VAT.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the most significant element of discrimination against the services sector is the 10 per cent regime for manufacturing companies which was precipitately extended to the year 2010 during the Taoiseach's term as Minister for Finance <Col N="599" /> and that in retrospect, that was an unwise decision?  Will the Taoiseach agree that if this task force is to tackle seriously the growth of the services sector the question of the tax regime ought to be within its remit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax regime has a very wide import, Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  My discussions in Paris on 10 and 11 June with Prime Minister Balladur and President Mitterrand covered the matters likely to be discussed at the Copenhagen meeting <Col N="600" /> of the European Council, including action to boost economic growth and employment, relations with Central and Eastern Europe and with Russia, enlargement of the Community, the locations of EC agencies, the situation in former Yugoslavia and the future evolution of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Community.  The discussions also covered the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, Northern Ireland and cultural relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The GATT talks were also covered in my discussions in Dublin on 9 June with the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Rasmussen and will also be discussed when I meet the British Prime Minister tomorrow and, without doubt, at the Copenhagen European Council.  Subsequently, I will keep under review the question of additional meetings with EC Leaders before the conclusion of the GATT round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my discussions in Paris, I indicated, in line with the well-established Irish position, the Government's general agreement with the positions of the French Government that the world needs a GATT agreement, that any agreement must be balanced and global, that the presence of the Community's agricultural and food exports on world markets must be firmly maintained and that the aspect of the Blair House agreement that involves a 21 per cent volume cut in subsidised exports compared to the 1986-90 average is not acceptable in its present form.  I conveyed our assessment that this latter proposal, if implemented, would have very serious consequences for Ireland's major farm products, especially for our beef industry, and our insistence that these potential problems would have to be satisfactorily addressed.  There was a very satisfactory level of agreement between our views and those of our French partners on the whole GATT subject. This was also true in regard to the need to give priority, at Copenhagen, to action by the Community, and more widely internationally, to boost economic growth and employment, a view I had <Col N="601" /> also put strongly to the Danish Prime Minister when we met on 9 June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not presume the Taoiseach would get much sympathy from the Danish Prime Minster regarding the proposed cut in export refunds.  Was the French Prime Minister also seeking retention of the present level of export refunds where beef is concerned in the final negotiations in GATT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The French Prime Minister's main concern was in regard to cereal exports, France being the largest Community exporter of food and our concern relates to the beef sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard it as indications of acknowledgement of our position and our acknowledgement of the French position, a common support from both sides so that both of our critical positions will be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that EC sources have indicated that there will be no change in the compromise already reached in regard to food exports from the European Community. Will he agree that it is foolish for us to risk the collapse of the GATT negotiations on foot of this issue and that we should be arguing for a much greater degree of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which, effectively, is robbing the money required for other social and industrial developments in the European Community?  Will the Taoiseach agree that continuing increases in the Common Agricultural Policy will destroy other areas of development in the European Community?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he was a signatory to a communique on 6 November 1992 which was signed by all party leaders setting out the Irish position and the concerns about the cutbacks of 21 per cent in volume terms.  The Deputy seems to have changed his position in this regard since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the 21 per cent volume cut is not acceptable in its present form.  What are the implications for the Irish beef sector and the Irish economy should it survive in its present form?  Will the Taoiseach indicate in what form such cuts would be acceptable?  My second question relates to another part of the agenda, the location of European Agencies.  Is the Government making a case for the location of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in Ireland?  We have a strong case for its location here.  I note that the British Prime Minister, and the British Health Minister, have been busy lobbying decision-makers in Europe with multi-lingual high class brochures and are getting somewhat greedy as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is located in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A 21 per cent cut in volume of beef exports certainly would have a very serious impact on the pricing structure in our beef sector and also on employment in the food industry.  I will not say in advance of any possible talks in this regard what would or would not be acceptable.  It is already clear that an adjustment has been made in the area of oil seed since this draft agreement was drawn up.  Consequently we will continue to pursue the matter in this manner.</P>
      <P>In regard to the medicines agency, our position has not changed since the Lisbon Summit.  We have made a very strong case on a number of occasions and the Minister for Health is also following it up.  I am not sure that the question of agencies will be decided at the Copenhagen Summit.  I tend to believe that it will not.  As far back as the Lisbon Summit, which was my first one, I laid down the position in relation to the medicines agency as far as Ireland's interests were concerned because I believe it can complement a very successful pharmaceutical and chemistry industry here.</P>

It was a general statement about the need for a GATT agreement and about ensuring that those negotiations did not collapse.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the proposed increase of about 7 per cent in Common Agricultural Policy spending this year by the European Community is a suicidal approach to the way in which the budget of the European Community is spent, that 80 per cent of this money goes to 20 per cent of the richest farmers both here and in the rest of the Community and that it is crazy for Ireland to adopt a position in support of the French in the GATT negotiations which could effectively destroy the total economy of this country if it brings about the collapse of the GATT negotiations?</P>

      <P>It is important that Deputy De Rossa should not seek to misrepresent what I have been trying to say.  We made clear on 6 November 1992 the two very good reasons for our position. First there was the absolute need in the EC negotiations with the United States to safeguard the Common Agricultural Policy reform compensation measures.  They were secured as a result of extensive and extremely difficult negotiations which have exacted a considerable price already for Ireland.  We should not have to pay twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our second concern relates to our future potential to export beef and dairy <Col N="605" /> products.  Ireland cannot accept volume limitations on exports benefiting from community export refunds that would reduce in an unacceptable way our potential to sell on world markets.

They have already been bought off on oil seed, they will soon be bought off on grain and we will be left isolated, in that we will not be able to get the compensation we are entitled to under the Common Agricultural Policy reform package, the outlet for our beef exports will be cut off and milk quotas will be cut by up to 8 per cent.  Is it not the case that if those things happen large numbers of PAYE jobs will be lost, apart from the number of farming jobs that will be lost and the impact on the overall economy which depends more than any other on food exports will be far greater than anywhere else?  Is that not the case?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the proposal of Chancellor Kohl that there should be another summit this year after the final ratification of the Maastricht Treaty?  Did he discuss with Prime Minister Balladur his <Col N="606" /> proposal for a European conference on security in Eastern Europe?</P>

      <P>In relation to the second question on Chancellor Kohl's proposals for a second summit, if the idea of a second summit is to relaunch the whole European project after it has been ratified by the UK and cleared through the German courts, then certainly we will be in support of it.  We will have to wait and see what the arguments for it are.</P>
      <P>In regard to jobs in the Irish food sector, certainly it could have a very serious effect, apart from the effect it would have on the beef industry generally and on the whole pricing mechanism. This is a £1.5 billion sector of our industry and consequently any serious interference with it would have repercussive effects.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not accept that it would be good and <Col N="607" /> proper planning for the Government to indicate clearly now what constitutional changes might be proposed on the same day as the European election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree with the first part of the Deputy's question. As has already been stated clearly in this House by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, the necessary preparatory legislation and other measures should be in place before the holding of the referendum.  These are the Family Law (No. 1) Bill, the Family Home Bill and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Bill.  It is not possible for me at this stage to anticipate exactly when the House will be finished deliberating on these matters but it is our intention to have a referendum as early as possible in 1994, possibly on the same day as the European election.  Until the House has disposed of these three measures, I cannot be any more definitive than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Taoiseach's reply that it is the general intention to have a referendum on divorce on the same day as the European election, if it is possible to have the legislation in place on time.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that from the point of view of cost it makes sense to have the constitutional referendum on the same day as a European election rather than a general election in that there is not the same degree of heat and political passion associated with the European elections? Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be wise to look at other aspects that might give rise to constitutional changes, for example, the law of bail in the context of which there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of constitutional amendment?  Does the Taoiseach think it wise to consider now the possibility of such constitutional changes and, if so, the steps that would be necessary to put them in place by June of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it would be desirable, from the point of view of cost, <Col N="608" /> to hold a referendum on a constitutional amendment on divorce on the same day as the European election.  That is the objective if we can have the appropriate legislation passed by the House by that time.  I am sure that will be possible with co-operation.  We have no other plans for an additional referendum question on the same day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Copies of the understanding reached on 4 June 1993 between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the implementation of the pay commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP) in the public service have been placed in the Dáil Library.  The understanding reaffirms, <i>inter alia</i>, the Government's intention to honour commitments as yet outstanding which were made in the Government's package on public service pay of 17 January 1992.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the package of 17 January 1992 had the effect of deferring implementation of general round pay increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1992 and 1993.  In relation to 1993, the package provided for the imposition of a ceiling of £6.50 per week on the general round increase of 3.75 per cent which was paid on 1 January 1993 and its removal with effect from 1 December 1993.  The understanding reaffirms the commitment to remove the ceiling on 1 December 1993. The estimated cost in 1993 is £7 million and provision has been included in the Estimates for the Public Services for 1993.  The carryover cost in 1994 is estimated at £68 million.</P>
      <P>The understanding also provides for the implementation of the commitment in the package of 17 January 1992 to recoup the losses arising from the application in 1992 and 1993 of the ceilings of £5 per week and £6.50 per week respectively. The cost is estimated at £118 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>None of the foregoing costs is new. Essentially they derive from commitments previously made, as outlined in the package of 17 January 1992.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the commitments, together with an estimated £30 million for payment of salary increments are estimated to increase the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1994 by £216 million or 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The understanding, as it applies to public service pay, also provides for the <Col N="612" /> orderly processing of claims under clause 3, local bargaining, of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the appointment of a person to act as chairman of the public service arbitration board until 31 March 1994 and a commitment to complete negotiations on a new system of public service pay determination and industrial relations machinery by 31 October next.</P>
    <P>In relation to claims for increases under clause 3, local bargaining/ restructuring, the Government remains committed to realistic and meaningful discussions.  I welcome the willingness of the congress to give restructuring discussions affecting claims from pivotal groups a reasonable opportunity to come to fruition with a view to reaching agreement not later than 31 October next.  After that date, if agreement has not been reached, the groups concerned will be free to pursue claims to arbitration.</P>
    <P>The position of the Government, as set out in my Budget Statement, continues to be that any settlements or adjustments under clause 3, must not add to payroll costs in 1993 and must not prejudice the 1994 situation.  I am pleased that the congress has noted the Government's position in this respect while stating that they could not, however, commit themselves in advance to the outcome of any negotiations. Congress has also acknowledged the right of the Government and of employers generally to seek measures to offset costs arising under clause 3 and have accepted that payroll neutral settlements and adjustments are not ruled out under that clause.</P>
    <P>Public service employers will be obliged to adhere to the Government's position in their negotiations.  Given the overall position, as outlined, I am not making any provision for additional costs in 1993 and 1994 beyond those already mentioned earlier in relation to the cost of removing the ceilings which were applied to general increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased at the commitment by the congress to conclude discussions <Col N="613" /> on future arrangements for determining pay and the industrial relations machinery by 31 October next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister referred to the Budget Statement of 25 February, 1993.  Does he recall saying that there was an air of unreality in the expectation of trade unions and he would not ask taxpayers to pay for further increases in public sector pay?  In view of those statements how can he now justify his U-turn on those statements in respect of what was agreed on 4 June?  Will the Minister clarify the position in regard to the 3 per cent local pay bargaining clause and give a categoric commitment that there will not be a further increase in public sector pay given that the combined effect of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was that public sector pay has now increased at the rate of 2.5 times inflation over that period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1993.  I did not bring in the 1994 budget this year.  The figures announced in the Book of Estimates for 1993 and the plans for 1994 of the carry over are precisely what is contained in the agreement of 17 January 1992.  To answer the first question, there are no figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second question, the position under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was that the public service unions and the public unions generally accepted a 2.5 per cent non-index related pay increase when growth rates in the economy were double that figure and inflation was approximately that figure.  Therefore, the State did very well.  The State did not do as well under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> because growth rates were less and pay levels were more but were not <Col N="614" /> based on the fixed rates of pay.  Agreements were made in 1987 and in 1988 to roll over arbitration awards that were negotiated in 1986 and to pay those in 1991 and 1992.  We are paying those awards in 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's response that before any local bargaining takes place with any pay implication for the next year or, indeed, possibly this year, and before any further round takes place next year, the public sector pay bill will rise next year by 5 per cent before anything else is given. Does the Minister have any sense of a boundary on this State's ability to pay for constant rises above and beyond the rate of inflation?  Can he explain how what he has done in recent weeks in the name of the so-called understanding does not fly in the face of the logic of his budget, with particular reference to the following remark: &ldquo;I am not making any provision in this budget for more improvements in pay or conditions&rdquo;.  An arbitrator has been appointed.  We know what the effect of aribtrators has been; the idea that the arbitrator is the best arbitrage of the public interest is frankly ludicrous based on the history of that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that an arbitrator will remain in place until the end of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The only reason there is no arbitrator is that the previous holder of the office was appointed to the Judiciary, thereby leaving the post vacant so there is no change so far as the position is concerned.  To reiterate what Deputy Cox already knows, the figures for pay in 1993 are already included in the Book of Estimates under all categories and headings. This is as a result of the agreement of 17 January 1992 when the Government gave an undertaking that the outstanding commitments which they could not pay in 1992 would be deferred to 1993 and that the remaining agreements from arbitration cases which have been in existence since 1986 would be paid and not <Col N="615" /> later than 1994.  I am confirming that the pay bill in 1994, based on the present as it stands now, will show a 5 per cent increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to acknowledge that there is a trade off between pay increases and jobs in so far as more public sector pay means more taxation and more pressure on the public finances, all of which impacts on competitiveness? Would he agree also that it is imperative he holds a strong line in 1994 in relation to a new round?  Would he agree also that the best way to proceed in relation to real increases in incomes is by way of tax reductions and that his highest priority will be, therefore, the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy before he becomes involved in further pay increases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>I accept Deputy Yates' point because as I have stated many times over the past number of years, it is desirable that pay increases be kept at low levels by way of helping job creation.  In effect, since 1988 the pay limits under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> range from 2.5 per cent &mdash; for three years &mdash; to between 3 per cent and 3.25 per cent for the other three years which is in no way excessive.</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm that total public expenditure up to May 1993 has increased by more than 12 per cent over the same period in 1992; and the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure that public expenditure remains within the budgetary targets for 1993.</Quest>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to figures in the Exchequer statement dated 18 May last which showed that supply services expenditure as of 14 May 1993 increased by 12.7 per cent over the corresponding period in 1992.  The equivalent increase for the end of May Exchequer statement was in fact 18.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that for technical reasons it is not valid to compare the 1993 supply services figures with the corresponding figure for 1992.  Up to now the only time such a year-on-year comparison could be validly made was at end-quarter and end-year.  To improve this position, a technical change was made at end of October last to the basis for calculating the Exchequer issue for supply services for inclusion in Exchequer statements published between end-quarters.  However, this will not provide comparable year-on-year figures until the end of October of this year.  In the meantime, the only valid 1993 year-on-year comparisons relate to the figures for supply services published in the Exchequer statements issued at the end of each quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1993 end-March quarter Exchequer statement showed an increase in supply services expenditure over the corresponding period of 1992 of 5.7 per <Col N="618" /> cent.  This was in line with the budget forecast.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept there is now serious concern about the position of the public finances?  Is he aware of the Central Bank report last week which indicated that borrowing was now stretched to the limits of what was prudent, a 3.4 per cent EBR of GNP?  A total of £130 million will be given to Aer Lingus, no money will be provided for the double Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients and £20 million minimum will be required to cover the costs of the Beef Tribunal.  In addition to this there are budgetary commitments for next year in relation to the levy, £260 million for pay and the Minister is facing a black hole of £500 million of an opening deficit next year in addition to his existing commitments between what he has done with the receipts from privatisation and the other matters I have mentioned.

      <P>The figures for the first quarter were on target and while there are still some weeks remaining in the second quarter they are on target also.  I am confident that the figures outlined in the budget will be more or less on target at the end of the year.  The question the Deputy originally asked was in regard to improving the position so that the figures are always in order.  The figures are produced for the purpose of determining the borrowing requirement and central supply figures during each quarter, so that the markets can make an accurate assessment of them.  They are the changes that are made.  I am sure the Deputy is pleased that public expenditure for this year is in line with the budgetary figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 41, 45 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has participationed actively in the Community discussions which have been held on the Commission's proposals for an EC carbon-energy tax.  To date, Ministers in the Joint Energy-Environment and ECOFIN Councils have not been able to agree on the need, or otherwise, for a specific Community fiscal instrument as one of the measures to enable the achievement of the objective of stabilising CO² emissions in the Community at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Further discussions on the topic are likely to be held during the second half of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incorrect to say that the Government is not supporting the Commission's proposal.  From the outset, Ireland has adopted an open mind approach in the EC discussions.  More recently, the Government agreed that we would be prepared to support the principle of the introduction of a carbon-energy tax provided certain concerns are satisfactorily addressed.  These relate, in particular, to ensuring that any agreement takes account of the different levels of economic and social development in individual member states.  While recognising and accepting the importance of environmental considerations, the Government is anxious to ensure that, to the extent feasible, the interests of existing Irish industries are protected and that our competitiveness as a location for investment is not undermined.  These considerations will inform our stance in ongoing <Col N="623" /> Community discussions.  Deputies will also appreciate that because in many cases our taxation of energy products is already relatively high, the existing taxation regime is already supportive of environmental and energy conservation concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that during the debate in this House on the Green 2000 report the issue of an energy tax was discussed in the context of a reduction of tax on labour as part of an overall review of taxation and there was agreement by parties present as to the merits of an energy tax as one of the many measures needed to combat the climate change crisis, which in terms of the recent flooding has cost life as well as money?  Given that the ESRI report referred to in the question indicates an increase of 9,000 jobs following the introduction of an energy tax and the EC strategy which the Government supposedly supports, was the Minister misquoted in speaking against the energy tax at the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has been ongoing for some time at the Environmental and Energy Councils and the ECOFIN Council.  The whole basis of the discussion is that climate change in recent years has been identified as a global environmental problem of major significance. It is thought that the causes of this phenomenon lie principally in the greenhouse effect caused by gas emissions. One measure suggested is that Governments take action on manmade carbon dioxides, the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil and turf.  A proposal was made 18 months ago that a tax be introduced of US$3 per barrel, increasing to US$10 per barrel, in addition to an increase on existing excise on fuels.  The ESRI surveys were based on that proposal, which would raise a substantial amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically Deputy Sargent's comment on the report is correct, but that is only one of several analyses made by the <Col N="624" /> ESRI.  The proposal quoted by Deputy Sargent was based on moneys raised from employers' PRSI and it was suggested it would reduce the cost of employment, thereby increasing the number of jobs created.  IBEC and other studies undertaken by several private sector companies showed that there would be a decrease in growth and that in the area of peat production 4,000 jobs would be lost. Other cases were put forward by Aughinish Alumina, Premier Periclase, Irish Cement Limited and others.</P>
    <P>At the discussions that took place I joined Ministers from other countries in supporting in principle a carbon tax, while putting forward the reservations of interested groups.</P>
    <P>The Greeks have a lignite problem. Hydro-electricity is a problem for the Portuguese and we have a problem with regard to peat.  We all put forward our arguments.  Further studies are being undertaken.  In principle we support the proposal but like practically every other State we have some reservation and we want to see some derogations and exceptions. We want to come to early conclusions on the tax.  We have put forward our views and look forward to discussions continuing under the Belgian Presidency.</P>

      <P>Discussions will not combat the greenhouse effect.  Will the Minister indicate even one step he has taken apart from further consideration and reservations, to indicate our genuine commitment? Ireland is far more prolific in its CO2 emissions than many other countries. From what the Minister has said it appears that our commitment is far from genuine.</P>

      <P>We said that we would go along with the proposal if the Community made progress in four areas.  We want a provision whereby the EC carbon tax will be modulated by the cohesion States, to our relative advantage.  We want a satisfactory provision regarding the impact of tax on the peat sector.  We want effective conditionality clauses to maintain the competitiveness of the EC generally.  A number of our biggest firms <Col N="625" /> employing a great number of people argued that we should take these views into account.  We are not particularly concerned that these industries could move to non-EC countries unaffected by the carbon tax and that we would achieve nothing.  A lot of this is conditional on Japan and the US implementing the same kind of regulations as those in Europe.  If they did not, the so-called dirty industries would move around the globe and we could do nothing about CO2 emissions. We also want an effective provision to maintain the competitiveness of energy-intensive firms that face competition from non-EC firms.  Those requests were reasonable enough.  Other countries have far greater reservations.  If those provisions were implemented we would accept the proposal.  We had bilateral discussions with the Danish Presidency and now it has been agreed that discussions will continue with the Belgian Presidency.  Quite recently 11 countries indicated their support in principle without too many reservations.  The matter is progressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 32, 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Birmingham on 16 October 1992 invited the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers to review the lessons to be drawn from the currency crisis.  In turn, the EC Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks were asked to examine the matter and report back to the ECOFIN.  The reports of these two committees were discussed at the informal ECOFIN in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports emphasise the need for countries in the Exchange Rate Mechanism to ensure that their economic policies are such as to sustain their exchange rates.  It was partly the cumulative divergence <Col N="627" /> of some economies from the policies necessary to support their exchange rates that brought about the crisis.  The reports recommend the establishment of a monitoring system for exchange rate parities to sound an early warning on potential problems in this area.  The reports, as has been widely reported, do not recommend any changes to the intervention mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I have broadly welcomed the reports and I can agree with most of the views expressed in them.  It is true that I would have preferred a change to the intervention mechanisms to require other countries to support a currency under pressure, even before it reached the bottom of the ERM band, where the new monitoring system showed that the relevant exchange rate was correct.  This was based on the view that, while intra-marginal intervention is not the only solution to a currency crisis, it nevertheless can play an important role.  Other countries did not agree to this and, at the end of the day, the system is built on consensus.  Both reports give emphasis to the use of voluntary co-operative intervention within the ERM bands.  I welcome recent examples of this type of co-operation as indicating a greater awareness of the need to resist speculative pressure where it is not warranted.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for copies of both reports to be placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that those criticisms are not echoed in the report of the monetary committee and that what our partners are telling us is that we have persisted in a fundamental error in defending the pound for too long when our main reliance is on the British market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="628" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. What my colleagues and both reports are saying is that because the system is a voluntary system, nobody wishes to give an absolute guarantee to accept the cost of the marginal intervention.  This is particularly the German position.  In fairness to them they carried much of the load on behalf of the system during the winter months.  A useful aspect of the report is that it identifies that intra-marginal intervention will be applied on a voluntary basis, provided the monetary committee and the Governors of the Central Banks, who in future will have ongoing monitoring of exchange rate parities, believe that the exchange rate parities are defensible.  Equally if they do not feel parities are defensible, they will not act.  On foot of the conclusions received on a quarterly basis, the monetary committee who meet monthly on this matter will continue to monitor exchange rates and report on a confidential basis to the Governors and the relevant Minister of the member state which is out of line.  Perhaps that is not as much as I would have liked to see but on the basis that it is not Ireland that has to pay the substantial tab on intervention and then has to wait several weeks or months to be reimbursed, it is not an unreasonable compromise.  This has been in operation in the recent past in Spain, Portugal and Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall in the post-devaluation period all the whingeing and crying and scapegoating that the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government participated in, blaming the Bundesbank and the European Central banking system for not coming to the support of the punt as it did to the Danish Krone?  Now that this whole matter is investigated, the Minister and the Government are saying that everything is fine although there is no fundamental reform.  Does the Minister not consider these reports to be a major rebuff to him and to the Irish position in view of the earlier position taken up?  Does it not have serious implications for our credibility in so far as we did not take due <Col N="629" /> cognisance of the relevance of sterling to the punt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not changed my views one iota on that.  I noticed, even in this morning's <i>Financial Times,</i> that the influential group, the Bank of International Settlements, who are considered experts in this matter, in their report speak about the system and blame last year's crisis within the European exchange rate mechanism on the lack of willingness of Governments to consider preventive parity adjustments in exchange rates prior to the emergence of severe market strains.  That report also concludes &mdash; in clear reference to ourselves &mdash; that ultimately adjustments have to be made in crisis conditions precipitately, and that speculative attacks were triggered, even in the case of currencies where the fundamentals were sound.  Effectively that is what happened to us; indeed, in some ways it is still happening, perhaps to a lesser degree now, in the case of our colleagues in Spain and Portugal.  I have not changed my opinion one iota and still believe that, during the crisis, the co-operation and co-ordination should have been better. That is not to say that the overall system which has served us well since 1979 is fundamentally wrong.  But I believe &mdash; I have placed this on the record many times &mdash; that it is better that the system speak clearly on whomsoever they believe to be out of line; if there are exchange rate parities out of line the finger should be pointed, and one does not then continue to defend those parities.  In the case of the Irish punt the point was made clearly throughout the crisis that we were not out of line.  Indeed, even when our Central Bank, not that many days before devaluation, asked the question again, it was told it was not out of line.  Nonetheless we did not receive the type of support we would have liked to have received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>But the contents of this report will change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It will change it, perhaps not as much as we should like, in two <Col N="630" /> respects.  First, the EC Monetary Committee henceforth will continuously monitor all exchange rates; it has not been given that very important role and power which will play a very important part overall.  It will then be at any country's peril to ignore what it is told.  While I cannot speak for every other member state, it would be my view that any country would err fundamentally to ignore such advice if and when given by the EC Monetary Committee and the Governors of the Central Banks.  Second, on a voluntary basis, if they believe that the parity is right, on an intermarginal basis, they will intervene in support of a currency. The House should remember that that is what they would not do in the crisis.  Inter marginal intervention may not save a currency or prevent speculative attacks, but it gives the right signal and did work in the case of Denmark.  I know it did not work recently in the case of Spain, because they decided to go ahead and devalue.  While it does not constitute all that was sought, it is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for having placed the reports mentioned in the Dáil Library.  I have had an opportunity of reading one, the Annual Report of the Committee of Central Bank Governors in which they express the very clear view that they should be, and should have been, more flexibility in the operation of the exchange rate mechanism. Will the Minister clarify something politically not clarified in any other forum? Did these technical people in the banks advise this course of action in advance of crises and did the politicians ignore such advice, or was it a case of them expressing wisdom with the beneift of hindsight?  In view of the Minister's comments about voluntary interventions on an inter-marginal basis, will the Minister accept that it could be inferred that, at the end of the day, the Central Banks took the view that Ireland was a loser last January, and that the failure to get what was described as a sweetheart deal was nothing more than a validation of the view that they thought we could not ride <Col N="631" /> both horses, that is sterling and the then value of our currency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that was not the position.  It should be remembered that when we were at the bottom of the band, the countries at the top supported us, but that was merely one for one.  The inter-marginal support tends to be forthcoming but not when one is are the bottom of the band.  I know Deputy Cox fully understands that one should not wait until one is at the bottom of the band, a point made not only by us but by four or five other countries.  After we had devalued, on the following Monday morning, but more particularly on the Tuesday morning, the speculation moved on fully to the Danes, who took a rather quick decision that they were not going to sit there.  I cannot say whether their decision was to leave the system altogether, as alleged, or whether to devalue by a large amount, but it was one or other.  At that stage the political fear &mdash; in respect of which we would like to have received support &mdash; hit other countries, mainly one, when they acted to give inter-marginal intervention and a reduction in interest rates. It was that which stabilised currencies at least for the present though I would still hold the view that perhaps more should be done.</P>
      <P>I made my point clear on the reports in Denmark that, while it is all right to maintain everything is now fine, such problems may recur.  I agree with Deputy Cox that greater flexibility within the system on more general realignments would not be a bad thing, if undertaken within the EC monetary committee.  The House should remember that had a meeting been held of the monetary committee in September last, or late August, they might have said: &ldquo;Let us call it as it is&rdquo;; certainly two or three other countries, not ours, would have changed their exchange rates.  That has been fairly well acknowledged, both politically and in the reports since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the political aspect, the Central Bank was very much part of all the decisions taken up to the last minute. <Col N="632" /> Indeed, we acted at all times on the basis of its advice which I very much appreciated during the currency crisis.</P>

      <P>The technicalities of the ERM make for a very interesting discussion but what lessons has the Minister learned from the experience?  While I appreciate that one cannot quote at Question Time, there are a myriad of quotes from the Minister, none of which are reflected in the report the subject matter of this question.  Does the Minister accept that the drama could yet be replayed?  What lessons has he learned from that experience?  Is it not the position that the Irish pound was over-valued? Is not the fall-out now that we are viewed, whether or not the Minister likes it, as being in the sterling zone? Does the Minister agree with the comment of Mr. Jacques Delors that anybody who fell out of the ERM, or whose parity was altered, did not do so because of some malfunctioning of the ERM but rather because of problems relating to the fundamentals of that particular economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte correctly interpreted the thrust of Mr. Jacques Delors' comments about those who fell out of the system.  Indeed, on the Friday evening before devaluation, in so far as he could, he was supportive of this country &mdash; which we must appreciate throughout the crisis &mdash; and felt strongly that the fundamentals of the Irish economy did not warrant devaluation. No, I do not believe the Irish punt is over-valued. Indeed, that is precisely what we have witnessed in recent months and why our reserves are so high at present.  That is why people were prepared to move money back in here from many countries, not merely from the sterling area.</P>

There is no need to go through a detailed analysis of our exports again. The fact is that if 30 per cent of our trade is with the United Kingdom, then 70 per cent is with other countries.  As the House will be aware that 30 per cent is comprised of multinational exports denominated in dollars, not in sterling.  Indeed, there are other accounts that go through the United Kingdom which are ECU-related and related to other currencies in the Far East.  Therefore, the percentage is not near 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>In regard to the ECOFIN Council and the other committees, the countries which are not <Col N="635" /> included in the ERM ars still included in the EMS and are, therefore, party to all the discussions on this matter and to these reports.  I made the point earlier that when there is no consensus or unanimity one does not get one's way.  Naturally, the United Kingdom, the Italians, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Danes, the French, the Belgians perhaps and our-selves would like to have something different but on many of these matters somebody calls the tune, as the Deputies are aware.  Deputies have to acknowledge that it is very easy if one does not have to pick up the tab which last year ran to billions of pounds for the Bundesbank. Therefore, it is entitled to its point of view.</P>
      <P>The Italians would like to re-enter the system at an early date while the United Kingdom has made its position clear, it has no intention of thinking about it in the medium-term.  However, it is still party to all the discussions that take place at the monetary committee and at meetings of the governors of the central banks.  It would be useful &mdash; this is the view of Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand &mdash; if moves were made later in the year to speed up the convergence process under the Maastricht Treaty.  I agree with Deputy Yates when he says that, ultimately, we cannot force sterling to enter but in moving towards a single currency we can resolve many and probably all these problems.</P>

This calculation is based on an investment period of 66.5 years and represents an average rate of return <Col N="636" /> of about 4.5 per cent compound interest per annum tax free.</P>
      <P>In recent years, rates of return on savings certificates have been much higher than this.  However, amounts invested in 1926, in the first issue of savings certificates will have enjoyed these higher rates for the appropriate periods.  For the initial periods of investment, however, interest rates were very low &mdash; reflecting market conditions at that time.</P>
      <P>The rate of return on the current eleventh issue of savings certificates is 7 per cent compound interest per annum if the investment is held to five years.  It should be noted that this return is tax free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but when I saw this question had been tabled I wondered what the trend was over the period in question and I think it makes interesting reading.  The current value of a certificate purchased in 1926 represents a total return of more than 1,900 per cent.  Inflation for the period 1926-93 is calculated at more than 3,100 per cent. It is felt that all other comparable investments held over the same period would not have matched inflation, especially having regard to the difficult economic climate of the twenties, thirties and fifties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.  When one compares an investment in saving certificates against other comparable investments it looks as if, through difficult decades, saving certificates represent a very good value.  Incidentially, there is still £6,500 worth of saving certificates purchased in 1926 outstanding.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am mesmerised as to how it ended up in the lobby of the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, some of the questions that I wanted to ask the Taoiseach are not pertinent.  Are programme managers asked to make observations on Cabinet memoranda and, having regard to the fact that in most cases programme managers are not civil servants, what implications has this for Cabinet confidentiality, as recently defined?  Having regard to the unfortunate situation at Clonmel where it has been reported that 1,200 jobs have been put at risk by over anxious politicking on the part of Labour Party backbencher does the Minister think that the unfortunate leak in question might have come from a programme manager as distinct from a Minister?</P>

      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question relates to a separate matter.  Programme managers who are appointed from outside the Civil Service are appointed under excluding orders from the Civil Service Commissioners and are required to sign a contract. Therefore, they are civil servants and have to comply with the normal contract provisions regarding official secrecy and <Col N="638" /> integrity.  If the Deputy wishes.  I will read the terms into the record.  It states:</P>
      <P>You will during the term of your appointment be subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1963. You will agree not to disclose to third parties any confidential information, especially that with commercial potential either during or subsequent to the period of employment.  You will also be bound by regulations regarding integrity and conflicts of interest which are generally applicable in the Civil Service and you shall be required to make a declaration of interests in such form as the Minister for Finance may require.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 20, subsection (3), of the VAT Act empowers me to make refund orders in respect of VAT borne which does not qualify for deduction in the normal way, subject to whatever conditions are considered necessary.  Some existing refund schemes operate for social and philanthropic purposes, for example, the scheme for certain medical equipment purchased by voluntary subscription.</P>
      <P>The possibility of making a VAT refund order in relation to gifts or donations of equipment for schools was discussed at length during the Committee Stage of the recent Finance Bill.  Deputies on both sides of the House showed a considerable amount of interest in the idea and, for that reason, I am giving the matter some further thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tabled this question is that the Minister gave a commitment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, in response to my amendment, to give the matter some further thought.  As he pointed out, it was commented on positively from all sides of the House.  On Committee Stage the Minister undertook to give further consideration to giving a VAT refund.  May I ask what thought he has given to the matter during the intervening time?</P>

      <P>Debate on the Finance Bill was concluded only last Thursday night in the Seanad.  I will certainly look at the points raised during the debate.  I do not think it would suit the Deputy if I gave inadequate consideration to the matter and I am sure he will await my proper consideration of it.  One has to consider whether paying through the VAT system for something which is really a capitation rate matter is the best way of doing things.  One has also to take into account that this may be of benefit only to schools in particular categories.  I am not against examining the possibility of giving a VAT refund in this area. There is a similar provision for voluntary bodies.  The Deputy made some valid <Col N="640" /> arguments which I accept.  However, I would be concerned that people would only collect money for good causes, charities etc. in order to get a VAT refund.  One has to try to protect the system.  I will look at the valid points made in regard to this matter.</P>

If there is any increase it will have to be on an Exchequer neutral position.  When the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was negotiated three years ago a local bargaining clause was included on the basis that it would be payroll neutral in the private and public sectors.  It would be very useful for some grades in the public service if there was some flexibility in regard to technology and if demarcation lines were removed.  Whether it would be possible to reach agreement on this is another matter.  It should be possible in some of the pivotal grades. There could be substantial savings.

      <P>For upwards of 100 <Col N="644" /> years prior to 1945, drainage works in Ireland were carried out on a piecemeal basis and dealt with drainage problems in localised areas of river catchments. Several hundred of these minor schemes were carried out under various statutes in what came to be known as drainage districts, the maintenance of which became the responsibility of local authorities or drainage boards.</P>
      <P>The inadequacies of this piecemeal approach to dealing with drainage problems were highlighted by various drainage commissions over the years, particularly by the Browne Commission 1938-40.  It commented adversely on the haphazard creation of individual districts without consideration of the interests, problems and requirements of river basins as a whole.  This was judged to be inconsistent with the idea of a planned drainage policy.  Lack of maintenance was also a feature to such a degree that many schemes deteriorated to the extent that works had to be re-done, often on more than one occasion.</P>
      <P>Among the main recommendations of the Browne Commission was that there should be a central drainage authority based in the Office of Public Works with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of arterial drainage.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission.  It is now the sole basis for the Commissioners' statutory authority for arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>The 1945 Act envisaged the execution of arterial drainage in the future on the basis of a planned programme of comprehensive schemes for entire catchments areas.  Sixty of the most important rivers in the country were included in the national programme which was initiated soon after and which has progressed successfully in the intervening years.  To date well over 40 schemes have been completed, conferring benefit on some 660,000 acres of agricultural land which previously suffered from flooding or waterlogging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changing emphasis on land uses, increased awareness of the environment and reducing returns on the high capital <Col N="645" /> investment required has led to a diminishing prospect of formulating economically or environmentally acceptable schemes in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been examining to what extent changes, if any, in existing arrangements are necessary to take account of these altered circumstances.  It is however too early at this stage to say whether any changes would be required to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the unnecessary history of drainage works he gave in his reply.  In view of the fact that the arterial drainage programme is now effectively dead &mdash; the current estimate is 37 per cent lower than last year's estimate &mdash; would the Minister not agree that it would be wise to look at smaller catchments which are causing major problems in certain areas?  The Minister will agree that full catchments works are effectively dead, both from an economic and environmental point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, which was not history, it is too early to state whether any changes will be required in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I am, as the Deputy suggested, looking at smaller catchment areas and considering the possibility of carrying out drainage works in those areas.  Drainage works were initially carried out on a piecemeal basis with the result that the problems were transferred from one part to another.  Obviously such matters have to be taken into consideration, and this is being done at present.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners also require evidence that the general public is aware of the access to the building. Such evidence would include notices in brochures or publicity leaflets issued by Bord Fáilte or other similar organisations and advertisements in local or national newspapers.  Evidence is required at the stage of granting the relief and can also be requested on an ongoing basis in order to establish that access continues to be afforded to the general public.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not consider that consultations with members of the public in the localities in which the buildings are situated is necessry in view of the procedures in operation.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason the major emergency plans were not activated on Friday, 11 June 1993 during the severe weather conditions which affected many parts of the country with a consequent threat to life and property; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to ensure a more coordinated approach to the provision of emergency services in the future; if he proposes to offer any assistance to victims of the severe flooding which took place; if he intends to utilise EC funds for this purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these four Private Notice Questions together.  The heavy rainfall which affected much of the country beginning on the night of Thursday, 10 June was an extreme natural occurrence; in some areas, including Baldoyle, registered levels involve a statistical probability of lower than once in 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inevitable that a natural phenomenon of this exceptional severity must <Col N="654" /> result in extensive damage and suffering. Such has sadly been the case.  As the House is well aware, tragic loss of young life has been occasioned, as well as widespread hardship and disruption to the urban and farming communities.  Our deep sympathy goes to the bereaved and to all others affected.  Our thanks are also due, of course, to the staff of the various emergency services and all other volunteers who laboured exceptionally to provide all possible relief.</P>
    <P>Different factors contribute to flooding in different circumstances.  A number of public sector responsibilities are therefore involved, in relation to matters such as arterial drainage, coastal protection and urban drainage.  My own responsibilities as Minister for the Environment relate to the financing of projects designed to provide adequate drainage of urban catchments within the framework of the water and sanitary services programme.  I accept that this aspect is an issue in the Baldoyle situation, with which I will now deal in some detail.</P>
    <P>Two questions arise for consideration in the light of the Baldoyle flooding.  The first concerns the operational measures deployed by Dublin County Council, as the responsible public authority involved, during the testing and exceptional events of the weekend.  The second question relates to the Baldoyle flood relief scheme which has been proposed by Dublin County Council to provide a permanent solution &mdash; if such solutions can be provided &mdash; to the drainage problems of the area.</P>
    <P>As regards the first of these questions, Dublin County Council have already issued a statement on the Baldoyle flooding pending further investigation by them of all of the circumstances involved. Independently of this, I immediately requested a report on the situation from an inspector of my Department which I have received today.  I will now summarise for the House the main findings of this report.</P>
    <P>The report details that between midnight on Thursday, 10 June 1993 and midnight on Friday, 11 June 1993, approximately 93mm of rain fell in the <Col N="655" /> Baldoyle area.  Conditions of this kind would only be expected at intervals of more than 100 years.</P>
    <P>Grange Road, in the vicinity of the drowning tragedy, was flooded to a depth of between one and two feet.  Some low lying houses were also flooded, as has previously occurred during heavy rain-storms.</P>
    <P>A housing development is under construction across the Grange Road from the scene of the drowning.  One of the planning conditions required the developer to construct an open channel linking the Seagrange and Racecourse streams in order to provide some flood relief in advance of the main council drainage proposal for the area.  Another planning condition was that the channel should be fenced.  At the time of the flooding, this channel had not been fully connected between the two streams and fencing had not been provided.  It appears that there would have been up to six feet of water in this open drain a short distance out from the wall at the point where the tragic drowning occurred.</P>
    <P>The relief measures taken by Dublin County Council include the following: clearance of the stream at Marian Park; issue of sandbags to householders; manual opening of the flood gate at Mayne river to ensure release of as much water as possible and manual operation, on a precautionary basis, of the foul sewage pumping station at Baldoyle village. Fire brigades were also, to the extent feasible, present to assist in relieving flooding to households and other premises.</P>
    <P>Overall, the report concludes that Dublin County Council's management of the drainage system was properly organised in relation to the facilities available and the exceptional circumstances which obtained during the weekend.</P>
    <P>The second question arising from the Baldoyle flooding concerns the flood relief scheme which has been under planning for some years.  The need for this scheme was already recognised by the Government by virtue of its inclusion, in <Col N="656" /> 1990, in the operational programme for water, sanitary and other local services.</P>
    <P>I can state openly to the House that planning and financial difficulties have delayed the earlier provision of this scheme.  At the planning or technical level, revised contract documents for the scheme were submitted to my Department in January 1993.  It has not yet been possible to approve these because all details of planning, such as acquisition of wayleaves and foreshore licence, have not yet been certified by Dublin County Council as complete.  It is also the case that, within overall competing needs for water and sanitary services investment, quite limited financing has been available for flood relief proposals.  Proposals are, of course, before me from many other areas throughout the country as well as Baldoyle.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that the difficult events of the weekend reinforce the need, already identified in the sanitary services programme, for the Baldoyle scheme.  I will endeavour, in consultation with Dublin County Council and within the constraints of budget, to ensure its early provision.</P>
    <P>As regards emergency planning, it is a matter for the main response agencies &mdash; the health boards, the Garda and the larger local authorities &mdash; to determine the appropriate response to emergency situations and to decide when it is necessary to formally activate the plans which they have prepared for responding to major emergencies.  These plans are based on a common framework for a coordinated response to major emergencies which was adopted by the Government some years ago.  The plans include procedures for co-ordination between the different services responding to an emergency, and with other agencies and services in a position to assist in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are no funds available to me to provide assistance to householders for any damage to houses caused by flooding.  Householders would normally be expected to have buildings and contents insured against losses of this nature. However, in necessitous cases, it is open <Col N="657" /> to the health board to provide assistance to elderly householders under the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly to remedy damage to the householders' living conditions.  Furthermore, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a health board may assist a person where an urgent need arises. Persons affected by the recent flooding may get advice on the assistance available in this way from the local community welfare officer.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Eric Lambe who lost his life in Baldoyle and to the relatives of the two young men who were drowned in County Meath during the weekend flooding.  Will the Minister confirm that in May 1989 Dublin County Council submitted a scheme for the flood relief programme in Baldoyle and that if that scheme had been given approval then it would be in place now and the disastrous flooding at the weekend would not have occurred?  I would remind the Minister that some years ago a special scheme of compensation was introduced for people affected by the overflowing of the Dodder river in Dublin.  Would the Minister revise what he has just said and introduce a scheme of compensation for the people in Baldoyle and elsewhere who have been affected by the flooding which occurred at the weekend?  Finally, could I ask the Minister to work with Dublin County Council to get the much needed scheme for Baldoyle up and running during 1993, in view of the fact that this should have been done in the seventies when it was first mooted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that proposals for a scheme were submitted in 1989. Since then the planning and revision of that scheme has taken a different course and in January last the county council was in a position to submit to my Department the revised plans which show significant changes in design from those proposed in the original scheme.  There are other planning and wayleave matters which must be resolved and I will give an <Col N="658" /> undertaking to the House today to work as closely as possible with Dublin County Council to resolve the remaining difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is open to any local authority to submit a report to me on the scale of the problems in its area and we will examine to what extent, if any, action is required by my Department.  My original reply dealt with this problem in general.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be open to the State in all circumstances to carry the costs of exceptional storms of this nature and for that reason people have their own insurance cover.</P>

      <P>I, too, extend my sympathy to the family of Eric Lambe. Would the Minister agree that the ability to cope with flooding such as that which occurred at the weekend has been affected by the cumulative impact of cuts enforced on various services in recent years?  Regrettably, it appears there must be a fatality before the Minister accepts the gravity of a situation.  For example, in my constituency an invalid woman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it to the Minister this way.  If it was found possible to provide a disaster fund of some dimension in the case of the people affected by the flooding of the Dodder a few years ago, why is it not possible to assist those who have been affected so badly as a result of the overflow of the Camac in Clondalkin?  What is the disposition of the Minister and his Department on the question of funding the necessary engineering scheme to make that river safe, having regard to the fact that this is the second time in ten years a disaster of this dimension has impacted on the people of Cherrywood in Clondalkin, where more than 40 houses are uninhabitable and many people are housed in emergency accommodation by the Eastern Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing the people who suffered from this exceptional storm want to hear is politics of pretence or the suggestion that the Minister for the Environment will act only when an unfortunate tragedy takes place. I am anxious to provide additional provisions for sanitary services and will fight my own battles in that regard.  Deputy Rabbitte can vote against any additional taxation raised in this House whenever it suits him, even though some of those provisions might be dedicated to services such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is well aware that there were large scale evacuations and considerable structural damage caused to housing property at the time of the Dodder flooding and as far as we are aware no real comparisons can be made with this case.  Nonetheless, individuals have been severely affected by the storm <Col N="660" /> at the weekend and I have outlined the assistance that is available.  When the local authorities, who have primary responsibility for reporting problems of this nature to me, submit a report indicating special hardship cases I will examine the extent to which I can assist them. I am grateful to the Deputies for raising this matter, but I regret that Deputy Rabbitte saw fit, once again, to politicise a problem for which every Member realises nobody could carry the full responsibility. When accidents and emergencies of a type which might occur only once in 100 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like also to express my sympathy to the relatives and friends of the victims of the tragedies which occurred at the weekend.  Would the Minister agree that the weekend flooding showed glaring inadequacies in the emergency plan which is supposed to be in operation on such occasions?  Will he inform the House who is in senior command in the local authorities in cases of emergency?  Is it the Garda?  Is it the engineering section of the local authority?  Is it the fire services?  Is it the Army, or is it somebody else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who co-ordinates it?  I do not want to delay the House, but this is an important matter which should be dealt with now.  Could the Minister initiate some procedure within the Department whereby it can be clearly indicated to the various local authorities who is to take charge in the event of an emergency of this nature so that we do not have a repetition of what happened in the last few days when fire services personnel were on some roads attempting to direct traffic and the engineering services of the local authorities were not aware to whom they should answer?  The Minister should address this issue, otherwise we will be back here again on some other occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

We are talking about tragedies which just should not happen, even if it is just once in a hundred years. Quite apart from the fact that I found the answer the Minister gave to my question overly general, I would say that if there is not an emergency plan there should be one.  If there is one, somebody should have overall responsibility, and surely that should be the Minister.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is in fact the person who assumes that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To refer in particular to the question I asked about the surface water channel where this unfortunate youngster was drowned, who is now responsible for this <Col N="662" /> open channel?  Is it the builder or the county council?  Is it anticipated that the channel will now be fenced in completely? When exactly can we expect the surface water drainage scheme to start?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Deputy would expect me to be able to answer those questions in detail.  I had an inspector of my Department review this matter and give me a report within hours of this tragic development.  I indicated to the Deputy that it was a condition of planning permission that fencing would be required.  I understand that work on the channel had not been completed. These are legal matters.  We will have to wait for a coroner's report and there are other legal implications which I would not be in a position to inform the House on today.</P>

      <P>Most Members will agree that the new method of discussion of Estimates has proved very successful. In the event of any of those committees agreeing they would like additional time to discuss the Estimate under consideration, could the House instruct the committee to sit again, if such a meeting could take place before the Adjournment debate at the beginning of July, so that the Estimates could be properly completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more time to debate Estimates this year than ever before.  While the Government is anxious to co-operate as much as possible with the committees it must be appreciated there are constraints on Ministers' time as well as on Deputies' time.  The Government has no objection if the committee, in conjunction with the Minister, can arrange for additional time but it is anxious not to have an accumulation of Estimates.  The committees could order their time and business among themselves. We do not wish to be involved except to say that where a Minister agrees with a committee to take this course of action, it must be remembered that ministerial time is constrained also, as the Deputy will appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  This problem may not actually arise but, depending on the depth of discussion the committee will engage in, it may feel that it requires additional time.  It is only in that context that it would require further consideration and it should be dealt with before the Adjournment debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be aware that the Select Committee on Social Affairs found itself in a position last Friday where it was unable to discuss adequately secondary and third level education because all of the time had been absorbed discussing primary education. I suggest, therefore, an amendment to the Order of the House because it was the Order of the House that caused the problem in this case.  That amendment would be to insert... &ldquo;to consider and if possible conclude all Estimates relevant to the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.  If we include the words &ldquo;if possible&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;conclude&rdquo; it would mean that the Order of the House would not prevent a Minister agreeing to an extension of the time if he so wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of the Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Kenny, seems to be the most appropriate in this regard. I have no objection to this but we must be extremely careful that Ministers are not put in the position where they are constrained by time.  The problem raised by Deputy Bruton is one for the committee itself to address.  It could have ordered its time just as the House is required to do when discussing primary, secondary and third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of the House requires that the committees in question must conclude these Estimates on 17 June or 18 June.  That means that the only option available to them is to sit right up to midnight on the day in question. For example, the Minister could not agree, without breaking the Order of the House, to leave part of the Vote for another day.  The appropriate course of action would be to insert the words &ldquo;if possible&rdquo; before &ldquo;conclude&rdquo;.  This would give a measure of flexibility.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the Minister would not be able to agree to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I wish to state for the record that the officials of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, the chairman and conveners <Col N="775" /> met a week prior to the meeting. The notification of the meeting was circulated at least a week in advance and was circulated again during the week.  On the day of the meeting, which was last Friday, the chairman offered to extend the hours of sitting and the committee declined that offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm that. Am I right that it is only the Friday committees we are ordering in the House?  A different approach has been adopted to committees not confined by the Order. Where discussion on one part of the Estimates continued it was agreed to adjourn and consider the remaining parts on another day.  When there is an Order of the House, that freedom does not seem to be allowed, even though the Minister last Friday was willing to oblige.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to diverge from the very important issue being raised by my colleagues, but I would like to know why a meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy scheduled for today to discuss the Estimate for that Department has been cancelled.  Would I be right in thinking that it has been cancelled because the Minister for Enterprise and Employment thinks there is more sex appeal being in the Seanad dealing with his Industrial Development Bill than being in committee with his Estimate?  If that is the case where does that leave the scheduling of these committees?  Will that committee be required to meet before 17 June to comply with the Order of the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the view that the committees are working well. The Select Committee on Legislation and Security, for example, has no business at the moment.  Also, the committee is not free to invite outside people such as the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána because the terms of reference are too narrow.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the terms of reference of committees are sufficiently wide to ensure they have work to do and can sit to discuss important <Col N="776" /> issues such as crime and so on?  Can I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that is done before the Dáil goes into its summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Harney saying that that committee is still awaiting business.  I understood that the Minister for Defence had requested that committee to examine the role of the Defence Forces and all that attaches thereto.  If that has not been done perhaps they do not intend to do so but it is not for me to dictate to those committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I am proposing an amendment to insert the words &ldquo;if possible&rdquo; before &ldquo;conclude&rdquo; in each of the items Nos. 2, 3 and 4, thereby allowing flexibility to a Minister to postpone part of the Estimate to a later date if it is not possible to conclude it on the day.  I hope the Taoiseach will agree to that amendment. The intention would be to conclude but I would ask that we see, at least for this week, how it will work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be awkward in this regard but what Deputy Bruton is proposing would certainly constrain the Minister.  If the committee decides to extend the time the Minister must fall in with that decision.  I made a genuine point in response to Deputy Kenny that while there may be time constraints on the Members themselves there are also constraints on the Minister.  If I were to accept that amendment the committee would then decide and the Minister would have no say in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Minister shall take steps to ensure that among the members of the RTE Authority to be nominated by him, a minimum of 40 per cent., of both men and women shall be nominated.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a rather long discussion on this on Committee Stage.  The intention is to take on board the question of women in decision-making and to ensure that for the first time we have in legislation a minimum of 40 per cent men and 40 per cent women nominated to the board of RTE.  This is in line with a recommendation of the first Commission on the Status of Women which was fully accepted by the Government two years ago.  Since then, the Free Legal Aid Board and Eolas did not have any women nominated to them.  In a series of questions to a range of Ministers I discovered that quite a proportion of boards still fall very far below this 40 per cent figure.  In effect, this means that women are not in the decision-making arena in State boards. The intention here is to remedy this in legislation for the first time.  It is important that the Government accept the recommendation but it is also important to build that into legislation in this way because that would give us equality in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should lead the way in this regard in this Bill. This is an important opportunity for him. It is particularly important because of the statistics that emerged this week in relation to women in the workforce which <Col N="786" /> show that in Ireland we are out of step with the rest of Europe in terms of women working outside the home and involved in decision-making arenas outside of the home.  It is important to give clear recognition to the importance of having balanced decision-making in all arenas and that means the involvement of men and women using the talents of women and men in every arena.  This amendment would allow that.  This is an historic opportunity to enshrine in legislation a minimum of 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men nominated to the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>The recent Third Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men published by the European Community emphasised the critical role of the media in relation to progressing equality and, therefore, in the decision-making arena of RTE it is important that women are well represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I suport this amendment and I appeal to the Minister to accept the substance of this amendment.  This Minister is very well positioned to do that.  Since his appointment his record in appointing women to boards has been impeccable.  He has not missed any opportunity.  He has appointed women to the Film Board and to other boards. It is reasonable that we on this side of the House should look to the Minister, the Cabinet and the Government for leadership in this repect.  The Minister has an established reputation in this area.  If the Minister does not take this amendment on board it will give ammunition to others who may not be as progressive in their thinking as the Minister on this matter. That would be detrimental to the welfare of this country in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The essential argument is that in every area of public life we need to enlist the experiences and talents of women at every stage and no opportunity must be passed up.  This is an ideal opportunity for a Minister for the first time ever to incorporate this principle into law.  It is an historic opportunity and I appeal to the Minister not to pass it up and to agree to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister is accepting the substance of what we debated on Committee Stage. While there are some differences between the Minister's amendment No. 4 and Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment, the intent is the same.  Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Minister shall takes steps to ensure that among the members of the RTE Authority to be nominated by him, a minimum of 40 per cent, of both men and women shall be nominated.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment seeks to amend the Broadcasting Authority Act without going into the percentages.  It refers to not fewer than three out of seven and not fewer than four out of eight or nine.  That meets the argument I was making although I cannot speak for Deputies in other parties.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought forward this amendment.  I detected a reluctance on his part at the time, not that he was not agreeable to the principle of what we were proposing, but that he felt at the time that it might be more appropriately done by general legislation covering all Government appointments to boards. Therefore, I welcome the fact that he has considered the case made by all Members who spoke on Committee Stage that he should introduce his amendment here.</P>
      <P>One question I want to put to the Minister relates to the second part of his amendment No. 4 concerning the coming into effect of the provisions of this amendment, which states:</P>
      <P>(2)  This section shall come into operation on the 1st day of June, 1995, or such earlier day as the Minister may appoint by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I erred when speaking on Committee Stage and referring to the appointment of the RTE Authority this autumn. Since then I understand that is not the case, that they are not to be re-appointed in the autumn; unless of course the Minister decides that that is what he wants to do.  Would the Minister clarify the reasons that 1 June 1995 is specified. <Col N="788" /> Does the current RTE Authority term run until June 1995 and is that why it has been inserted?  If not, would he say why it has been included?  Again, in relation to the last part, which states &ldquo;or such earlier day as the Minister may appoint by order,&rdquo; I presume he is so stipulating in case he may have cause to remove the Authority for some reason or other.</P>
    <P>Therefore I very much welcome Deputy Frances Fitzgerald's amendment and the Minister's taking on board the very strong case made on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa, it is only fitting that I, too, should compliment Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and the Minister on having been big enough to accept this amendment, perhaps in a different form of words or presentation; but I predict it will be seen as a benchmark <i>vis-à-vis</i> future legislation. It is particularly important since there is perhaps an easier option, that is, to await a global decision covering all legislation. The Minister has been very courageous in this regard and has been consistent.  I compliment him, particularly, as Deputy Quill said, since the experience of women has been ignored to date.  It is extremely important that at last they are being recognised.  Indeed, this House has come a long way in a few short months in regard to the role of women in society.  Perhaps it could be said that I was one of the perpetrators of that gender quota in many respects.  Nonetheless, I accept in the interests of democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say first that the spirit in which the amendment was tabled on Committee Stage was one with which I very much identified.  Nonetheless, I had difficulty in relation to some of the wording.  For example, at that particular <Col N="789" /> stage we had disposed of amendments dealing with radio, with which I can deal when I come to my fundamental broadcasting Bill, which will include a review of the 1988 Act and which is the appropriate place for that.</P>
      <P>In asking Members to accept my amendment No. 4 I want to make a couple of important points.  I decided on reflection, and the matters on which I reflected were as follows.  One was that I needed an appropriate wording.  I was worried about the reference beyond the RTE Authority with which my Bill dealt. I wanted an opportunity of considering the issue <i>vis-à-vis</i> general legislation, or particular legislation.  While I have been very impressed by the arguments advanced from the opposite side of the House, and share them, I concluded that it might be better to proceed with particular legislation which can be encompassed later within a general Bill.  Yet I did not want to lose the opportunity of putting forward the participation of women and concluded that I would move an amendment to that effect.  In fact my amendment No. 4 goes further than Deputy Frances Fitzgerald's amendment No. 2 in a number of ways.  I decided to be specific about numbers.  The number of members of the Authority can vary between seven and nine.  Where it is seven, there will be not fewer than three men and three women and, where it is nine, there will be not fewer than four men and four women.  I will not argue about percentages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that on Committee Stage I was asked to consider a nomination process through Government. In fact I am creating an obligation to achieve the gender balance I have described.  It goes further than a nomination process; in fact it is an obligation in the law.  The House should remember also that I have gone further than the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women, which did not request specific legislative action.  I am pleased to do that.  I am also pleased that such a proposal, which will heighten the consciousness of women on the RTE Authority, is supported by all sides of the <Col N="790" /> House.  That is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Frances Fitzgerald will see that not only the spirit but the letter of her intent has been more than met in my amendment No. 4.  I am grateful to Deputy Quill for drawing attention to the fact.  Indeed, I have been pursuing the conscious policy of building up gender representation.  I referred the last time to the fact that I had made an appointment to the board of the National Gallery and have availed of the one vacancy obtaining in the Independent Radio and Television Commission to appoint a woman there, should vacancies arise in the interim I intend to positively pursue my aim of building up gender representation on the basis of equality.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised a very good point and is absolutely correct.  I have specified the date in the second part of my amendment No. 4 to coincide with the date of appointment of the new RTE Authority, the legitimacy of the currency Authority having to be protected. However, I should assure him that if any casual vacancies arise I hope to follow the pattern of my present thinking, which is to build up gender equality.  May I assure the House also that when I come to make further appointments at the time of my fundamental review of broadcasting, they will see the same spirit reflected in that legislation which will cover radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan for his kind remarks.  He will be familiar with my views on this subject.  I am delighted that it has received such support in the House.</P>

      <P>Certainly, I agree that the Minister's amendment meets the spirit and intent of the amendment I had tabled in relation to the balance of women and men to serve on the RTE Authority.  I thank the Minister for having taken this amendment on board. I agree with Deputy Quill that it is a breakthrough.  We hear much lip service and talk about equality.  We want to see action being taken and legislative proposals building in what is accepted in <Col N="791" /> theory.  It is indeed gratifying to see this being included in the provisions of this Bill and being clearly spelled out.  It is an historic breakthrough, a marker, and an example of one individual Minister taking action within his remit.  I hope it is an example which will be followed by other Ministers in the future.  As the Minister said, it goes beyond the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women by building into law this minimum percentage of women and men within a decision-making arena.  It is extremely important because the matter of whoever takes decisions in our society is critical.  We have an unfinished democracy; we have half a democracy if women and men are not both involved in decision-making such as this.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking my amendment on board and am delighted to have given him the opportunity to build this into the provisions of this Bill. I hope it will be a marker for the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 30, after &ldquo;as may be&rdquo; to insert, &ldquo;,but not later than 3 months,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to this amendment was that I was seeking to address a point raised by Deputy Quill in the course of our Committee Stage debate.  I believe I have met the spirit of her amendment, one which I share.  Indeed, it has been my attitude throughout this short Bill to accommodate as many Committee Stage amendments as I could.  If it is a first, I welcome it, because it has not been of any bother to me and I may continue to do so in other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment No. 3, is to insert after the words &ldquo;as may be&rdquo; the words &ldquo;but not later than 3 months&rdquo;. What Deputy Quill was looking for was a legislative deadline in respect of the report which will be produced by RTE under section 6 of the legislation which deals with the commissioning of independent <Col N="792" /> television programmes.  It seems that a requirement to produce the report within three months of the end of each financial year is reasonable, given the importance of the report.  I wanted to meet the spirit of her amendment but to implement it in the most manageable way within good practice, given the maximum amount of information in the report.  I believe that this amendment meets the intent of the amendment she tabled on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for meeting the spirit and, indeed, the substance of my amendment.  I am very pleased with the outcome.  A time limit of three months is reasonable.  On reflection, perhaps my amendment was too restrictive.  The requirement that the report be published within three months is more reasonable because RTE will have time to prepare and present a proper report.  The amendment also meets the requirement for accountability to this House.  That was my overall intention when I tabled the amendment.  I accept that the Minister's amendment is the better one.</P>

    <Title>Presidential Elections Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill continues the programme of reform of the electoral law commenced last year with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992.  The overall objective of that programme is to up-date the electoral law and, in effect, bring it into the last decade of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Act, which amended and consolidated the law relating to Dáil elections represented the first substantial step in this programme.  The present Bill continues the process and, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it is intended to follow up, in due course, with similar measures dealing with referenda and the other branches of the electoral law.</P>
      <P>There are no fewer than seven separate electoral codes and modernising them all will, clearly, take time.  It is, however, a job well worth doing.  I think the House will agree that the electoral law, in particular, should be accessible and comprehensible to all and should not be the preserve of lawyers and specialists.</P>
      <P>The Constitution sets out the fundamental principles relating to the election of the President.  It deals, for example, with the right to vote, the qualification of candidates, the right to nominate, the term of office of the President, the electoral system and the time-frame for holding an election.  It could be said, therefore, that the Constitution contains, within it, the essential elements of the code for the election of the President leaving over to ordinary legislation only the detailed regulation of the election.</P>
      <P>At present, the statute law on the subject is contained in the Presidential Elections Acts, 1937 to 1992. The Principal Act is the Act of 1937 which has been extensively amended by the Electoral Act, 1963, and, to lesser extent, by later enactments.  The law is, therefore, in a rather fragmented state and the conduct of a presidential election requires reference to six separate statutes.  In addition, there are certain technical defects in the law, which have the potential to give rise to difficulty in particular circumstances.  The Bill makes good these defects, provides for a more streamlined and efficient procedure for the conduct of the count, introduces a procedure for reviewing the result of a presidential election and provides for the consolidation of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most striking change proposed by the Bill is the elimination of the central count.  Under existing law, the first count is carried out in each Dáil constituency by the local returning officer.  The first count result for each constituency is announced locally.  The ballot papers are then parcelled up and sent to the presidential returning officer who is required, by law, to count the votes and ascertain and declare the result of the election. With the exception of the 1945 and 1990 elections, the result of every presidential election has been decided on the first count.  However, under existing law, candidates and their supporters, as well as the country at large, have to wait while ballot papers are sent to Dublin and the presidential returning officer goes through what seems to be a superfluous counting process, before the result can be formally declared.  There is, in fact, no necessity for a central count, even <Col N="797" /> where it is necessary to eliminate one or more candidates.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, therefore, for the conduct of the entire count at constituency level, with a central co-ordinating role being performed by the presidential returning officer.  The result of the first count will be reported to that officer who will then calculate the quota and declare elected any candidate who reaches the quota on the first count.  If no candidate reaches the quota the presidential returning officer will direct the exclusion of the candidate with the lowest overall total of votes and the transfer of the papers of the excluded candidates. These operations will be done at constituency level and the results reported to the presidential returning officer.  Where necessary, depending on the number of candidates, the exclusion of candidates will continue on this basis until a candidate can be declared elected by the presidential returning officer.  Candidates and their agents will have the right to attend at, and supervise, proceedings at the count in each constituency and also at the central ascertainment of the result. As at present, candidates will have the right to demand a complete recount of the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the result of the 1990 presidential election was not declared until nearly 48 hours after the close of poll.  Under the arrangements provided for in the Bill, it should be possible to have the count completed in a single day even where the elimination of a number of candidates may be involved.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to certain apparent defects in the present law.  These centre on the nomination of candidates and related procedures.  Under existing law, if a Member of the Oireachtas signs more than one nomination paper, all such papers signed by him, except the first received by the presidential returning officer, must be disregarded.  This could lead to a situation which was clearly not intended.  For example, if a Member were to sign a nomination paper which has fewer than 19 other signatures and subsequently joins in a nomination with 20 or more Members, the later nomination <Col N="798" /> must be disregarded entirely, while the original nomination paper would be ineffective due to the absence of a sufficient number of signatures.  To eliminate this possibility, the Bill provides that, where an Oireachtas Member signs a nomination paper in respect of more than one person, his or her signature on the first nomination received by the presidential returning officer will be regarded as valid and the signature on any subsequent nomination will be disregarded, with prejudice to the signatures of any other Oireachtas Members on that nomination paper.</P>
    <P>Another defect in existing law is that if a candidate wishes to withdraw before the close of nominations, it does not seem open to his proposers to make a fresh nomination.  A candidate may only withdraw during the ruling on nominations or on the &mdash; later &mdash; day appointed for withdrawals &mdash; in other words, when it is too late for his proposers to consider a new nomination.  Under the Bill a candidate will be allowed withdraw at any time up to the completion of the ruling on nominations and it will be open to his proposes to nominate another candidate within the time allowed for nominations.</P>
    <P>Existing procedures in the event of the death of a presidential candidate are not altogether satisfactory.  Under existing law, where a candidate dies after the election has been adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll, the election is commenced afresh, with a new period for nominations.  However, existing law makes no provision relating to the death of a candidate where it occurs just after the close of nominations, or so shortly before the close of nomination, that there is not sufficient time to nominate a replacement candidate.  To cover this situation, the Bill provides that where a candidate dies more than five days before the close of nominations, the election will continue and the proposers of the deceased person will have an opportunity to nominate another candidate.  If a candidate dies during the five days preceding the close of nominations, or after the close of nominations a fresh election will <Col N="799" /> be held, with a new period for nominations.</P>
    <P>The law relating to the ruling on nominations provides for a judicial assessor, who is the president or another judge of the High Court, and for a tribunal, consisting of three judges of the High Court, to rule on any objections.  The respective roles of the returning officer, the judicial assessor and the tribunal are not very clear.  Accordingly, the Bill clarifies that the function of the judicial assessor will be to furnish his opinion on any matter referred to him and the provision for a special tribunal is repealed. However, a candidate or his authorised representative, will still be entitled to object to the ruling on the validity of a nomination or in relation to the qualification of a candidate, and the objection will be heard by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Unlike the other electoral codes, no statutory procedure is provided in existing law for questioning the result of a presidential election.  Given the status of the office of President, we would all hope that the question of a legal challenge will never arise.  Nonetheless, it would seem appropriate to lay down a specific statutory procedure for dealing with any possible challenge as is done in other electoral codes.  The Bill, accordingly, provides for a petition procedure based on, and applying with appropriate modifications, the Dáil petition procedure contained in the Electoral Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the constitutional importance of the office of President, the Bill provides that a petition may only be presented with the leave of the High Court and that such leave may be sought only by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a candidate, or the election agent of a candidate.  The application for such leave must be made within seven days of the declaration of the result of the election.  The grounds for petition will be restricted to the commission of electoral offences, obstruction of the election, or mistake or irregularity likely to have affected the result.</P>
    <P>In addition to amending the law as I <Col N="800" /> have outlined, this Bill consolidates the presidential elections code using the Electoral Act, 1992, as a model.  It applies, with appropriate modifications, the procedures in the 1992 Act which are common to elections generally, including procedures relating to postal voting, voting by disabled electors, polling on islands, taking the poll in polling stations, voting by election staff, arrangements for counting of votes and the retention and disposal of election documents.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the programme of electoral reform commenced last year with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992.  It is essentially a consolidating and up-dating measure and I trust the House will afford it a swift passage into law.  In recent years we outlined a programme to continue to reform and up-date all our laws relating to general, presidential and other elections and referenda.  It is good to take the opportunity to reflect on our electoral law at a time when there is no prospect of a presidential election.  Our esteemed President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, is performing admirably on behalf of Irish people, both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope my colleagues in this House will continue with the process of reforming our electoral legislation later this year or early next year.  It has been a difficult and tedious process to remedy some of the defects in our existing legislation and I am indebted to the staff of my Department, whose judgment in electoral matters is sound and whose expertise is good and to the Attorney General and others who have had an input in bringing forward this reforming Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be supporting the Second Reading of this Bill.  My initial reaction to it was of slight amusement. When I read the title, Presidential Elections Bill, 1993, my initial response was &ldquo;if it ain't broke don't fix it.  One of the few areas where we are functioning very effectively at present is in relation to our Presidency.  Among all the urgent legislation that is so pressing &mdash; I refer the Minister to the list of legislation being requested by the Opposition every day on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> We now have presented to us, unheralded and unrequested, the Presidential Elections Bill, a Bill which I contend has no urgency.  The Minister put a brave face on justifying the fact that it is on the Order Paper today, that we are spending time debating this Bill and that it is included as part of his programme of reform of the electoral law which, he said, commenced last year. That is valid.  He is making a valiant effort to justify the priority given to this legislation, but I contend he is fooling no one, least of all the public, who are pressing us daily in relation to what they consider critical and urgent legislation, none of which has yet been published and most of which we hear very little about. This is filler legislation and can be called nothing else.  It is important in its own technical way, but no more or no less than that.  Even within the Department of the Environment &mdash; I know the Minister and the Minister of State will agree &mdash; there are other pieces of legislation which are far more pressing and far more urgent, but where are they?  What has happened to the legislation we have been promised for so long even from the Department of the Environment?  We are told there is a queue for getting material through the parliamentary draftsman; yet this Bill unrequested and unheralded, about which there is absolutely, no urgency can appear.  I wonder about the priorities of this Government if this legislation is considered to have a priority in 1993 when we are several years away from a Presidential Election, unless of course there is some hidden agenda we know nothing about.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the Constitution details to a great extent the fundamental principles in relation to the programme for the election of any President.  Legislation only complements the constitutional requirements and the Constitution leaves the detailed regulation of the election to the Statute Book or to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The biggest change is in relation to the location of the count from a national centre to individual and constituency counts.  There are a few questions I <Col N="802" /> should like to put, on the assumption that the Minister will reply to them at the conclusion of Second Stage.  It would appear that the slowest constituency in relation to the presidential count will now determine the time a count takes.  There are large disparities at present between constituencies and the time it takes to return the first and subsequent counts. Dublin Central, a three seat constituency, is famous for the speed with which it has its returns at election time. There are some five seater constituencies &mdash; dare I mention my neighbouring constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny?  &mdash; which have traditionally been very slow to make their returns.  In view of the change from a central counting depot to individual constituency count centres, I assume the speed of the count will be determined by the slowest constituency.  In areas such as Dublin Central, where on the last time round it took three hours to produce the first count, those involved in the count will be sitting, crossing their legs and drinking cups of coffee while Carlow-Kilkenny takes an extra seven hours, on average, to get their first count in.  Where is the efficiency in such a programme? Up to now the first count was held in all constituencies and announced.  Afterwards the ballot boxes were repacked and sent to the RDS in Dublin for completion of the presidential election count. There are inefficiences in that method, but at least the individual counters in each constituency involved in the first count can complete their business efficiently and go home.  We are creating problems for the constituencies by removing problems and lack of efficiency from a national count.  In a way it is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Has this legislation been thought through to the extent that it will be as efficient and effective as the Minister would have us believe?</P>
    <P>I am not sure, and would be pleased to hear from the Minister, whether the President should be a unifying force? Once we have elected a President we rally behind the President, regardless of our political affiliations or even if we have no particular affiliations.  Will there be individual constituency counts all over <Col N="803" /> the country particularly in the initial counts, where a President is not elected on the first count whether regional disparities are obvious?  If there is a candidate from Munster and a candidate based in Dublin there will certainly be regional disparities in the initial counts in terms of the preferences of the people in those areas.  I do not know whether that will make for a unifying force behind that President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>An exit poll.  Are we creating another problem in that area by allowing regional disparities to be highlighted by moving from a central national count to local constituency counts?  Certain sections of the Bill concern me.  I do not intend to delay the House unduly on Committee Stage and I have a feeling that we will not be bowled over with Deputies offering to speak tonight.  If you will allow me a little latitude, Sir, I should like to refer to section 49 (1) which states:</P>
      <P>After the ballot papers have been mixed in accordance with section 114 of the Act of 1992....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the point in mixing presidential election ballot papers?  The purpose of mixing ballot papers is to ensure that if a surplus arises there would be a genuine random distribution among the remaining candidates.  If we get to a surplus it means we have already reached the quota.  As we are electing only one President at any one time I consider it a waste of time to mix the ballot papers.  There is no point in mixing presidential election ballot papers because a surplus should never arise.  If more than one candidate is to be elected, ballot papers are mixed when the first has reached a surplus or, in the case of a deposit system, to ensure that the remaining candidates reach a certain percentage of the quota in order to have their deposit returned.  I am unaware of a deposit system operating in relation to presidential candidates and I do not see any need to worry about a <Col N="804" /> surplus.  Once a surplus has been reached, the quota has been reached and the President is deemed elected.  Section 49 (1) appears to be a nonsense.  I say this on Second Stage without having given too much thought to the Bill.  If there are any more such anomalies I would ask that the Minister rectify them rather than waste the time of the House in amending legislation which does not make a whole lot of sense.  They will not do very much harm.  If they wish to mix the ballot papers let them do so, but where is the point in wasting our time this June evening talking about mixing presidential election ballot papers when we are going to elect only one candidate and no candidate has to put down a deposit, so that the issue of the return of the deposit does not arise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it will be a bit like the European elections where we will elect a panel in the event of some one resigning or retiring or going to greener pastures &mdash; wherever that might be &mdash; from Áras an Uachtaráin.  I give that as an example of my slight lack of comprehension of what this legislation is all about.  Has this legislation been thought through to the extent it should?</P>
      <P>Some technical matters are tidied up in this Bill and they are particularly welcome. I welcome the provision for allowing poll clerks and other election staff the right to cast their vote in a Presidential Election.  This anomaly was very apparent at the last presidential election.  We had rectified this problem in relation to general elections and local elections for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, up to now staff involved in presidential elections were denied the democratic right to cast their vote other than at their listed polling booth on the register of electors.  Many loyal election staff will welcome the technical change to bring presidential elections into line with all other elections.  I am not sure if this applies to referenda but I believe I am correct in stating that this is the case in all other elections.  In all general and <Col N="805" /> local elections, staff have the right to vote at a booth other than the one listed on the electoral register.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, it will not be necessary to introduce a statutory procedure to question the result of a presidential election. However, for natural justice reasons it is only fair that such an event should be provided for and I have no quibble with the procedure outlined by the Minister. The changes in relation to the nomination of candidates appear minor and technical and, again, I have no problem with the Minister's proposals.  I hope we are never put in the position to test the procedures relating to the death of a presidential candidate, but it makes sense to provide for such an eventuality.  Given the constitutional nature of the position of President, it is proper that we should tidy up any areas of ambiguity in relation to presidential elections.  I welcome the proposals in regard to the nomination procedure for such elections.</P>
    <P>I will not be opposing Second Stage of the Bill.  However, I consider this legislation a space filler and evidence of the lack of legislation being introduced by this Government.  We are now almost into July.  In its first few months in office, the Government might have had some justification for saying it required time to settle in but I do not know what type of defence Ministers can give for the serious lack of legislation at this late stage in the year.  Will the Minister explain the difficulty I raised in regard to section 49?  Perhaps there is a simple reason for mixing votes that may have escaped me in my initial reading of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill but it is a question, as I said, of &ldquo;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo;.  I suppose we need something to talk about and this technical, relatively straightforward Bill was first off the parliamentary draftsman's desk or computer.  I would like evidence that more serious legislation dealing with problems as perceived by the public will be put on the Order Paper. It would be difficult to justify to my constituents in Wexford or, indeed, to people anywhere in Ireland, why at this stage in the year we are spending scarce Dáil time debating a presidential elections <Col N="806" /> Bill.  Perhaps the Minister might like to do that.</P>

      <P>While I have mixed feelings about the Bill, I welcome it in principle because it updates and regularises the procedure for presidential elections. However, I would like to raise a number of points in regard to its introduction at this time.  Given that there may not be a presidential election for at least five years it is inappropriate to be occupying Dáil time with this Bill when so much other important legislation is outstanding.  This Bill has been introduced as a space filler from a Government that has not got much commitment to the programme of legislative reform it promised last November.</P>

      <P>Instead of introducing badly needed and worthwhile legislation the Government has opted for this time filler.  This is another example of the cynicism of this Government in believing that merely saying something is enough.  That is not true and the Government would be well advised to remember that.  There is no evidence of a radical legislative programme. Indeed, vital Dáil legislation is <Col N="807" /> being delayed while this type of legislation is placed at the top of the agenda. This is a Government which has lost its way.  I will remind the Minister of some of the matters that should be at the top of the agenda but on which there is no real evidence of action as yet.</P>

We could debate any of those matters this evening if they were put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a piece of electoral housekeeping. There is no evidence of a change in policy or administration because it merely concentrates on bringing the legislation up to date.  I am glad to have this opportunity to remark on the remedy of obvious defects as outlined by the Minister earlier.  I agree with Deputy Doyle's point in regard to authorisation to allow election staff to vote at a polling station other than the one listed on the register.  During the last presidential election a number of election staff were disappointed they could not vote for their chosen candidate.  I am glad that matter has been remedied.  Other aspects could have been considered in the Bill.  A presidential election would provide an ideal opportunity to introduce Sunday voting which would be more desirable than the present arrangement for many reasons, <Col N="808" /> including the number of working days lost, the number of schools and community centres which must close and the need for people to travel to cast their vote.  That matter should be examined in the future because we should follow the example of our European partners and strive to ensure minimum disruption during an election.</P>
    <P>Apropos the nomination of candidates to the presidency, it is evident that unfortunately the Presidency of Ireland, while not meant to be a political position, has become in some ways politicised.  I am not referring in any way to our current President in that regard, but to the method of nomination to that office.  At present, without the substantial support and patronage of a political party it is practically impossible to secure a nomination to the presidency.  While realising the constraints placed on us by our Constitution, there is a case for having a nominating procedure whereby on foot of, say, 30,000 signatures of support, a person could be nominated to the presidency. The provision whereby the signatures of 20 Members of the Oireachtas entitles a person to a nomination should be reduced to ten.  That would be a fairer number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>A Progressive Democrats Member might then be a candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We could definitely have a Progressive Democrats candidate then. I would not like to see the role of the President politicised and, therefore, we should have a wider nominating procedure than is the case at present.  By making access to the Presidency more open and giving people an opportunity to stand as candidates, the Presidency would truly reflect the nature of the people.  We should ask ourselves what the Presidency is supposed to symbolise. The magnificent work being done by our President, Mary Robinson, has ensured a much higher profile and respect for the Presidency than existed in previous years.  That is because of the actions of one person rather than a change of attitude towards the Presidency in terms of our political culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> Accessibility is the key to the successful reform of electoral procedures in all their manifestations.  Our party certainly is committed to reform of the procedures relating to, for example, postal voting in all elections.  Nobody should be hindered from casting their vote.  Perhaps we should look at a wider use of the postal vote, to extending the remit of that to ensure that the maximum number of people can cast their vote.  I am not suggesting a solution here, but saying we should examine the subject in greater depth.  If somebody is unable to cast their vote because of work commitments, is there any reason, if they show genuine cause, they cannot be allowed a postal vote?</P>
    <P>This is an electoral housekeeping Bill. There is nothing controversial in it and I certainly would not hold up the House by maintaining that there is.  It does, however, afford us the opportunity to examine some things that might not be directly related to the housekeeping nature of this Bill but which should, nevertheless, be put on the agenda. There may be room to look again at procedures for nominating a presidential candidate.  The Minister did go through the defects that are being remedied in this Bill and there is nothing controversial in the remedies put forward.  I have no hesitation in supporting any of them.  I take the point that was made about the slowness of the voting procedures.  I expect that the procedural practice will be speeded up to a greater extent by having the vote within the constituency; I have no problem with that.</P>
    <P>My main difficulty with this Bill is the fact that it is taking up the time of the House.  I do not believe it should take up time because there is nothing controversial about it.  Perhaps there might be some minor amendments on Committee Stage which would make it a better Bill.  As a Bill it presents no problems and I am happy to support it on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of electoral reform and I am always pleased when I see electoral legislation <Col N="810" /> brought before the Dáil.  This legislation is non-contentious.  We have not had many opportunities, certainly in my voting life, to have a great deal of experience of presidential elections, but anybody who has any experience of such elections knows that there is much tidying up to be done from a technical point of view.  My party is certainly not opposing this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised to have this legislation before us.  In our country 300,000 people are out of work and there are huge crises in most of the State organisations, crises in housing, problems in regard to tax, social welfare, family law and so on.  Members come in here every week and ask Ministers questions on a whole range of issues and when legislation relating to these issues will be brought forward.  To what does the Government give priority?  It gives priority to legislation relating to an election which is not due to be held again for another four and a half years.  There is nothing that could more clearly demonstrate the legislative bankruptcy of this Government than that we have this Presidential Elections Bill before us as the most important and urgent business for us to deal with in the last two or three weeks before the Dáil goes into recess.</P>
      <P>I recall that when Deputy De Rossa moved a motion in this House only a few weeks ago urging on the Government the holding of by-elections that are overdue, the Taoiseach replied that it would disrupt the important legislative work of the Dáil.  He said there was so much important legislative work to be got through here that to hold the overdue by-elections in Dublin South-Central and Mayo West would cause political disruption and upset the legislative work of the House.  How can the Government delay holding elections that are overdue and yet find time to introduce legislation for an election that is not due to be held for another four and a half years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government is serious about electoral reform, the first thing it should do is hold elections when they are due. There are two vacancies in this House which have existed for almost six months <Col N="811" /> now and this Government, for nothing short of political cowardice and opportunism, is running away from them, refusing to give the voters of Dublin South-Central and Mayo West their entitlement to fill the seats that are vacant and an opportunity to give a verdict on the Government's appalling performance since it came into office six months ago. It would fit the Government better to bring a motion before this House moving the writ for the by-elections than this legislative filling in that we have this afternoon.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of overdue elections, the Minister for the Environment could have introduced legislation which would have far more relevance to electoral reform.  That is the legislation dealing with the reorganisation of local government.  At the municipal authorities conference some months ago the Minister of State announced that elections to urban councils and town commissioners were to be held next June. That is very welcome.  The only problem is that the last time the people of those towns had an opportunity of voting for their representatives was nine years ago. Successive Governments have postponed the holding of those elections on the basis that there was to be local government reform.  It seems that we are no closer to that reform now than we were four years ago when the first postponement was announced because the legislation which was supposed to be introduced to deal, for example, with the question of local authority boundaries and so on has now been referred to yet another one of the Government's sub-committees.</P>
    <P>The Government has so many things being dealt with in committee that it is in danger of meeting itself turning around. I wonder where Government Ministers can find the time to attend all the meetings of the sub-committees that are dealing now with important matters.  We have sub-committees on local government reform, sub-committees on Aer Lingus, a review committee on Aer Lingus and on the telephone charges.  This is indeed Government by committee.  The problem <Col N="812" /> is that we never seem to hear the outcome of the deliberations of any of these committees. While I welcome what the Bill contains, I am certainly most critical of the fact that the Government is elevating this rather technical legislation by bringing it before the House within weeks of the recess even though there is no presidential election due for a long time.</P>
    <P>We have an outstanding President who has brought a sense of pride to the Irish people and who has had such a positive impact throughout the world.  However, there is an obligation on the Oireachtas to periodically review the procedures for the nomination and election of the President. There is a particular need to look at the procedures for nominating candidates for the Presidency which are unnecessarily restrictive and which effectively reserve the power to nominate presidential candidates to the larger political parties in the Dáil.  Because of these restrictive procedures there was no electoral contest for the Presidency between 1973 and 1990.  The people were denied any say in the matter and in 1974, 1976 and 1983 the decision as to who should hold the office of President of Ireland was decided by agreement essentially between the two largest parties in this House.</P>
    <P>The procedures for nominating candidates were set under the 1937 Act and have remained unchanged since that time.  I regret the Government has not used the opportunity presented by the introduction of this legislation to reconsider the matter in a more comprehensive way.  As the law stands, a candidate for the Presidency requires the nomination of 20 Members of the Oireachtas or, alternatively, the nomination of at least four county councils or corporations.  The reality of political life is that the larger political parties dominate the Dáil and local authorities.  The office of President is supposed to be above party politics, so why should the power to nominate be restricted to political parties?  Why should the choice put before the people be so restrictive?</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible for an independent candiate or candidate of a smaller <Col N="813" /> party to secure a nomination, as was the case when the former Senator, Carmencita Hederman, sought a nomination in 1990.  Why should there not be, as there is in many other countries, a procedure whereby a certain number of ordinary citizens can nominate a candidate? The number required for nomination would be a matter for discussion. It would need to be high enough to discourage frivolous candidates but should not be so high as to make the task impossible. It might be the case that people nominated in this way would never win a presidential election, but that is not the issue.  The people should have the widest possible choice of candidates from whom to select.</P>
    <P>Such procedure would be more in keeping with the way in which the Presidency is developing, in that it is becoming an office with which the people identify closely.  In the past few years the Presidency has become very much a people's Presidency.  In keeping with that development, which I very much welcome, the power to nominate should be widened. In general, people should have the power to nominate a candidate for the Presidency. If that were to happen it might have the desirable effect of taking out of contest for the Presidency some of the strong party political content which has tended to creep into presidential elections.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over some of the more celebrated cases of hyperbole which arose in the course of the last presidential election.  It is regrettable that Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Deputy Stagg, has stepped out of the House because I wished to remind him of the way in which he was implicated, rather unfairly, in the course of the presidential election in 1990.  The former Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Brennan, admittedly close to polling day &mdash; and I suppose people may be forgiven for what they say close to polling day &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>It is already clear that if Mrs. Robinson were to be elected on Wednesday, this would be claimed by <Col N="814" /> Labour and The Workers' Party as a great victory for the Left.  Emmet Stagg, the Labour Deputy for Kildare, has already issued a call to the people to elect Ireland's first socialist President. It would substantiate the claim made by Eoghan Harris, now one of Mrs. Robinson's principal media advisers, in <i>In Dublin</i> magazine in January 1988: [in which he stated] &ldquo;The Workers' Party continues its steady march to the mansions of the national bourgeoisie.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is to the eternal credit of the victor in that election that the needle which tended to creep into the electoral contest, close to polling day, was very quickly removed.  The President has the acceptance of the public, irrespective of political persuasion, and has elevated the Presidency above the level of politics. Fine Gael was not entirely remiss in that Deputy Jim Mitchell stated that Mrs. Robinson represented the acceptable face of socialism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of presidential elections to which I wish to refer is the provision that candidates for the Presidency must be aged 35 or over.  This may have seemed a reasonable proposition to the drafters of the Constitution <Col N="815" /> in 1937.  It was a period when women had only recently been given the vote, when the local government franchise was still restricted to property owners and when the general vote was only given to those over 21 but what possible relevance does this restriction have as we approach the 21st century?  What is the relevance of the age of 35?  What qualities does a person have at 35 that he or she does not have at 34?  The age restriction on the election of candidates to the presidency is a relic of another era and it should be removed.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that provisions relating to the nomination of candidates for the Presidency are enshrined in the Constitution and cannot be changed solely by legislation.  I am not suggesting that we should hold a special referendum on those issues.  However, on the next occasion a constitutional referendum is held &mdash; the Taoiseach today promised a referendum on divorce in June 1994 in conjunction with the European elections &mdash; the opportunity might be used to remove some of the constitutional restrictions regarding the nomination of candidates for the Presidency and the archaic age restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter to which I intend to return on Committee Stage is the right of emigrants to vote in presidential elections. Despite all the debates we had during the past few years on giving emigrants, particularly recent emigrants, the right to vote in Dáil, presidential and European elections, the matter has been put on the backburner.  It has disappeared into one of the Government's committees.  We are told there are constitutional problems associated with giving emigrants the right to vote, but I am advised that is not the case, particularly in respect of recent emigrants.  As the President has succeeded in recent years in presenting the office of President as a symbol of and a unifying force for the wider Irish family, including emigrants, it is appropriate that they be entitled to vote in presidential elections.  It is not sufficient to invite our emigrants to look at the candle in the window of Áras an Uachtaráin.  It is time <Col N="816" /> this House gave our emigrants a say in the hand that lights the candle by giving them a vote in presidential elections.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the issue of giving voting rights to emigrants was introduced by way of Private Members' Bill, by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan of the Labour Party.  It had support from a wide cross-section of the House.  It is time this issue was raised again and I intend to reintroduce it on Committee Stage.  The issue of voting rights for our emigrants is an important one, not only from the point of view of electoral reform but also as regards the preception of emigrants.  There is no more appropriate way of enhancing this perception than by under this legislation dealing with presidential elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> The Opposition Deputies who have spoken have tried without much success to use this Bill to highlight the deficiencies which they allege exist in other areas of legislation.  It is an overstatement to attach such a important function to this Bill.  Work on this legislation is now completed and is before the House for consideration. The fact that it is being introduced is welcome because it is often the case in relation to elections that these issues are put on the long finger and no matter how long it may seem between one election and the next, the time for an election can be upon us very quickly. Reforms which people state must be made are overlooked and the same problems arise a number of years after they have been identified.  From that point of view, I welcome the introduction of this legislation at an early stage in the term of this Dáil and I am confident it can be disposed of appropriately as befitting legislation which governs the highest office in the State, that of the President, an office which, as has been acknowledged by all Members, has been enhanced in recent years by the current incumbent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that the laws in relation to the governing of presidential elections should be brought into line with those <Col N="817" /> governing Dáil elections.  Particularly welcome is the provision for all stages of the count to take place in the constituency. The present arrangement whereby only the first count is carried out in the constituency is cumbersome and a waste of time.  For example, in the last presidential election the result was not declared until almost two days after the poll had been taken.  Under this legislation all stages of the count can be carried out in the constituency and the results sent by fax to the presidential election returning officer.  It is appropriate and timely that the use of telecommunications is being recognised in the running of elections and I look forward to the extension of its use to other areas of elections also.</P>
    <P>As somebody who was very much involved in working at local level in the last election I saw a practical problem arise which caused great inconvenience and this Bill will eliminate it.  In the last election presiding officers and polling clerks found the were forbidden to transfer their votes to the polling satation in which they were working on the day of the presidential election.  This facility is already permitted in Dáil elections and it is appropriate that the anomaly is now being addressed through the present Bill. I look forward to this measure being implemented and I welcome the fact that the reforms which have been made for Dáil elections in relation to special voting by disabled electors and the elimination of the intimidation that existed outside polling stations are now being extended to presidential elections also.</P>
    <P>The changes include an important adjustment to nomination procedures. At the moment Oireachtas Members who sign papers for more than one candidate cause papers other than the first nomination paper to be disregarded.  Under this legislation the signature on any later papers would be disregarded but without prejudice to any other signatures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in the Bill to introduce a procedure for the questioning of the result of a presidential election by petition to the High Court.  This procedure exists already in Dáil elections but <Col N="818" /> at present a presidential election candidate who questions the ruling of the presidential returning officer on the validity of a nomination or in relation to the qualification of another candidate must appeal to a special judicial tribunal.  This Bill allows for an appeal to the High Court.  It clarifies the roles of the returing officer and the President of the High Court.  The returning officer must have regard to the opinion of the President of the High Court on any matters referred to him or her.  The importance of this measure may not seem apparent but the House will recall the last European elections when my colleague, Deputy Bell, appealed unsuccessfully the outcome of the Leinster constituency election.  It is important that this facility be extended to the presidential election.  One may say that it will never be used but one never knows when its use may be necessitated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various other measures which consolidate legislation in relation to presidential elections and which bring it in line with the Dáil position.  However, I look forward to a continuing review of electoral practice and electoral legislation not only concerning presidential elections but also Dáil, European and local elections, as well as referenda.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been made regarding the updating of registers but with the use of modern technology this facility can be improved even further. Improvements can be made in the procedure adopted at counts and also in the location of counts.  I realise the count is the end result of the process but if those who have worked during an election and who are interested in the concerns of the candidates cannot expect minimum levels of comfort and accommodation perhaps legislation needs to be introduced to ensure that such minimum standards are provided.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made concerning the extension of the franchise to emigrants.  I would remind the House that this is clearly set out as an objective to be achieved in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I am confident that this will be achieved.  We must not overstate the importance of this legislation <Col N="819" /> but we should not understate it either.  It is welcome legislation, part of a programme of electoral reform and I commend the Minister on its introduction. I urge its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keogh raised the question of Sunday voting.  There is no restriction on Sunday voting now.  The Electoral Act, 1992, covers that point.  It is not clear that that would be a better time for some people to vote.  As the Deputy is aware, there were objections to that from minority Churches here on the last occasion when opinions were sought.  We would like to refer to all concerned.  Many other countries follow the same pattern.  It is not that we are dogmatic or certain that we are right, but that has been the practice up to now.  If opportunities arise in which a matter may be discussed in that context we would like to have a degree of consensus among all the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the parties in Government for their future to fulfil their election commitments to improvement in higher education grants and calls on the Government to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  adopt the Fine Gael proposals <Col N="821" /> to allow tax-free allowances to parents and guardians of students who do not qualify for grants and</P>

    <P>The Labour Party promise, as encapsulated in the title of its election document, <i>A Two Part Programme to Put Justice into Economics and Trust into Politics,</i> must rank as one of the most brazen, trumped-up promises in the history of politics.  I will refrain from going into detail about justice in regard to the 1 per cent income levy, the trebling of telephone charges, the tax amnesty for the super rich and the fact that a blind eye is being turned to scandals that came to light since the Labour Party went into Government with Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I intend to confine my remarks to that segment of society, the PAYE sector, who pays for everything, from whom 48p in every pound is snatched from their wages before they even see it, who pay their PRSI and get no exemption or waiver from service charges, who do not have a medical card and do not qualify for footwear and clothing allowances, who must pay up to £1,000 per annum to the VHI for health cover and for whom there are no breaks, concessions or amnesties.  These are the people who have to scrape money together for a holiday and even then very often it is only at two, three or four year intervals.  These people watch the provocative and sickening spectacle of an elite golden circle controlling, abusing and misusing much of the wealth of the country because they have the capacity to move money around in banks, institutions and stock exchanges inside and outside the country as if that money represented chips and gambling hall tables, while the real productive skills of the ordinary workers are undervalued and underpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> The PAYE sector have to cling by their fingernails to keep body and soul together.  They cannot get a higher education grant to send their children to university, regional technical colleges or colleges of technology.  Many of these people turned to the Labour Party on the basis of the Labour leader's assurances in the preamble to the Labour Party manifesto which stated: &ldquo;Our priorities are children and people with disability&rdquo;. We have seen how the clear promise to provide in 1993 an additional £25 million for people with disability has been shamefully reneged upon, with less than one-third of the figures promised being delivered.  People believed the Labour Party when they stated in this document and in full page advertisements in newspapers that: &ldquo;Access to third level education is becoming increasingly vital and increasingly unequal&rdquo;.  That is a truly valid and accurate diagnosis.  The document went on to state: &ldquo;Labour proposes to work towards a position where the income limit for higher education grants is based on net income rather than gross income&rdquo;.  That is a clear policy statement that struck a chord with the people.  The age old grievance that all entitlements are based on one's topline wage rather than on take home pay was going to be corrected, at least in terms of college grants.  That was a very good prototype on which to test the new system.</P>
    <P>Fiann Fáil, not to be outsmarted, outdone or out-trumped, promised not to increase grants, increase thresholds or introduce net income assessments, but &mdash; in full banner headlines &mdash; said they would provide free third level education. Yet when I reminded the Minister for Education in her first Question Time in the House of her party's election promise I was told by her on 11 March 1993: &ldquo;I am not sure that a change from an assessment of gross income as distinct from net income would make the scheme any fairer&rdquo;.  The Minister went on to state in the same debate: &ldquo;This raises the question as to what is meant by net income&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in a very powerful position as chairperson of the Labour Party for the past number of years and <Col N="823" /> presumably she had a major part in the drafting of this document: <i>Making Ireland Work: Putting Trust Back into Politics.</i> She certainly would have chaired the session that gave this commitment on net income the final <i>imprimatur</i> before it went to print and was made public.  Yet within three months she backed away from a clear unequivocal commitment about which some weeks previously there was no doubt about which there was no ifs, buts or maybes.</P>
    <P>Time and time again during the course of the election campaign the Labour Party leader and spokespersons who were questioned on the various elements and aspects of the programme told the public and the media that it was thoroughly researched, that it had been accurately costed and would be delivered in full.  Yet a centre plank of the so-called quest on the part of the Labour Party, a specific measure in their programme and manifesto which was supposed to redress one aspect of a glaring education anomaly and inequality, is now discarded under the guise of another jaded review which is being carried out by some group or committee within the Department.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, particularly in the last three years, highlighted time and again the plight of families who try to get their children into and through third level college. My colleague, Deputy Therese Ahearn, produced a detailed document showing that the guidelines in regard to higher education grants are always deliberately pitched at a level which excludes the majority of PAYE workers and their families.  When the then Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, implemented the measure announced by his predecessor, Deputy Noel Davern, to means test European Social Fund grants, the only refuge of many PAYE families, Fine Gael resisted that measure by way of a Private Members' motion on 18-19 February 1992 and forced a vote on the issue. Deputy Brian O'Shea, as Labour spokesperson, strongly supported the motion, crying about the injustice and travesty of what was happening.</P>
    <P>In the recent general election Fine <Col N="824" /> Gael decided to stay out of the Dutch auction that ensued between Labour and Fianna Fáil, recognising that the higher education grants scheme is fundamentally flawed and that no matter how it is tinkered with, the warts and anomalies will remain.  Fine Gael proposed a clear, simple, effective approach &mdash; the granting of a tax free allowance to each family in respect of each child in third level education who does not qualify for the higher education grant.  The allowance, which would become effective in the current tax year, was to give real relief.  At present the maximum grant for fees is £2,000 and, for maintenance, £1,461.  The Fine Gael proposal contained in our election programme and now before this House is that if a student's course fees are costed at a maximum of £2,000 and if this amount is then allowed by way of a tax free allowance, together with the tax free allowance of £1,461, which is the equivalent of the value of the maintenance grant, for somebody without a grant this will give a tax allowance of £3,641 or an actual saving of 48p in the £ or £1,661 per annum or £31 per week.  The amount of the tax free allowance would be scaled down then depending on the fees payable for the course and on whether the student was already getting a partial grant.  In essence, the family would qualify for a graduated tax free allowance for each child not getting a grant or only a partial grant.  This would replace the covenant scheme which can apply only to one child, or if distributed among a number of children can only be to a maximum of 5 per cent of the family gross income.  To the bulk of PAYE families who do not get higher education grants and who have no hope of getting higher education grants, this £31 per week per child would make the crucial difference.</P>
    <P>This week, 63,300 young people are sitting their leaving certificate examination and 55,000 of them have applied through the CAO and the CAS office for entry to higher education.  For those who do not qualify for a grant there will be no college, no education and no future.  If one set out to trawl the administrative <Col N="825" /> jumble of this country for an unfair, an unjust and inequitable system one would need to look no further than the higher education grants that operate for universities. The scheme is based on gross income, which is irrelevant.  The thresholds are ridiculously low.  The joint earnings of both the husband and wife are taken into account and nothing is allowed for living costs, medical costs, a mortgage or other necessities.  Despite improvements in the scheme, 40,000 higher education students did not get any grant in 1992 or 1993.  These 40,000 lower or middle income families are automatically debarred because every penny of their income is up front.  In effect, none of the 50,000 teachers, the bulk of civil servants, no gardaí or nurses and the majority of our industrial and service workers need even apply for third level grants.  They should save themselves the frustration because they do not have the remotest chance of qualifying.</P>
    <P>The 1992 higher education grants scheme increased the thresholds for fees and maintenance to £15,000 for a husband and wife with three dependent children. This was announced with banner headlines by Deputy Brennan at the time and it was a matter of hours before a Fine Gael motion was tabled in the House before the last election.  If a husband and wife with three children earn one penny more than £15,000 they begin to lose out.  Great play was made of the fact that the increase would alleviate the burden for a lot of families.</P>
    <P>Before jumping in ecstasy we should seriously consider the family earning £15,000 per annum.  We can assume that the family will have a mortgage of £40,000.  One certainly will not get a lavish house for £40,000 in any reasonable location nowadays.  Nothwithstanding the welcome recent downward trend in interest rates the family will have a £5,000 mortgage repayment per annum.  A mortgage of £5,000 plus a payment of £2,582 income tax, plus the 1 per cent income levy of £150, plus PRSI at 7.75 per cent, which comes to £1,162 whittles the £15,000 per annum to £117 per week or £6,106 per annum.  A family <Col N="826" /> comprising a husband, wife and three children getting a princely income of £117 per week to pay for food, clothing, electricity, service charges, health insurance and so on simply cannot survive.  There is no need to mention that the family car will be long gone, if it ever existed in the first place.  Do the Government, the Minister and her party not realise that one cannot live with any dignity on £117 per week let alone subsidise university fees or regional technical college fees for a child?  Do they not care?  The Minister can argue that there is a sliding scale depending on the number of children but despite that, the inherent snares and thresholds debar people because the income limits are so restrictive.</P>
    <P>In September 1992 the Union of Students in Ireland gave a detailed breakdown of the costs for students living away from home and the cost for students living at home in Dublin.  The costs for students away from home, taking into account rent, food, electricity, fuel, city travel, travel home, books, equipment, stationery, personal maintenance and college food and entertainment came to a conservative £4,000 per annum.  Even the cheapest college fees will bring that cost up to £5,500 per annum,.  The maintenance costs for students living at home in Dublin came to £2,248 and including modest fees the sum came to £3,800 per annum.  Yet, the son or daughter of somebody earning over £15,000 per annum begins to lose the grant.  What are the options for parents?  They simply cannot afford to pay the £5,000-plus out of their own income because total disposable income for the family comes to only £6,106.  The only option is to remortgage the family home and that perpetuates a vicious cycle of debt.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to deny a child access to third-level education altogether.  For the vast majority of middle income families, putting a child through third-level college nowadays is literally hell on earth. Massive sacrifices have to be made and one has to make do with the bare minimum. It is a case of putting the entire family's life and livelihood on hold throughout the period in question, at a <Col N="827" /> time when they are supposed to be enjoying life.  The position becomes intolerable if one has to maintain two or three children in college simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Despite all the assurances, all we have managed to extract from the Minister is a reply to the effect that a further review is under way, the results of which will be published shortly.  The days of reviews and re-examinations are over.  When Deputy Mary O'Rourke was Minister for Education, she was pressed from all sides of the House regarding the anomalies and inequities of our educational system and the fundamental need for its radical reform.  She told us that a review body, comprised of officials from her Department and the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Finance were reviewing the overall question of higher education grants and a report would be published in due course.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan did a solo run with the idea of a review body.  The current Minister is again reviewing the whole system and the overall data base.  The flaws, inequities and anomalies of the system are glaringly obvious and are known to everybody who has any interest in third-level education.  Nothing has changed fundamentally.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the first programme involving all of the social partners, promised action in this area but we did not get it.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> promised... &ldquo;the development of more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants.&rdquo;  As my figures this evening show, for a family in the £15,000 income category the changes are more cosmetic than real.  The Labour Party has welshed on the promise to base assessment on net rather than gross income.  The Programme for a Partnership Government promised greater equity and assistance to third-level education. The delivery of that promise has not taken place either.</P>
    <P>Students have the next two weeks to indicate a change in the precise courses for which they wish to opt.  The final choices for the various third-level institutions <Col N="828" /> must be made and no change will be permitted beyond that date.  Such choices are determined by the level of grant aid available to students.  People had anticipated that the Labour Party would deliver on their promises but they have failed to do so.  Even if the Minister publishes the results of the review within a reasonable period, if it is after that closing date it will be too late to enable students change their courses and direction. The whole system is most unfair and discriminatory.</P>
    <P>There is a major accommodation crisis in virtually all colleges.  For example, University College, Dublin had its &ldquo;house full&rdquo; sign up for a considerable period last year.  The position in University College, Cork was extremely difficult due to gross overcrowding. Students had to attend classes in the corridors of the regional technical college in Galway.  All the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology in this city are bursting at the seams.  The Minister officially opened the regional technical college in Tallaght since her appointment.  Despite the fact that it is in its first year of operation, additional buildings will be required in 1994.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on entry to faculties such as veterinary medicine, dentistry, law, pharmacy, ophthalmic optics and so on mean that many students who would normally have the necessary points to gain entry are caught in a dilemma.  The only option remaining for many students, if they want to undertake courses of study for which they have the requisite abilities and aptitudes, is to take the emigrant plane or ship to the universities and colleges of the United Kingdom.  The number of Irish students attending universities in the United Kingdom is estimated to be in excess of 4,000.  Irish students are to be found virtually on every campus from Aberdeen to Oxford. Their fees are paid by the host Government. Many find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to fund their own maintenance costs.  Some months ago a British television programme caused considerable anxiety by graphically illustrating the impoverished existence of <Col N="829" /> many Irish students endeavouring to maintain themselves in British universities in the absence of financial support from our authorities.  If the British Government, or other EC countries, are paying the fees of our students and hosting them in their colleges and universities, the very least we might do is consider extending the maintenance element of the higher education grants to them.  It is ridiculous that we have students at Queen's University, Belfast, the New University of Ulster and Magee College in Derry whose fees are being paid by the British Government, yet we cannot find, within our existing resources, a penny piece to subsidise these students who are being awarded top level educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>The time for action has arrived.  This is a clear, short term, prescriptive measure, but £31 per week would make all the difference between getting somebody to college and leaving them in a dole queue.</P>
    <P>With your permission and that of the House, a Cheann Comhairle, I should like to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Browne.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister shares many of the sentiments we express. Unfortunately, while she may have a handbag she has not the purse of the <Col N="830" /> Minister for Finance and must persuade him to make the necessary resources available.  It is very important that we highlight our view of what is required for third-level education.  I am sure the Minister will accept many of our views but, of course, she is subject to budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to accept that in 1993 gross pay should constitute the criterion for eligibility for anything.  An income of £15,000 gross can be reduced to £6,000 net.  One can readily appreciate the difficulty presented.  It is extremely unfair to students that their parents' financial position should determine eligibility for higher education grants.  Some can be just above the limit and yet not qualify.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the Proclamation that we should cherish all the children of the nation equally.  I hope therefore that when the review body presents its findings it will argue that those students who want to enter university should not be deprived of the opportunity to do so because their parents' income is above the limit set down.  I do not mind if a person on a high income says that he is not prepared to make sacrifices but I know of a road worker in Carlow, who when another ganger was ill last year, was often asked to do extra duty, with the result that his income was above the limit when he applied for a grant for him daughter, who was an excellent student. Any politician in touch with reality would cry rather than give out about this matter.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I proposed that a brilliant student who perhaps gets four As should have an automatic right to free third-level education having regard to the contribution he or she could make to the nation at a later stage.  It is a scandal that a brilliant individual cannot obtain a grant because the parents' income is above the limit and they cannot afford to send him or her to university, whereas somebody with lower grades can enter university.  The concept of using gross salary will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Free third-level education for all was an election gimmick but it would make much sense, given that many anomalies <Col N="831" /> would be removed.  As things stand, students are under enough pressure to secure the points they need to pursue the courses they want to follow.  It is grossly unfair, having secured the points they need, that they cannot obtain a grant to attend university.  Even if they do get to university they may find themselves in financial difficulty, with the result that they may have to work at weekends at a time when work is not flathúil and people can take advantage of them.</P>
    <P>Universities in the North, where many of our students find places, provide free courses.  I was under the impression that we were providing maintenance grants in respect of courses followed in Northern Ireland.  If not, this is a sham given that there is much talk about a 32-county Ireland.  No maintenance grants are paid to students who follow courses in English universities.  Is it not amazing that universities in a foreign country provide free courses for our students while we do not care if they starve or prosper?  Why should the daughter of a taxpayer who has paid his or her tax here not receive a maintenance grant simply because she has decided to attend university in England where our students are received with open arms?  In addition their degrees are recognised throughout the world.  Is there not something wrong with a system under which maintenance grants are not paid to students who follow university courses in England?  As my colleague, Deputy Higgins, said we know what can happen there when students find that money is scarce.  I ask the Minister to see to it that the children of taxpayers here who are entitled to grants receive them even when they decide to go to England to attend university.  If they qualify for grants in respect of fees what constitutional impediment is there to paying them?  This is an outrageous anomaly and I hope the Minister, who is forward looking, will deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The position is made worse for those taxpayers who are paying through the nose and who have to pay for everything when they discover that others who are better off have obtained third-level <Col N="832" /> grants for their children.  On top of this they are not entitled to any relief in respect of fees paid.  If it is not possible to meet university fees or to provide maintenance grants for all, the least we should do is allow a tax concession.  I accept that the Minister has no responsibility in that area but it is up to her to represent our interests at the Cabinet table and argue that if it is not possible to provide grants for all we should allow a tax concession.  The State would get back approximately half.  Many people feel aggrieved, and insulted and that they are being completely ignored.  The PAYE taxpayer has been hit with the 1 per cent levy at a time when many of them are struggling.  Some have two or three children at university and have had to borrow or seek an overdraft from the banks with the result that untold hardship has been caused.  It is a tribute to the parents of Ireland that so many of them are prepared to make sacrifices to send their children to third-level.  It is a pity, given the state of the economy in many countries worldwide, that many are unable to get jobs despite their top class qualifications.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take this motion seriously.  It may appear that the Opposition is trying to wrong foot the Government but she will have to accept that the taxpayer who has to meet university fees is getting a raw deal.  The least we should do is allow them a tax concession in respect of the fees they have paid.  We can no longer justify sending our students abroad to attend university while standing back and saying that we do not care whether they sink or swim.  It is time we said that if a student is entitled to a grant in Ireland we will pay a maintenance grant if they decide to go abroad to attend university.  Indeed, it is doubtful as to whether there should be a limit in respect of those who go abroad given that they are not costing us as much as if they stayed at home.  If we cannot help them at home we should do everything possible to help them while they are abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: &ldquo;To <Col N="833" /> delete all words after `That' and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann commends the Government for its commitment to continuing improvement of the Higher Education Grants scheme and endorses its initiatives in the promotion of social justice and equity.&rdquo;'</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, to review recent student grant improvements and to outline current developments in regard to student support in the third-level education areas.  I begin by reiterating this Government's commitment, in accordance with the Programme for Government, to ensuring wider access to third-level education, including the continued improvement of the third-level student support schemes.</P>
      <P>Specifically, in relation to student support, the programme states:</P>
      <P>We anticipate that under the new structural funds extra resources will be available to assist with the cost of third level education.  On that basis, it is the Government's intention to ensure that these additional resources are used to widen the access of all students to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity.</P>
      <P>The promotion of social justice and equity will include continuing improvement of the higher education grants scheme to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his/her financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme was introduced a quarter of a century ago in 1968, following the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.  I should like to outline the dramatic changes which have taken place in third level education in the intervening 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1992-93 there are some 80,000 students in third-level education &mdash; more than treble the 1965 total of 21,000.  Current projections indicate that there will be over 100,000 students in third level <Col N="834" /> education by the turn of the century. These increases very much reflect the increasing proportion of the age group proceeding to third level education &mdash; 20 per cent in 1980, over 40 per cent last year and heading towards 50 per cent at the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>These students are being catered for in a diversity of institutions.  The universities continue to be the largest providers with almost 46,000 students.  The arrangement initiated by the Government with the universities in 1990 whereby the universities were to provide not less than an extra 3,600 undergradate places over a three-four year period is currently running above the annual target of 1,200 additional students.</P>
    <P>In the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, growth has been particularly dramatic.  In the period since 1980, wholetime student numbers in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology have risen from 10,500 to 31,000.  The new legislation for the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology which came into effect on 1 January last provides an important new legislative and developmental framework for those institutions.  Other colleges, including the Colleges of Education, the National College of Art and Design, Dun Laoghaire College of Art and Design and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland add a further 2,500 students to the total in third level education.</P>
    <P>In the case of the colleges of education, it became necessary in recent years to review the future of those institutions because of the downward trend in school enrolments and with the objective of optimising the use of facilities and resources.  Under legislation introduced a few years ago, Thomond College of Education was merged with the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 a new linkage is now in place between Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, and the University of Limerick.  As part of the joint development of a faculty of arts-humanities, 150 students were enrolled on a new University of Limerick BA degree in <Col N="835" /> Mary Immaculate College in autumn 1992.  When this new programme is fully operational in a few years time it is expected that there will be an extra 600 undergraduate students in Mary Immaculate College together with undergraduate teacher trainees.  Discussions on a similar linkage are currently taking place between St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and Dublin City University. I am hopeful that an agreement which will form the basis for collaboration between those two institutions in the provision of academic programmes will be reached in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that an important strategy to provide easier access for students to third level education has been simplification and co-ordination of entry procedures.  Since 1992 a fully co-ordinated joint Central Applications Office and Central Applications Service has been in operation.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure on education in 1993 amounts to 1.8 billion, representing approximately 19 per cent of Government expenditure.  This represents a very significant increase in the allocation of available resources to education compared with 1965 when the corresponding proportion was 13.2 per cent. These very positive indicators of progress highlight the commitment of successive Governments of the systematic expansion and development of our higher education sector and underline the willing co-operation that has been forthcoming from all higher education institutions in maximising the use of existing facilities and resources.</P>
    <P>The rapid expansion which has occurred in student numbers in recent years has been accompanied by significantly improved arrangements in the student support area.  A package of major improvements in the higher education grants scheme and related student support schemes was implemented in 1992. These improvements were quite rightly welcomed as very progressive measures by all sides in this House during the passage at this time last year of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) <Col N="836" /> Act, 1992, which gave effect to a number of the improvements for mature students.</P>
    <P>Assisting mature students to return to formal education, including third level education, had been identified as a key policy objective in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Education Green Paper.</P>
    <P>As a result of the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1992, two special provisions for mature students were put in place as from the 1992 student grants schemes. First, mature students who secure a place in third level institutions are automatically considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of grants.  Previously, under the law, they could not obtain a grant if they did not have a certain standard at the leaving certificate examination.  Second, mature students are now means tested for grants by reference to their own incomes and, if applicable, their spouses' incomes rather than on their parents' income which had been the case.  More than 800 mature students were awarded grants under the 1992 higher education grants scheme and the 1992 vocational education committee scholarships scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Act also enables us to accept other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination. This relates to school-leavers going on to third level education and is mainly directed towards the relatively small number of Irish nationals residing in Border areas and attending second level schools in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The principal improvement in 1992, and the one which was most widely welcomed as it affected the biggest number of people, was the substantial increase in income eligibility limits.  Now, for example, a family with one to three dependent children qualifies for a grant of full fees and maintenance on an income of £15,000 compared with the previous income limit of £10,787, and that was an increase of 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>There were other improvements in the 1992 schemes.  The income limit for families was increased by £2,000 for each additional child after the first child <Col N="837" /> attending third level education.  In other words, the income ceiling is £15,000 if a family has one child at third level and if a second child goes to third level the income ceiling becomes £17,000 and so on.  Income is now assessed for the year in which the student actually enters third level education and by reference to the income limits for that year; before 1992, income was assessed on a current year basis but by reference to the income limits for the year the student sat the leaving certificate examination.  In relation to giving support to people who need it most, this is a significant improvement because the family income is now assessed at the time the student is entering third level education.  Lone parents welfare payments under the lone parents allowance scheme are now excluded from the assessment of income, a very welcome development.  Maintenance grants were increased in line with consumer price index increases, and fee grants were increased in line with increases in third level fees, another welcome development. In order to further strengthen the equity and fairness of the income assessment process the Revenue Commissioners are, since 1992, involved in the process of income verification.  That is a fair improvement.</P>
    <P>Thus, there was a significant attempt in 1992 to broaden eligibility and to ensure fairness.  We must remember the original purpose of this is to ensure that (i) students in need of support are identified and provided with assistance to pursue third level studies, and (ii) Exchequer resources are thereby directed to those most in need.</P>
    <P>I think the impact of all those improvements is very clear if we look at the relevant statistics.  In the current academic year, nearly 46,000 students are in receipt of awards under the various student grants and scholarships schemes &mdash; compared to just over 12,000 students ten years ago in the 1982-83 academic year.  Overall, at present in the third level area well over half the total enrolment of 80,000 students are in receipt of student support by way of the various schemes &mdash; higher education grants, ESF grants, <Col N="838" /> vocational education committee and other scholarships &mdash; compared to a quarter of all students in 1982-83.  In financial terms, the total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State in this current year of 1993 is about £84 million compared to £75 million in 1992, which represents a 12 per cent increase in one year.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the higher education grants scheme to cover Irish students studying on recognised courses in EC countries.  I have to point out that this is essentially an issue of identifying what our priorities are for the use of scarce Exchequer resources in the area of third level student support.  I think our priority has to give financial assistance to students ordinarily resident in Ireland who because of family circumstances might not otherwise be in a position to proceed to third level education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have recently set up an expert advisory group &mdash; to which the Opposition Deputies have already referred &mdash; on third level student support.  It was set up specifically (a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes.  I have every confidence that the expert advisory group will make recommendations in those two areas.  In preparing its report the group is working closely with and drawing on the expertise of Department officials and has invited submissions, by way of public advertisement, from all interested parties. The group is meeting regularly and I will publish its report.</P>
    <P>My main reason for setting up this expert advisory group is that since I became Minister I have become aware that in spite of reforms introduced in 1992 &mdash; referred to already in this debate and on two previous occasions in the House &mdash; particular aspects of the various student grant schemes continue to be a source of dissatisfaction.  I have taken as <Col N="839" /> some points of reference specific difficulties Deputies' constituents have had regarding the application or payment of grants under the schemes.  I would be the first to agree with what has been said earlier about areas that are a source of dissatisfaction.  While I will continue to put on record the improvements that were made in 1992, an expert advisory group has been asked to examine the areas of dissatisfaction that have been spelled out in questions to the Minister for Education week after week.  One aspect was that of means testing and what were represented to me by various interests as perceived inequities.  The whole area of how eligibility on the grounds of means should be established for student support services is indeed a very complex one.  As Deputy Jim Higgins pointed out, we promised that we would work towards an equitable scheme.  I owe this not only to my colleagues in Government who made a commitment to a fairer assessment and easier access to third level education but to the students to whom Deputy Higgins referred.</P>
    <P>Another aspect was the organisational arrangements for the administration of the different schemes.  Currently, in addition to my Department, which oversees the operation of these schemes, there are three sets of agencies involved in delivering the third level grants system. Deputies are well aware of these three agencies.  The local authorities are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme. Anyone who has served on a local authority knows the workload this puts not only on the officials who administer this scheme but the workload this puts not only on the officials who administer this scheme but the heavy workload that local councillors carry on behalf of their constituents when the scheme is not administered satisfactorily.  The local authorities are the main source of distribution of third level grants.  The vocational education committees administer the vocational education committee scholarship scheme and carry out the <Col N="840" /> means testing for both that scheme and the ESF maintenance grants scheme, which is means tested since 1992.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology make the maintenance payments under the ESF maintenance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Thus there are three very different organisations responsible for ensuring that grants are administered to those how need them.  No more than when the entry forms that were required not so long ago for entry to third level were reformed into a much simpler system, I suggest there is certainly scope for a simpler, more streamlined and more efficient organisational arrangement for the delivery of services under these student support schemes.  This has been highlighted on many occasions.  It has been a constant theme in representations to me to the extent that I am well aware of the difficulties being encountered and the frustration being experienced by students and parents in particular.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the need for urgent action in this area.  Not only must the general terms and conditions of the schemes be improved but their actual delivery has also to be streamlined.  All would agree that we owe it to the students and the parents involved.  I am committed to major investments on this side of things but I would ask Deputies to bear with me and await the expert group's recommendations in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have called in experts who can deal with anomalies in the system.  However, I feel that major organisational changes may take some time to achieve.  For excample, the framework within which some changes would be developed might well be that of the forthcoming White Paper on Education.  These schemes have developed since 1965.  They are extremely complex as a result of having been frequently adapted to incorporate various improvements in scope and content. We are well on our way to ensuring that a streamlined, efficient method will be established to ensure that anomalies, which probably exist in the present scheme, will be ironed out but I need to await the advice of the expert group.  As <Col N="841" /> I have said before in the House, I will publish the group's findings and I will be prepared to consult with my colleagues, on all sides of the House, on whether the recommendations will ensure that the promise made in the Programme for Government on access to students to third level education in the interest of social justice and equity will be carried out.  The improvements introduced in 1992 together with the continuing increase in third level student numbers have led to a greatly increased number of applications.  This has brought increased pressure on the system, both centrally and locally.</P>
    <P>There is no question, therefore, of waving a magic wand &mdash; politicians are not given magic wands to wave &mdash; to produce streamlined procedures overnight. Every effort will be made to implement as many improvements as possible at the earliest possible date in the context of the 1993 schemes.</P>
    <P>As I wish to allow my colleague, Deputy Shortall, to contribute to the debate I will conclude.  I would like to assure the House, however, of the Government's continuing commitment to investment in third level education generally and to continuing and substantial improvements in the student support area.  I ask that colleagues on all sides of the House join with me in the discussions that will ensure following the publishing of the expert group's findings. I set up the group because I share the concerns which have been and will be expressed today and tomorrow from both sides of the House.  I am open to some of the suggestions which have already come from Members who have contributed to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time with me.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states that education is the key to the future prosperity of Ireland and to equality and equal opportunities for all our citizens.  It outlines clear priorities from pre-school education right through to university level.  Striding towards greater equity at the higher education <Col N="842" /> level is commendable and I welcome the efforts made by the current Minister in that respect.  However, as a primary school teacher and as a public representative for an area that comprises a couple of very large corporation estates I represent many people for whom the question of third level education never arises in the case of their children.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly that the Minister should aim for wider distribution of funds in education.  If greater funds were made available for pupils at the early stage of education it would bring about a fairer representation at second and third level education.  Providing funds for third level institutions, commendable and all as it is, means that in reality we are catering for the educational needs of a small percentage of the population.</P>
      <P>The funding of education needs to be approached in the most equitable way possible.  I urge the Minister to look at ways of putting the resources in from the bottom up, starting at the broad end of the population pyramid.  This would present wider education opportunities for all the children of the State.  Primary school years are crucial in the education of a child.  These years will dictate the level of participation in society he or she will aspire to and achieve.  There are aspects of primary education which require hands-on practical experience and, therefore, equipment also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crippling lack of financial support for schools often means that these aspects of the curriculum are neglected and sometimes completely ignored, but areas such as computer studies and environmental studies are not the only problems. Much more fundamental problems exist. There are primary school children and teachers working in cold and cramped conditions.  There are many schools which would fall into this category in my own constituency and, indeed, in the large urban areas in all cities throughout the country.  There are boards of management and parishes which are financially crippled in their attempts to meet fuel and insurance bills.  There are many primary school children in overcrowded classrooms and many primary school <Col N="843" /> buildings are substandard.  There are children who do not have access to physical education facilities.</P>
    <P>While I commend the Minister's work in the area of third level education, I urge her to take on board the points I have raised about primary education. The structure of third level education in Ireland has undergone great change in recent years and the Minister has referred to some of those changes.  During the past ten years the number entering third level education has doubled.  In spite of this, there is still an abysmally low level of participation in third level education by children from working-class families. Recent studies have shown that the participation rate from this group has decreased and is now less than 2 per cent. The best way to improve on the rate of participation is to provide the necessary supports to children in primary and secondary schools so that they remain in the system sufficiently long to have the option of third level education.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate and compliment the Fine Gael Party and their <Col N="844" /> spokesperson on Education for bringing this issue before us again this evening. There is no doubt that the funding of third level education will engage all our minds, tax all our energies and stretch our capacities in the years ahead.  It is important that we debate this issue from time to time in the House to ensure that we make the best possible use of the resources available at any given time. The issue of third level grants is crucial and there is an obligation on all of us to ensure that a fair, open, equitable and transparent system is available to all and that as far as possible no child with the ability and potential to benefit from third level education is precluded from so doing because of their parents' income. That must be our objective at all times.</P>
      <P>While I agree with everything that has been said by Deputy Higgins regarding the difficulties experienced by parents, I do not agree with the motion put forward by Fine Gael and my party and I will not be supporting it.  Accordingly, I want to read into the record an amendment which I would propose to the motion.  After the words &ldquo;Government to&rdquo; I would propose the substitution of the following:</P>
      <P>reform the third level grants scheme to ensure complete transparency and equity in its operation, taking into account the criteria for inclusion of wealth and assets in determinng income and eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party believes that while the problems identified by the Fine Gael Party must be exmained carefully, the route it has chosen, and the prescription it has put in place are not ones to which my party can give consent, and the reasons for that should be obvious to anyone who has noted our consistency in regard to reforming the tax system since our formation. We maintain that consistency, bearing in mind the people whom the Fine Gael Party claims it seeks to assist, namely the PAYE sector.  We would not consider the granting of tax concessions without limit to parents who are not otherwise grant aided as assisting the PAYE sector.  We certainly would not <Col N="845" /> consider it as making it easier for this or any future Government to reform the tax system in the manner in which we believe it ought to be reformed.  We believe also that the main beneficiaries of the reform we have in mind would be those whom it is said this motion seeks to help, those in the PAYE sector.  By putting forward this motion the Progressive Democrats Party is entirely consistent in its policies.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that the children of persons in the PAYE sector are seriously discriminated against under the present system.  It is clear to all of us that parents who engage in creative accounting, as it were, have in the past managed to establish eligibility for their children to third level education, and I am sure we have all seen evidence of that.  I have seen grant-aided students driving in big cars to the university in Cork city, cars much bigger than I can afford.  On the other hand, I have seen children of people in the PAYE sector &mdash; primary schoolteachers, nurses and gardaí &mdash; not even in a position to afford a bicycle to take them to college.  Clearly, there is something wrong with the manner in which the third level grant system has been administered in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the obligation that will be put on the Revenue Commissioners to verify income.  Since its formation as a party the Progressive Democrats has stated that when an application is made for a third level grant full account should be taken of wealth and assets that do not always find their way on to the balance sheet because of the clever manoeuvres of some accountant.  There have been serious inequities and injustices in the past in regard to third level grants and they must be rectified immediately.  A start has been made, but it is only a start. We are going down the correct road and if we continue down that route the student children of people in the PAYE sector, on whose behalf every brown penny has to be accounted for, will benefit.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats Party was in Government from July 1989 to November 1992 it sought continuously to bring about changes and improvements in the third level grants system, <Col N="846" /> and a number of those changes have been referred to in detail by the Minister this evening.  We included a provision to that effect in the July 1989 Programme for Government and insisted on renewing that commitment in the October 1991 programme.  That programme renewed our earlier commitment to reform the grants system to &ldquo;ensure greater social equity in the distribution of grants, and a fairer distribution of grants in terms of the occupational status of families&rdquo;.  In that programme we went on to ask the Government to make sure that equity and transparency in the operation of the third level grants scheme would be an important objective and that wealth and assets would have to be taken into account when determining income and eligibility for third level grants.  What the Progressive Democrats sought to bring about at all times and what we continue to strive for from the Opposition benches today is that every applicant would be treated fairly and equitably and that the discrimination against the PAYE sector and their student sons and daughters would be brought to an end.  Our proposal that all forms of income and wealth should be taken into account in determining eligibility would lead to a more effective, balanced and straightforward way of dealing with the issue than the manner prescribed by the Fine Gael Party in this motion.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we were successful in helping to have the overall income eligibility ceiling for third level grants raised, which resulted in a 21.5 per cent increase in the number of students eligible.  That, in turn, brought the number of qualifying students from a figure of approximately 15,200 to approximately 18,200.  That was a major step in the right direction and it is the road we must take.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out what has been achieved by bringing mature students within the ambit of eligibility.  That happened as a direct result of efforts made by my party, with Fianna Fáil, during the term of the previous Coalition Government. There are now more than 8,000 grant aided students in universities and <Col N="847" /> third level colleges who were not there before those improvements came into effect in 1992.  That has made a great difference particularly to a number of women I know.  Those women had the ability to benefit greatly from third level education but, for one reason or another, could not make it at the usual matriculation age of 17 or 18 and could never have made it if the grant system had not been extended to them.  That scheme represents a very valuable investment in people who have a great contribution to make to the well being and the welfare of this country.  I am very proud that that was brought about when my party was part of the Government.  I would see an extension of that as a major benefit to society and to people who have much to contribute to the welfare of this country.</P>
    <P>However, there is huge scope for improvement.  The main improvement I would like to see brought about is an annual raising of the ceiling on a phased basis.  Having begun in 1992 we should continue to raise the ceiling for eligibilty to bring more students from low or middle income families within the framework of eligibility for grants.  That is the direction in which I am asking the Minister to go, in addition to bringing about a greater element of fairness.  I know a number of parents in the PAYE sector who have had to remortgage their house in order to pay third level fees for their children.  These people are liable for everything and eligible for nothing.  That has been a feature of the past.  It must be remedied in the context of any improvements being contemplated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what the Minister's package of improvements will be.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to the heads of the universities and ask them to hold back on the proposed 8 per cent increase for the next academic year.  If that increase goes ahead it will mean that in two years there will have been a 16 per cent increase in fees.  That will be a powerful disincentive to parents on modest incomes and an overwhelming disincentive to families where there is <Col N="848" /> no great tradition for third level college attendance.  It is in this regard that we are seeking to redress the balance and the Minister has spoken about this on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>One of the great scandals here is that so many young people from certain family backgrounds have been precluded from availing of third level education in the past.  Children of middle income or so-called middle class families are 18 times more likely to go to third level education than children of lower income families. That means that the ability and experience of children from such backgrounds are excluded from third level colleges. These people have their own distinctive contribution to make to the overall benefit of this country and we must not continue to exclude them.  Any fee increase or any matriculation fee proposed by the universities for this year can only act as a disincentive to these people.  It is disgraceful that when the matriculation examination was abandoned last year that the NUI continued to charge the same fee as it did when the examination was in place.  It has now become a ghost fee for a process that is so simple; at the press of a button the NUI can get all the results it needs to determine eligibility for entry and yet it is continuing to charge the scale of fees it charged 60 or 70 years ago when a very small segment of privileged people went to university.  Third level education should no longer be the preserve of the affluent or the financially privileged.  It should be open to anybody who has the ability to benefit from it.  The Minister should again appeal to the NUI to abandon that fee.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement in regard to her plans for streamlining the delivery of third level grants. Anything that can be done to speed up the payment of grants would be welcome. In practice students go to college in October knowing they are eligible for grants, but they are compelled to put up part of their fees and make provision to buy their books because the grant is very often not paid until months after students register. That is a big fault in the system.  I appeal to the Minister to take all the steps open <Col N="849" /> to her to ensure that grants are paid to students who qualify and on whose behalf grants are approved.  They should have their grants on the day they register for third level education, not a month or two months later.  They should not have to borrow money to buy their books.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to thank Deputy Quill for sharing her time with me and giving me the opportunity to support the motion before the House.  I hope the Minister realises that Fine Gael pursued this issue with such a passion that we will not accept defeat on it.  Our record on the issue can stand up to scrutiny.  On every possible occasion Fine Gael put forward responsible motions to have equity injected into the third level grants system and with much success.  The Minister, and Deputy Quill, like to take credit for what was done by the last Government. However, there was little or no response from the Government to the inequities and inefficiencies in the system which gave students no possibility of achieving their potential by having a chance to pursue third level education. The only response from the Government came after I, with Deputy Jim Higgins, produced a policy document outlining reasonable and realistic proposals for changes in the third level education grants system.  We put forward six proposals for improvements in the third level education grants system and five of those were adopted by the Government.  The one that was not adopted is at the kernel of our motion tonight, that is, the giving of tax relief to people who are not in receipt of third level education grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I awaited with enthusiasm the response of the Minister to the motion tonight. What we got from her was a good historical background of the third level education system, information we all had anyway.  However, those who are hoping to be able to give their children the opportunity of third level education are not concerned with the historical background of the system.  The Minister detailed what the present system is but people are aware of that also.  They know it does not facilitate almost 50 per cent <Col N="850" /> of the students.  As the Minister stated, over 50 per cent of students are grant aided but one must not forget that almost 50 per cent of the students are not grant aided.</P>

      <P>The headlines in the local newspapers in County Tipperary in recent weeks make tragic reading.  A month ago there were banner headlines promising over 1,200 jobs for the former Digital plant in the town of Clonmel. However, last week the shock realisation that the company which was going to bring these jobs is instead locating in Scotland was highlighted and the bottom line is that it will be at least three months before there is any prospect of renewed investment interest by this company in this country.</P>
      <P>This is a tragic story.  It stems entirely from the disgraceful behaviour of the South Tipperary Deputy and Labour Chief Whip, Michael Ferris, who on 10 May last rushed into print on details of the promised 1,200 jobs and a £200 million investment for Clonmel.  He said that the company responsible was AST Research and, he asserted, &ldquo;a contract has been concluded&rdquo; between that company and the IDA for the project.  I quote that because within the past week, when it was clear that problems had arisen, Deputy Ferris claimed he had not said a contract was agreed between AST and IDA.  The facts, of course, are that on May 10 no contract was concluded between the IDA and the American company and that negotiations were at a very delicate stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that not <Col N="851" /> only was the IDA furious regarding the publication by Deputy Ferris of sensitive data in relation to this project, but the American company was also appalled. However, the real tragedy in so far as this country and the jobless of Clonmel and South Tipperary in particular are concerned, is that Deputy Ferris' mishandling of the issue alerted the Scottish Development Agency, the IRB in Northern Ireland and the Tandy computer company to the enormous investment potential that AST had.  It renewed its overtures to the Californian company, and the upshot now is that AST is not coming to Clonmel or to Ireland, but is instead investing in Kilbride in Scotland, where it has bought the Tandy computer plant and has purchased outright the Tandy company.  This has meant its calling off of its imminent plans to come to Ireland and a declaration that it will not be renewing any interest in this country for three months at least.  Of course, I hope it will be back in three months' time and I wish the IDA every success in trying to win investment in Ireland by AST.</P>
    <P>However, the bottom line is that whereas a month ago AST was poised to locate its European manufacturing base in Ireland, it is now doing this in Kilbride, Scotland.  The reason this abrupt turn-about has occurred is due to the irresponsible, misleading and premature disclosure of the matter by Deputy Ferris.  In short, Deputy Ferris has sabotaged a top class electronics operation promising over 1,200 jobs for the town of Clonmel and the company involved is instead commencing operations in Scotland.</P>
    <P>Even more culpable than Deputy Ferris, however, is the person responsible for leaking to him the highly secret, commercially sensitive and very restricted information which the Deputy sought to use for cheap political gain.</P>
    <P>In an era when we have a Supreme Court judgment on the secrecy that must surround Cabinet documentation and decision-making and when we have an Official Secrets Act, it is quite plain that whoever leaked this information to <Col N="852" /> Deputy Ferris was in serious breach of Government regulations and probably is guilty of a direct breach of the law.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when Deputy Ferris was queried by the media last month about the reliability of his information he claimed that he had &ldquo;impeccable sources&rdquo;.  I want to ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who were these sources, and can the Minister give this House an assurance that, neither directly nor indirectly, was he the &ldquo;impeccable source&rdquo; claimed by his party colleague.  I want a categorical assurance from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, that at no stage did he disclose any of the details surrounding the proposed investment by AST to his South Tipperary colleague.  It is important to note that Deputy Ferris went public with details of the proposed project before it was considered by the Cabinet, so the number of people who were privy to the information which he used in the public arena was very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>This episode has been damaging to the IDA and the reputation of this country as a location for international mobile investment.  The company concerned, AST, was particularly appalled by the use of the figure of £202.8 million in relation to its affairs.  However, this is a heartbreaking development for the people of Clonmel and South Tipperary, given that a top class electronics project with over 1,200 jobs, and the many service jobs this would generate in the surrounding area, are not going to materialise now and about which there must be a grave risk in the longer term also.</P>

It is a case where confidentiality, which is the absolute precondition for the IDA dealing with companies, has been breached at the highest level.  We must pray that the Clonmel project goes ahead, but AST now has a similar plant in Scotland and it has left Ireland with a sour taste about the manner in which it <Col N="853" /> has been handled and there is a fear that the development agency in Scotland will exploit this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by pointing out to the Deputies that negotiations on large scale industrial investments are at all times ongoing with many potential inward investment promoters. Such negotiations of their nature are a two-way process with both sides seeking mutual agreement.  In such a dynamic process investors constantly update and review their investment strategies, based, as they must be, on developing market trends and financial resources.  This is particularly the case in the electronics sector where such forces are especially volatile.</P>
      <P>This is the background against which all such negotiations take place.  The IDA in competing for such mobile investment must have the capability, flexibility and resources to succeed.  All will agree that IDA has been to the fore in attracting such mobile investment.  Others have followed our example with the result that competition for such projects is now particularly intense.  I am sure that we are all in agreement that our objective is to maintain our full support for this important task.  We should not seek by political means to intrude or undermine ongoing negotiations between IDA and any particular investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the particular project raised by the Deputies, I must point out that it is premature and, to say the least, damaging to infer that &ldquo;the project will not go ahead as previously planned&rdquo;, which is implicit in what Deputy Cullen has proposed.  This is a significant project <Col N="854" /> requiring detailed evaluation and negotiation. It is complicated by the dynamics of the sector, which is consolidating after an explosive growth phase.  Sectoral developments impact on all players, requiring continuous evaluation of proposed investments.</P>
    <P>That note was prepared for me in anticipation of what Deputy Cullen might responsibly say.  I wish to add the following points.  I want to assure the House that no action taken by any Deputy or Senator, in Government, in Opposition or on the backbenches, has in any way endangered this project.  Tragically, the way in which Deputy Cullen has sought to highlight and politicise this incident has not been helpful.  I have been in contact with the IDA and it has assured me that the details that emerged, which perhaps were premature but nevertheless accurate, did not in any way alter the fact that the AST Corporation was in sustained and substantial negotiations with the Tandy Corporation about which they did not inform the IDA.  If I may so infer, the Chair has a direct constituency interest in this matter.  The position now is a follows.</P>
    <P>The agreement between the Government and this particular company, following an agreement that was arrived at with the IDA and the company, still stands.  Because the company had, independently, received an opportunity to purchase another particular competitor in, as my statement said, a rapidly changing market, they availed of that opportunity. They sought and have received from the IDA a space of 90 days within which to consider the offer that is on the table from the IDA on behalf of the Irish taxpayers.  All of us hope they will proceed with the arrangement that was negotiated and agreed as per the information that is now public knowledge. Regrettably, the way in which this has now been politicised in the most extraordinary competitive manner by Deputy Cullen, who is not in the constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to bring to the notice of the House the critical problem of coast erosion affecting the village of Cahore on the Wexford coastline between Gorey and Wexford town.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to assure me that under the Structural Funds coast protection and maintenance works will be included because that will be the essential ingredient to address the problem in Cahore and, indeed, all the other villages in Wexford as well as other maritime counties that do not have rock abutment but which have only sand dunes between them and the sea.</P>
      <P>There has been an ongoing problem for some time in Cahore.  After the 1989-90 winter storms Wexford County Council expended £50,000, 50 per cent of which was recouped to them from the Minister's Department, to protect the pier in Cahore.  However, there has been progressive erosion since, as there had been over the years before the storms of that particular winter.</P>
      <P>Cahore represents a small part of the 80 miles of sandy beach in Wexford.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that he accepts the principle of central Government funding for coast protection and maintenance works.  Now that the Coast Protection Act is effectively obsolete, will the Minister indicate that he will direct moneys for the protection and support of the structures in and around Cahore village.  I realise we cannot hold the sea back indefinitely on all our vulnerable coastline, but we must have a selective policy of retreat whereby we designate the areas that we will defend against the forces of nature, the sea, and draw moneys from the Structural Funds to protect those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rosslare Strand has been an ongoing <Col N="857" /> problem.  We have yet to receive the moneys for this year and we need assurances in this regard.  We have major problems with Courtown pier and the residents of Cahore village are seriously under threat at this time.</P>
    <P>I would like to read into the record a letter from the Save Cahore Fund which I and other Oireachtas Members recently received.  It refers to:</P>
    <P>... the utmost urgency for some action to be taken to save the small village of Cahore near Gorey in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>For the past three years, we [the local residents] have been trying to get some action which would help alleviate the fears of local residents with regard to the safety of their homes.</P>
    <P>Some small amount of work (large boulders placed on the beach by the county council) has been done but it is feared that, because the work has not continued [unfortunately Wexford County Council's financial position does not allow them spend money on coastal defences] a further problem could arise due to tidal conditions etc.</P>
    <P>While we understand that there are a lot of important problems facing the country at the moment we do feel that we have some right to benefit from the large sums of money being injected into the country by way of Structural Funds from the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to assure me tonight that moneys will be made available from the Structural Funds for coastal defence work.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>We are a small community with very little voice but we do feel we have a right to be heard and, most certainly, not feel as neglected as we do.</P>
    <P>I do hope that you can give this matter urgent consideration as we feel that time is running out.</P>
    <P>Two years ago county engineers from the maritime local authorities produced a report entitled <i>Coastal Zone Management: A Case for Action.</i> I bring that <Col N="858" /> to the Minister's attention and I presume he is already familiar with it.  I urge him to examine that report and respond to the proposals therein of local authority county engineers from the maritime counties.</P>
    <P>Maritime counties do not own their coastline.  Our coastline is a beautiful and natural resource, but it must be funded, maintained and protected by central Exchequer funds because local authorities have no financial rate base.  I urge the Minister, in confirming his help tonight for Cahore village, to indicate also that Structural Funds will be used for coastal maintenance and protection in the vulnerable maritime counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Doyle for raising this important issue here this evening.  It is a matter which is of great concern to me personally and to the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  However, primary responsibility for coastal erosion rests with coastal local authorities, some of which have undertaken protection works themselves.  Owners of private property have, of course, a role in protecting their own interests.</P>
      <P>There are limited funds available to the Department of the Marine to deal with the huge problem of coastal erosion. An amount of £200,000 was allocated in 1993.  These funds are earmarked for advancing existing schemes, such as the major protection scheme at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, and the maintenance of former Office of Public Works' schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to formulate a national programme of coastal protection works for the next few years the Department of the Marine wrote to all coastal local authorities in 1991, inviting them to submit a list of priorities for coastal protection projects which they feel would be warranted <Col N="859" /> and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council, in its submission to the Department of the Marine, proposed protection works at nine locations at a total cost of over £15 million. The council's proposals are as follows: Rosslare Strand, the provision of rock groynes and beach nourishment material at a total cost of £6 million; Courtown, the provision of rock groynes and beach nourishment at a cost of £3 million; Cahore, the provision of rock groynes and beach nourishment material at a cost of £1 million; Ballyconnigar, the provisions of a rock revetment at the base of the cliffs over a distance of 0.4 km at a cost of £200,000; Ardamine, the provision of rock groynes and beach nourishment at a cost of £2 million; Pollshone, the provision of rock groynes at a cost of £500,000; Curracloe, the importation of dune material and provision of wind protection for the dunes at a cost of £1 million; Ballyteigue, the provision of dune protection at a cost of £1 million; and Cullenstown, the provision of rock armouring to stabilise the position of the river outlet and cliff slopes at a cost of £500,000.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the submissions received, including Wexford County Council's submission, the Department of the Marine is actively seeking funding for a comprehensive coastal protection programme under the next round of Structural Funds allocations.  These allocations will be determined in the National Development Plan, due over the coming months.</P>
    <P>While no decisions have yet been made on Structural Funds allocation, I am hopeful that the Government will accord high priority to this programme and that the necessary funding will be made available.</P>
    <P>With specific reference to Cahore in County Wexford, I wish to say that this location is being considered for inclusion in the programme.  However, pending finalisation of the programme and clarification of the funding available, I am not in a position at this stage to say if or when <Col N="860" /> the project can be implemented.  I might also add that grant aid for repair works at Cahore amounting to £30,000 was provided in 1990 following storm damage.</P>
    <P>On a more general note I would like to point out that the Department of the Marine recognises that the entire coastal zone represents an asset that must be protected and managed.  Close co-operation between the Department of the Marine and coastal local authorities in the planning and execution of all coastal protection works is essential.  Indeed, close co-operation is important with regard to the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently reviewing its approaches to coastal protection.  In this regard I believe the way to proceed in the future is to look beyond individual projects and embrace the concepts of coastal zone management which gives a more comprehensive overview. I agree with what the Deputy said in that there is a need for a new approach to coastal protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for selecting this subject for discussion. I apologise to the Chair, the Minister and the House for misunderstanding my time slot and delaying the House.  This issue concerns a man who is physically and mentally capable, a fit and accident free driver who has no blemish on his driving licence to date and who has had experience of driving.  The father of a young family he could not always afford a car and only recently sat his driving test.  It was the toss of a coin as to whether he was tested in a manual or automatic car, such was the extent of his disability, which is hardly noticeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of this man's arms is disabled as a result of polio as a child.  He is now very fit and capable of driving a manual car without being a danger to himself or anyone else.  People with illnesses are allowed to drive manual cars.  When I raised this matter in the House many years ago the former Minister, Padraig <Col N="861" /> Flynn, was very helpful in changing the regulation in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not often raise matters on the Adjournment but an injustice is being done to this man and there was a certain element of subjectivity in making the decision.  I ask the Minister to reverse this decision or at the very least refer it to an independent party or authority to rule on it.  It appears the decision as to whether a manual driving test is allowed is made by people who are not qualified to certify whether a person has a disability.</P>
    <P>People with greater disabilities than the one from which this man suffers experience no difficulty in driving manual cars.  This man simply cannot afford the extra cost of an automatic car.  He is not a man of means and the market for second-hand automatic cars is very limited. On principle, whether this person could afford such a car and the additional expenses of servicing it, he should not have been denied the opportunity to undertake a manual driving test.  I hope the Minister will intervene to allow this man, and people with mild disabilities, to take the full driving test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory or administrative bar to a person with a physical disability taking a driving test in a vehicle with a manual gear change.  Indeed, many such people have successfully completed driving tests in such vehicles, usually specially adapted to overcome the effect of their handicaps.</P>
      <P>A medical report is required by a handicapped person for the purpose of an application for a licence.  It is the medical practitioner who completes this report and forms a view as to the fitness of such a person to drive from a health point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Driver testers operate in accordance with the Licensing of Drivers Regulations, 1989, which lay down the nature and manner of the holding of driving tests, including the operations and manoeuvres which have to be carried out satisfactorily during the course of the practical road test.  It is a matter for the <Col N="862" /> driver tester to determine whether, having regard to the performance of the applicant, he or she is competent to drive the vehicle without danger to and with due regard for the safety and convenience of other persons.  The tester is obliged to withhold a certificate of competency unless he is satisfied that the requisite standard of driving is in evidence.</P>
    <P>In the case of the person in question, a driving test was conducted in a car with manual transmission but the driver tester abandoned the test having formed the view that the person, because of the nature of his disability could not operate the gears with his right hand while at the same time maintaining adequate, safe control over the movement of the car.  The tester offered him the advice that he should drive an adapted car with automatic transmission and the applicant subsequently completed a successful test in such a car.</P>
    <P>I repeat that persons with physical disabilities are not, <i>per se,</i> debarred from making driving tests in vehicles with manual gear change.  Common sense and limitations imposed by an individual's particular disability will usually dictate the type of vehicle and/or adaptations required to enable such a person to drive with safety.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years significant changes have been made in catering for people with physical disability.  Sensitive problems, similar to that to which the Deputy referred, arise occasionally and have to be subjectively dealt with in circumstances in which a driving tester has a number of competing responsibilities. Even though this person has succeded in passing a test, I will review the regulations generally with a view to ensuring that the system as it operates is not only fair but caters for individual circumstances such as the case in question.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the Chamber tonight at short notice to listen to my appeal to the State to purchase the Waller estate for the <Col N="863" /> nation, thereby creating employment in the Kenmare-Sneem area of County Kerry.  This estate consists of approximately 50 acres.  Dromore Castle, which is 150 years old, has been recently inhabited and is structurally sound.  More importantly, the Waller estate contains one of the finest exclusive fishing rights in Ireland.  The river system which is ten miles long includes two tributaries also attached to the lands &mdash; one in Dirreendraugh and the other at Kealduff. There are also boating rights of 100 acres in nearby Lough Brin.  These are excellent fisheries with great potential.  The estate also has a half mile of netting rights on the Kenmare Bay estuary.  There is a hatchery available on the lands.</P>
      <P>There are 17 dilapidated dwellinghouses on the lands which could be made habitable again.  The estate is one of the greatest indigenous resources with the greatest job potential to come on the market for many years.  It has a boathouse next to the beach in a beautiful environment overlooking Kenmare Bay and stables which are in poor repair.  The property could be purchased at a reasonable price and would be a very solid investment for the State.  Dromore Castle is open for development as a tourism project in a specialist area with good employment potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance to consult with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Minister for Tourism, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Energy in the preparation of a development plan for this valuable property.  The numbers which could be employed on this property if developed would exceed by far the numbers which <Col N="864" /> could be employed in a major industry in the area.</P>
    <P>There is local goodwill in the Kenmare-Sneem area for the State to purchase this property for development for tourism, fisheries and leisure.  I strongly recommend that the Minister use her good offices to arrange for the purchase of this property in the national interest.  The estate is up for sale by auction in early July.  I look forward to a favourable reply from the Minister.</P>

The Minister has requested the Office of Public Works to provide him with a brief on the Waller estate at Dromore, Kenmare, County Kerry, so that he can come to a decision in the matter.</P>
      <P>One of the first things the Minister wishes to establish is a priority list of properties which the State should aim to acquire.  The Deputy will appreciate that we must be discriminating in selecting the cases which the Exchequer will be called upon to support.  Only properties of national significance should be on the list, and other factors, such as the nature of threat that exists to particular properties, will have to be taken into account in deciding on the priorities.  The Minister intends to seek the assistance of the National Heritage Council in drawing up the criteria by which properties will be considered for inclusion and positioning on the list.  In the meantime, the Minister will look specifically at the Waller estate and will let the Deputy know his decision in due course.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Probate Office that the number or estates that entered probabe in the year 1991-1992 was 9,820, while the number of estates on which administration was taken out was 4,437. The respective figures for 1990-1991 are 9,838.  Based on a one month sample of grants of probate and administration issued in both Dublin and rural areas, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that approximately 23 per cent of estates are valued below £10,000, that 40 per cent of estates are valued below £20,000, that 71 per cent of estates are valued below £50,000 and that 90 per cent of estates are valued below £100,000.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, which have been taken to ensure that the issuing of P11D forms to businesses will not extend to employees earning as little as £1,500 per annum and will not relate to all expenses without any de minimis rule.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have not in recent years operated specific programmes to identify benefit-in-kind and other expense payments made to employees.  However, following the Government decision not to introduce the proposed fringe benefits tax, the Commissioners were asked to take the necessary steps, through the use of their existing statutory powers in this area, to <Col N="667" /> achieve more effective taxation of fringe benefits.  The recent issue of the form P11D is one such initiative.</P>
      <P>The form P11D is being issued to employers on a selective basis and is designed to bring into charge benefit-in-kind and other expense payments which have not already been declared to the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
      <P>The form P11D seeks details in respect of cars, preferential loans, cash benefits, non-cash benefits, accommodation and other benefits provided to such taxpayers. To keep compliance costs to a minimum, benefits which have been subjected to PAYE and expense payments in respect of which Revenue approval for payment without deduction of tax has been granted need not be returned.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not provide for a <i>de minimis</i> rule as regards the amount of a fringe benefit which must be returned &mdash; the provision of such a figure would be interpreted as a general exemption threshold in respect of taxable benefits and would be counter-productive to the task of achieving effective taxation. However, in practice, the Commissioners are not concerned about isolated small-value benefits or insignificant goods consumed on the business premises.  If an employer is in doubt as to whether a particular item should be included in the form P11D, he should contact the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
      <P>The form P11D is being issued under the provisions of section 178 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which requires employers to make returns of benefit-in-kind and other expense payments made to, or for, employees with remuneration of £1,500 per annum and all directors. While the limit of £1,500, below which employees are not liable to tax on benefit, has stood since the legislation was introduced in 1958, the question of any adjustment in that figure cannot be considered without reference to the fundamental changes which have occurred in the meantime and to the important principle of equity involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the legislation was introduced, benefits were uncommon and were confined <Col N="668" /> to higher paid employees and directors. In recent years however, the concept of &ldquo;tax-efficient remuneration&rdquo; has come to play an increasing role and is no longer confined to higher paid employees.  Any circumstances which results in particular forms of remuneration getting preferential treatment is contrary to the principle of broadening the tax base.  Moreover, Revenue experience has been that where a form of remuneration is not taxed or taxed lightly such forms tend to proliferate.  Should the limit £1,500 be increased, there would obviously be a switch to avail of the more favourable tax treatment of benefits <i>vis-à-vis</i> normal remuneration, causing a reduction in tax yields with obvious adverse implications for the general body of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The amount of £36 million was part of a total amount of £57 million which was collected in 1992 under an Arrears Programme in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Variations in the number of staff assigned to this and other tax collection programmes will have regard to the relevant work requirements at any given time.</P>
      <P>In an overall context, the Commissioners remain committed to tackling entrenched arrears of tax and, in particular, to ensuring that arrears do not arise or accumulate on an ongoing basis. This is being done through promoting a climate of voluntary compliance, by taking swift and targeted enforcement action where required and through the use of all legislative and administrative means to identify and tackle evasion and avoidance.</P>
      <P>In the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes, there has been a planned development in the administration of the tax system which has resulted in a broad movement of staff from routine administration to compliance, audit and investigation work.  This reorganisation will enhance the administrative policies and initiatives being taken by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure and improve the efficiency of the tax administration system.</P>
      <P>In addition, surplus staff resources arising from the Decentralisation Programme and the Completion of the Single European Market are being used to enhance and expand the current programmes for collection, compliance and enforcement so as to generate an additional return for the Exchequer in current and future years.</P>

      <P>In my Budget Statement I pointed out that the Government were totally committed to change in the area of public service pay determination systems.  I also indicated that it was our intention to press forward, in 1993, through discussions with the public service unions, with the introduction of a new system which would be more transparent and operate on assessment criteria which, while being fair to staff, would be responsive to the interests of the Government and the community as taxpayers.</P>

      <Quest>the beneficial impact, with regard to the Finance Bill as recently passed by Dáil Éireann, on Exchequer receipts and cash-flow in December 1993, under section 92 and the implications for cash-flow of the application of section 93 in early 1994; and the estimated real economic worth and value of this exercise.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the question I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a parliamentary question from Deputy Cox on 25 May last on the same matter.  Essentially, the advance payment measure under section 92 will give rise to an estimated cash-flow gain of £145 million to the Exchequer in December 1993.  Under either sections 92 or 93 this amount will be credited in total against the November/December VAT liability of the traders concerned which falls due for payment by 19 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advance payment initiative, which will impact on the 2,000 largest remitters out of a total VAT registered population of over 125,000 arises, as the Deputy will be aware, because of the abolition, from 1 January last, of VAT at point of entry for intra-Community trade.  The format of the measure ensures that the business <Col N="672" /> community retains the benefit of the cash-flow gain thus arising for most of the year.  I believe that the balanced nature of this approach has been accepted by business generally.  From the Exchequer viewpoint, the initiative disposes of the need to recoup the revenues involved elsewhere, either through other taxation measures or by increased borrowing, and confirms the Government's commitment to sound financial management in accordance with the European Monetary Union convergence criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of the report, which was indeed prepared by my Department. However, I would not accept that &ldquo;Women ... are tied to lower grades&rdquo;, neither would I accept that the current gender imbalance in the profile of the general service grades in the Civil Service indicates any inequality of treatment.</P>
      <P>Promotion and recruitment competitions held for appointments in the Civil Service are open to both men and women.  Advertisements and circulars announcing external and internal competitions indicate clearly that the Civil Service is committed to a policy of equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of interview boards convened by the Civil Service Commission are briefed on the civil service policy in relation to equality of opportunity and in <Col N="673" /> addition are provided with written guidelines stating the policy in relation to the conducting of interviews.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to the candidature and outcome of recruitment and promotion competitions and membership of interview boards are collected by my Department from the Civil Service Commission and from each Government Department.  The information is analysed by my Department, in consultation with the Civil Service unions and is contained in the annual report to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the report, the statistics to date give no indication of gender bias in selection for appointments in the Civil Service, either on recruitment or promotion.  The results show that, in general, women are at least as successful as men in promotion competitions.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am anxious to achieve a better gender balance at senior levels and I believe that significant progress has been made in this direction.  As stated in a reply to Deputy McDowell a few weeks go, of those serving at managerial level in the main general service grades, more than 25 per cent are women.  The fact that women now represent more than 50 per cent of the Executive Officer grade, which is one of the chief grades from which future higher civil servants will be drawn, is a significant step towards achieving a greater balance further up the ranks.</P>
    <P>In relation to having discussions with other Government Departments, discussions with Departments and with the unions on equality issues are ongoing and have been for many years.  Policy and guidelines on equal opportunities for the Civil Service were published in July 1986 and distributed to all Departments.  They provide a statement of basic principles on which the ongoing development of an equality policy is based.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the equal opportunities policy in the Civil Service is looked after by the equality section in my Department in close consultation with the Civil Service unions.  A union-management committee on equal opportunities <Col N="674" /> meets monthly to monitor the general implementation of equality policy and to discuss issues as they arise.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the Convention in 1974 subject to ratification.  Ireland fully intends to ratify the Convention and has recently informed the European Commission of this fact.  There are concerns that there may be technical discrepancies between the terms of the Convention and some aspects of Irish law.  The matter is currently being examined by the Attorney General's Office.  Once it is resolved ratification will proceed forth-with and a motion will be put before the Dáil to ratify the Convention.  I cannot give a precise time frame at this juncture for ratification but I would hope that the legal questions will be resolved by the end of the year.  The Deputy should be aware that Ireland fully observes the requirements of the CITES Convention which became binding on the European Community as a whole under EC Regulation 3626/82.  Ratification of the Convention by Ireland is therefore largely a technical matter.</P>

      <P>As is customary, I met with a number of representative groups in the run-up to this year's budget.  Included in these groups was the Drinks Industry Group representing both producers and retailers.  In the course of that meeting, the group highlighted the increased exposure to cross-Border distortions of trade that arises in the context of the Single Market and urged me to reduce, or, at a minimum, not to increase the excise duties on alcoholic products.  In response, I referred to the restraint displayed by the Government in relation to the taxation of alcohol in recent years and pointed out that this restraint had not been matched by the industry where, for example, the tax exclusive price of the pint of stout has been increasing by more than double the rate of inflation.</P>

    <P>While giving no commitments as to my budgetary intentions, I made it clear that, in the event of a continuation of the policy of restraint in this area, I would expect the industry to respond in a similar fashion.

Since then, I have had contacts with the company involved to express my concerns in this matter.  I have also been in touch with the vintners organisations to indicate that the occasion of a producer price rise should not be used as an opportunity to impose unjustified price increases at retail level and I have asked them to request their members to behave responsibly in this matter.</P>

      <P>The taxation of disability benefit is essentially a matter of equity.  It ensures that when two families in similar circumstances have the same amount of income one does not pay less tax than the other simply because one family's income contains DB and the second family's does not.  Of course, I am aware that bringing any income into the tax net which was previously outside that net causes a direct loss of net income for those affected. However, the income tax exemption limits, which I increased in the budget, will mitigate the effect for low income families.</P>

      <P>I understand that, as a general principle, income earned by a foreign corporation that is owned by a US parent company is not taxed by the United States tax authorities until it is repatriated to its US parent.  This principle has, however, been restricted over the years by various measures intended to prevent to use of foreign corporation as a means to achieve unwarranted tax advantages.  The proposals now being brought forward by the US authorities in relation to the taxation of certain US companies operating outside the US would apparently require US taxpayers holding a stake of more than 10 per cent in a US-controlled foreign corporation, where passive assets account for 25 per cent or more of the total asset value of the company, to pay US tax on a specified portion of the foreign corporation's current and accumulated earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are closely monitoring the progress of these proposals and <Col N="678" /> are making their views on the matter known to the US authorities through the appropriate channels.</P>

      <P>I am aware of and have seen the report of the IFSC which was prepared by the Financial Services Industry Association. The report, which contains much information and many recommendations is, however, a confidential one, elements of which are being examined by the IFSC Committee which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am not in a position, therefore, to comment on any particular parts of it.</P>
      <P>I can say in general, however, that there are some companies in the Centre which rely in the early stages of development on the tax benefits available.  This is normal and to be expected but is not to be encouraged beyond that stage because it would not provide a sound basis for the future development of those companies, particularly after 2005 when the current tax incentives for IFSC companies are due to terminate.  I would of course lend my support to any initiatives which would act to strengthen the Centre in ways which would contribute to its long term future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the future physical development of the area the recently concluded Master Plan Agreement between the Custom House Docks Development Authority and the developers, which provides for further construction of office, residential and leisure facilities at the Area, requires pre-letting of the office buildings in advance of construction. Such pre-letting will facilitate the re-commencement of construction work in the area, with the generation of up to 500 jobs, at a time when current conditions in the market for office space might otherwise result in the further postponement of construction work.  I do not <Col N="680" /> consider that this is unreasonable as the requirement to relocate the centre is part of the terms under which companies obtain tax relief.</P>

      <P>The provision, on a commercial basis, of facilities for taking part in sporting activities became liable to VAT at the 12.5 per cent rate from 1 July 1992.  Prior to that date the position was quite confused. The provision of certain sporting facilities, including golf courses, had been treated as exempt, while the 21 per cent rate applied in other cases. However, all sporting facilities provided <Col N="681" /> as part of a hotel operation were liable to VAT at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The exempt treatment of commercial entities could not have been allowed to continue as it was contrary to EC rules and created distortions of competition between sporting facilities provided by hotels and similar facilities provided by other commercial operators which were exempt.  This distortion had become far more pronounced because of the trends in the commercial sector over the last few years.</P>
      <P>Golf facilities which are being provided in the course or furtherance of business are properly liable to VAT and there can be no question of exempting them from the tax.  On the other hand golf clubs established on a non-profit making basis, for the benefit of their members, are exempt from VAT under the provisions of EC law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 47 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of Sheriffs is governed by the Sheriffs Fees Orders 1926 to 1963 under which a Sheriff is entitled to 35p in respect of every certificate lodged with him and poundage of 5 per cent on the first £100 plus 2.5 per cent on the balance collected.  Expenses for travel and seizure are payable in certain circumstances. The fees, expenses and poundage are payable by the defaulting taxpayer.  As is the norm in financial transactions between solicitor and client, Sheriffs have at all times been permitted to retain interest on short term deposits.  In effect, this interest has been a major source of their income.  The operation would have become non-viable had they not been permitted to supplement their income with interest in this manner to defray the substantial costs they incur. A review of the statutory fees is in progress and I will be making recommendations to the Minister for Justice shortly for revised scales of fees.  Once these fees have been improved to a realistic level, Sheriffs will no longer be permitted to retain interest on amounts held pending transmission to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs is on a client/professional basis and is not such that conditions can be imposed on the sheriffs in relation to the location of funds which they are holding in trust on behalf of Revenue.  Nevertheless, an agreement was reached with the Sheriffs in 1988 that funds would be held in a medium that permits immediate withdrawal, in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheriffs are required, under the terms of operational guidelines, to submit audit reports to Revenue at six-monthly intervals. The audit reports are examined and sheriffs are notified of any investments which are considered to present a risk to the Exchequer.  In relation to the specific <Col N="683" /> case referred to by the Deputies, the problem was resolved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners once it was drawn to the attention of the Sheriff in question.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that no loss of revenue has occurred arising from the manner in which moneys are, or have been, held by the Sheriffs.  In addition the Commissioners are satisfied that the Sheriffs are now complying with the requirements that all funds must be held in a medium that permits immediate withdrawal in full.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that taxpayers are entitled to strict confidentiality in relation to their dealing with the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, I must accept Revenue's advice not to reveal any of the amounts of tax paid by the Sheriffs in the last five years as requested by Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>Income earned by the Sheriffs, including deposit interest, is of course taxable in the same way as the income of any other business, and the Sheriffs pay tax at the normal rates on the excess of income over deductible expenses.  The high cost of operating the Sheriff's offices is the main deductible expense.</P>

      <P>The issue of superannuation payments of APSO development workers, and in particular teachers, has been a major problem restricting APSO's recruitment of personnel for some time.  The issue was highlighted again in the Consultancy report commissioned by APSO on the placement of Irish personnel overseas during the next four years in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the number of such personnel substantially.</P>
      <P>I regard it as important that the rights and entitlements of development workers be safeguarded so that they would not be penalised because they choose to work for a period in a developing country.  I have instructed my officials to examine the issue of superannuation as a matter of urgency and to consult with the Government Departments concerned, namely Finance and Education. I hope that a solution to this problem can be found shortly.</P>

      <P>The terms of Article 25 (Exchange of Information) of the Ireland/United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention, 1976 are similar to provisions contained in the Model Double Taxation Convention which were being formulated at that time by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and which were published in 1977.  The provisions are also on the same lines as corresponding provisions in other double taxation treaties concluded by Ireland.  The purposes of such provisions is to prevent fiscal evasion by a resident of one of the partner states in respect of income and capital gains arising in the other State.</P>
      <P>Article 25 permits the exchange of such information as is necessary for the carrying out of the Convention.  It does not require the disclosure of information which would be contrary to the laws or administrative practice, or could not be obtained under the laws or normal course of administration, of either of the treaty partner countries.  Information which would disclose a trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy, also need not be exchanged.  The acceptance by Ireland of provisions of this kind is in general a necessary prerequisite to the conclusion of double taxation conventions with other countries which would on balance be seen as advantageous to this country.</P>
      <P>The Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct taxation provides that the competent authorities of member states must disclose to the competent authorities of other member states any information in the field of direct taxation which is required to be disclosed by virtue of that Directive.  The directive contains detailed rules regarding the circumstances which must exist if information is to be exchanged.</P>

      <P>As I announced earlier this year, the Government have adopted a new approach to the protection of areas of scientific interest.  All the old areas of scientific interest are being reviewed to see whether they should be designated as natural heritage areas.  This review is being done in consultation with farming and conservation organisations.</P>
      <P>Legislation to give statutory protection to natural heritage areas has been prepared and will be included in a Bill to amend provisions of the Wildlife Act. This Bill will be submitted to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>The staffing of the individual committees to which the Deputy refers is being arranged, in part, through the reallocation of members of the Joint Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who had become available for reassignment in consequence of the termination of committees which existed during the term of the previous Dáil and the replacement elsewhere in the Office of an Assistant Principal.  There is, in addition, an arrangement under which, following consultations involving the Chair of each committee, the Minister for Finance and the appropriate Minister, the secondment of suitably qualified officials to a committee will be arranged.  This latter process has so far been initiated only in the case of one committee and is not yet complete.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the production of reports of committee proceedings, I have sanctioned the recruitment of five additional transcribers and the holding of a competition, open to existing clerical staff in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, for a new grade of trainee transcribers from which it is hoped to make five appointments shortly.</P>

    <P>The launching of the decentralisation programme in 1987 reflected the Government's belief that the more widespread location of public service employment was a desirable long term objective to help reduce regional imbalances and the pressure on the Dublin region.  The Government considered that the concentration of human and material resources in Dublin at the expense of the peripheral areas had effectively deprived the provinces for too long of their development capacity.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present programme, when completed in the selected locations, will result in achieving a better regional spread of prosperity and economic activity throughout the country.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give the rules in relation to whether payments to a home help to care for a parent where such care is essential or payments to a private nursing home to care for a parent by one or more taxpayers can be allowed for tax relief purposes; and if he will provide Deputy N. Ahern with or refer him to regulations which would outline the rules.</Quest>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the type of tax relief referred to by the Deputy is provided for in Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967. A taxpayer may obtain relief in respect of expenses incurred on behalf of a parent only where the taxpayer concerned is entitled to a dependent relative allowance in respect of the parent concerned i.e. where (i) the taxpayer maintains the parent and (ii) the parent's income does not exceed a specified amount &mdash; £4,035 for the current year.</P>
      <P>Relief is not available in respect of any expenditure which has been or will be reimbursed, for example, by the VHI, health board or by any other body.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is not available in respect of payments made to a home help who cares for a taxpayer's parents.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is, however, available in cases of serious illness where a qualified nurse is engaged by a taxpayer on the advice of a medical practitioner to provide constant nursing care for a parent in the parent's home.  Medical certification, details of the qualifications of the nurse and a breakdown of the payments made would be required where tax relief is claimed.  Further details are available from the taxpayer's inspector of taxes.</P>
      <P>A taxpayer would also be entitled to relief in respect of expenses incurred in respect of a parent who due to old age or infirmity is required to reside in a nursing home.  The nursing home must be on a list approved by the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where health expenses of a parent are <Col N="704" /> shared between two or more taxpayers, tax relief would be available to each taxpayer provided they satisfy the conditions for the dependent relative allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers will offer partial relief in respect of certain categories of undisclosed tax liabilities which arose prior to April, 1991. The detailed provisions are under active <Col N="705" /> consideration with a view to bringing forward legislation within the current session. Pending the completion of the legislation, it is not possible to give every last detail.  However, it is certainly not intended to exclude undisclosed liabilities of particular categories of taxpayers, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, where these liabilities otherwise fall within the ambit of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is doubtless aware, Irish Life plc is a private concern.  Consequently I have no function in relation to its commercial operations.  Not-withstanding this, as a shareholder I had the right, as had all other shareholders, to raise the issue of the Mespil flats sale at the company's Annual General Meeting, and I did this via my Proxy.</P>
      <P>At that meeting my Proxy indicated my concern at certain aspects of this sale, and sought assurances from the board of the company both in relation to this transaction and any future undertakings of a similar nature.  My conerns in the matter were recognised and acknowledged by the board, and the assurances which I sought were given.  These included a commitment to assisting in the remedial action now under way in relation to any difficulties still faced by the residents of the estate.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issues relating to security of tenure which the Deputy raises, I have no function in this area, either as regards the general issue, or the specific instance in question.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>In February 1988, the person concerned applied for a Deserted Wife's Allowance.  However, her application had to be disallowed as she failed to satisfy the Department that her husband had of his own volition left her.  She appealed against this decision.  Following an oral hearing of her case in September 1988, an appeals officer upheld the decision to refuse her deserted wife's allowance.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and cannot be reviewed except in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned applied for a <Col N="711" /> means tested lone parent's allowance in February 1993.  One of the conditions for receipt of this allowance is that the claimant must not have means in excess of a specified limit &mdash; £3,848 per annum in the case of a person with one child dependant.  In addition, the Department must be fully satisfied that the claimant is separated and not receiving adequate maintenance from his or her spouse.</P>
    <P>During an investigation of her claim in May 1993, the person concerned was requested by a local officer of the Department to produce for inspection her business bank account, her building society account and a copy of documentation relating to her legal separation from her husband.  As she failed to produce these documents, it was not possible for the Department to determine if she was eligible for the allowance.  Accordingly, it was decided recently that her application for lone parent's allowance had to be disallowed as she had not fully disclosed her means.  She is being notified of this decision.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned produces the relevant documentation requested, her entitlement to lone parent's allowance will be reviewed and she will be notified of the outcome without delay.  Alternatively she can appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office against the disallowance.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement can be paid towards rent or mortgage interest payments.  Generally speaking a supplement would be payable where a person with a mortgage is unable because of unemployment, sickness or other reason, to meet the interest repayments. In such cases a supplement may be paid where the rent or mortgage interest exceeds £5 per week.  The maximum amount of supplement payable would be such as to ensure that the client has, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to his family circumstances less £5.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Dublin area, that the people concerned were refused a mortgage supplement as their income, after mortgage interest payments, exceeds that level.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for disability benefit or invalidity pension, applicants must satisfy certain statutory contribution conditions, one of which requires them to have had at least 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in a recent contribution year which governs their claim.  It is understood that no contributions have been recorded on behalf of the person concerned since 1979 and therefore he is no longer eligible for payment under the disability benefit or invalidity pension schemes on the basis of his current PRSI record.</P>
      <P>However, subject to receipt of suitable medical evidence confirming the nature and extent of incapacity, I will arrange to have the possibility of awarding credited contributions for the intervening period examined and his eligibility for disability benefit or invalidity pension can be reassessed when the outcome is known.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is payable to unemployed persons whose means fall below a certain level and who are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.  If the person concerned satisfies these conditions, he should contact his social welfare office which will provide any necessary advice or assistance with his application in this regard.</P>
      <P>A person who is incapable of work because of illness or incapacity would not normally qualify for unemployment assistance but may be entitled to payment under the disabled person's maintenance allowance or supplementary welfare allowance schemes.  Further information in this regard can be obtained from the local health board.</P>

      <P>Acting under Article 169 of the EEC Treaty the EC Commission requested the Government on 12 March, 1993 to submit its observations on the failure by Ireland to incorporate into national law the provisions of Directive 91/308/EEC and Directive 91/447/EEC. The deadline for implementing both directives was 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Directive 91/308/EEC, is to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.</P>
      <P>Details of our proposals to give effect to the directive have been forwarded to the Commission.  The directive has not been incorporated into Irish law to date because legislation is required to give effect to its provisions.  That legislation is at a very advanced stage of drafting and will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The directive does not create rights or entitlements for individuals and, accordingly, the question of State liability in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy does no arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Directive 91/447/EEC, its purpose is to afford member states the requisite guarantees that guns and other weapons would not move freely between EC countries after the abolition of internal community frontiers in 1993. To facilitate the movement of weapons by sportsmen it proposes the introduction of a European firearms pass.  It also allows member states to exercise more <Col N="717" /> stringent controls in their firearms legislation than those provided for in the directive.  In addition the directive provides that firearms dealers must retain their records for a period of five years and it also stipulates that persons under the age of 18 are not entitled to hold certain firearms certificates.</P>
    <P>Details of our proposals to give effect to the Directive have been forwarded to the Commission.  Draft regulations to implement the directive are ready to be made.  However, on the advice of the Attorney General I have deferred making the regulations pending the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Meagher <i>v.</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Others.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the European firearms pass, Irish sports people travelling to Europe and European sports people coming here with their firearms to take part in competitions have been accorded special facilities to ensure that they are not prevented from carrying their firearms. Consequently the question of State liability in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy do not arise.</P>

The recycled paper represents almost 9 per cent of total paper purchased and my Department would intend to continue to use recycled paper where this is possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 118, 119, 120 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>European Commission proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty are in train in relation to transposition of the directives listed in the following schedule. I am not aware of any legal suits of the kind referred to in the questions.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Schedule</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Directive 76/160/EEC concerning the quality of bathing water.</i>
      </P>
      <P>This directive has been transposed into Irish law by the Quality of Bathing Waters Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 155 of 1992).  My Department is currently considering a point raised by the EC Commission regarding criteria for designation of waters.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Directive 76/464/EEC on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Water Pollution and Environmental Protection Agency Acts already provide the means for transposing the requirements of Directive 76/464/EEC into Irish law and further legislation is not required.  Regulations are made as necessary <Col N="726" /> to give effect to the requirements of directives dealing with individual dangerous substances adopted within the framework of Directive 76/464/EEC which provides for combating pollution caused by discharges of such substances to the aquatic environment.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, (Control of Cadmium Discharges) Regulations, 1985 (S.I. No. 294 of 1985) and the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Control of Hexachlorocyclohexane and Mercury Discharges) Regulations 1986 (S. I. No. 55 of 1986) give effect to &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; directives of Directive 76/464/EEC. Regulations to give effect to subsequent &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; directives establishing emission limit values for particular processes are in preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Directive 85/337/EEC concerning the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC have been transposed into Irish law primarily by&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Motorways) Regulations, 1988 (S. I. No. 221 of 1988),</P>
    <P>&mdash;the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (S. I. No. 349 of 1989), and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 25 of 1990).</P>
    <P>The Commission has raised a number of concerns on the adequacy of these transposing measures not all of which are agreed by my Department.  Correspondence with the Commission is continuing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Directive 87/217/EEC on the provision and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos.</i>
    </P>
    <P>This directive was transposed into national law by the following Regulations: Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Emission Limit Values for Use of Asbestos) <Col N="727" /> Regulations, 1990 (S. I. No. 28 of 1990), European Communities (Control of Water Pollution by Asbestos) Regulations, 1990 ((S. I. No. 31 of 1990) and European Communities (Asbestos Waste) Regulations, 1990 (S. I. No. 30 of 1990).  The Commission has stated its view that the latter Regulations do not fully transpose certain provisions of the directive.  It is intended to address this matter in further Regulations to be made shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Directive 91/157/EEC on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Regulations to be made shortly by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will, together with appropriate administrative measures, give effect as far as possible to Council Directive 91/157/EEC.  It was envisaged that member states should transpose this directive before 18 September 1992. However, some provisions of the Directive cannot be fully implemented because of delay at EC level in drawing up certain detailed arrangements pursuant to Article 4.  A Commission Directive incorporating these arrangements is likely to come into force on 1 January 1994 and will require further national regulations for its transposition.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and 78/319/EEC on toxic and dangerous waste.</i>
    </P>
    <P>These directives were transposed into national law by the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 (S. I. No. 390 of 1979) and the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982 (S. I. No. 33 of 1982) respectively.  My Department was satisfied at the time that the regulations gave effect to and respected the essential obligations of these directives.  It is intended that certain matters now raised by the Commission will be addressed in the context of the forthcoming Waste Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" />
      <i>Directive 79/923/EEC on the quality required of shellfish waters.</i>

It is notable that dairy products are at the top of the list of foods which are recommended in the circular.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for suckler cow premium on 33 cows.  At an inspection of his herd he presented only 20 of the 33 cows and also eight in-calf heifers which were supposed to replace some of the absent cows. In his explanation for the absence of 13 cows he has indicated that five cows died and that seven were sold to another herdowner. The tag numbers of the five cows that were alleged to have died were not on his application however and there is no proof that he ever had the seven cows he claims to have sold.</P>
      <P>Unless he can account satisfactorily for the absence of all 13 cows his application will be deemed to be fraudulent and he will be refused suckler cow grants for 1992 and be debarred from the 1993 suckler cow scheme.

      <P>While the subject of the Deputy's question is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, I understand from the institute that a wide variety of radio-nuclides with an extensive range of activities are used for teaching and research purposes.  Sealed radioactive sources are used to demonstrate the properties of ionising radiation for analytical purposes, as calibration check sources for instrumentation and other miscellaneous uses. Radioactive substances in unsealed form are imported for use in a wide variety of applications.  These are usually organic molecules incorporating radionuclicides for use in solution form as tracers in process investigation, as chemical catalysts or calibration standards.</P>
      <P>At present, all imported sealed sources must be returned to the original supplier at the end of their useful lives &mdash; this is a precondition imposed by the institute prior to the issue of a licence.  In the case of radioactive substances in unsealed form, the licensee is obliged to store waste material on his premises until the radioactive content has decayed to levels at which disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections of storage of unsealed radioactive substances are carried out by the institute.  Although there is at present <Col N="745" /> no central radioactive waste storage facility in Ireland, I am satisfied that the present arrangements in place ensure that all sources of radioactivity are currently stored in a manner which does not pose a hazard to people or property.</P>

      <P>The transport of nuclear weapons between British military establishments is a matter for the British Government.  It is noted that an official review conducted by the UK Ministry of Defence's Chief Scientific Advisor, published in July 1992, concluded that warheads are carried by road in vehicles which are secure and equipped with satisfactory means of internal containment and protection.  It would be inappropriate for me to contact the UK authorities about such transports.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the Government intends to prevent the transportation of plutonium by air and sea from Germany, Japan and other countries to Sellafield, following the commissioning of the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP), in view of the fact that all of these transports will come within sixty miles of the Irish coastline and that the consequences of a serious accident involving these transports could prove catastrophic.</Quest>

      <P>The new THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield cannot go ahead until revised authorisations are given by the UK authorities for the discharge of liquid and gaseous emissions from Sellafield.  No final decision has yet been taken on whether or not it will proceed.  Following a public consultation process undertaken by the UK Inspector of Pollution, HMIP, some 80,000 submissions were received by HMIP and a report has recently been submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment for his consideration. The Secretary of State will now decide if a hearing is to be granted on the THORP issue to interested parties or whether to issue discharge authorisations.</P>
      <P>The transportation of plutonium will only be a possibility if the THORP plant is given the go-ahead.  In this connection, I have already expressed the Government's concerns about such shipments.</P>

      <Quest>the current scheme of capitation fees paid to primary and secondary schools, including the capitation levels, the increases over the past ten years and the scheme of fees paid to disadvantaged schools; and the present position in relation to the proposal to introduce fees to reflect the various levels of disadvantage, as there is with the present system which does not take account of severely disadvantaged urban schools.</Quest>

      <P>The current levels of capitation <Col N="762" /> grant to primary and secondary schools are £33 and £150 per annum per pupil, respectively.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, there is a standard rate with varying rates applying to special categories as set out on the following Table A.  In the case of secondary schools, there is only one level of <i>per capita</i> grant with the exception of schools giving instruction through the medium of Irish which receive an enhanced <i>per capita</i> on various rates.</P>
      <P>The increases in the standard rates of grant per pupil between 1983 and 1993 are shown in Table B.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving the standard capitation grant, primary schools in disadvantaged areas have since 1984 received financial support under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>Originally, this support was delivered to needy schools through the Diocesan Authorities who were given a block grant for this purpose.  The schools in question also received direct supplementary grants of up to £5 per pupil from my Department. Since 1990, these arrangements have been replaced by the direct payment of a supplementary capitation grant of £17 per pupil to schools which have been designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>In addition to maintaining the £17 grant in the current year, I have decided to allocate a further £250,000 to schools which are already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and which have particular financial needs at this time. The process of selecting schools for this extra funding is currently taking place. In the current year, an additional 50 new schools will be designated as disadvantaged. The schools selected will also qualify for the £17 per pupil grant.</P>
      <P>There is no special <i>per capita</i> arrangement for secondary schools in disadvantaged areas but special provision is made for such schools by way of additional teachers including home-school liaison teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures for selecting schools for disadvantaged status were put in place in 1990 following discussions with school management and teacher representatives. The selection process has <Col N="763" /> regard to a range of agreed socio-economic criteria and allows schools to be assessed on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined will make a significant contribution towards meeting the needs of schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>Dunshaughlin community college was closed by the vocational education committees as a precautionary measure following the concern expressed by the staff and not as a result of any significant risk to the occupants having been identified. Because of the fears of parents, pupils and staff I have sought the advice of the Health and Safety Authority on the matter and I am assured that it is considered that the occupants of the building would not have been exposed to levels of asbestos that should be a cause of concern.  I understand from the Health and Safety Authority that there is no evidence that exposure to asbestos at the low levels involved in Dunshaughlin community college would have any adverse health effects and that consequently the risk is considered minimal.</P>
      <P>The college is currently receiving a thorough re-cleaning and it is proposed to seal the wall cavities to ensure that any asbestos fibres lodged in cracks or crevices which might become airborne if disturbed will be locked in place.  Further clearance testing will be conducted before the school re-opens to allay any remaining concerns which staff or students might have.</P>

      <P>The decision to allocate a shared remedial teacher between St. Paul's national school and the Central Model School Senior, was based on an assessment of the level or remedial need in the <Col N="767" /> schools in question.  The placement of teachers on the transfer panel is a separate issue which arises where ordinary enrolment numbers in a school decline below a specific level.  Such is the case in the Central Model School, where the decline in enrolments is such that the intention of the fourth assistant is no longer justified.</P>
      <P>The mechanism by which problems of socio-economic disadvantage are addressed is the disadvantaged areas scheme. Under this scheme, schools designated as disadvantaged receive concessionary teaching posts and additional funding. Both the schools sanctioned by the Deputy are already included in this scheme and have received concessionary teaching posts.  The schools in question are also included in the home-school liaison scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above measures, the Deputy may be aware that my Department recently invited schools already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme to apply for a number of additional concessionary posts being made available to assist schools with particular difficulties.  The school mentioned have made application and will be fully considered in this context.</P>
