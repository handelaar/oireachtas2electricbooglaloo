    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party moved that the Telecommunications Bill be given its Second Reading last week. The Bill is designed to establish a watchdog function for a director of telecommunications. Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> explained this clearly when speaking on Second Stage.  Of course, establishing a director of communications with a watchdog function would involve the removal of the regulatory and supervisory function of the Department and the vesting of that function in an independent officer.  The Bill also provides for the introduction of competition in the area of telecommunications. It is interesting to contrast what the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, said last week with what he said this week.  Last week he said the Bill was &ldquo;opportunistic, inconsistent and out of accord with policy developments of recent years&rdquo;.  This week he confirmed that the Government will establish a new <Col N="1284" /> regulatory authority which will remove supervisory control from his Department. Furthermore, he announced that the Government will introduce competition to telecommunications.</P>

      <P>I was reading <i>The Cork Examiner</i> yesterday &mdash; no better bible to follow &mdash; and there for all to see was: &ldquo;Government to set up Telecom watchdog&rdquo;, and the strong statement over the weekend by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Indeed it said in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> report that &ldquo;the development comes as a surprise&rdquo;, it does not come as a surprise to me.  the Minister, having rubbished the Bill last week, now appears to fully accept its logic.  The Minister's conversion to common sense is more dramatic than Saint Paul's conversion to Christianity.</P>
      <P>Why should I be surprised?  It should be no surprise that the Bill comes from Fine Gael because we have had an interest in telecommunications for many years.  In fact Fine Gael set up Telecom Éireann in 1983 and we are very proud of it.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann was set up for a variety of reasons and, as a consequence, the cold hand of departmental bureaucracy was removed from the day-to-day running of the business.  Enormous progress has been made since we took that step but the basic point is that Telecom Éireann cannot continue as a statutory monopoly.</P>

      <P>If it tries to do so it will suffer the same fate as Aer Lingus. That is the problem.  Having mentioned Aer Lingus in relation to Telecom Éireann, it is very obvious that the Government is acting in the same way as it has done in relation to Aer Lingus: It <Col N="1285" /> is speaking with a forked tongue.  The Fianna Fáil wing of the Government seems at least to be prepared to accept the need for competition but its Labour wing pretends there is no need to adopt this approach.  It was quite interesting last week to listen to the contrast in the speeches from the Government benches. In particular I noted the contrast between the speech of Deputy Lawlor and that of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan.  They were coming from opposite ends of the spectrum. Indeed Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan was so incensed by my opening remarks in which I referred to competition, which were on a par with Deputy Lawlor's comments, that he attempted to shout me down.  It was obvious I struck a very nervous cord so far as he was concerned. That does not indicate a coherent approach on the part of this Government in relation to Telecom Éireann or any other issue, not least Aer Lingus.  The Labour element of Government muddied the water further by pretending that the Fine Gael Bill is about privatisation.  Fine Gael has made it absolutely clear that it believes competition in telecommunications is good for the country, for the consumer and, above all, for Telecom Éireann.  Furthermore, this Bill has nothing to do with ownership, it is about competition.  It is in the national interest that Telecom Éireann should face up to competition at this stage and this Bill would help it to do that.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that huge changes in technology are taking place internationally and unless Telecom Éireann faces up to competition at this stage it will be unable to cope with those changes in the years ahead.  Therefore, the Labour campaign of misinformation should stop now because the consequence of such a campaign will damage the morale of the excellent work force of Telecom Éireann. The Labour Party appears to be deliberately damaging the morale of that workforce.  It should stop its campaign of misinformation and end its silly utterances on this issue.  If it cannot find some provision of the Bill to attack, it should at least stop its attacks on something which is not contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> So far as I am aware, every Member of this House agrees with Fine Gael that a private monopoly is not in anyone's best interest.  Therefore, it is ludicrous that the Labour Party should oppose the Bill on the basis that it opposes the establishment of a private monopoly that has not been proposed by anyone.  That type of approach is similar to the entire campaign of misinformation which has bedevilled the debate since telephone charges were increased, a campaign that was assisted by claims from the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, that the increases were preordained and recommended in the Culliton report.  Those claims were of no help whatsoever to this debate.  Members will recall that it took an irate personal rebuttal from Jim Culliton, the Chairman of the Culliton report, to put the record straight in that case.  From the beginning, the approach of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government and Telecom Éireann management on this issue has been that the public are very gullible.</P>
    <P>As a Telecom Éireann consumer I received a letter from Telecom Éireann in September relating to my private telephone to the effect that &ldquo;I would surely welcome the news that Telecom Éireann rates had been substantially reduced from 1 September, 1993.&rdquo;  The justification for that surprising information and the enormous increases in local charges was contained in a leaflet on international residental prices which was included with the letter.  That leaflet referred to reductions in telephone charges for calls to various countries.  It outlined the following reductions: 38 per cent in telephone call charges to Andorra, 18 per cent in the charge for calls to Austria, 19 per cent in the charge for calls to Albania, Algeria, Armenia and Azebaijan and 35 per cent in telephone call charges to Alaska, Anguilla and Antigua.  I discovered from that leaflet I would be able to ring Australia at a cost of £1.05 per minute and Afghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Aruba and Ascension for £1.67 per minute.  That is only the beginning of the story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no pressure from the people in Cork south-west or, so far as I am aware, from people in any other part of the country for a reduction in telephone charges to such places nor have I been inundated with calls from greateful constituents to be passed on to Telecom Éireann in relation to those reductions.  On the other hand, I received a deluge of complaints about the increases in local call charges which are relevant to my constituents and to 95 per cent of the people generally.</P>
      <P>International call charges had to be reduced simply because they were so much out of line with charges applying in other countries.  A call to America for an American who lives in my constituency costs the equivalent of $2 a minute, but if he makes his call by way of an American card service on a reverse call basis to the American telephone company the call costs him $1 per minute.  I have bills to prove that.  There was no way the inflated international charges could be maintained.  International charges have been reduced only to the same level as applies internationally.  As a consequence the portion of calls to and from Ireland will probably equalise at 50:50 whereas until a few months ago the ratio was approximately 60:40, the reason being that a significant number of outgoing calls was made in the manner I described.  If that process had continued it would have virtually wiped out much of Telecom Éireann's international business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To attempt to justify increasing local charges because of the reduction in international charges is entirely illogical. Because of the campaign of misinformation carried out by the Government the general public are rightfully angry about the increase in local charges. Furthermore, Telecom Éireann as a monopoly company is calling on people to restrain themselves from making telephone calls.  Instead of the old advertisement <Col N="1288" /> which stated &ldquo;make that call&rdquo; we now have an advertisement calling on people to &ldquo;not make that call&rdquo;.  That is turning logic on its head and could only arise where people try to justify an untenable situation or where there is a monopoly. As I stated at the outset, Fine Gael believes that a monopoly is bad for the consumer, for the country and, above all, for Telecom Éireann.  If the management of Telecom Éireann has any concern for its workforce and the consumers it must prepare itself for competition by improving its efficiency, and seek to increase rather than reduce its business.  In the past its workforce has shown that it is able to improve productivity in the company.  In particular, since it escaped from the clutches of the Department it has had an outstanding record.  I have no doubt that given the proper lead by management, the workforce can repeat the same exercise in the years to come.  There is no reason that trend cannot continue.</P>
    <P>Since the changes in telephone charges were brought into force there has been an 8 per cent reduction in the number of calls made from telephones in the residential sector.  That indicates a &ldquo;thumbs down&rdquo; approach from residential telephone users to the actions of the Government which are generally agreed to have been a fiasco.  The Government must face up to its responsibilities and accept that competition is the answer.  At least one section of the Government appears to have adopted that approach.  The Government should review local call charges but I am unsure whether the official or provisional wing are prepared to do that at this stage.  It should also establish procedures whereby consumers are encouraged to increase telephone usage, thus bringing more benefits to Telecom Éireann.  That is the obvious answer in the business world; a businesslike response is required.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann must be given an opportunity to compete both nationally and internationally.  It must become more involved in research into new telecommunications techniques and must be able and willing to be in the front line <Col N="1289" /> of the dramatic changes that undoubtedly will take place in the years ahead. Furthermore, Telecom Éireann must value its consumers to a greater extent. A clear message must be given to the management of Telecom Éireann in that regard.  Telecom Éireann can no longer ignore the fact that the greatest volume of complaints to the Ombudsman are made from telephone users.  In the past, resonable and legitimate complaints from the public have been met with threats to have their telephone service cut off.  That could only happen in the case of a monopoly supplier.  It is typical of a company with a monopoly.  Telecom Éireann must change its approach and become more market oriented.  In the Cork area there is a huge sense of grievance because the city and county are not classified as one local call area.  The Cork city code covers towns nearby such as Kinsale, Midleton, Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Mallow but outside these areas calls cost more.  The sense of grievance is heightened by the fact that Dublin city and county and places adjacent to the county such as Counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow are all included in a local call area.  Many complaints have been voiced to Telecom Éireann on this issue but they have been rejected out of hand.  That is typical of the reaction to consumer complaints by Telecom Éireann and of the scenario that arises where there is a monopoly.  It is not good enough.  The management of Telecom Éireann are storing up trouble for themselves because when the opportunity arises for people to use services such as the American 'phone card service to which I referred, they will have no loyalty to the company.  Certainly the case made on this issue is reasonable.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Government should have the good grace to acknowledge that its handling of the Telecom Éireann charges has been a shambles, added to by the campaign of misinformation in which the Government indulged.  The Government should accept that the competition approach advocated by Fine Gael, included in Deputy Noonan's Bill, is the answer.  That approach must be <Col N="1290" /> taken by both wings of the Government. We cannot have an official competition policy and a provisional anti-competition policy which is emanating from the Government at the moment.  Furthermore, the Minister should acknowledge that the Fine Gael approach in advocating an independent regulatory function outside the Department will now be followed by him.  Competition and independent regulation of telecommunications is the essence of the Fine Gael Bill.  If the Government rejects this approach it should vote against Deputy Noonan's Bill, but if the Government agrees with the introduction of competition and independent regulation it should accept the principle of the Bill and vote for it.  The Bill deserves the support of all but the most narrowly anti-competition elements in this House.</P>
    <P>In an effort to justify rejecting this Bill the Minister, Deputy Cowen, was rather petty in relation to its drafting.  Everybody knows that the Opposition does not have access to official draftsmen or hordes of civil servants to make sure that every comma is in the right place.  The function of the Opposition in producing a Bill is to put the principle before the House and when it passes Second Stage it can be referred to the official draftsman if necessary.  In a number of references Deputy Cowen attacked the drafting of the Bill.  He said that Deputy Noonan had referred to Bord Telecom Éireann instead of Telecom Éireann and other such petty references.  If that is the only basis on which this Bill can be rejected by the Government, it should think again. That kind of codology does not do the Minister credit.  If the principle of the Bill is worth adopting the Government should stop nit-picking and support it.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister is indulging in nit-picking to paper over the cracks in the Coalition and the fact that there is a divided view in the Government.  Some elements on the Fianna Fáil side, like Deputy Lawlor, favour competition and the other element epitomised by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, is utterly against it. The Government is not doing any service to Telecom Éireann or to the country if <Col N="1291" /> its approach is just to paper over the cracks.  If the Minister is speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil he should make that clear but if not, he should make it clear he is speaking on behalf of the Government. It is wrong to reject a Bill which proposes competition and independent regulation on the basis of nit-picking about draftsmanship.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications will be a huge business sector in the years ahead.  It is clear from what has been written about it that it may be the biggest business sector before the end of the decade.  Are we to have a serious debate on where we stand in relation to that growth sector or will we hide behind a monopoly and pretend that the enormous technological and other changes will not affect us?  The Fianna Fáil approach to the semi-State sector is epitomised by the ostrich with his head in the sand.  That is why Aer Lingus has been left in its present situation and why it suffered enormous losses.  My colleagues and I feel that the same approach will be taken to telecommunications and to Telecom Éireann.  We are afraid the company will be run down to the extent that it will be almost put into bankruptcy, as Aer Lingus has been.  I do not know whether the Government is prepared to face up to its responsibilities, but there are enough examples to show that political cowardice in relation to semi-State bodies is total dereliction of duty.  There have been many examples of political cowardice in relation to semi-State bodies by Fianna Fáil and, more recently, by Labour.  I am anxious to ensure that political cowardice is not the downfall of Telecom Éireann as the company is too important.  The company must be ready to face competition, to grow and to provide work for its workers rather than to go into decline. Growth in telecommunications provides the possibility of more rather than less work for workers but if the Government hides behind the fiction that we can insulate ourselves from the changes in the telecommunications sector in Europe and throughout the world, it is condemning <Col N="1292" /> Telecom Éireann to a slow decline.</P>
    <P>A Government which treats Telecom Éireann in the way it has treated Aer Lingus does not deserve to be in Government.  Parties which are prepared to ignore the facts and allow the company to go into decline do not deserve to be in Government because they are not being fair to the country and in particular to those who work for Telecom Éireann. We in Fine Gael have been prepared to face the facts.  Deputy Noonan has put before the House a reasonably argued Bill designed to be of benefit to Telecom Éireann and the country.  It calls for a commonsense, visionary and fair response from the Government rather than the responses given by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and his colleagues to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will not be supporting this Bill for the many good reasons outlined by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on Tuesday last.  At the outset I would like to respond to some of the points raised by Deputy O'Keeffe, I am sure that he would accept, as a practising politician, that politicians do not mind being quoted provided, first, the quotation is accurate and, second, it is relevant. In his speech to the House last week the Minister, Deputy Cowen, said:</P>
      <P>I intend to take the necessary action to stimulate the development of this critically important sector without undue delay.  I am predisposed to increased competition and to independent regulation.  These two go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>Those are the facts.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, are acting on behalf of the consumer in conjunction with the management of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the debate so far that the Government's misgivings are shared by the great majority of speakers and I would like to touch on some of <Col N="1293" /> the issues which have been raised.  It is important to identify the real context in which this Bill is being brought forward. Some play was made of the difference between &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; and &ldquo;opportune&rdquo; by speakers on the other side.  It might have been argued, and I am not saying that we would accept it, that this Bill was opportune if we were somewhat more advanced on the road to open competition and if there had not been more pressing issues to be dealt with.  There are and we are dealing with them.  What we are doing of course in attempting to rebalance telephone charges is to prepare the way for more open competition and especially to place Telecom Éireann in a position to deal effectively with it. Indeed, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications made it quite clear that the competition question was under urgent consideration within the Department.  The Minister has also made it quite clear that he favours competition and is already moving towards independent regulation.  That is why, as a first step, there is to be a separation of &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; type functions within our Department from those relating to general policy and shareholder type functions.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated that whatever legislative and administrative arrangements prove necessary will be made in due course.  These are complex matters and will take time.  They cannot be dealt with by headline grabbing measures such as the one before us now.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have no hesitation in endorsing my colleague's view that this Bill is not at all opportune.  However it is quite obvious that it has been carefully tabled to coincide with the immediate effects of Telecom Éireann's rebalancing exercise, when Telecom Éireann is taking the first difficult but necessary steps on the road to competitive tariffing.  On any construction that is opportunistic, to say the least.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan stated that it was not an attack on Telecom Éireann.  It is difficult to see how it could be otherwise at a time when the company has had to take such difficult steps, especially in such a <Col N="1294" /> well orchestrated climate of hysteria. What is called for is a dispassionate analysis of the steps that have been taken. That, in turn, will not be possible until we have had a settling in period during which the rebalanced tariffs can take effect.  Let me re-emphasise that it is futile and irresponsible to play upon the fears of ordinary telephone users at this time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has already said in this debate, the information produced by Telecom last week gave the facts in relation to the effects of the tariff rebalancing as we have them at this stage. These figures have been analysed and reacted to in this House and in the media. We should now stand back from the issue and let the established patterns emerge and be subjected to independent analysis at the appropriate time.  I would point out, however, that the figures which Telecom Éireann produced were not based on a &ldquo;survey&rdquo; as has been suggested in some quarters, but were the result of analysis of actual telephone traffic during the month of September.</P>
    <P>The proposers of this Bill assure us that it is not related to the privatisation question.  I will leave that to the judgment of this House.  I noted, however, the passing reference by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald to the fact that privatisation was an issue across Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that this Bill, even though it would leave the ownership of the telecommunications network with Telecom Éireann, would do nothing to shift the onerous obligations contained in its universal service obligations from Telecom Éireann, and, accordingly, would give a free run at the more lucrative areas of opportunity in the telecommunications industry to a host of competitors.  One wonders, therefore, about the sincerity of statements that this Bill is not about ownership when ownership in such circumstances would be devalued to such an extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that Deputies are genuinely concerned about the universal service obligation and the effect of rampant competition on the provision of services in rural Ireland.  I would like to deal with that matter briefly.  It is a myth &mdash; I have listened to many of the contributions &mdash; that the charge of £120 for a telephone connection represents the total cost of providing a connection.  On occasion Telecom Éireann has to spend up to £25,000 in providing a modern telecommunications service to householders in remote rural areas.  People tend to forget <Col N="1296" /> this fact.  If we allow competition without first protecting the existing provider there will be cherry picking and rural areas will be left without a service.  Is this what Fine Gael want to achieve?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the stated purposes of Telecom Éireann's exclusive privilege is the provision of a national telecommunications service.  The obligation of network operators to provide a high quality universal service is recognised internationally and certainly in Community open market provisions. This Bill does not take proper account of the balance between those obligations as they are placed on Telecom Éireann and its ability to carry them out.  This is one of the most complex aspects of the regulatory function.  It will require careful consideration when the time comes to implement an independent regulatory authority and I believe this Bill falls very far short of the mark in taking it into account.</P>
      <P>There was a statement that in seeking a derogation from the opening up of voice telephony we had been an apologist for Telecom Éireann at Community level. As the person who negotiated this derogation let me say that nothing could be further from the truth.  Whereas there is a derogation in favour of Ireland and some other Community member states until the year 2003 there is no obligation on us to keep the doors to competition barred until that time.  Indeed, it would be foolish to do so.</P>

      <P>The fact is that there will be an investment of £870 million in telecommunications over the period of the plan.  This recognises the importance of the sector to our national economy.  It recognises, too, the relative openness of our economy and our peripheral position in relation to our Community partners.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that Telecom Éireann has funded an accelerated investment programme during the past decade from internally generated funds and high borrowings.  Telecommunications is, after all, an inherently profitable business.  It was never intended that EC co-financing would supplant industry expenditure in the sector.  Nonetheless we have secured significant assistance for some of the key areas in the telecommunications sector and the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The range of investments under the plan will facilitate the following developments, among others: the completion of digitalisation; the expansion of the fibre-optical network; further developments in mobile services; and significant improvements in international access. All this will lead to much higher telephone penetration &mdash; from 70 telephones per 100 households to over 80 per 100 households.</P>

      <P>Is fada mé ag cur spéise i gcúrsaí telecumarsáide. Caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir sé alltacht agus íontas orm mar dhuine óg nuair a chuaigh mé siar go Conamara ag obair a fháil amach ar an gcéad dul síos nach raibh na teileafoin ar fáil ann ar chor ar bith.  Thairis sin, má fuair tú teileafón bhí tú ag brath ar cheann de na sean-teileafoin láimhe a bhíodh againn ansin.  Ón am sin chuir mé romham go mba cheart féachaint chuige go mbeadh leathnú na seirbhíse ann, go mbeadh cothromú ó thaobh caighdeán na seirbhíse idir an taobh thoir agus an taobh thiar den tír agus go mbeadh cothromú freisin idir na táillí a ghearrfaí ins na réigiúin éagsúla.</P>
      <P>Le cúnamh an ineistíochta a rinneadh faoin Aire Airgeadais ag an am, Ailbhe Mac Raghnaill, deineadh dul chun cinn maith sna rudaí sin.  Ar an gcéad dul síos tá teileafóin le fáil i bhfad níos fairsinge sa tír anois ná mar a bhí an t-am sin. San áit a bhfuil cónaí orm féin agus i gConamara i gcoitinne tá méadú deich n-oiread ar líon na dteaghlach ina bhfuil teileafóin iontu thar mar a bhí ag tús na seachtóidí.</P>

Tá an fhadhb sin sáraithe sa chuid is mó den tír anois ainneoin go bhfuil ceantair áirithe, ceantar Chonamara agus ceantar an iarthair i gcoitinne ina measc, go mbíonn moill mór fós ar dhaoine ag fanacht ar theileafón.</P>

      <Col N="1300" /> Tá feabhas tagtha ar an treallamh leis. Tá cothromas bainte amach againn go bunúsach ó thaobh treallaimh de ach níl sé sin ann i bhfad.  Ba i mbliain 1987, sé bhliain ó shin, a cuireadh deireadh leis an malartan láimhe deireannach i gContae an Chlair agus san áit a bhfuil cónaí orm féin bhí orainn fanacht go dtí Méan Fomhair 1986, sé sin seacht mbliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas mór ó thaobh cúrsaí táillí de.  Cinnte tá feabhas mór ann, go mórmhór ó thaobh an mhí-chothromais damanta a bhíodh ann sa chaoi a bhíodh na táillí á ngearradh ar na réigiúin.</P>
    <P>There have been major changes in the balancing of charges between the regions.  When I and others instituted a campaign in an effort to have telephone charges rationalised we were told that things would remain as they were, that those who were privileged to have unlimited local calls to 400,000 subscribers would continue to have that privilege and that those who were confined to 1,000 local subscribers, where every call is a trunk call and paid for by the minute, would be left to rot.</P>
    <P>Last year a major step forward was taken.  There was a major extension of the local call areas, particularly in those worst affected rural areas.  For example, Clifden, which had 1,500 local call subscribers available to it suddenly had access to towns like Westport and Galway which were of major economic importance to them.  For the first time they enjoyed the privilege that so many people in the big centres of population take for granted, of being able to ring their county council, livestock office, hospital, tax office and all major services for the price of a local call.  There are lower costs for trunk calls and a reduction in the cost of international and eircell calls.  The lower cost of trunk calls is proportionately more important to people living in rural areas because it is well known that they make more trunk calls than those living in the main urban centres. For the first time, a principle was conceded under the new package which we enunciated at the beginning of our campaign, the recognition of the principle <Col N="1301" /> of a universal tariff for the whole country.  A major new development has been recognition of the principle that there could be a similar charge for all calls from any part of this island to any other part at weekends.  That is making rational use of technology because, as everybody knows, the cost of making a call relates more to time than to distance. There is also in rural areas for the first time the extension of free telephone services to helplines.  Until now people had to pay trunk call rates to avail of the helplines because they were outside the code area in which the service was based. If the service happened to be based in the capital city one was talking about paying the highest trunk rate.  Next April there will be a further 25 per cent decrease in A rate trunk calls.</P>
    <P>We made progress in the last few years but much remains to be done by the main supplier, Telecom Éireann.  Most of the necessary work will be done by only one supplier and I will refer to this later in the context of competition.  We want to ensure that connections are provided to all subscribers without delay, irrespective of location, and that all areas have an equal service.  The more isolated parts of the country have not yet been provided with a mobile telephone service.  If and when there is competition, companies should be obliged to provide such services not only in the large centres of population but also in small rural areas.</P>
    <P>Fibre optic lines must be extended. There will never be two suppliers of that type of equipment.  Regional tariff disparities, hidden or otherwise, must be ended.  For example, if someone in Dublin has access to 400,000 subscribers at the local call rate people in the country should also have access to the same number of subscribers at that rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not be achieved by the manner in which competition is being approached.  Even in the US there is no duplication of the basic hardware.  The idea of competition, of operating two parallel companies <Col N="1302" /> whereby two lines would be connected to each house, is a myth.  Regarding competition, it is usual for one company to provide the hardware and for another company to lease the use of that hardware to undercut the charges of the first company.  If such competition emerges a different rate will be charged for telephone connections in rural areas, they will be forced to do so because of economic market forces.</P>
      <P>Efficiency is needed in Telecom Éireann; it must adopt to new technology. There must be efficiency audits on the main supplier and the ground gained in the past few years must not be lost through clapping ourselves on the back and believing we have completed the work.  Technology is changing rapidly and there will be a need for continued major investment in telecommunications infrastructure if we are to compete in the modern world.  What has been achieved during the past 20 years is spectacular but there will be similar spectacular changes in the next 20 years which will require major cash investment, which can only be made by the major supplier if the future revenue of that supplier is secure. The Opposition spokespersons have not advanced a clear-cut measure by which they will secure that investment.  We must ensure that we guard against cherry picking. At present Aer Lingus is in crisis because when it was decided to introduce competition in the area of aviation not enough time or thought was given to creating a level playing pitch between the major and the subsidiary suppliers.</P>
      <P>If competition solved all ills, why is it only in the past two years that the banking sector changed to provide more reasonable opening hours?</P>

      <P>We must be wary of providing expensive duplication in what will always be a small market of five million people.  We must also ensure that we do not create false competition, what I call the train seat analogy.  For example, a train company might operate a Friday evening service to Cork and another company might block book seats on the train at a knock down rate.  The original company would then be forced to sell the seats to compete with the second company and bear the brunt of the cost.  That is not real competition, it is make-believe competition and I would not like to see it in the telecommunications service. There is room for real competition.  I have never objected to such competition being introduced to certain provisional services, but competition for the sake of competition &mdash; to accommodate some new fad &mdash; does not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that section 4 of the Bill proposes to remove power from the Minister and give it to a director.  As a democrat I would prefer a position in which the Minister is responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas and Deputies are responsible to the people.  The section proposes that the director would consult the Minister but that the director would fix the terms.  To whom would the director be responsible?  Responsibility for such major issues should be vested in those who are answerable to the people &mdash; the Minister &mdash; who is answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes advisory bodies.  The public are fed up with the establishment of more and more internal advisory bodies.  Such bodies are made up of different combinations or permutations of the same small groups of people.</P>

      <P>Most of those groups represent various sectional interests. That is the position having regard to recent proposals by Opposition parties in respect of suggested advisory groups.  It is time we had the guts to make decisions in this House which is answerable to the people.  Instead of changing structures perennially, the public services should be effective and efficient.  Main suppliers, like Telecom Éireann, must be efficient and we must adapt to new technology. The necessary investment must be made and secured so that the money borrowed can be repaid.  We must adhere to the principle that everyone has an equal right to technology and the same connection fee should be charged irrespective of where people live.  Everybody has a right to a telecommunications service that provides an equal tariff structure and does not impose additional charges in respect of distances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking in Brussels on 21 October 1993 the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Karel Van Miert, said that the success of the Single Market depends increasingly on essential public services, such as telecommunications, transport and energy.  He stated that it is imperative to open those, mostly State monopolies, up to competition.  He went on to say that the survival of those State monopolies in essential public services was an anachronism in a Single Market based on free and fair competition.</P>
      <P>What Mr. Van Miert said represents the thinking of the European Commission and indeed is representative of the thinking in most countries in Europe today.  Interestingly, Mr. Van Miert might in European political terms be described as left of centre.  His thinking is a long way from that of proponents of outdated socialism whom we still often hear in this House and in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's thinking in regard to the competitive position of these essential public services, particularly telecommunications, is a long way <Col N="1305" /> removed from, and a long way ahead of, the thinking of the Government espoused by the Minister and Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>I read with some disappointment, but not with any great surprise, the speech of the Minister on this Bill last week, who, in his usual &ldquo;boot boy&rdquo; approach, still seeks to justify what he and Telecom Éireann did last May, when they both seriously misled the public about the nature of the so-called &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; of charges announced at that time.</P>
    <P>Even as recently as last week the Minister continued to make the mistake of identifying himself 100 per cent with Telecom Éireann, with its corporate interests and its propaganda, even though the Minister is supposed to be the regulatory authority and is supposed to exercise an objective independence of Telecom Éireann, which of course from the time he assumed office he has failed to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now reduced to boasting that the bills of some telephone users will actually decrease because since 1 September people are using their telephones significantly less. According to Telecom Éireann, both the number and the duration of calls have declined since that date.  The Minister seems to see this as some kind of political and commercial triumph.  He and Telecom Éireann must be the only people in the world running a commercial service who see themselves as a success when, by their own incompetence and deception of the public, they induce their customers to use their services less.  What private company could possibly run on that basis?  I know of no company chairman who would boast that his public relations department mucked things up so much that it succeeded in diminishing the sales of the company's product by 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard all this before but let us say it again: telecommunications is central to Ireland's future.  Access to advanced, reliable and inexpensive telecommunications is essential for the <Col N="1306" /> development of the next century's information-based industries.  It is not sufficient simply to offer services like those of our neighbours and competitors. Rather we must take the lead in providing innovative communications services to bring industry to Ireland, and it is primarily the private sector with its interest in increasing market share of profitability which would provide the speedy innovation we require.  Ireland cannot be among the last to develop and implement innovative infrastructure merely because we have a relic of times past in the form of a State-owned, monopolistic telephone company of a kind so derided by Commissioner Van Miert.</P>
    <P>To compete with our larger trading partners we require a governmental structure which encourages competition and innovation, not one which spends its time trying to protect its own protégé The European Commission has been at the forefront in promoting communications competition.  Our neighbours in the United Kingdom have gone even further than the Commission in opening up their country to competition at all levels of service, including the local telephone service. It is no coincidence that the United Kingdom is experiencing the most rapid development of new services in Europe while seeing its telephone costs drop.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of living in a more competitive Europe, Telecom Éireann faces the prospect of tracking its sister State company, Aer Lingus, in a downward spiral if it does not change its approach.  It is frequently less costly and more convenient in terms of schedules to reach a great many international destinations by flying Aer Lingus to London and there changing to a flight in a much more competitive network.  In that way Aer Lingus merely acts as a ferry to London.  Similarly, it is less costly for many large Irish firms to export their telecommunications traffic to London via private lines and to utilise the greater variety of competitive network services there to reach their international destinations. As with Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann then only makes the much smaller revenues available from the Dublin to <Col N="1307" /> London route and, worse, becomes a marginal feeder network within Europe. Telecom Éireann has forecast that it will lose revenue of £200 million on US-bound calls alone over the next five years through this type of by-pass.  It is likely that the figure will be higher over all of Telecom Éireann's routes.</P>
    <P>We face the grave possibility that Telecom Éireann may reach the same position as Aer Lingus in the not too distant future and that this Government will divert itself around the margins by liberalising services seen as not &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; Telecom Éireann rather than by liberalising the entire sector.  In a competitive Europe there is no way to isolate and protect Telecom Éireann.  We can only protect it by having a vigorous competitive structure in which it plays a full and open part. Only a competitive structure will provide Irish consumers with a greater variety of services at less cost.  It is a competitive structure which will increase the overall size of the communications market, making Telecom Éireann a healthier business, much as competition in the US and UK have made AT&amp;T and British Telecom, both formerly monopolies, healthier businesses.</P>
    <P>What is lacking from Fine Gael's Bill is a clear call for competition.  Merely doing away with the monopoly provisions of the Communications Act of 1983 is not enough.  Rather, we need legislation where competition is the presumption and monopoly the anomaly, or as Mr. Van Miert calls it, the anachronism.  We need a governmental structure, much like our friends in the US and the UK, where innovation and competition are encouraged by a governmental regulatory authority. We need a structure within which problems of competition are resolved within a framework designed to promote and protect competition, rather than the unsatisfactory position we now have in Ireland.  Here, at present, potential competitors can appeal only to Brussels or to the courts in the absence of an independent non-departmental regulatory authority which is allowed and encouraged to see beyond the particular political <Col N="1308" /> and social problems of the State sector. Governmental whining and obtaining of derogations is no substitute for facing the hard facts of Telecom Éireann's future.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs communications legislation which lays out the rules for competition, and the means by which competitors and consumers can make sure that they are treated fairly and equitably by Telecom Éireann, which will have to operate in a transparent fashion. This is not the case at present.  The Fine Gael Bill does not go far enough along that road, but at least points in the right direction.  For that reason my party is happy to support it.  Like the Minister, we recognise that it has many drafting defects, but they are not important.  What does matter is the principle of the Bill, and that is certainly far preferable to the negative, ostrich-like pining for the certainties of the past to which the Government is addicted.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity to consider the speech by the Minister of State and I welcome the markedly different tone between it and the speech delivered by the Minister last week.  It is certainly more open in acknowledging that there are serious problems in this area and that they will have to be tackled in a certain way.  The main difference between the views of the Minister of State and those of many of us on this side of the House is that he thinks it will be time enough to tackle these problems in some years' time, on some undefined future occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is the case.  The problems are a great deal more urgent than that and need to be tackled much more quickly than on the slightly lackadaisical timescale the Minister of State has in mind.  However, it should be noted that he acknowledges the existence of the problems and his thinking, in so far as one can deduce it from his speech, seems to be along the lines advocated by the proponents of this Bill and by myself, even though a great <Col N="1309" /> deal of time may elapse before he gets to the stage of implementing it.</P>
      <P>I remember in 1984 and 1985 making speeches in this House about Aer Lingus which were not dissimilar in their intent from the one I am endeavouring to make tonight.  I pointed out that Aer Lingus was crazy to try to preserve the cartel situation in which it then operated and how much more beneficial it would be for the country, the company and its employees if it faced up to the reality of the modern world and accepted that competition was going to be forced on it from outside, whether or not it liked it.  I said that that was going to be the way of the world in the future and Aer Lingus should accept it and rise to the challenge and opportunity which competition presented rather than try to keep its head in the sand and hope things could go on as they had for many years prior to that. I suggested that Aer Lingus, which was then apparently a relatively successful company, could face very serious commercial difficulties if the market passed it by, so to speak, and it was unable to cope with the changing conditions in which it would have to operate.  Tragically, I was subsequently proven correct.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of being an Independent at that time and recall calling a number of divisions on the question of competition where the result was 165 to one.  The fact that I was in a minority of one did not mean that I was wrong, and events have shown that I was not.  I think future events will show that the points I am making tonight about Telecom Éireann are correct in so far as the future of the company is concerned.  The Government would be well advised to accept at the very least the principle contained in the Bill.  As I said, the Bill has many defects &mdash; it is not well drafted &mdash; but at least it sets out to do something which is useful.  This could be done better than the way proposed in the Bill, but the principle is what is important.  If there are defects in the Bill they can be remedied by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the regulatory question, it is interesting to note the thinking enunciated <Col N="1310" /> by the Minister of State where he said it is proposed to divide the Department in two, the operating part and the regulatory authority part.  That reflects exactly the thinking I advocated during the debate on the Irish Aviation Authority Bill recently passed by this House. A similar conflict arose in the case of that Bill.  This conflict arises in this case in a very clear way and the Minister of State now acknowledges that, something he did not do during the debate on the Irish Aviation Authority Bill.</P>
    <P>The way to deal with this difficulty, which has been recognised and, I think solved in every other country, is to set up a regulatory office which is independent of the Department.  The problem cannot be dealt with simply by dividing in two the Department or the section of it dealing with communications.  I would prefer to see something along the lines of the OFTEL office in Britain or what has been done in a number of the continental countries in Europe.  Nevertheless, the proposal now referred to by the Minister of State is at least a major advance on the situation where, up to very recently, we were told that change could not be contemplated in this respect.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech last week Deputy Noonan referred to an article on telecommunications in the European Community which appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 11 October last.  He may not have had the opportunity to develop this point in detail at that time.  I am sure the Minister of State has read the article, and I would recommend any Member of the House interested in this issue to read it.  The European scenario is very far removed from what is taken for granted here and from much of what has been represented by some of the speeches made by members of the Government.  It would be an eye opener to some people to realise what goes on in the real world. One should not assume that the real world is what goes on behind the rather high walls we tend to build around Ireland for our protection or the protection of our semi-State companies. The real world is represented in this <Col N="1311" /> article.  Interestingly, much of the article deals with Telecom Éireann &mdash; the author recognises the crossroads at which Telecom Éireann, in particular, stands and points out the direction in which it will have to move.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Few Telecom Éireann executives believe that the <i>status quo</i> is viable, even in the medium term.  Overseas operators offering businesses call-back and lease line facilities are fast eroding Telecom Éireann's international revenue. To staunch the flow a recent radical rebalancing of tariffs has reduced Telecom Éireann's international crisis sharply, while increasing local charges.  But that is only a palliative. Interest charges on 1980's investment are consuming half of Telecom Éireann's operating profit and if margins continue to fall Telecom Éireann's investment plans will suffer and so will the profits which the Government creams off.</P>
    <P>The article includes three charts which set out where different countries stand in relation to European telecommunications. Eleven of the countries are members of the Community.  I suppose Luxembourg is excluded because it is too small and is not representative.  Rather interestingly, Turkey is substituted for Luxembourg to make up the twelfth country.  Ireland is shown as having the smallest number of exchange lines and the lowest revenue of the 12 countries. One cannot make any point about this because we also have the smallest population and, unfortunately, a very low level of economic activity.  Therefore, that placing is to be expected.</P>
    <P>The third chart relates to productivity. All countries are potentially on an equal footing when it comes to productivity. Unfortunately, Ireland is at the bottom of the scale so far as productivity in telecommunications is concerned: it is substantially the worst of the 12 countries surveyed.  The next worst after Ireland are Turkey and Portugal.  This is a matter which should concern us.  Clearly we have problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I spoke in this House on a Private Members' Motion which I put down on behalf of my party on 18 May last when the increases in the local charges were first announced by the Minister and Telecom Éireann.  I drew attention in particular to the strong view likely to be taken by the European Commission and, if necessary, the European Court about what was being done, which seemed, in European terms, to be of very doubtful legality.  That appears to remain the position and the Commission is not enamoured of what has been put before it.  It is particularly disturbed that even at this stage no justification in terms of costs has been given for the action that was taken and which came into effect on 1 September.  That is unforgiveable and the legal challenges which are likely to take place as a result of what has happened are just as likely to be successful as I believed them to be when I was speaking on this subject last May.  I am not aware of anything that has changed the position.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that any advances we seem to make in this field, as indeed in so many other fields, are made only because they are forced on us by the rule of law from Brussels.  Our Ministers and Departments frequently spend much time and energy arguing against the general rule of the European Community being introduced into Ireland.  We have seen many examples of that in the broader social field.  Many advances have been made in social legislation and in social welfare legislation that would never have taken place here had they not been forced on us by the European Community.  The limited changes and advances that we have seen in relation to the telecommunications industry &mdash; and we lag way behind most of the Community in accepting the principles of competition, openness and transparency &mdash; have been made because Europe has forced them on us.</P>
    <P>It is a cause of great regret that even though the main Directives on the provision of service do not become compulsory and come into effect until June 1998, Ireland saw fit, with some of the other weaker peripheral states, to seek <Col N="1313" /> and to obtain a derogation until 30 June 2003.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State say tonight that that did not necessarily mean we would avail of that derogation.  That at least represents a healthier approach.  We obtained derogations in the past which we did not use and I remember on such occasions announcing at the earliest possible moment that we would not be availing of them.  The Minister or the Minister of State should announce now that we will not use this derogation because if Telecom Éireann, which is wholly owned by the Irish taxpayer, holds the view that it has another ten years in which to operate as a monopoly, without any competition, except around the margins and in some limited areas, no progress will be made in this area.  We must impress on Telecom Éireann that it should disregard the artificial protections which were negotiated for it, go out into the market place and operate in a way which is fully in accordance with the spirit of competition now being laid down by the European Union and, in particular, by Commissioner Van Miert.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful debate and I am grateful to Deputy Noonan for bringing forward this Bill, which we will be happy to support.  I presume it will be voted down in the normal way by the largest and most unthinking majority that this House has ever seen.  Nonetheless, if some of the contributions that have been made in the debate help to advance, to some degree, the thinking in this important area, it will have been worthwhile.</P>

      <P>Politics is an imperfect science.  There are no infallible politicians or parties and even Deputy O'Malley would not claim to be infallible.  I have great respect from my colleague from Limerick East but I also have a long memory.  He recited tonight some of the things he got right in his life and, naturally, <Col N="1314" /> he omitted some of the things he got wrong.</P>
      <P>I remember the Deputy on one occasion speaking passionately about nuclear energy, contending that it was a magic panacea for Ireland's ills.  He put this view forward locally and nationally and no one could tell him he was wrong.  He was headstrong and held this view for many years.  Many people told him that he was making a fool of himself but nonetheless he continued to make a fool of himself around the country.  Eventually, he recanted, went back on his word and took the opposite view.</P>
      <P>In regard to family planning, Deputy O'Malley was totally opposed to it and said it was a licence to fornicate.  Subsequently, he changed his mind on this matter.  The Deputy is not infallible.  He has no right to get into his pulpit and deliver homilies in this House about the action he took in regard to various matters when he was in power.  The Deputy's word has some weight in this House because of his record, and I admire him for that, but like the rest of us he has also been wrong on occasions and if I had time I would refer to the Deputy's record in Limerick East. However, I am not here to denounce Deputy O'Malley, I am here to contribute on another subject.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed also with my other collegue from Limerick East.  We seem to take opposite sides in many debates although I have much respect for him also.  However, this Bill reeks of opportunism. <Col N="1315" /> It is being put forward by Deputy Noonan as a panacea for the difficulties in the telecommunications industry. Deputy O'Malley touched upon some of the volatility and competition that exists in this area.  We are a small country with a scattered population giving a service to people in remote areas of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>This Bill has flaws, the major one being that it is an opportunistic attempt by the Deputy's party to play a relevant role in our society.  Fine Gael is seeking to have some relevance in our society at present but this Bill is no favourable advertisement for the party.  If the Deputy's party wishes to do good work in our society it should not adopt this &ldquo;flash in the pan&rdquo; approach.  It should help to find solutions to our problems rather than engage in the gimmicks and stunts that we have seen in this House.</P>
    <P>The approach in this Bill is too simple. The problems in this country cannot be cured by a Private Members' Bill.  Privatisation is not a magic wand to deal with the ills in our society or in Telecom Éireann.  The problem is much more complex than that and Deputy Noonan is well aware of this.  I have no objection to the company becoming more efficient and more competitive but the problems of Telecom Éireann will not be resolved by this Bill.  We must not rush in with simple solutions to complex problems.</P>
    <P>In regard to the European dimension to which Deputy O'Malley referred, Commissioner Van Miert was not much in evidence at the time of the débâcle in the Irish Sugar Company; he was silent when many people made large amounts of money from insider trading, using confidential, private, privileged information to enrich themselves.  I did not hear one word from Commissioner Van Miert on that occasion.  If we are to have a balanced attitude to the problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The establishment of the job protection unit to co-ordinate early warning systems within the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Enterprise and Employment generally was welcomed as a worthwhile initiative.  It was felt that, at last, workers could expect timely intervention.  Indeed the Minister, Deputy Qunn, invited everybody to support the establishment of that unit.  However, as his Department will be aware, there have been substantial redundancies in the flagship multinational companies of County Clare, in Syntex in Clarecastle and De Beers at Shannon.  Workers are concerned that this haemorrhage has not been stemmed <Col N="1318" /> by the unit.  They seek evidence that the officials of that unit have taken the initiative and they want confidence restored, which has not happened to date. Although employees in both companies enjoy substantial earnings they have major commitments.  Surely the work of this Departmental unit can be rendered more transparent?  For example, has the Minister given any help in reducing costs so that greater competitiveness could be achieved and say whether any new research and development and-or marketing regimes have been proposed?</P>
      <P>There are rumours of additional voluntary redundancies in De Beers leading to greater insecurity on the part of workers.  Surely the Department has made its expertise available to these companies? f Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment indicate whether his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will take any initiatives to maintain jobs in manufacturing industry here.</P>
      <P>In our region there has been the insecurity of recent decisions in regard to Shannon Airport and the present instability in multinational companies.  Having listened to the Minister when he spoke so eloquently in the course of Question Time about this job protection unit I had hoped that we would have had evidence of assistance by now.  After all, we witnessed the débâcle at Digital and other industries.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate his intentions in relation to the alleged 90 or 100 redundancies in De Beers and whether some new initiative will be undertaken in that regard?  Surely something can be done to prevent the wholesale loss of jobs in the region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent times in the mid-west region, with the haemorrhage of jobs in the case of prestige multinational companies such as Syntex, De Beers and Aughinish Alumina and the uncertainty of the future role of Shannon, there has been much insecurity felt by workers generally.  For a long time the mid-west was identified as the linchpin of industrial progress but there is now a great sense of despondency in the region. <Col N="1319" /> In my county of Limerick the main arterial route is the Shannon Estuary, long identified as an area for potential jobs, once described as a jewel of the western world.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s a few projects were established there, particularly the ESB projects at Moneypoint and Tarbert, with Aughinish Alumina recognising the potential at the time to create an Alumina plant there, which provided 5,000 construction jobs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Indeed many in County Limerick regarded Aughinish Alumina as the flagship industry of the area where up to recently there were 600 jobs; now 135 redundancies have been agreed.  These redundancies will create a sense of gloom and despondency, not alone in County Limerick but in North Kerry and Limerick city since many people from those areas work in that plant.  I shudder to think what many of the people who work there, in management and in the plant, will fall back on.</P>
      <P>There has been much rhetoric about the Shannon Estuary.  I remember the Taoiseach, shortly after his election, speaking at an Irish Management Institute Conference in Killarney classifying it as a great area for transhipment; then the buzz word changed and recently it was called a trading bridgehead.  A project team has been meeting for some time past but I am very sceptical about their endeavours because I have not seen anything worthwhile come to fruition; there appear to be merely hot air proposals. I should like the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to come to grips with this matter and ascertain what the project team is doing with regard to targeting potential industry along the estuary.</P>
      <P>An industrial park in Askeaton, County Limerick has lain idle for many years and I should like to think that industry could be attracted there.  At one stage it was thought that a health care project had been procured for the area but it was eventually hived off to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that the Minister would give something back to the mid-west <Col N="1320" /> region, the subject of considerable buffeting in recent times, some of it at the hands of Government.  He should do something to compensate for recent job losses there.  One thing appreciated by the management of Aughinish Alumina was that the Minister allocated £500,000 to the establishment of his enterprise support unit.  We also appreciate the present talks with the county enterprise team in an effort to steer some future projects for the benefit of employees there.  I would like to think that other companies in a similar situation would consider the same type of venture and a similar allocation of funds equivalent to the number of redundancies to soften the blow.  Perhaps we should seriously target extra industries for the Shannon estuary area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies opposite for raising these matters. I know they are both concerned about developments in their area.  I should like to refer to the points they raised.  Aughinish Alumina is a major employer with just under 600 people employed at their Limerick plant.  Unfortunately the market for their specific product, alumina, is in recession at the moment and it will be some time before there is an upturn.  Faced with an over supply of alumina in world markets, Aughinish was left with no alternative but to announce a certain number of redundancies in order to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.  This was part of a comprehensive survival plan which, hopefully, will secure the continued presence of Aughinish in Limerick as a viable and enduring operation.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is working closely with the company to assist those being laid off to restart in business themselves. In this connection a number of programmes and services geared specifically to the creation of new indigenous enterprises are being utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other company to which reference was made, De Beers, in common with other international trading organisations, has also been affected by the ongoing <Col N="1321" /> world recession.  In order to remain competitive it has found it necessary to reduce employee numbers.  I am aware that De Beers has operated successfully in Shannon for over 33 years and is a major contributor in terms of employment and output in the region.  Shannon Development has always worked closely with De Beers in the past and will continue to do so in order to ensure its continued presence at Shannon as a successful and dynamic company.</P>
    <P>The major restructuring programme which has been put in place by GPA will ensure its future at Shannon and, while there have been some redundancies, the long term prospects for this company and their new partners, General Electric, have been enhanced by the restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to re-emphasise what I said in the Dáil last month in answer to a question on the employment situation in the Shannon region.  The mid-west has a first-class industrial infrastructure which will be used to develop industrial enterprise over the coming years.  Shannon Development and the IDA are achieving continued success in bringing new companies onstream and in generating increases in employment and output within existing companies. Specifically within the Shannon region a selection of key resources is already in place which will ensure that growth and development will continue apace.  These facilities include the Shannon free zone, the National Technological Park at Plassey, the Shannon World Aviation Park, the Shannon Estuary as well as Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The cyclical nature of international markets and their interaction with the internal dynamics of multinational trading corporations must inevitably mean that employment in existing companies will fluctuate over time in response to changing conditions.  Allowing for that, it is of some significance that last year, for the fifth year in succession, Shannon Development achieved a net increase in employment in the industrial areas for which it is responsible.  Shannon also exceeded its job creation target for new <Col N="1322" /> jobs in 1992 set for the region under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Given the extremely difficult business climate which exists at present all of us will recognise that this is a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note today I announced the establishment of a major project in Limerick by the AST research corporation &mdash; the fourth largest personal computer company in the United States. This project, the details of which were announced this afternoon at 3 p.m., will create 600 new jobs.</P>

Ach toisc go bhfuil an méid sin tithe tógtha anois i gCnoc na Cathrach tarlaíonn sé nach bhfuil an bóthar, go Kingston go háirithe, in ann glacadh leis an trácht atá ar an mbóthar.  Tharla anchuid timpistí, ar an mbóthar.  cheana féin agus is oth liom a rá gur maraíodh triúr deirtear liom.  Tá an dáinséar ann go dtarlóidh tuilleadh timpistí uafásach ann de bharr an brú tráchta air.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of the Kingston Road is greatly in excess of its capacity.  An intolerable situation has existed there for the past few years, yet nothing is being done and the bad situation becomes continuously worse.</P>
      <P>The situation that has developed is a classical example of lack of advance planning and of co-ordination between those in control of urban housing development and those in control of overall roads policy.  The local authority responsible for housing development, in this case Galway Borough Council, has had all its plans for assistance and recognition of the problem by the Department of the Environment totally ignored to date.  The Minister for the Environment has been made aware of this problem by me and others, including the combined residents association in the area of Knocknacarra, but all to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 March 1992 the Minister wrote to me stating it was the responsibility of the local authority and that they had <Col N="1324" /> discretion to spend money from their block grant on this road.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to your letter in connection with traffic problems in the Galway Borough area in the vicinity of Knocknacarra.  My Department is aware of the necessity to improve the road network between Knocknacarra and Bishop O'Donnell Road.  As you are aware, however, the planning and development of road improvement projects rests primarily with the local authority.</P>
    <P>A proposal for the provision of a western distribution road between Bishop O'Donnell Road and the County Borough boundary was submitted to my Department by Galway Corporation in October, 1990.  The local authority were informed that as the proposed road would be a non national road the planning and execution of works, including the provision of the necessary finance, was a matter for the corporation.  The corporation may use the block grant provided annually by my Department to supplement expenditure from its own resources on such works.</P>
    <P>The letter continues in this vein.  The suggestion that the corporation could do this work out of a block grant was insulting because the Minister knew, at the time of writing that letter, that the block grant being allocated to Galway Corporation was only sufficient to maintain the surface of city roads and to provide and repair some footpaths.</P>
    <P>In a letter to Galway Corporation on 27 August 1992 the Department of the Environment stated:</P>
    <P>As the proposed road would be a non national road the cost of improvement works would, in accordance with normal practice, further be financed by the local authority from their own resources, supplemented at their discretion by the block grant for roads paid annually by the Department.</P>
    <P>This repeats the ridiculous suggestion that this could be done out of the block grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> On 4 September 1992 I requested the Minister to meet a deputation from the combined residents' association of Knocknacarra and although he agreed at the time, he subsequently cancelled the arrangements.  The Galway city engineer states there is justification for the Western Distributor Road, also known as the Western Inner Relief Road, because of the inadequacy of the existing road network and in particular the Kingston Road with regard to capacity and alignment; the lack of traffic capacity at the junction of the Shangort Road (Distributor) and the Kingston Road; the inadequacy of capacity of Ballymoneen Road junction with the Barna Road; the elimination of traffic pressure on Taylor's Hill and Threadneedle Road junction; to provide a quicker link to the city area and the peripheries by means of the Quincentennial Bridge; to ensure that State investment in the Eastern approach road system is maximised to the extent that it does not terminate in a bottleneck, but rather distributes via this proposed Western Distributor Road as intended; and to facilitate further development and to ensure that future development does not cause increased pressure on the existing road network.</P>
    <P>The proposed road, the design of which has been with the Department since 1990, is 3.25 kilometres.  In the opinion of the borough engineer, the existing road network is incapable of dealing with the traffic utilising it, particularly during peak times.  The corporation is concerned about the extent of public disquiet on this issue and the conflict between the volume utilising the roadway and its actual capacity.</P>
    <P>Examination of the traffic shows that in excess of 1,300 PCU's per hour utilise Bishop O'Donnell Road while 356 PCUs per hour traverse the Taylor's Hill Road from its junction with Threadneedle road to Nile Lodge and a further 1,125 PCUs per hour traverse the Kingston Road. The estimated AADT is about 13,000 on Bishop O'Donnell Road, 3,600 on Taylor's Hill and 11,000 on the Kingston Road.  The significance of all of this is clear when one compares it with UK standards <Col N="1326" /> of 500 PCUs per hour as outlined by the Department of the Environment in <i>Roads in Urban Areas</i> under the heading, Practical Capacities of Two-Way Urban Roads.  It is clear that the capacity of the Kingston Road is approximately 500 PCUs per hour.  Clearly, there is a great dilemma and according to the city engineer the Western Distributor Road is totally justified.</P>
    <P>The proposed road is 3.25 kilometres in extent and the line as proposed and adopted by Galway Corporation follows the contour which represents the area between semi-arable and moorland and traverses an area which has been designated development land.  In the city development plan it is envisaged that the population of Knocknacarra will be 10,000 persons by the end of the century and approximately 14,000 persons by the year 2010.  Each development of 100 houses represents a traffic increase of 700 AADTs.</P>
    <P>The city engineer claims the road is justified from the point of view of current traffic as well as the traffic to be accommodated. There will be a number of roundabouts and the city engineer estimates that the overall cost of providing the road will be £5.707 million.</P>
    <P>In a report to the council in 1992 the city engineer concluded:</P>
    <P>This Project is requiring to be done sooner rather than later as the situation which pertains in the Kingston Road is no longer acceptable and, indeed, is giving rise to much agitation in the area at present.</P>
    <P>The report of the Knocknacarra Combined Residents Association which I submitted to the Minister 12 months ago states that they speak on behalf of 15 separate residents' associations representing 1,700 houses.  They state also that several major isues have arisen which have not been adequately addressed, one of which is the traffic flow and the traffic management of the Kingston-Barna road.  They claim that the completion of the Quincentennial Bridge and all the housing developments at Knocknacarra mean that the vast bulk of <Col N="1327" /> traffic converges on the Barna-Kingston road.  These roads were just country roads but have now become the main artery of westward bound and inward city bound traffic.  The roads can no longer service the Knocknacarra area and the only solution is the new Western Distributor Road.  This proposed road has been at the planning stage for the past number of years and must become a top priority if traffic chaos is to be avoided.  Long delays have been experienced by residents in the mornings, afternoons and evenings when going to work or bringing their children to the five schools in the immediate area.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that the quality of life of the Kingston Road residents has been seriously eroded over the past five to seven years because of the heavy traffic. An editorial in the local newspaper on 16 June states:</P>
    <P>...residents of the estates verging onto Kingston-Knocknacarra-Barna strip of road are now looking out onto something akin to &ldquo;Brands Hatch&rdquo; at peak traffic times and see no resolution in sight to their problems.  This road is little more than what is laughingly described as a &ldquo;country road&rdquo; which has turned into a main highway because of the fact that the new city ring roads system has funnelled traffic from the eastern side of the city right around the city and out to a junction at the top of Threadneedle Road where it is duly despatched on its way to Connemara.</P>
    <P>In the same article the editor uses words like &ldquo;death trap&rdquo; and &ldquo;killer cocktail&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The time for passing the buck has stopped.  The Department's ridiculous suggestion that Galway Corporation could do this essential work out of the block grant is not credible and makes the Minister look foolish.  It is imperative that the 1994 Estimate contain a provision to enable this work to commence.</P>

      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil an Bóthar Iartharach Dáilitheach le Bóthar an Easpaig <Col N="1328" /> Uí Dhomhnaill a cheangal le Bóthar an Cheapaigh, fad 3km.  San fhad tréimhse táthar ag súil go gceanglófar an bóthar nua leis an mBóthar Réigiúnach siar ó dheas ó Bhearna, i limistéar an Chontae.</P>
      <P>Leag Bárdás na Gaillimhe togra isteach sa Roinn i mí Dheireadh Fómhair, 1990 le haghaidh an Bóthar Iartharach a thógáil agus leis an airgead a ba gá leis a fháil, £3.8 milliún a bhí measta ag an am.  Chuir an Bardas roinnt fáthanna ar aghaidh ag tacú leis an dtogra.  Réiteodh sé na heaspaí a bhí ann i líonra na mbóthar mar a bhí, réiteodh sé an fhadhb maidir le brú tráchta ar bhóthar Kingston agus ar roinnt gabhal eile, ina measc an Bóthar Ard agus Bóthar na Mine Buí.  Chonacthas don mBardás go mbeadh ról tábhachtach ag an mbóthar nua ag ligean do fhorbairt tarlú amach anseo ar iarthar na cathrach, tithíocht ach go háirithe.</P>
      <P>Mhínigh mo Roinn féin, agus í ag freagairt don tógra, gur bóthar nach bóthar náisiúnta é an bóthar seo agus dá bhrí sin go raibh pleanáil agus cur i gcrích an bhóthair, chomh maith le hairgeadú an bhóthair ag brath go hiomlán ar an mBardas é féin.  Níor cuireadh i gcoinne, áfach, úsáid an bhloc-dheontais a chuireann an Roinn ar fáil chuile bhliain le cur le haon achmhainní a chuirfeadh an Bardás féin i dtreo na scéime, óna gcuid airgid féin.</P>
      <P>Níorbh fhéidir ag an am, nó san idirlinn, deontas spéisialta a chur ar fáil don mBardas i gcoir na n-oibreacha seo.  Cé go gcuirtear deontais speisialta ar fáil ó am go chéile do údaráis áitiúla le haghaidh scéimeanna ar bhóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad tá ciste na ndeontais seo anteoranta. Is é an nós ata ann ná an méid is mó airgid a chur an fáil mar bhloc dheontas comhairlitheach le go dtugtar an méid is mo saoirse do bhaill tofa na n-údarás áitiúil le cinneadh a dhéanamh ar an cláracha oibreacha bóithre bliantúla, agus ar na tosaíochtaí a thugtar do scéimeanna éagsula ar bhóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an soláthar airgid ar fad atá ann i mbliana do dheontais speisialta ná £5.7 milliún.  Is fiú a chur san áireamh gur ionann an figiúr seo go beacht agus an <Col N="1329" /> meastúchán is déanaí a rinneadh ar chostas an Bhóthair Dháilithigh.  Ní bheadh sé réalaíoch a cheapadh go gcuirfí an soláthar iomlán ar fáil do scéim amháin nuair is feidir leis an airgead cúnamh a thabhairt do suas le 18 scéim ar fud na tíre a bhaineann fiúntas leo freisin.</P>
    <P>Lean an Bardas ar aghaidh lena gcuid iarratais ag cuartú airgid cúpla uair ó shin i leith, an ceann is deireannaí ar an 11ú Lúnasa i mbliana, agus d'iarr siad go n-íocfaí na deontais i gcodanna, thar roinnt blianta.  Tá an scéal mar a bhí, áfach, agus níl aon chaoi gur féidir liom aon deontais a chur ar fáil i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá diomá orm ag tabhairt faoi deara ón iarratas is deireannaí nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag an mBardas aon airgead dá gcuid féin a chur go díreach isteach sa mBóthar Dáilitheach.  An t-aon cúnamh a chuirfidh an Bárdas ar fáil don scéim ná airgead a thiocfaidh ó na táillí pleanála a d'fhéadfadh a bheith ann ó thithíocht sa cheantar.  Is é iomlan an cúnaimh airgid seo ná timpeall £350,000 thar 3 bliana, agus is léir nach bhfuil a dhóthain anseo le tús na scéime a thabhairt chun tosaigh.</P>
    <P>Chuir mo Roinn neart cúnaimh i bhfoirm deontais ar fáil do Bhardas na Gaillimh le blianta beaga anuas do bhóithre áitiúla sa chathair agus leis na bóithre náisiúnta a fheabhsú i gceantar na cathrach.</P>
    <P>Idir na blianta 1987 agus 1992 cuireadh deontais thar £12 milliún ar fáil don mBardas.  Cuireadh £711,000 ar fáil i 1993.  Baineann an chuid is mó de na híocaíochtaí seo le togáil Bhóthar Nua Oirthearach na Gaillimhe, Droichead na Coiribe mar chuid dó, mar cho-oibriú idir an Bardas agus na Comhairle Chontae.  I mí Mheán Fomhair seo caite dhearbhaigh mé an Ráiteas um Tionchar Comhsaoil don triú chéim agus an chéim dheireannach den bhóthar Oirthearach a shíneoidh ó Pháirc Mheirline go dtí an Baile Bán.  Meastear go mbaineann costas £6 mhilliún leis an gcuid seo agus ta mé ag súil go dtógfar é i 1995 agus 1996.</P>
    <P>Sa bPlean Forbartha Náisiúnta a foilsíodh le déanaí deantar meastúchán ann le haghaidh méadú san infheistíocht i mbóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad, agus <Col N="1330" /> a bhfuil tábhacht leo don eacnamaíocht. Thar an tréimhse 1994-99 tá mé ag súil go gcuirfear deontais Stáit de luach £475 milliún ar fáil le haghaidh na mbóithre seo a fheabhsú.  Tá san áireamh le seo £235 milliún a bhfuil súil leis a bheidh cáilithe le híocaíochtaí a fháil ó Chiste Fhorbartha Réigiunach na hEorpa agus a thabharfaidh mo Roinn féin amach mar dheontais do scéimeanna éagsula a chuirfidh na húdaráis áitiúla ar fáil ar an mbonn go gcuirfidh siad le cruthú fostaíochta, forbairt tuaithe agus gníomhaíocht eacnamiúil, i dtionsclaíocht agus i dturasóireacht ach go háirithe.</P>
    <P>Déanfar socrú maidir le sonraí an scéim deontais seo i gcomhairle le Coimisiún an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh agus cuirfear in iúl iad do na húdaráis áitiúla chomh luath agus is féidir.  Beidh sé ag brath ar Bhardas na Gaillimhe athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar a iarratas le haghaidh airgeadú an Bhóthair Dháilithigh i dtéarmaí na socraithe nua seo agus i gcomhthéacs an chiste iomláin a bheidh ar fáil le haghaidh fheabhsú bóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad agus a bheidh cáilithe le haghaidh cabhair ón gComhphobal Eorpach.  Bheadh ar an mBárdas a chur in iúl cén tosaíocht a cheanglaíonn an Bardas féin leis an scéim seo agus le scéimeanna ar bith eile gur mhaith leis a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go ndáileofar an t-iarmhéid do £240 milliún, nach mbeidh i dteideal ais-íocaíochtaí a fháil ón gComhphobal Eorpach, go ginearálta mar atá a dhéanamh faoi láthair ag mo Roinn i dtaobh na mbloc deontais comhairlitheacha le haghaidh feabhsuchán ar bhóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad.</P>
    <P>Approximately £30 million was provided by my Department for road improvement works in Galway city in recent years and there are proposals to carry out further improvements at a cost of £6 million in the next few years.  The road in question does not come within the ambit of the national primary routes and the total funds available to the Government for those type of roads is £5.7 million for the country as a whole. We have undertaken 18 projects throughout <Col N="1331" /> the country and, in the circumstances, it was not possible to provide financial support for the project to which the Deputy referred.  However, it will be considered in the context of submissions by Galway Corporation for special regional and important routes for industry, tourism and commercial development provided for in the National Development Plan.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Food Quality Standards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue.  Many consumers will have been disturbed to discover from newspaper headlines during the past week that a recent survey revealed 11 out of 15 brands of food tested had at least one sample of bacterial content exceeding international limits.  It is of particular concern that this would never have come to light if the consumers' association, a voluntary body surviving on a shoestring, had not had the opportunity, commissioned by the EC, to carry out the survey.  The public have a right to know why the Minister and the officials of his Department did not carry out adequate monitoring, particularly in respect of food shown to contain harmful samples of bacteria.  A total of 20 per cent of a particular unbranded food product revealed harmful bacteria associated with food poisoning.</P>
      <P>Overall, the findings of this survey were disturbing for the Irish food industry. A total of 28 per cent of all chilled ready to eat products exceeded permissible levels in France, 300,000 parts of bacteria per gram.  In the case of one product, 100 per cent of samples tested exceeded the French standard and in another 75 per cent exceeded that limit.  It is particularly disturbing for consumers that one in five cases of unbranded products showed the presence of dangerous bacteria.  However, it is reassuring that none of the familiar household food brands tested showed a presence of dangerous bacteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> The survey also highlighted the inadequacy of nutritional information on some branded food products.  The law states that people selling branded food products should specify the fat, meat and other content of the foods they are selling. It is disappointing that at least one company surveyed did not display such information on its products.  Will the Minister inform the House if other companies fail to meet nutritional information requirements?  At a time when consumers are becoming increasingly health conscious, many of the products surveyed contained a high fat content that would not be compatible with the recommendations of any health programme.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider the findings of this survey.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that the inspectorate in his Department will carry out a more detailed and properly resourced study urgently so that recommendation can be made in key areas to reassure customers and restore our international reputation? Such recommendations should set out the standards which should apply in regard to bacteria content in food and state whether we should set a limit in the interest of quality production as is the case in France and the Netherlands.  They should also specify the handling by distributors and retailers which must be observed to ensure quality standards are maintained throughout the shelf life of a product.  We are all familiar with the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date on products but the survey showed that some products failed to meet the quality standards required within that time.  That may have been because the temperature of the chillers in which they were preserved was too low to preserve their quality.  The Minister should tell the House the recommendations he intends to make to retailers and distributors in that regard. He should also state the inspection method he intends putting in place so that in the long term consumers can be assured of quality rather than being taken by surprise by newspaper headlines.</P>
    <P>Associated with that we will have to consider seriously the need to invest in <Col N="1333" /> the industry to meet that problem.  Can we ensure that Structural Funds available to support the food industry are set aside for this purpose?  Consumers, particularly those in the European markets into which we are trying to direct our products, are becoming very discerning. Banner headlines proclaiming that Ireland has the worst record for bacteria content, double that of our nearest neighbour and 14 times that of the French, do not do our reputation any good.  The survey was part of a European survey and the results will become available to our competitors, who will use it ruthlessly to try to gain advantage in the market. We cannot afford this sort of damage to our reputation.</P>
    <P>The Irish food industry rightly prides itself on its quality, greenness and wholesome food products and we cannot risk damage to that reputation.  We need regulations and stern enforcement from the Department to protect our reputation for the many producers who are penetrating the European markets.</P>
    <P>The future for the food industry lies in adding value and in getting to the ultimate consumer a product with plenty of added value.  That means penetrating the international &ldquo;ready to eat&rdquo; market.  It is worrying that this survey of &ldquo;ready to eat&rdquo; food has shown Ireland wanting in this area.  The industry and the producers have no option but to set their sights on beating the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's reply will outline steps by which we can protect and enhance the reputation of Irish food at home and abroad.  This industry already employs about 40,000 people but has the potential to employ many more if we get the balance right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is referring to media reports on a survey commissioned by the EC Commission on cook-chill ready to eat meals on sale in EC countries.  This survey was commissioned by the consumer policy service of the EC Commission and, I am sure, is the first of many such surveys.  It was conducted by the consumer associations <Col N="1334" /> of each member state.  It is imperative that we have regard to the findings of these surveys and we learn to apply the valuable lessons that they teach us. The Deputy will be aware, of course, that the results of this survey have not yet been conveyed to the Department of Health and so I am unable to comment in detail on its contents.  I am, however, aware of media reports of its findings: in particular, the reported failure of a number of cook-chill ready to eat meals on sale in Ireland to meet the high standards set by the French authorities.  I have, therefore, asked the EC Commission for a full copy of the survey and the associated detailed findings.</P>
      <P>Our Food Safety Advisory Committee has also set relevant guidelines in its reports on microbiological guidelines for meat and meat products, milk, cream and ice cream, eggs and fish and also in its report on cook-chill systems.  I have asked the Food Safety Advisory Committee to consider again the situation generally with regard to cook-chill systems and to report to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I will, of course, also ask them carefully to review the results of the EC survey when it comes to hand and will issue a further statement on this as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Breaches of the guidelines referred to do not constitute a threat to public health but are indicative of a need to improve the quality control systems in the operation. This fact does not give us any cause for complacency and I wish to advise the Deputy that I am fully committed to ensuring that standards of food safety in Ireland remain high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also remind everyone of the importance of ensuring that the cold chain for frozen and chilled foods is carefully monitored at all times.  There is a clear obligation on all manufacturers, distributors and retailers to ensure that their staff are fully conversant with all the safety aspects of food storage and handling. There is no shortage of courses and organisations willing to provide or indeed to tailor make courses, if necessary, for all food premises regardless of size.  The <Col N="1335" /> food industry is one of our more important industries and it is imperative that everyone involved in the food business uphold our enviable reputation for quality and safety.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that foodborne illness generally is on the increase in all modern states.  The causes of such illness is often not clearly understood and many incidences go unreported. Reports such as this are indeed helpful to everyone involved.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an increase in the evolution of the technology of all aspects of food production and marketing.  Food products available on our supermarket shelves range from the most basic primary food to a vast range of sophisticated and complex ready to eat meals.  The scale of production and distribution has also increased dramatically with a commensurate increase in the risk to the health of the public.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty and the related completion of the Internal Market has guaranteed that our food products may be freely exported and sold to other member states without barriers or tariffs.  It is imperative for the success of the Internal Market that all member states have comparable standards that protect and reassure not only their own nationals but all European citizens. The EC, while remaining sensitive to the cultural diversities of the member states, is also determined to ensure food safety standards consistent with the needs of public health across the EC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> The Deputy will be aware that in association with our EC colleagues we have embarked on a major initiative to bring our food laws and enforcement arrangements into line with the needs of modern and sophisticated food industry.  We are also increasing the number of food inspectors deployed in each health board area.  I have asked my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to review the arrangements for the inspection of food plants involved in the production of these types of food.</P>
    <P>As part of a general review of our public health programme we are actively considering new structures in each health board which will improve management efficiency and ensure a more even and equitable application of our food laws.</P>
    <P>We are currently considering certain changes in the formation and constitution of the Food Safety Advisory Committee to ensure that we will have the best up to date expertise available to us at all times. In particular we are considering arrangements which will ensure that both industry and consumer interests are fully consulted in the ongoing development of our policy on food safety.  We have provided significant capital investment for re-equiping our three public analyst's laboratories this year and have provided additional technical staff in each of these laboratories.  We are committed to continue developments in the food safety area to ensure our standards continue to be maintained at the highest level.</P>

    <P>The protection of human rights is a <Col N="1217" /> legitimate concern of the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government closely monitors human rights questions and, in cases where this appears justified, draws its concerns and the concerns of Deputies to the attention of other Governments.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that our concern to see human rights universally upheld is best advanced by an approach which considers carefully &mdash; where appropriate in conjunction with our EC partners who share our concerns &mdash; when to make direct representation to a foreign government about an individual case.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information at present available to me I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to write to each of the Governments about the individual cases mentioned in the questions.  However, I am willing to keep individual cases under review and to consider any additional information the Deputy may wish to send me.</P>

      <P>I have raised these three cases with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  The Secretary of State announced some months ago that he would review the matter and indicated subsequently that he was examining additional material in the context of this review.  Accordingly, I do not propose to call on the British Government to institute an independent inquiry.  I have made it quite clear, in the light of the widespread doubts which have been expressed about these cases, that I would welcome a decision to refer them back to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>These cases, and the concerns to which they have given rise, illustrate the importance which attaches to ensuring adequate safeguards and access to legal counsel for persons in custody.

      <P>The current specified interest rates, i.e. the interest rates used to determine the benefit-in-kind charge for preferential loans made to employees by their employers, were set in the Finance Act, 1992, by reference to the prevailing commercial rates.  When announcing the new specified rates in my 1992 Budget Statement I stated that the rates would be reviewed before each budget to take account of variations in commercial rates of interest.  Because of the substantial administrative burden involved in making variations to the specified rate, and the associated changes in individual tax allowances, it would not be practical to adjust the specified rate in response to every change of market rates during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of months up to and following my 1993 budget market rates were considerably higher than the specified rates, resulting in a considerable benefit to those in receipt of preferential <Col N="1223" /> loans.  However, because of the exceptional circumstances prevailing at that time I chose not to increase the specified rates to market levels in 1993.</P>
    <P>In recent months market rates have dropped.  Movements in commercial interest rates are monitored closely by my Department.  In accordance with my undertaking of 1992 I intend to further review the specified interest rates before the next budget.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me concerning the cash flow implications of the withholding tax.  The withholding tax on professional services was introduced in 1987.  It affects companies and the self-employed who offer professional services to the public sector.  In effect what withholding tax does is to bring forward the payment of tax, resulting in a cash flow gain to the Exchequer.  It does not impose any additional tax liability.  Moreover, there are specific safeguards in the legislation. A system of interim refunds operates to ensure that deductions do not exceed the individual's liability in the previous tax year.  Adjustments are made where the previous year's liability is unusually high and there are special considerations for individuals in their first year of operation.</P>

      <P>Child Benefit is payable in respect of all children normally resident in the State, up to the age of sixteen or up to eighteen years of age if the child is in full time education or physically or mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>In the last budget the rate of child benefit was increased from £15.80 to £20 in respect of each of the first three children and to £23 in respect of the fourth and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>While the rate of child benefit paid in Ireland is relatively low in an EC context, it should be noted that five member states operate a means/income test in relation to child benefit payments, whereas other countries, including Ireland, make child benefit payments regardless of income or insurance contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, simple comparison of the level of basic child benefit payments in different countries does not give a comprehensive picture of income support for children.  Ireland is one of only five EC member states which pays increased <Col N="1225" /> social welfare payments in respect of children in relation, for example, to unemployment payments.  Families on low incomes in Ireland are further supported through the Family Income Supplement and by the child related tax exemption limits.</P>
    <P>The total amount of social welfare expenditure directed specifically towards children is estimated to be over £500 million annually.  Child benefit accounts for nearly half of this amount.</P>
    <P>The Government, recognises the important contribution of Child Benefit as an income support mechanism and, as indicated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it is intended to further increase child benefit over time, following integration of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>

      <P>The schemes in question are part of my overall vigorous, pro-active, work supportive programme of incentives, options and opportunities which are available to unemployed people.  These initiatives are designed to provide opportunities for long term unemployed people and to encourage them to make the transition back into the workforce.  Anyone wishing to participate in these schemes should contact their local social welfare office where they will be furnished with all the necessary details.  The following is a brief description of each scheme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme:</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is designed to allow long term unemployed people to work part-time for up to 24 hours a week while receiving a flat rate <Col N="1226" /> allowance instead of their unemployment payments.  The allowances are currently £37.80 for a single person and £62.10 for a married person with a dependent spouse.  This supplement is not affected by any wages from the part-time job. There are almost 500 people currently participating in the part-time job incentive scheme of which over 40 are residing in County Meath.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Voluntary Work Option:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The voluntary work option facilitates people who are receiving unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit in getting involved in certain types of voluntary work.  The option was intended to be of benefit to unemployed people by involving them in their community and social services activities and by developing their existing skills and preparing them for full-time work.  Under the scheme people are authorised by the local office to engage in voluntary work and have the security of knowing that their unemployment benefits are not affected. Statistics are not available as to the extent to which unemployed people are engaged in voluntary work but the number of workers who have contacted their local office to avail of the option has been low.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Back To Work Allowance:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new back to work allowance scheme which I introduced in September is a pilot scheme for 3,000 people and is intended to provide a financial cushion to people in receipt of unemployment payments and lone parent's allowance who wish to return to paid employment or to engage in self-employment.  It allows long term unemployed people to keep up to three quarters of their unemployment payments while exploring the potential of viable employment in indigenous industry or the voluntary sector, or while setting up self-employment ventures such as horticulture, fisheries, tourism and heritage.</P>
    <P>People who participate in the scheme receive 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare entitlement (including adult and child dependent allowances) for the first year of payment and 50 per cent for the <Col N="1227" /> second year.  They also retain access to family income supplement, fuel allowance, butter vouchers, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the Christmas bonus.</P>
    <P>The scheme has only been in operation for a relatively short period and detailed statistics are not yet available on a county basis.</P>

      <P>The Community Employment Development Programme, (CEDP), is a scheme administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  It provides part-time work for long term unemployed people in noncommercial socially desirable projects which are sponsored by local authorities, community groups and others.  Participants receive a basic allowance and are allowed to retain any existing extra benefits which were payable while on the live register.</P>
      <P>My Department's definition of long term unemployment requires attendance on the live register for 15 months or more.  After this period the unemployed person becomes eligible for the Christmas bonus and the fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, participation in the CEDP required that the person be unemployed for at least 12 months.  Last July the Department of Enterprise and Employment reduced the minimum duration to 6 months.  Those who are short term <Col N="1228" /> unemployed and who avail of this arrangement are not eligible for the Christmas bonus or fuel allowance as they had not established an underlying entitlement to these payments while on the live register.</P>
    <P>I am having research conducted into the position of those who, had they remained on the live register, would otherwise have qualified for extra benefits to establish what wider implications the extension of the extra benefits facility would create.</P>

    <P>I am also informed by the tribunal that, while longer delays occurred in the case of some applications lodged in the past due to the large volume of applications made in the period 1980-1986, such delays may be due to factors outside the control of the tribunal.  As these cases are disposed of pressure on the <Col N="1231" /> tribunal will ease and improvement can be expected in the time taken to deal with current cases.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been an increase in the number of residential burglaries in the Elm Mount area this year and that these crimes are mainly attributed to the activities of criminals who are resident outside the area.  A number of measures have been taken to deal with the crime situation in the Clontarf subdistrict, <Col N="1232" /> which includes Elm Mount. These includes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the deployment of extra resources to the area;</P>
      <P>&mdash;four selected uniform members have been assigned to augment the existing District Detective Unit;</P>
      <P>&mdash;assistance from the Divisional Task Force based in Santry;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the establishment of a District Response Unit to provide attention to identified problem areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash;crime checkpoints and surveillance operations;</P>
      <P>In the Elm Mount area there is an active Neighbourhood Watch Scheme covering over 1,000 homes.  The Garda authorities are very active in the promotion of crime prevention measures and every assistance is afforded this scheme by the Community Sergeant and the Liaision Garda from Clontarf Station.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the measures they have taken in the area are proving effective in dealing with the crime situation there.  However, I am assured that the situation will be kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>Any man or woman committed to custody who displays symptoms of drug addiction is promptly assessed medically and, where appropriate, is placed by the prison doctor on a detoxification programme.  All drug dependant prisoners can also avail of a full range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services within the prison and they may be admitted to hospital or attend as out-patients as required.  Two women medical doctors attend the women's prison on alternative days.  A psychologist and a psychiatrist attend the prison on a regular basis and are on call as required.  A number of community-based agencies involved with drug addiction problems regularly visit the prison to counsel prisoners.  Where such prisoners show the necessary commitment to rehabilitation and do not appear to pose a threat to the community, they are considered for release at an appropriate stage of sentence to enable them to attend community-based drug treatment centres.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 October last Dublin Corporation submitted an application to my Department for funding for the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the railway line at Kilbarrack, linking Briarfield Road and Grove Park Crescent, as part of a series of measures to improve the environs of the DART startion. The estimated cost of the bridge and associated works is £425,500.  As the bridge is intended to facilitate pedestrian movements between two local urban roads, it is a matter for the corporation to finance its construction from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary block grant which is £2.654 million this year.</P>
      <P>The proposed measures at Kilbarrack include a housing precinct improvement programme for Swansnest Court.  In this regard I refer to the reply to Question No. 206 on 6 October 1993.  The corporation has since been requested to prioritise its outstanding applications under the remedial works scheme, including its application for Swansnest Court, and the question of providing funding will be determined in the light of the response.</P>
      <P>Improvements to the DART station itself would not fall to be financed from my Department's funds.</P>

      <Col N="1241" /> In addition to the schemes set out in the table, Louth County Council proposes under its 1993 programme to acquire four houses and construct two single rural houses, and Drogheda Corporation proposes to acquire four houses.  The acquisition of houses, new or previously occupied, within the authority's approved programme of &ldquo;starts&rdquo; does not require prior departmental approval. Similarly, the provision of single rural houses within an authority's approved programme of &ldquo;starts&rdquo; does not require prior approval provided the cost of any such houses does not exceed the unit cost approved by the Department for the authority for the type of house in question.</P>

    <P>The grants totalled £5.032 million to Galway County Council and £6.383 million to Mayo County Council.  The programme of works to be carried out with these grants is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned and details of the extent to which grants were assigned to the N84 between Headford and Shrule are not available in my Department.  A road improvement grant of £80,000 was paid to Galway County Council in 1991 for the provision of hard shoulders on the N84 at Headford.</P>
    <P>The planning and development of road improvement projects on national roads is also a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant local authority.  No proposals have been submitted to my Department for the improvement of the section of roadway in question.  The funds to be provided next year for the maintenance and improvement of national secondary roads have yet to be determined.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the number of households accepted by the housing authorities in County Mayo for inclusion in the assessments of needs carried out under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 at 31 March 1993.  The results of the assessments were published in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin, June Quarter 1993, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Government's plans for responding to housing needs nationally are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government which states clearly that the aim of the Government's policies will be to reduce pressure on local authority waiting lists to the greatest extent possible. In 1993, 125 new local authority house &ldquo;starts&rdquo; were authorised for County Mayo and these will become available for letting in 1994.  They will be complemented by output under the different social housing schemes e.g. the voluntary housing schemes.  The number of housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; to be allocated to individual local authorities in 1994 will be determined early in the New Year having regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the results of the latest needs assessments.</P>

In general the long range aircraft that will be involved in US flights from Dublin meet the stringent noise abatement requirements set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  Furthermore most of the flights involved will take off towards the west (thus avoiding populous urban areas).

      <P>I am aware that St. Luke's and St. Ann's Hospital Board has served a notice of termination on the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in respect of the lease of a small portion of the hospital's lands at Sunbury Gardens.</P>
      <P>The hospital has informed me that based on legal advice it was necessary to proceed in this way in order to protect its legal interest in the lands in question.</P>
      <P>As the notice does not expire until the end of December 1993 I believe that there is ample opportunity for both sides to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement and my Department will do what it can towards this end.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, particularly given the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one, and I am satisfied that the health <Col N="1262" /> boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special medical needs.</P>

      <P>My Department is fully committed to facilitating and supporting the establishment of Gaelscoileanna in areas outside the Gaeltacht including the Dublin region.  Where a demand for such a school is demonstrated and there is no alternative within a reasonable distance my Department, subject to certain conditions, will sanction a new Gaelscoil. Practical support for Gaelscoileanna is further demonstrated through the payment of increased capitation grants for pupils in these schools, allowing a more favourable pupil teacher ratio compared with ordinary primary schools, and paying allowances to teachers who teach through Irish.  Furthermore, my Department provides 100 per cent of the cost of site acquisition and the provision of new buildings or extension-renovations to existing buildings for Gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the Fianna Fáil and Labour <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> gave an undertaking to continue to promote and support Gaelscoileanna outside the Gaeltacht and to provide them with the necessary back up support.</P>

      <Quest>whether it is her Department's policy to distinguish between the rights of pupils in State-recognised schools and extern students, in relation to entitlements to have Leaving Certificate examination marks checked; the reason recognised school pupils are prevented from having their marks checked without the permission of the school authorities, while extern students do not require any permission; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I can confirm that my Department's policy is that where a candidate is entered for examination by a school, it is a matter for the school to apply to my Department for a re-check of the candidate's results.  Applications for rechecks <Col N="1269" /> in respect of school candidates are not accepted from parents, candidates or individual teachers.  Before applying for a re-check in the case of any subject the school authorities must be satisfied, and must certify, that the result in question is substantially at variance with the ability of the candidate, having regard to the performance of the candidate in the examination.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to external candidates is very different.  They are not entered for examination by schools but enter personally for the examination. Since they enter personally for the examination they may also apply personally for a re-check of their examination results.</P>
      <P>External candidates are students outside of the normal recognised post-primary system or those who are pursuing their studies privately.  A pupil who is still attending a recognised post-primary school is not eligible for admission as an external candidate.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of applications for re-checks are in respect of school candidates. The present procedures are designed to ensure that, in general, appeal examiners will have to deal with applications which have some reasonable basis.  They also have the effect of miniminising the number of applications received and enabling the appeal examiners to complete their work within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present system meets the needs of candidates and that the role of schools' authorities in the system is entirely appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 109, 129, 130 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant payments under the higher education grants scheme are made by the local authorities as soon as individual awards have been processed and this expenditure is subsequently recouped by <Col N="1272" /> my Department.  The arrangement in relation to recoupment which has operated since the grants scheme was introduced in 1968 is that recoupment in respect of a local authority's expenditure in a particular local financial year is paid after the end of that year.  My Department will ensure that claims submitted by local authorities in respect of the 1993 local financial year will be paid as early as possible in 1994.</P>
    <P>The information sought about bank borrowings and interest payments by local authorities in connection with higher education grants is not available in my Department.  My Department does not recoup interest payments to local authorities.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that the local authorities make every effort to pay these students grants as early as possible in each term, I accept, nevertheless that the present grants process &mdash; including the arrangements for payment of students &mdash; is less than satisfactory.  I am committed to achieving improvements in this process. In that context the terms of reference of the expert advisory group on third level student support, which I set up earlier this year, include the making of recommendations for, <i>inter alia</i>, the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the advisory group's recommendations before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The question of making school facilities available to arts and cultural groups or to other groups or individuals is one for the school managerial authorities. I am aware that many schools already make their premises available as suggested by the Deputy and I should mention that my Department issued a circular to post-primary schools in April 1992, urging them to make their premises available as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the use of school premises for community purposes outside of school hours and would strongly urge that school buildings provided by way of State aid should be readily available for such use.  I will be addressing this matter further in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Groups or individuals using school premises are required to take out their <Col N="1282" /> own insurance cover.  I do not propose to introduce any change in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if, in respect of a primary school (details supplied) in Dublin 7 she will provide a full-time remedial teacher in keeping with the commitment and sanction that was indicated in June 1993; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the subsequent changing of this commitment means that the school has to share one remedial teacher with another school which already has a full-time remedial teacher and makes that other school, despite having considerably less pupils and already having a remedial teacher, the base school for the second remedial teacher; if she will give the normal procedures in relation to base schools for sharing teachers; the reason the larger school was not made the base school in this case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The established policy of my Department in relation to the allocation of remedial posts is that such decisions are conveyed in writing to the chairperson of the board of management of each of the selected schools.  This arrangement is intended to avoid doubt regarding the sharing of the resource.  I am not aware of any commitment given to the school in question other than that conveyed in the manner I have set out.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the selection of the base school in the case of a shared remedial post are based on a number of considerations, including the relative level of remedial need in each school, the location of each school and the levels of enrolment.  However, school size is not of itself necessarily a determining factor.</P>
      <P>In this particular case it was considered that the balance of advantage lay in designating the school selected as the base school and that the teacher should provide remedial support at the school referred to by the Deputy for three days per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> As with all remedial posts, my Department will be reviewing the effectiveness of these arrangements on an ongoing basis.</P>
