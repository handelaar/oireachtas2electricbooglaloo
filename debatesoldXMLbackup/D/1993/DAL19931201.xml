      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 30 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Gay Mitchell and I now call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of allegations of fraud concerning sales of furniture in a number of areas, including Dublin, Wicklow, Drogheda, Athlone, Sligo Roscommon, Salthill and Ennis, where, contrary to the statement by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil on 25 November last, reliable information indicates that at least 40 complaints have been made, I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil for the purposes of discussing this important matter of public interest which requires urgent consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing <Col N="998" /> Order 30.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second topic, I received notices from Deputies John Bruton and Ivan Yates.  I now call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate a motion disapproving the unfairness to those who paid their full tax on time of the unilateral alteration of the terms of the 15 per cent tax amnesty to include within it those who did not pay taxes on time but who had already agreed with the inspector that these unpaid taxes would be paid, even though the Minister for Finance had given an assurance to the Dáil on several occasions that such people would not be included in the tax amnesty; and deploring the fact that a major policy change of this kind should be made without the prior approval of the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to debate the following matter: the implementation of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, whereby the incentive of 15 per cent amnesty is being extended to include unpaid but recorded arrears of tax, despite the repeated assurances by the Minister for Finance during all Stages of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil to the effect that this part of the amnesty, the 15 per cent, would apply only to &ldquo;undeclared, undisclosed tax liabilities and to non-complaint taxpayers outside the tax net&rdquo;; and for the Government to quantify the losses to the Exchequer of tax arrears which would have been collected by the Revenue Commissioners but which are now being discounted at 15 per cent due to the late flood of applications availing of this loophole in the amnesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I received notice from Deputy John Bruton first and I will <Col N="999" /> give him precedence.  I consider the matter to be one contemplated by the Standing Order and, accordingly, to be in order.  I must now ask the Deputies who support Deputy Bruton's request to rise.</P>

In relation to the announcement the Taoiseach made earlier that there will be a working meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister, is that meeting taking place because of the failure at a senior level to agree on a communiqué?  Can the Taoiseach indicate when a summit meeting will be held?  The Taoiseach has raised huge expectations in relation to this matter and I would like him to tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the outset I must say how much I welcome the fact that we have been offered the opportunity to debate the tax amnesty this evening.  May I ask, Sir, in relation to the agreement to hold a debate, whether you are in a position to say what form that debate will take, whether it will take the form of a motion on which the House will then vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it is important to stress that, when Deputy Shatter's Bill &mdash; the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1993 &mdash; was accepted on Second Reading last evening, I contacted the Whips Office as late as 8 o'clock and was told that business this evening would be the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill, 1993, running on instead of Private Member's Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate for the hares and greyhounds to run.  I might place on the record that the first I heard about this changed arrangement was when I came into the House this morning, not having received the Order of Business, and was told by Deputy Enda Kenny that it had been agreed this morning between the Government Chief Whip and himself.  It would be better in future that my party be contacted formally.  I might add that I have been in my office since 9.30 a.m. and could have been contacted there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, would the Taoiseach say whether the promised Waste Bill is at a sufficiently advanced stage to serve as a guide to the Minister for the Environment, who faces a crucial vote on a disgracefully amended Belgian proposal on the EU Directive on packaging and packaging waste at tomorrow's Council of Ministers' meeting?  In addition, would the Taoiseach say whether he is aware at this stage of how our Minister for the Environment proposes to vote on the proposal tomorrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I might just clarify for the record the position in so far as references to the Whips agreeing business are concerned. Last week at the Whips meeting the business determined for this week was agreed between the Whips.  At that stage it was not known that the Minister for Justice would accept the Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Shatter.  Yesterday, as Whip of the Fine Gael Party, I consented to the two technical amendments to be taken this morning without debate which will be referred to the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  The only communication I had from the Government, in so far as the non-taking of Private Members' Business this evening was concerned, was a telephone call this morning to say that it was proposed to take the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill, 1993, in Government time until 8.30 p.m. this evening. In so far as the allowing of a request to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 was yours, Sir, and yours alone the decision was not within the range of responsibility of any Whip.  It is for that reason I put this on the record for clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of the fact that it has now <Col N="1006" /> been clarified that there will be no Private Members' Business this evening, would the Taoiseach say whether he would make available Government time to allow his Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with special responsibility for housing, Deputy Stagg, to either withdraw or substantiate his scurrilous and totally unfounded allegation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will revert to what <Col N="1009" /> I had been saying about amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Gay Mitchell. On Committee Stage I undertook to have another look at that amendment to ascertain whether in the light of arguments advanced on Committee Stage, I could accept it.  Unfortunately, I still have some difficulties with it.</P>
      <P>First, may I refer briefly to the purpose of the provision as it stands?  In section 3 (3) (a) the Court of Criminal Appeal is being given an important new power to order the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to carry out inquiries to ascertain whether further evidence ought to be adduced.  The court's role will be to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it and not to carry out the inquiry itself. There may be cases in which particular issues raised by the appellant or the prosecution cannot be resolved on the facts available and which the court may wish to have further investigated.  The purpose of this provision is to enable the court to so order the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to make the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue here is the duty of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to carry out specific inquiries ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It will be up to the court to be satisfied that the investigations have been properly carried out by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and that they adequately answer the queries raised.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has the technical and forensic resources necessary to carry out any inquiry which the court is likely to suggest.  He also has the necessary investigative expertise available to him. Clearly, he is the most appropriate, if not the only, person who could be asked to perform those functions.  There may be a perception that when the court directs the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to conduct an investigation, the purpose of that investigation somehow will be concerned with covering up some wrongdoing or mishandling of the case by the Garda themselves.  This need not necessarily be the case and in practice might be the case only very occasionally. However, as I have said, because of the investigative role, expertise and <Col N="1010" /> resources of the Garda, they would be the obvious and correct body to undertake such an investigation.  In those circumstances it is better that they report directly to the court rather than through an intermediary, whether or not that intermediary be the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The principle of the Garda investigating matters which concern their own operations, under independent supervision and in accordance with a statutory duty, is not new.  It is already contained in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.  I am informed that its provisions are working well.  As I have said, any investigations undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána would be under the supervision of and in accordance with the instructions of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  There is no reason to doubt the safety of such procedure.</P>
    <P>It would be particularly inappropriate to appoint a person such as the Attorney General to carry out or oversee the investigations. While the Director of Public Prosecutions has taken over the prosecutorial functions of the Attorney General, there remains the possibility, whether under specific legislation or under the Prosecution of Offences Act, that certain prosecutorial functions could be allocated to the Attorney General. For example, individual statutes may, despite the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, allocate prosecutorial functions to the Attorney General.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, has done so in relation to maritime fisheries offences. Under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the Government may, in the interests of national security, order that functions in relation to specified types of criminal matters shall return to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I have the fullest confidence in the integrity and ability of the Garda Commissioner to carry out the orders of the court in a proper and efficient manner. Basically that is the reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thinking behind Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 11, the purpose of which is to extend the <Col N="1011" /> existing subsection (7) to provide for legal aid for an application under section 2.  However, that situation is already provided for.  I explained on Committee Stage that section 2 (2) provides that such an application shall be treated for all purposes &mdash; I stress those words &mdash; as an appeal to the court against conviction or sentence.  The normal legal aid appeal certificate could therefore be granted where appropriate in such cases.  Therefore, what the amendment seeks to correct is already provided for.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the debate which took place last evening. There were contributions from Deputies De Rossa, O'Donnell, Gay Mitchell and Michael McDowell.  The contributions from the first three Deputies were reasonable and well informed.  I empathise and sympathise with Deputy Mitchell, who has tabled most of the amendments.  I have acquaintances and friends in his constituency and I know he is in close touch with his constituents and that he represents their interests in the best way he can.  There are many things he wants to achieve by means of the amendments tabled which I too would like to do but, unfortunately, we live in a democracy and are subject to a written Constitution.  Therefore, I am precluded by law from accepting many of those amendments.  I certainly understand and sympathise with the thinking behind them.</P>
    <P>There are a few points on which I would like to correct Deputy Mitchell. He suggested that the reason for the departure &mdash; I suggest slight departure &mdash; from the report of the Martin committee in this legislation was undue influence from the Judiciary.  I repeat now what I said on Committee Stage.  I have made inquiries as to whether the Judiciary tried to influence this legislation in any way and the answer I got was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the rules of evidence.  I take the point that in some cases the rules of evidence are not designed to bring out the truth as they have evolved and developed over the centuries.  We are talking here about justice <Col N="1012" /> for the accused and about legislating in the interests of somebody who is imprisoned wrongly.  The rules of evidence exist for one reason only, that is to protect the interests of an accused person: in other words, to prevent the balance tilting too much in favour of the State and of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies said we had abandoned the Martin report, that we had turned it on its head and junked it.  I contradict that in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>The Martin report made three main recommendations.  First, it proposed that there should be a system to deal with miscarriages of justice in cases such as the Guildford Four in the United Kingdom and the Nicky Kelly case in Ireland and recommended that the person who was the victim of a miscarriage of justice should have a right to go back only before a tribunal.  Second, it proposed that the Government proceed immediately to put in place a system for video recording of interviews with suspects. Third, it proposed that the Government introduce a statutory system of compensation for the victims of miscarriage of justice.  We have accepted the third recommendation in its entirety and we are providing for it in legislation. We have accepted the second recommendation in its entirety and I fully acknowledge and agree with the point made by Deputy Gilmore on Committee Stage that we are very late in doing so. Nevertheless we are now beginning to put the process into operation, admittedly on a pilot basis.  I have explained at length the reason it is being done in that way and the Martin committee agrees.</P>
    <P>The first recommendation of the Martin committee was that somebody should have the right to go back before a tribunal.  We agree with that recommendation and are providing for that right.  I cannot agree with the committee's conclusion that they can only go back to a tribunal.  We are providing an alternative whereby they can go back either to the court or to a tribunal.  When they go back to a tribunal, the filtering mechanism will be the Minister for Justice who will <Col N="1013" /> decide whether the case is an appropriate one for a tribunal to be set up.  I gave some examples on Committee Stage as to when this will operate.  Obviously where some evidence in favour of the accused is inadmissible one cannot go back to court because courts cannot hear inadmissible evidence.  That is not the only case that will be appropriate for a tribunal. There may be cases where a great deal of investigation and inquiry will be necessary.  I am sure the Minister will consider that such a case should be appropriately referred to a tribunal.  Instead of only allowing people to go back to one forum we are providing an alternative.</P>
    <P>On the question of a pardon I repeat again what I said yesterday.  I note that Deputy McDowell, who is obviously busy elsewhere while we are debating this issue, took to the airwaves this morning to compensate for the facts that he is too busy in the courts or whatever to come here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unworthy comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what Deputy McDowell said last evening was very unworthy and I will demonstrate the reason.  Deputy McDowell took to the airwaves this morning and made all sorts of suggestions that I was being unfair to Nicky Kelly.  I am on record both in the print media and in RTE as saying, before there was any pardon and when it was not profitable or popular to do so &mdash; the dates, times and places I can supply to this House if anybody has any doubts &mdash; that Nicky Kelly's case should be reinvestigated. I read the transcript of the trial and I was unhappy with it.  Before there was any question of a pardon I said that a case should have been answered on behalf of Nicky Kelly.  I did not hear a peep from Deputy McDowell while the former Deputy Pat McCartan, some Fine Gael Deputies and I were talking about Nicky Kelly.  When the match is over and when it is profitable to talk about the case we hear Deputy McDowell speak in his high moral tone.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday we did all we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> We recommended to the President that she grant Nicky Kelly a pardon and accordingly this was granted.  What is in dispute now is the exact legal effect of a pardon.  In law &mdash; I am talking about technicalities &mdash; does it set the conviction aside?  The short answer is that I do not know.  The term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo; appears in the Constitution and like many other words and phrases in the Constitution it has never been interpreted by the courts. Under the terms of the Constitution only the courts can interpret that and set the parameters or the limits to the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;.  We cannot do that here.  We are given no power in the Constitution to regulate or define the meaning of the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;.  Somebody mentioned that Nicky Kelly or somebody else who was a victim of a miscarriage of justice and who subsequently got a pardon might bring a declaratory action.  That would be a good thing because it would come before the courts and we could know exactly what it means in law.  That is all I have said and that is all I will say on the matter.</P>
    <P>In her contribution yesterday Deputy O'Donnell made what I regard as a good point.  It was a much more solid point than all the nonsense we heard from Deputy McDowell.  What we had from him was a performance from start to finish.  Obviously when people come in here from the Four Courts the performance goes on &mdash; it is very difficult to readjust.  Deputy O'Donnell said that Article 13.6 refers to the right of pardon and to the power to commute or remit. If I interpret her correctly she is saying that the Constitution, of necessity, is a document where words are not wasted and as the two expressions are used in Article 13.6, obviously pardon must mean something more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than simply commutation or remission.  That is a good point.  However, I still do not think that we are entitled to define the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;.  If somebody brought a declaratory action or the Supreme Court <Col N="1015" /> had to interpret the term &ldquo;pardon&rdquo;, I could see them coming to the conclusion that it did legally set the conviction aside and I imagine one of the reasons they would come to that conclusion would be that outlined in the argument advanced by the Deputy yesterday.  Yesterday I committed myself to getting a full written opinion from the Attorney General on this matter between now and the legislation being debated in the Seanad.  If the Deputy wishes, I will furnish her with a copy of it.  I give that commitment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell said there is nothing in the Constitution which states that pardons cannot touch guilt or innocence. The problem is that there is nothing in the Constitution which says exactly what a pardon means in law and, as I said, only the courts can interpret that.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell referred to a letter on its way to me from the Bar Council, which was going to make us all run for cover.  I understand it arrived this morning and, of course, I will study it carefully. When Deputy McDowell referred to the Bar Council sending me a letter, my interest was aroused because I thought it must be the letter I had been expecting for the past year and a half in reply to my letter about the ridiculous pieces of horse hair they wear on their heads to make the court atmosphere even more unreal to ordinary witnesses.  I inquired 18 months ago what they proposed to do to change this nonsense and I got a sort of a reply that this matter was going before the dress committee for its adjudication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the dress or the dressage committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If you please, the dress committee were going to adjudicate on this weighty matter.  To date I have had no response as to the result of the deliberations of the dress committee.  It occurs to me that I am expecting another letter from the Bar Council, a response to a letter I sent some time ago which will explain the minimalist system of self-regulation. When we were debating the legislation to regulate solicitors, the Bar <Col N="1016" /> Council moved fast &mdash; there are some good politicians there &mdash; and brought in their own system of self-regulation, obviously to avoid being regulated by this House.  They said they had all types of systems in place whereby retired judges would hear appeals and so on.  I was able to monitor this by observing at a distance what happened to a number of complaints from my constituents.  I now find that the terms of reference of that committee are minimalist and cover virtually nothing.  I have written a letter asking them to explain exactly the terms of reference and I thought perhaps the letter to which Deputy McDowell referred was to tell me somebody had been found guilty and punished under the terms of reference of the committee.  I will not hold my breath waiting for that letter.  I will, of course, examine the Bar Council's submission on this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell said also that people serving sentences of 15 years will have nothing better to do than think of ways to get out of prison and that in this Bill we are putting in place a system whereby they can appeal their cases.  He claimed they will have nothing better to do than dream up all types of schemes and ways of getting witnesses to make statements that will support their case, that the Court of Criminal Appeal will be flooded with spurious applications and that the barbarians will come out of Mountjoy, Limerick and Portlaoise and storm the gates of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  He was repeating the arguments he had made on Second Stage but they are about as solid as Legoland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that Deputy McDowell agrees with the recommendations of the Martin committee.  The committee proposes that somebody who is the victim of a miscarriage of justice should have further recourse to the law; in fact, it suggests a tribunal.  We are providing that it can be either a court or a tribunal.  If Deputy McDowell agrees with the recommendation of the Martin committee that people can make a case to a tribunal, does not the same argument apply?  He says that prisoners sitting in cells will be dreaming up schemes, but <Col N="1017" /> equally will they not be dreaming up schemes to bring before a tribunal?  Is it not likely that if they could only come before a tribunal the chancers to whom he refers would come out of the woodwork because a tribunal is not constrained by the same rules of evidence in regard to admissibility as a court would be?</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of somebody who has no case at all but dreams up a scheme which is supported by an alibi witness who will swear falsely.  If that person presents primary evidence to the Minister for Justice that is admissible, it is likely that he will refer him to the court.  If he has to go to court he will know that if his witness admits he committed perjury before or if he attempts to commit perjury on this occasion and is caught that would give the witness cause for thought. On the other hand a witness can swear all he likes before a tribunal because there is no possibility of a prosecution for perjury under the terms of the legislation setting up tribunals.</P>
    <P>Is it not more likely that more people will wish to appear before tribunals because, as well as being able to call the alibi witness, they will be able to call people with hearsay evidence?  For example, a witness might claim that Deputy Gay Mitchell said Deputy De Rossa was 50 miles away from the scene of the crime and another witness might say that he heard Deputy Gay Mitchell say that in Blanchardstown shopping centre.  The appellant can produce several witnesses giving hearsay evidence and everyone is entitled to be heard. Whatever else, Deputy McDowell should not base his claims on numbers.</P>
    <P>On the question of people clogging up the Court of Criminal Appeal, I wonder if Deputy McDowell has read the Bill properly.  Section 2 provides that the only person who can claim an alleged miscarriage of justice before the Court of Criminal Appeal or before the Minister for Justice under section 7 will be a person who has already gone through the entire appeal system.  Deputy McDowell knows perfectly well that only a small percentage of people who are convicted <Col N="1018" /> by either the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court go through the entire appeal procedure and on to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I have the statistics for 1991 and 1992 showing the number of people who went right through to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and therefore the pool of applicants who could come back under this legislation.  In the legal year 1991-92 nine people appealed against convictions and sentence, 19 people appealed against conviction only and 62 people appealed sentence only. That is the total pool.  Of that number I do not think that those who went to the Court of Criminal Appeal and appealed only against the sentence will be returning alleging a miscarriage of justice because there is an implicit admission of guilt when one only appeals against the length of sentence.  The potential pool is very small indeed and newly discovered facts will be necessary to support coming back to the court to show there has been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's fears that the barbarians will be battering down the gates of the Court of Criminal Appeal are so far from reality that they belong to the realm of total fantasy.  He was worried by the fact that one can return to the Court of Criminal Appeal and on the grounds of a miscarriage of justice have one's sentence reduced.  The Deputy suggested it would be better for the Minister for Justice to use her normal powers to commute sentences.  How well has Deputy McDowell read this Bill before coming in here to make sarcastic, scurrilous criticisms of it?  A subsection in the Bill specifically states that the powers of the Minister for Justice in that regard are undisturbed.  If a prisoner feels that his sentence should be reduced and he does not want to go back to the court, he can appeal to the Minister for Justice under the 1951 Act.</P>
    <P>When I first read the Bill I wondered if it was logical to allow people to go back to the court to seek a reduction in sentences.  Having reflected on it I concluded it is right that this alternative system should be provided.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Justice gets <Col N="1019" /> quite a few cases under the 1951 Act.  I am afraid that if a person with a genuine reason for requesting a sentence to be reduced went to the Minister for Justice, due to the volume of cases going there, the depth of the inquiry would not be sufficient to allow the Minister to know whether she should help.  If a person fails with the Minister there is nothing wrong with giving him the right to go back to the court.  Deputy McDowell made the case that we are being unfair to prisoners, but I am leaving this here in the interest of the person claiming a miscarriage of justice while the Minister's existing powers remain undisturbed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was also worried about how the Court of Criminal Appeal would function when new evidence was brought before it.  The Deputy says that at the moment if somebody takes a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal the court will read the transcript and consider whether the judge applied the law properly, if the jury could have reasonably reached its conclusion on the facts and whether the judge properly directed the jury.  Deputy McDowell asks how the Court of Criminal Appeal will assess new evidence.  If ever I heard a disingenuous argument from a practising senior counsel, that was it; it takes the biscuit.  As somebody who appeared before the Court of Criminal Appeal, Deputy McDowell will be aware that as the law stands a person appealing an ordinary case to the Court of Criminal Appeal can adduce new evidence and the Court of Criminal Appeal has the right to deal with it.  The procedure here is simply that instead of new evidence being brought before the Court of Criminal Appeal in some cases, new evidence will inevitably be before the Court of Criminal Appeal in every case and the procedure will be exactly the same as it is now.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the Birmingham Six case and how the Court of Criminal Appeal treated the evidence of Mrs. Joyce Lynass.  The Deputy brought disingenuousness to a fine art in making his case.  I was not at the Court of Crimi-Appeal for the hearing of the Birmingham <Col N="1020" /> Six case but from newspaper reports I can make a fair estimate of what happened.  Deputy McDowell did not claim to have been there so I assume he is also working from media reports.  Many years after the Birmingham Six had been put in prison an application was made to the Home Secretary, who is the filtering system in the UK, for the case to be brought back before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The application was accepted and ultimately the case came back to the Court of Criminal Appeal. There were two witnesses, a policeman who had been sacked from the police force and Mrs. Lynass who had been a prison officer.  Mrs. Lynass gave solemn sworn evidence which was 100 per cent at variance with the solemn sworn evidence she had given at the initial trial.  Counsel for the other side cast considerable doubt on her veracity as a witness.  With regard to the other witness, it was shown that he was convicted of larceny.  That happens in the courts every day of the week.</P>
    <P>Not a week passes without a person telling the truth in a civil or criminal court being disbelieved while somebody lying through his teeth is believed.  Skilled barristers will cast doubts on the credibility of witnesses, some people are not good witnesses while others are practised liars. Because of that wrong decisions will continue to be made.  We cannot make the system perfect since we are dealing with human beings.  Deputy McDowell will be aware of the adage &mdash; to err is human.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six case subsequently returned to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis of forensic evidence which showed conclusively that the conviction was unsafe and unsound.  Deputy McDowell says that because the Birmingham Six were ultimately released, both Mrs. Lynass and the policeman should have been believed in the original appeal as they were telling the truth. When the match is over, one can say that everyone should have known that somebody was telling the truth all along, no matter what doubts were cast on the evidence and no matter what reasons the Court of Criminal Appeal had for not believing the witnesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> If a case comes before a court here today and the judge takes one view of the facts because he believes somebody and the case goes to an appeal and the appeal court believes somebody else, it should not be assumed that the judge in the original trial had a hidden motive for not believing the person in the first place. Hardly a week goes by without truthful witnesses being disbelieved in the courts. There are cases in which I am perfectly sure people have been telling the truth but they have not been able to get it across in court while people who were telling lies convinced the court.  The outcome also depends on who is representing the person.  To take one case where this happened and deduce that the Court of Criminal Appeal was acting with an ulterior motive stemming from a reluctance to overcome a previous decision made by the court is fantasy, an argument unworthy of Deputy McDowell, an Opposition spokesman.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is also worried that when this legislation is implemented barristers will make more money.  The profession is not noted for its altruism and Deputy McDowell is worried that the effect of this Bill is that they would make more money.  Can one imagine Deputy McDowell is worried about it?  If the Martin committee report is accepted and we have a tribunal instead of a court, does Deputy McDowell imagine that people going back to a tribunal will go on a wing and a prayer and be prepared to go into a tribunal with one arm hanging as long as the other, or does he imagine that TDs, county councillors and so on will represent people before tribunals?</P>
    <P>Does Deputy McDowell believe the same system would apply and that barristers would probably make more money because more people would take their case to tribunals?  Perhaps the Deputy is concerned about something else and I misunderstood him.  Perhaps he wants us to hold more tribunals even though we are all aware of their history and of how lucrative they can prove for barristers.  I do not need to expand on that aspect except to ask if it is the reason the Deputy <Col N="1022" /> wants us to hold only tribunals.  People in glasshouses should not throw stones.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell stated the system I am introducing will completely ignore witnesses who wish to change their evidence, in other words, people who claim they committed perjury in the first place, are suffering remorse and want to vindicate the accused by saying they told lies and want the accused released.  To say in the clearest possible language, as Deputy McDowell did, that such cases are not provided for in the legislation is a patent and downright misrepresentation.  Such cases were specifically referred to by the Martin committee and provided for in the legislation.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions does not agree that such witnesses should not be prosecuted for perjury the correct mechanism for the victim of the miscarriage of justice is to apply to the Minister for Justice to set up a tribunal.  We have introduced legislation governing the establishment of tribunals of inquiry so that the evidence of witnesses would not subject the witness to a subsequent charge of perjury.  We have specifically provided for such cases and to say, as Deputy McDowell did, that we have not is a downright misrepresentation. That is the strongest I am allowed to put it under the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was concerned about the term &ldquo;newly discovered fact&rdquo; and wanted to know what it meant.  He wanted to know if the evidence of a garda was in question because he lied in another case, would the courts be compelled to accept his evidence and if that would be a newly discovered fact.  Deputy McDowell agreed with the report of the Martin committee which recommended that people should have recourse to a tribunal, but that would be possible only in the case of new evidence.  One can call it a newly discovered fact, a new issue or a new matter as described by the Martin committee, but the same difficulties in respect of interpretation will arise if one accepts that people should have recourse to some mechanism.  We have defined the term &ldquo;newly discovered fact&rdquo; and Deputy McDowell is well aware that every possible <Col N="1023" /> eventuality cannot be provided for in legislation.  The courts will have to interpret what the term means in the same way as they would have to interpret what the term meant had the Martin committee report been accepted in its entirety.  The courts will decide on the facts of each case.  That is how the law operates and for Deputy McDowell to pretend otherwise is nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was concerned also about the question of finality.  At present if a person is convicted of a criminal offence in the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Criminal Court he or she can appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal which will agree or disagree with the conviction. If a point of law is involved one can appeal to the Supreme Court but if a point of law is not involved the Court of Criminal Appeal has the final say.  That is finality.  The Martin committee recommends that a person who had gone through the system and whose conviction is upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal can appeal the case again.  Is this not a departure from finality with which Deputy McDowell agrees enthusiastically? I agree with the principle of finality in criminal law but, on the recommendations of the Martin committee, we are departing from that principle in the interest of justice.  It will be departed from in the same way whether the mechanism to which one has recourse is a tribunal, a court or whether one has a choice.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell, Mitchell and De Rossa made reasonable points which I will consider before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I am not convinced that the reasoning behind the Martin committee report supports its conclusions.  The key pages of that report are 11 to 13.  On page 11 the report states:</P>
    <P>It is not impossible to conceive of cases in which, years after conviction, with all legal avenues explored and all appeal procedures exhausted, there might come to light a mass of cogent information and documentation inadmissible <Col N="1024" /> as evidence in court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Martin committee claimed that such a matter would not be suitable for going back to court.  On page 12 of the report the committee claimed that in rare cases where evidence is inadmissible a tribunal is the proper mechanism.  I agree with that proposal and we have provided for it. Under the heading &ldquo;A Statutory Inquiry Body&rdquo; the report states:</P>
    <P>We have given this aspect of the matter the fullest consideration and have taken into account the many submissions received.  As a result, we are of the view that in the circumstances envisaged (the only circumstances the committee has referred to are those involving inadmissible evidence) where substantial doubt may arise as to the propriety of a conviction...</P>
    <P>Again, the committee recommended the mechanism of a tribunal but, again, we are talking only about cases where the evidence is inadmissible.  Under this legislation people have recourse to a tribunal in such circumstances.  Having reached that conclusion the committee then stated a hypothetical case in respect of perjury, to which Deputy McDowell referred last night.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>We have considered a hypothetical case in which, say 5 years after conviction, a prosecution witness, as a result of whose testimony the accused was convicted, develops qualms of conscience, and is prepared to admit that it was his perjury which brought about the conviction, and his forgery of the vital document supporting such perjury, which resulted in the miscarriage of justice.  The reality of the situation is that such a person, despite his remorse, may be entirely unwilling to testify in Court proceedings, unless given immunity from prosecution for perjury and forgery, a course which the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the proper exercise of his functions, may well refuse to take, thus effectively precluding any remedy for the miscarriage of justice within the Court structure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I agree with that proposal and have provided the mechanism of a tribunal for people in such circumstances.  Without any further reasoning the Martin committee concluded that in no case should a person be allowed go back to court. The proposals in the Martin committee report do not support that conclusion and I challenge any Member or anybody outside the House to point out the reasoning in it which supports the conclusion that a person should be entitled to have recourse to a tribunal, and only a tribunal, even if the case is suitable only for a court hearing.  I failed to find such a conclusion in the report.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell, De Rossa, Gilmore and O'Donnell made some cogent remarks.  However, Deputy McDowell presented a farrago of nonsense, a performance from start to finish.  He is suffering from a serious handicap in that he believes passionately that any opinion which differs from his is irrelevant.  I have news for him.  He is not in the House at present; if he is practising his profession he is before the judges he so highly regards.  I withdrew a remark yesterday because Deputies De Rossa and Mitchell took umbrage and that was my only reason for withdrawing it.  I was not directing my comments at those Deputies and they should have no misapprehension in that regard.  If Deputy McDowell did not intend casting a slur on the Judiciary I must take his word for it.  He stated that he must take my word for anything I say in the House and the same applies to me in regard to what he says here.  He stated that the Court of Criminal Appeal in the United Kingdom deliberately closed its eyes to new evidence because it was unwilling to reverse a conviction.  That type of conduct from a Court of Criminal Appeal would make the people in question unworthy to sit on the bench.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is concerned that the Court of Criminal Appeal here will adopt a similar attitude.  He was concerned that when this legislation was put into effect and the Court of Criminal Appeal established, the two High Court judges and the Supreme Court judge <Col N="1026" /> would take the same irresponsible attitude. That is the reason, as I understand it, he is worried about a case being referred back to the court.  That is what he said and I drew a conclusion as to his attitude towards the bench from those remarks.  I can understand the English language as well as anyone else and I am entitled to draw whatever conclusions I like.  If that was not his intention, I have to take his word for it, but I have to point out that there is good evidence to support the conclusion I reached.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening Deputy McDowell was het up because I had accused him of saying something about somebody else. He claimed he did not say this.  That was the only accusation I made; I did not accuse him of anything directly or say anything about him.  I accused him of saying something about somebody else. What about his performance here yesterday evening?  Does he not feel he should apologise to the House?  He launched a scurrilous, sarcastic and snide attack on officials who cannot come into the House to answer for themselves.  He implied that they were ignorant, ill-informed and specifically and explicitly called them weak-minded.  Is that the right language to use about people who cannot answer for themselves?</P>
    <P>He also implied that anyone who was not practising at the Bar was not the appropriate person to draft Justice legislation. That argument could be applied in many directions, as I am sure Deputy McDowell and others would be surprised to learn.  Deputy McDowell is sensitive and thin-skinned when people accuse him of saying something about somebody else, but let us remember what he said directly about those who cannot come in here to defend themselves.  I do not want to get involved in a debate where such terminology is used, particularly about people who cannot answer back.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I was appointed I was present in the House during Question Time with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, when Deputy McDowell said to her that if she thought she was going to act the hard woman with him she had better think <Col N="1027" /> again.  I have another message for Deputy McDowell today: if he thinks he is going to act the hard man with me he had better not waste his time or breath.  While other Deputies advanced additional reasons to those advanced by the Martin committee in its report for referring a case back to a tribunal only, Deputy McDowell made no point.  Rather he made a sarcastic and abusive speech.  If he thinks he can influence me by hectoring, bullying and blackguarding I have to tell the House that he is even further detached from reality than I imagined.</P>

      <P>On the Bill, the Minister said he had only departed slightly from the Martin report.  In my contribution on the amendment yesterday I pointed out that the idea of setting up a tribunal as proposed in the Martin report had been effectively abandoned by the Minister.  I accept that the Minister has indicated that he will bring forward the regulations in regard to video recordings in the context of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which I spoke on at the time, the implementation of which has been long delayed.  The Minister has also accepted the principle of statutory compensation for people against whom wrongful convictions have been made.</P>
      <P>However, the core of the Martin report was the proposal that a tribunal should be established to enable people who felt they had been wrongly convicted to bring their case forward to that tribunal.  In responding to the case made, the Minister indicated that he felt there was no reasoning in the Martin report against allowing at least some of those cases to go before the Court of Criminal Appeal. My understanding is that the Martin committee felt that the Court of Criminal Appeal was not a suitable body before which such appeals should be brought and they gave a range of reasons for that, one of the most critical being the manner in which the Court of Criminal Appeal deals with new evidence.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer and I do not pretend to know the ins and outs of how the courts work, despite the allegations of Deputy Mitchell, but I understand that the Court of Criminal Appeal is not enabled to decide on the veracity of particular facts; it can decide that if certain information had been presented to a jury it might have reached a different decision and, therefore, the Court of Criminal Appeal may make a decision based on its view in relation to that.  It is not enabled to actually rehear the trial that resulted in the conviction.  The Martin committee felt therefore that the Court of Criminal Appeal was not the most suitable body to hear such appeals.  That is the crucial point in relation to how this legislation has been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> In the short few hours I have dealt with this Bill, I very much appreciate the manner in which the Minister has been prepared to consider various points made by Deputies on the Opposition benches. He has indicated his willingness to look at what might be regarded as peripheral issues relating to the Bill.  However, he has stuck rigidly to his point of view that the Court of Criminal Appeal should be maintained as an agency which would rehear cases of this kind.  For that reason it is necessary for me to put the amendment I moved yesterday to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be extremely sensitive and will not in any way attempt to drive the wedge any further between the two Deputies.  These amendments address the most fundamental issue in the Bill that all parties want to address.  It was the area of greatest concern on Committee Stage and also on this Stage.  On Committee Stage I expressed serious reservations, having read and studied the Martin report.  I felt the Minister was not giving due regard to the concerns mentioned in that report and I pleaded with the Minister to look in greater depth at the Martin recommendation on the question of a tribunal. That he promised to do.</P>
      <P>I studied carefully what the Minister had to say in reply on Committee Stage. I am not a lawyer and know little about court procedures, but I am concerned that there could be cases where certain evidence would not be admissible in court.  Therefore I question the wisdom of adopting a dual approach whereby certain cases would be heard again by the Court of Criminal Appeal and others would go before a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard the Minister's comments on the report of the Martin committee my concerns have been eased to a great extent.  I do not see in the report of the Martin committee the clear evidence to which Deputy De Rossa referred and which he claims proves his case.  I seem to be re-echoing what the Minister said, but there is a strong case to be made for his point of view.  Regarding the two cases the Minister cites, he has clearly stated on Committee and Report Stages that such cases would be referred to a tribunal and would not be suitable for referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  There are sufficient guarantees in the Bill that no case which is inappropriate for referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal will be referred to that court.  If the tribunal provided under the legislation is similar to that recommended by Judge Martin, I see no difficulty in taking on board the <Col N="1039" /> dual approach as distinct from the single approach recommended in the report of the Martin committee.</P>

      <P>I draw to the attention of Members an error in amendment <Col N="1041" /> No. 21, circulated as a substitute amendment, which appeared as amendment No. 22.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the Bill in that it does not provide for the recommendations in the report of the Martin committee.  It is extraordinary that Deputy McDowell made such a rambling concerned speech about this section of the Bill when he, as a barrister and one of the most skilled Members, did not draft an amendment to this Bill.  That is strange, particularly when I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage as well as Report Stage.  If he was so concerned about this matter I do not understand why he did not table an amendment.</P>

      <P>No detailed amendment has been tabled by the Deputy's party to the section providing for the replacement of the court by a tribunal. The only amendments have been tabled by Deputy Gilmore and myself and they outline how the tribunal should operate. I would have thought Deputy McDowell would have tabled an amendment to this section as he made such a meal of this matter yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that no Labour Deputy spoke on Report Stage.  This is an important Bill.  I did not make a long speech about this matter yesterday.  It is wrong to depart from the recommendations of the Martin committee which advocate a tribunal of inquiry rather than a court. The report stated that the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act, 1989, which allows hearsay evidence, is the model which should be used in hearing evidence before a tribunal. The committee recommended that the model of the civil evidence Act should be followed in this legislation and that hearsay evidence, which cannot be heard in court, should be heard before a tribunal.  Courts can only hear evidence based on the rules of evidence.  In an appeal case it is desirable that the normal rules of evidence should be expanded to <Col N="1042" /> determine the truth and in such circumstances a tribunal would be more appropriate than a court.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will shortly receive a reply to his letter to the Bar Council regarding the wearing of wigs.  Under our justice system the law is above the lay person.  Officers of a court are dressed in regalia and are separate from the lay person.  The lay person is not informed about the law or justice; and there is a sense that he or she should do as they are told and take his or her medicine.  The justice system separates the legal profession and judges from the lay person and that separation is a matter that should be considered.  I am sure the Minister is not misleading the House, but he will be aware that there is an established dress committee in the Bar Council.  The fact that there is such a committee speaks volumes for its attitude to the application of the law.</P>
    <P>There are other problems also which I will not go into at this stage.  As we are debating a Justice Bill, we should consider how the justice system is administered. I will be pressing amendment No. 4, which deals with the right to be heard before a tribunal.  It is an important point and should be put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will need more time than what I am entitled to if I am to cover the various points raised by the Minister, but some points he raised are more important than others.  I refute the allegation that members of our party slighted the Judiciary yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our argument has always been that it is not a criticism of the Judiciary or the courts to believe that the best way to deal with a review of a miscarriage of justice is to opt for a tribunal of inquiry rather than a referral back to the court.  That is the conclusion reached by the Martin committee and a view expressed by all parties in this House.  It is based on the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal is more used to determining matters of law arising from an appeal than issues of fact, which is what it would be expected to do in these cases.  All miscarriages of justice involve massive investigation and inquisitorial <Col N="1043" /> powers which the courts do not have.  That is why the Minister is choosing the second best option of the tribunal. My great concern is that the outcome at the end of the tribunal or pardon should be the same as if the case had gone back to the court, that is the quashing of the conviction.  I could live with the existence of the dual route, but the outcome should be the same in both cases.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McDowell said yesterday, experience in England, in the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six cases, has shown that the adversarial courts, by their nature and the rules which govern them, are not the appropriate fora in which to conduct the necessary inquiries in these cases, which involve the unravelling of a web of perjury, conspiracy, false confessions and police malpractice.  Very important in these cases &mdash; this could be applied to miscarriage of justice cases here &mdash; is the political and media hysteria which surrounds the trial.  The tribunal route is the best one in these circumstances. We believe that sections 7 and 8 would be adequate to deal with this matter on the basis that the effect of a pardon is clarified.  The Minister clarified the Nicky Kelly case.  I accept that he will seek the advice of the Attorney General as to whether it would be constitutional to legislate for the legal effects of a pardon.</P>
    <P>The Minister clarified another matter today, that very few cases go to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Deputy McDowell, as a practitioner, expressed the view that there would be a proliferation of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I accept the Minister's point that the pool of potential referrals back to the court would be quite small, but the doubt remains that when there is a mechanism whereby a miscarriage of justice may be alleged on new facts, more cases may come before the courts.  I welcome the existence of the dual route.</P>
    <P>I will not get involved in the series of personal offences against Deputy McDowell.  This has been going on for a long time between the Minister of State and Deputy McDowell, as lawyers, and <Col N="1044" /> there is an element of waiting for an opportunity to take a swipe at each other.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the letter from the Bar Council and I would be interested to know what is in it.  Perhaps the Bar Council is expressing a view that it is concerned about the methods adopted in this legislation.  Consultation with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar is an appropriate procedure in all matters. This is a procedural Bill which fundamentally affects the operation of criminal trials and the normal appeals system.  It is appropriate that there is as much consultation as possible and as many views as are appropriate heard, given that the Minister opposed the fundamental recommendation of the Martin committee relating to the court referral system.</P>
    <P>Under the 1951 legislation the Minister is empowered to reduce sentences, this happens all the time.  How prevalent is this practice?  When sentences are reduced by the Minister it should be a matter of public record.  The procedure should not be as simple as at present.  The Minister has too much power to reduce sentences and remit punishment.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister takes the point that as the law stands there is a lack of clarity on what a pardon means.  It is important to clarify whether, for example, Nicky Kelly has to go to court to seek a declaratory action to determine the legal effect of a pardon.  This is the solution we are offering to persons who have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice and it is important that the person is removed from all infamy and regains the status he held before the charges were made.  Anything less is not good enough. I would be grateful if the Minister would let me have a copy of the Attorney General's advice in the matter.  I am sure all Deputies would be interested in hearing that advice given the importance of Presidential pardons.</P>

      <P>If one accepts the proposition put forward by Deputies O'Donnell and Mitchell that court is an inappropriate place for examination of a new fact which shows that there has been <Col N="1045" /> a gross miscarriage of justice and that as the court is concerned only with law it cannot in essence dispense justice, the logical conclusion to be drawn is that we should abolish criminal courts and set up tribunals to deal with all criminal cases. The argument has been put forward that the rules of evidence are too restrictive, the courts bound up in red tape and so on.  The rules of evidence were drawn up after hundreds of years of experience. They were not drawn up for the fun of it or to wrap people in red tape; they were drawn up to ensure that a defendant in a criminal trial would get justice and fair play.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a point he made.  He said that the courts are the only body which can define the constitutional reference to pardon.  Is that correct?  The main function of this House is to interpret the Constitution and make laws based on our views of what the Constitution says. Therefore, it seems to be entirely appropriate for this House to state in law what the reference to pardon in the Constitution means.  Obviously, any citizen would be entitled to challenge that law and the courts would be entitled to state whether that law was right or wrong.  This happens from time to time, but it does not happen too often.  As a lay person, I am confused as to where the distinction arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the remark made by the speaker opposite that the courts are concerned with law, not justice. He said that he believed the reverse <Col N="1046" /> should be the case.  In the nature of things courts decide whether or not the law is broken.  We try to frame our laws in such a way as to ensure that people will get justice at the end of the day.  However, many people believe that while a decision was based properly on law &mdash; it was made in accordance with the law, the appeals procedure was gone through and the decision was upheld &mdash; it was not necessarily a just decision.  As more eminent speakers have said, the relationship between justice and the courts is not always obvious.  It is sometimes perceived that the courts tend to interpret and define the law rather than ensure that justice is done.  One is probably more likely to get a flexible interpretation of the law in the lower courts in terms of the decision made by the justice, based on what he thinks is fair.</P>
    <P>The key issue in relation to the tribunal is that the Martin committee believed it was not appropriate to refer cases of miscarriage of justice to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I have not yet heard an adequate explanation as to why the Government, having established the committee to make recommendations, has taken a contrary view and decided to ignore that specific recommendation.  I have to qualify what I am saying, as obviously the Government has taken on board some of the recommendations. However, it has ignored the key recommendation in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy De Rossa's point about the Martin committee, it is not unusual for the Government to set up a committee to make recommendations on changes in any area of the law or procedure and to take on some or all of those recommendations. In other words, it is not unusual for the Government to change or ignore some of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline what happens in such cases.  The committee gives its recommendations to the Department of Justice which, instead of repeating the recommendations verbatim, is entitled to look at them to see if what it wishes to achieve can be achieved in a better way.  If it is <Col N="1047" /> thought that the law in a certain area needs to be changed, the Law Reform Commission is normally asked to examine the law and make recommendations. Deputies who are familiar with the Law Reform Commission will know that it submits outline legislation.  I do not think the Department or indeed any Opposition party has ever accepted the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission verbatim &mdash; changes are always made.  The legislation put forward by the Department is not accepted verbatim either.  After debate in the House, the Minister may see reason to change certain provisions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not revolutionary for the Government to decide not to implement to the letter the recommendations of a committee.  This is the case in regard to all recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and other committees which have made recommendations to the Government. For example, a committee set up in 1990, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Costello, recommended, I think, 92 changes in the law relating to charities. Those recommendations will not be carried through verbatim.  The Department will see reasons for changing some of them; and when legislation is brought before the House, the Government, if it is prepared to be flexible &mdash; and this Government is &mdash; will accept amendments from the Opposition.  As Deputies will be aware, Governments sometimes change legislation by way of amendment during its passage through the House. The point I am making is that nobody has a monopoly on justice, whether it is the Department of Justice, Deputies in this House, the Law Reform Commission, the Martin committee or some other committee.  The extent to which the Government has accepted the recommendations in the Martin committee report is much greater than the extent to which it has accepted some of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell thought I accused her of casting a slight on the Judiciary.  I <Col N="1048" /> did not intend to do this.  I did not have Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy De Rossa or Deputy Mitchell in mind when I made those remarks.  If Deputy McDowell says he did not intend to cast a slur on the Judiciary, of course I have to accept what he says.  However, I repeated what he said and gave the conclusion I drew from it.  That is my interpretation of the English language &mdash; I am entitled to interpret the English language in whatever way I want &mdash; and that is the conclusion I reached.  However, if that was not the Deputy's intention, I accept that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that the Court of Criminal Appeal would not be the appropriate body to deal with cases of alleged miscarriages of justice because all those cases would involve inquisitorial type inquiries.  That is not correct.  In some cases the newly discovered fact could be a development in forensic science, a new witness, or simply a document which was missing.  Therefore, the courts will not require massive inquisitorial powers in all cases.  In cases where massive inquisitorial powers are required, I am almost certain that the proper route would be to have such cases heard by a tribunal set up by the Minister for Justice.  That is why the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is used in section 7, which deals with referrals to the Minister for Justice. In addition, the present powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal, not just in relation to section 2 applications but also in relation to ordinary appeals, are being beefed up when an inquiry has to be made.  For the first time ever the Court of Criminal Appeal is being given the power to direct the Garda Commissioner to conduct a Garda inquiry.</P>
    <P>The basic point is that the Martin committee recommended that people who are victims of miscarriages of justice should go back to a tribunal in all cases, even if a case is perfectly appropriate for a court hearing.  In other words, even if there is no inadmissible evidence, no perjurer wanting to come forward, and it is perfectly appropriate for the court to hear the case just like an ordinary appeal, the case should not go back to court.  The reasoning outlined in the <Col N="1049" /> Martin report does not support that conclusion. Deputies have not yet outlined to me the specific reasoning in the Martin report which supports that conclusion, and I challenge them to do so.  It does not.  Therefore, as Deputy O'Donoghue has pointed out so eloquently, the case has to go back to court.  People who say that all cases should go to a tribunal rather than a court have not given any conclusive reason for saying this.  Neither can I find any reason in the Martin report for this.</P>
    <P>My apologies to Deputy De Rossa, I did not answer his point in relation to a pardon.  We pass legislation here which must be consistent with the Constitution. When legislation is being drafted we obtain the advice of the Attorney General's office as to whether that legislation is consistent with the Constitution.  On occasions we are advised that it is and we proceed on that basis, someone then takes an action based on some section or subsection of the legislation and our advice is found to be wrong.  They are only human in the Attorney General's office, we cannot say that something is definitely constitutional or unconstitutional. On occasions we are found to be wrong but by and large we get it right.</P>
    <P>To say that when we are passing legislation in this House we must do so within the parameters of the Constitution is very different from saying that we can pass legislation here which takes a term from the Constitution and effectively says that the word &ldquo;pardon&rdquo; in article 13.6 of the Constitution has a particular meaning.  I do not believe this House has that power. When one takes a specific term from the Constitution which requires definition, I believe the court is the only place where that definition can be given.  That is my understanding of the Constitution but I intend to research the matter further.</P>

The Martin report recommends the establishment of a statutory inquiry body under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act and against referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It states: &ldquo;We doubt, however, whether references to the courts system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth&rdquo;.  It is unfair to say that because Members are highlighting the point made <Col N="1052" /> by the Martin committee, which was chaired by a judge, they are therefore saying that the courts are not competent to make judgements in the normal sense. No one is saying that.  Of course the courts are the appropriate place for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Martin report also states that the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act, 1989, which allows hearsay evidence in certain circumstances is a model that could be followed.  The committee came to that conclusion following submissions from many eminent people, including some who are now Ministers in this Government, former Ministers and former Members of this House and others who have nothing to do with politics. That is what these people said and other Members should not say that we on this side of the House are saying that the courts are not competent.  We are simply asking, as is our duty as Opposition spokespersons, what good and valid reason exists to depart from the recommendations of a very powerful committee chaired by a judge.  No reasons have been put forward here and I suspect that there are those who have put their spoke in to prevent the implementation of those recommendations.  The Minister says he has not been influenced by judges in this matter but I understand that judges were consulted.  This House should carry more weight than the judges.  This is a legislative matter and I see no reason we should not adopt the recommendations of the Martin committee, particularly as they are spelled out clearly in his report.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) who has two consecutive sentences amounting, in total, to not less than one year imposed on him by the District Court,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I made this point on Committee Stage.  I propose that paragraph (d) of my amendment should be inserted in the legislation because it is possible for a person to receive a sentence of up to 12 months from the District Court in such circumstances. In the normal course of events if that person can subsequently provide evidence that he or she is not guilty of the offence or evidence that would allow for a re-examination, it is not possible for such persons to have recourse to the rehearing process.  The Minister may argue that recording evidence in the District Court is not available, but that is regrettable.  There is no reason transcripts of evidence in the District Court should not be available.  If a person receives two consecutive sentences in the District Court totalling one year and can subsequently prove that he or she is innocent of the crime as charged he or she should be able to have the case reheard.  The Minister may argue that such persons have recourse to the normal appeal procedure of the Circuit Court. But a great deal of time may have elapsed and the transcript of evidence would not be available to the Circuit Court, even if a long time had elapsed.  In the case of summary offences there should be some mechanism in which an appeal procedure can be included.</P>

In amendment No. 15 Deputy Mitchell seeks to insert a condition that if a person is convicted in the District Court he or she will have to have been imprisoned before petitioning the Minister for Justice.  As the legislation stands, such people can petition the Minister for Justice for a pardon even if they have not been imprisoned and given the benefit of the probation act.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment would be more unjust to a victim of a miscarriage of justice than the legislation as drafted.</P>

      <P>I have learned that, in order to prepare the reply to the Deputy's <Col N="1067" /> question of 20 October 1993, officials of my Department had to contact principals of the company referred to in it to establish the facts in relation to the company being retained by ACC.</P>
      <P>I believe that this contact should have remained confidential &mdash; in line with the usual arrangements that exist between Departments and their consultants &mdash; and that it was not proper that the company should have made any approach to the Deputy, or the anybody else for that matter, on this issue.</P>

      <P>I tabled the question which relates to Nemesis, with which one of the Taoiseach's advisers is associated, late in the evening of 12 October.  It and I received a letter on 14 October.  It is clear that the question would hardly have reached the stage where contact might have been made on 13 October in respect of a question tabled for reply on 20 October.  Can the Taoiseach be more specific about the contact that was made and the basis on which it was made because this question deals with the relationship between him and his adviser rather than with the company?</P>

      <P>I have to correct the Deputy; the gentleman to whom he has referred is not an adviser to me or my Department, his company has entered into a contract relating to a number of specified projects with my Department. The Deputy should not complain about the efficiency of the Department, if as soon as a question is tabled, it seeks information to prepare an answer to it.</P>

      <P>I am hardly complaining about its efficiency as it is clear there was an efficient tick-tacking between his Department and the consultant and the company concerned. They must have been contacted withing a matter of 12 hours.  However, my question relates to privilege.  I would like to know how questions tabled by Deputies get into the hands of people outside this House.  How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with this aspect?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common practice in gathering material to prepare an answer to a question relating to a company which has a contract with any particular Department to contact that company.  As I said in my reply, it was not proper conduct for any member of the company concerned to get in touch with any Deputy in relation to a question that had been tabled.  Interaction between a Government Department and a company under contract takes place on a confidential basis and we expect it to be kept on that basis.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that my question relates to the Taoiseach's Department's relationship with the consultant and not with Nemesis.  My point is that there was no necessity for the Department to contact Nemesis in order to establish what presumably the Taoiseach already knew, the nature of the relationship between his Department and the consultant.  I am still at a loss to know the reason the information was conveyed to that company when it was not necessary to do so.  Indeed, the Taoiseach's reply on 20 October did not contain any information which might possibly have been conveyed to him by Nemesis, it related entirely to the relationship between his Department and the consultant.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The House can be assured that, in the context of the forthcoming series of meetings between the British Prime Minister and myself this month, all recent developments pertaining to Northern Ireland will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>With regard to responsibility for Northern Ireland policy, I set out the position in this regard to this House on 27 April 1993.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, is given ultimate authority, and therefore ultimate responsibility, in relation to the overall operation of the Government.  I therefore have an overseeing role and a corresponding involvement in all major policy areas, such as Northern Ireland, economic issues and European Union affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has direct functional responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs.  In his role as co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, he has immediate responsibility for the implementation of that Agreement in all its aspects and in relation to particular <Col N="1070" /> issues which arise in Anglo-Irish relations from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and I are at one in our policy approach to a resolution of the Northern Ireland conflict.  We are totally committed to the parallel pursuit of the peace and talks processes.  This position is fully supported by the entire Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, first, that I am glad the meeting is going ahead on Friday and I hope it will be a great success.  Will the Taoiseach clarify a number of points for the House?  Can he explain why it is necessary to have a series of meetings?  How many such meetings are envisaged and over what period will they take place?  Will they solely be between the two Governments?  Will the Taoiseach also deal in his reply with the intervention made by the US President, Bill Clinton, and outline the background to this?  Was an approach made by the Government to President Clinton and, if so, to achieve what purpose?  Finally, it is understood that President Clinton said to John Major that he wants him to go a further mile on the road in the peace process.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if there is to be success all politicians will have to go further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of meetings is envisaged and they will span the month of December.  The first working meeting is due to be held on Friday.  The Deputy asked why there was a necessity to have further meetings.  This shows the earnest of the two Prime Ministers to continue to devote all their energies towards trying to find a successful resolution and to put forward a formula for peace.  The first meetings is on Friday.  It will be a working meeting.  We will review progress at the Summit in Brussels and then move on to a further meeting.  It will all depend on progress and progress must be made.  I <Col N="1071" /> do not measure the amount of progress that still has to be made in terms of an Irish mile or an English mile.</P>
      <P>In relation to President Clinton, the Deputy surely has enough imagination to know that actions of President Clinton arose out of a recent visit to the White House by the Tánaiste and a meeting between him and President Clinton in regard to Anglo-Irish policy.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his comments that he has overall responsibility and the Tánaiste has responsibility for operational matters? Had the Taoiseach seen in advance the six principles outlined about a month ago by the Tánaiste in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is yes.  In relation to the overall responsibility, that arises under the Constitution.  I will read it again for the benefit of the Deputy. Under the Constitution the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, is given ultimate authority and therefore ultimate responsibility in relation to the overall operation of Government.  I therefore have an overseeing role and a corresponding involvement in all major policy areas such as Northern Ireland, economic issues and European Union affairs.  It is quite clear where the division is.  The Tánaiste's responsibilities are set out quite clearly.  He is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and he has full responsibility in that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is very wise in looking for a series of meetings rather than raising the expectation that he can deal with all the business at one meeting.  I fully support what he is trying to do and I think he is being very sensible about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would he agree that it is important that any declaration he is looking for from the British Government is seen to be a balanced one, that no community in Northern Ireland misinterprets it or sees it as threatening or as cuttingh them adrift in any way, and that to ensure that that <Col N="1072" /> happens he should use the extra time that he now has to be sure that he has direct face-to-face consultations with both communities in Northern Ireland so that they understand fully what is going on and do not fear things just because they have not been told about them directly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support of our approach to this series of meetings.  I can assure him that the proposals that the Irish Government has before the British Government in this respect are fully balanced.  They take into account the fears and insecurities of the Unionist population in relation to what they might think is a threat to their future and their position.  The same goes for the Nationalist population.  It is a fully balanced approach and, to be quite honest, I cannot see how either community, if they are being sincere and objective in their analysis of those proposals, could make any claim that they are in any way injurious to their present or future position.  This is purely a formula for peace.  Political solutions can be sought thereafter in the talks process that it is hoped can get under way.  The proposals in relation to peace certainly threaten nobody.  They are grounded on agreement and consent as far as the Unionist population is concerned.  We will use every opportunity that is available to us to communicate those assurances to both communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Irish Government asking the British Government to acknowledge the right of the Irish people as a whole to self-determination in return for acknowledging that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority there?

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the besetting fear of the Unionist community is that a deal is being done behind their backs or over their heads?  No matter what the Taoiseach puts on paper, and no matter how fair it appears on paper, it will be misunderstood and misinterpreted unless it is explained to them, face to face, that there is no threat.  Could I use this House to urge the Unionists to talk to the Taoiseach and urge the Taoiseach to make every possible effort to talk to them? Could I urge the SDLP to talk to the Unionists rather than talking to the Irish Government which is talking to the <Col N="1074" /> British Government which is, in turn, sending messages to the Unionists?  This sort of circular communication does not promote understanding.  Will the Taoiseach make every effort possible to ensure that everybody is involved in this process, that everybody feels part of it and that nobody feels that anything is being done behind their backs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly concur with the Deputy's sentiments in this regard.  I can assure him that every effort is being made both by me and the Tánaiste to talk to every representative of the Unionist population who will come to talk to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in this House on a number of occasions that I will go anywhere at any time to talk to Mr. Jim Molyneaux or any member of the Unionists and the Tánaiste has also made known his position in that regard.  When I spoke to the British Prime Minister the night before the last, I said that he should take the opportunity of acquainting Mr. Molyneaux and the Unionist members of the House of Commons with exactly what is involved in the proposals.  I am not trying to do a secret deal behind their backs.  I would be only too delighted to sit across the table from them and discuss it.  Every time I have had that opportunity with any community leader or anybody else and they have asked pertinent questions I have told them the position, they have gone away quite happy.  Mr. John Alderdice is a leading example.  He sat down with me and asked questions, and he went away happy that their future was not threatened.  We are doing everything we can.  I repeat that offer here today. Either I or the Tánaiste will go to any place at any time to talk to any of the Unionist politicians who choose to talk to us.  Indeed I have always urged the SDLP to talk to and communicate as much as possible with the Unionist community as well because they are the two communities that will have to live together <Col N="1075" /> and reach an accommodation of both traditions.</P>
      <P>We will continually urge that, but I want to repeat that there is no hidden agenda as far as the Unionists or the Nationalists are concerned.  It is a straight, open and balanced deal with a little compromise on everybody's part and that includes our part as well.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has said that Friday's meeting will be the first of a series.  Does he expect that there will be a communiqué of any kind following Friday's meeting?  How many meetings does he expect will take place and at what intervals &mdash; weekly, fortnightly or monthly?  At what point does he foresee that these meetings will reach a conclusion?</P>
      <P>In relation to reaching a final conclusion, the Taoiseach has stated that this is a peace process as distinct from the talks process.  Can we assume that what the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister are attempting to do is to find conditions which would be acceptable to the IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries to stop their campaigns, and could he indicate what condition, other than a requirement to enable them to sit at the negotiating table for a cessation of violence, does he believe it is possible to achieve which might satisfy both sets of paramilitaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speculate on the number of meetings that may be required.  We will see what progress can be achieved at the meeting, progress to the next meeting and, in the interim, work behind the scenes will continue. As Friday's meeting is a working one Deputies should not look forward to the usual long communiqué.  There will be other items, such as the forthcoming Summit in Brussels and the GATT negotiations, that will require discussion. However, the main item on the agenda is the search for a peace formula between the two teams, comprising the two Prime Ministers, the Tánaiste and the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for <Col N="1076" /> Northern Ireland and Minister for Justice. There is no point in speculating on how many meetings will take place, we will judge the progress made at each meeting.  We are trying to find a formula for peace that, I hope, will command support across both communities and both sets of paramilitaries because the paramilitaries on both sides are causing the violence.  As I said on a number of occasions in this House, if one set of violence is said to be reactive to the other there is no point in trying to stop violence on one side if there is no hope of stopping it on the other.  Consequently, that is the search going on and the search that people throughout the length and breadth of the country and in Britain want to see us pursue and succeed in achieving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members, including the Taoiseach, would have welcomed a meeting on Friday and a communiqué which would have contained the basis for a permanent cessation of violence. In the circumstances the Taoiseach's judgment must be respected in terms of what he has told the House he wishes to achieve and I agree with his objectives.  I wish the Taoiseach the very best in the discussions and, in doing so, I am sure I speak not only on behalf of Members of the House but for the majority of the people in the North and the majority of people on this island. The Taoiseach mentioned there will be a number of talks.  I hope we will be in a position to enjoy a happy and peaceful Christmas in a way that has not been possible for the past quarter of a century.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and goodwill and I know they are representative of Members of the House and outside.  However, this is a long and difficult road, it will not be an easy one and we never thought it would. There will be a number of road blocks along the way.  The reason a summit is not being held on Friday is that a good deal of work must be done on the ground to have a successful Summit.  This is a particularly difficulty issue and I was not satisfied a sufficient amount of work had <Col N="1077" /> been done in advance of it.  That is why I sought a series of meetings as a more sensible and pragmatic approach to the problem to show that both of us have put it at the top of our agenda and are agreeable to commit a good deal of our time to trying to find the formula that everyone hopes we will find.</P>

      <P>The Royal Dublin Society has recently submitted financial projections in relation to the proposed development of a national conference centre at its site at Ballsbridge.</P>
      <P>The essential difficulty for the society is providing the funds to match the European Structural Funds that are available for a national conference centre.  To date the society has been unable to generate the funds required.</P>
      <P>The steering group of officials viewed the latest proposal as deserving of a further final investigation and this is now underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is not possible <Col N="1078" /> to indicate when construction might commence.  I am happy, nonetheless, to repeat the Government's firm commitment to the development of a national conference centre by the RDS or by other promoters &mdash; it is provided for in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government commits the £50 million promised in the National Development Plan how much is the RDS expected to commit, and will the site it is offering be considered part of its contribution as that would be essential? If the RDS does not fulfil its obligations in respect of the centre will the Government then consider the other sites and offers available?  Will he indicate from where those offers are coming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no details of where those offers are coming from.  I was asked about this matter before, it was mentioned that it may be located in the Phoenix Park and that site will be considered.  I understand a good deal of money has been spent in preparing a presentation in that regard.  In relation to details of the submission by the RDS or by any other group, it is not the practice in this House to reveal such confidential information because it could be taken up by their opposition in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of the detail that will be dealt with on a confidential basis between the Department and the people concerned and I will not comment on it.  I am certain that point will get a full hearing and that everything that should be taken into account will be taken into account.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>The late Noel Lemass would probably ask the Taoiseach how many people over 45 were part of the 15,000 people and where were they from. I would like to clarify a matter and afford the Taoiseach the opportunity to deny what are probably erroneous newspaper reports.  During the summer there were media reports of an incident where a helicopter was alleged to have landed in Government Buildings on a Saturday morning with personnel who might not have been involved in Government business. The Taoiseach may not recall the incident but it was reported in a newspaper. Will the Taoiseach clarify that Government Buildings are not open to anybody &mdash; except perhaps the Taoiseach <Col N="1080" />&mdash; on Saturday mornings and that any such allegations are false?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a responsibility and a duty to respond to citizens who make representations to me or my office. All of us may have our views as to the cost involved but we live in a democracy and people are entitled to information and attention if they request it.  I am aware that the cost of dealing with each question is about £65 and this year alone in the region of 800 questions were put down to my Department.  When the total cost is calculated that amounts to a large sum of money.  In putting down questions Deputies must decide whether the information they request justifies the cost to <Col N="1082" /> the taxpayer.  If the information can be found in another way that should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in dictatorial regimes there is no question of putting down parliamentary questions or making representations to the Prime Minister or anyone else?  It is a fundamental part of democracy that people have access, by way of Dáil questions or otherwise, to the Taoiseach and the Government of the day.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be absolutely undemocratic to do as suggested by a member of the Labour Party and to restrict in any way the right of the public to write to the Taoiseach or any Minister and to restrict the rights of Members to table Dáil questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in all these matters it is the value of the question rather than the cost that we should be concerned about? Would he further agree that even if questions were not put down it is unlikely that a large number of staff would be let go or Deputies would be paid a lower salary? The costs will be incurred in any event. The system of putting down questions is one of the few opportunities for Deputies to use their discretion and to have the public service work for them.  The cost of dealing with questions is fixed rather than variable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully accept that the costs are fixed.

      <P>The National Economic and Social Council has welcomed the Government's enhanced commitment to a local development strategy.  I share the view in the NESC report &mdash; A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment &mdash; that local development initiatives should be co-ordinated within a national framework for local development.</P>
      <P>In the National Development Plan 1994-1999 the Government has proposed an integrated local development programme comprising the county enterprise boards, new partnership structures in areas characterised by high levels of long term unemployment and social exclusion, an extended community employment development programme and urban renewal measures.  The programme will be co-ordinated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESC recognises that different agencies are required because of the differing needs and priorities in the process of local development.  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of the local development programme, <Col N="1086" /> including arrangements to secure co-ordination will be contained in an operational programme which is being prepared at the moment in consultation with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>At national level the Government has established an interdepartmental policy committee on local development chaired by my Department in direct consultation with the Office of the Tánaiste which is representative of all relevant Departments and agencies.  This committee will ensure full co-ordination of all aspects of the programme as well as avoiding or eliminating any overlap.</P>

I accept that improvements in certain areas of the taxation system can make a contribution to a restructured economy but it is not the entire story and should not be presented as such.  Improvements have been made in respect of the lower paid in the tax wedge.  Successive Governments have endeavoured in budgets to take more and more of the lower paid out of the taxation system.  Having regard to the resources available in the immediate future, the Government is committed to taking more lower paid people out of the taxation system, thus improving the tax wedge.  I do not accept that eliminating the tax wedge is the answer to all our problems, but I recognise that it has a contribution to make in solving the problems in this area.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  Will the Taoiseach accept that this is the first time in six years that the tax wedge has got worse?  Will he concede that all of the agencies to which I referred will inevitably lead to wasteful duplication and competition for scarce resources?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said &mdash; each agency has a different purpose.  There are different priorities in regions and sectors.  For example, the county enterprise boards will support and encourage local enterprise which employ between one and five people.  This type of support system was not in place previously.  I often heard it said that the larger agencies were not interested in supporting local initiatives. The new agencies can make a very useful contribution to the creation of employment at a local level.  Over the past two years considerable success has been achieved in the area of rural development.  It is only by combining the efforts in the various areas that we can maximise our efforts to solve our unemployment problem, which I accept is the major unsolved problem in our economy.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think it is significant that it was only after the establishment of the local bodies that the Government started talking about a national framework for their development?  This seems to indicate that the decision to establish these bodies was not based on any assessment of how to ensure successful rural development. Will the Taoiseach agree that when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, was in Opposition, he put his finger on the real weakness in the 36 county enterprise boards, that is, they are grant-giving bodies which produce more local bureaucracy?</P>

People living in areas which did not previously have such a structure will be given the opportunity under the county enterprise boards to set up businesses. When I travelled around the country it was regrettably pointed out to me by local chambers of commerce, community development groups and others that all the decision-making took place in Dublin.  There is now an opportunity to encourage and support local enterprise and for the decisions to be made at a local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say when the Government will seriously consider lifting the State tree with all its branches from the body of the small businessman who has to pay VAT, PRSI, rates, etc.  The county enterprise boards have no teeth or money and can do very little to help people set up small businesses. Until such time as the Government takes steps to eliminate all unnecessary bureaucracy there will be no future for small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepts some of what Deputy Fox has said.  The county enterprise boards have approximately £250,000 to spend between now and Christmas and it is a matter for them as to how they spend it.  I agree that small businesses have to fill in too many forms &mdash; the State leans too heavily on them. That is why the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for commerce is examining the entire system together with small business people, the people in the best position to say which forms need to be done away with.  I have suggested to the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, that he should put all the forms which have to be filled in by small business on the walls of his office and call in the officials who drew up those forms to see how many of them are needed today. I am sure that a number, if not the majority, of these forms, could be done away with.  Unlike large businesses small businesses cannot afford the overheads involved in filling in an unending number of forms.  Businesses in the private sector should remember that when they call for more regulations they are calling also for more forms and the employment of additional civil servants to monitor the <Col N="1091" /> filling in of forms and ensure that the regulations are implemented.  The employment of these extra staff is another contributing factor to higher taxation. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Fox.  Plenty of room exists for improvement.  I hope that when the review takes place all the unnecessary bureaucracy will be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if the demarcation lines need to be more clearly defined between many of these bodies.  The confusion which seemed to exist prior to the setting up of the county enterprise boards, for instance, was referred to by the Taoiseach when he said that it was perceived that large organisations seemed to be helping the larger operator.  Does the Taoiseach recognise that much of the IDA activity, for instance, has been in regard to very small businesses although they do not receive the same attention as the Digitals and Amdahls?  Would the Taoiseach agree that what is happening is in fact a postponement of the radical <Col N="1092" /> change in the area of taxation rather than a measure to help reduce unemployment? It is simply postponing the action that is needed in areas such as work sharing, which we discussed earlier, guaranteed basic income and the tax reform that will shift from labour to resources.  Would the Taoiseach agree that only action in these areas will make a dent in unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas mentioned by Deputy Sargent will certainly have a contribution to make but there is no single answer to the unemployment problem and no one should pretend there is. In relation to support for small businesses, it was reflected in Culliton that international companies should be separated from indigenous companies and Forbairt was set up with the sole responsibility of developing indigenous industry. The county enterprise boards were established to identify companies who would employ two, three or four people and it is up to the other agencies, if they progress beyond that, to take those companies on to the next stage.  Nobody would deny that gaps existed in this area which needed to be addressed and the restructuring and reorganisation should provide a more focused effort in relation to the sort of problems to which Deputy Sargent referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has initiated a series of annual statutory sample inquiries of enterprises in the services sector.  The first survey was undertaken in 1992.  The principle purpose of these annual inquiries <Col N="1093" /> is to provide basic data necessary for the compilation of the national accounts. They were also initiated to generally improve statistics for the services sector identified as a priority development by the National Statistics Board following demands from many users.</P>
      <P>The retail and wholesale sectors are covered annually with rotating coverage of other sectors in successive years.  The hotels, restaurants and catering sectors were covered in 1992 and the business services sector was covered in 1993.  The inquiry covers some 9,700 enterprises in 1993 and seeks a very limited range of information which should be readily available from basic business records.</P>
      <P>While it is the objective of the CSO to maximise the use of administrative records for statistical purposes, the information available at present from administrative systems is not sufficient for compiling statistics for the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister accept that the person who gave me his annual service inquires form has enough to do to keep his drapery business open with the 21 per cent VAT on clothing and the increase in commercial rates that has been imposed due to the fact that the rate support grant is so miserable without having to fill in a form about VAT, stocks, salaries and wages which will cost him money?  Most of this can be obtained from information previously supplied through the myriad of forms mentioned already.  Is it not absurd that at his expense the State will obtain information which, to those small businessmen from whom this information is sought, will be the final nail in the coffin?  More jobs will probably be lost than will be gained eventually because these statistics will more than likely be buried in some room in the Central Statistics Office and will be of no benefit to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree totally with the Deputy.  The Central Statistics Office does not collect statistics in order to bury them somewhere.  Statistics are collected, <Col N="1094" /> in this case, for the national accounts, Such information is absolutely necessary and the CSO does not collect statistics merely to annoy business people.  The statistics are required for a very good reason, often to the benefit of the business sector.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy obtained the annual service inquiries form in question but I do not think it would take much time to answer the eight questions that are on the form, all of which information is readily available to the person, including the number of people he employs in the firm and the annual turnover.</P>
      <P>A difficulty arises in relation to the use of administrative records in this case.  I agree with the Deputy on one point.  We passed a statistics Bill, as he is aware, earlier this year which will allow for the increasing use of administrative records for surveys such as this.  However, the information that is needed for this survey cannot be obtained from other records. One might seek such information from the Revenue Commissioners but there are a number of difficulties in relation to that.  First, Revenue do not classify businesses at the moment by activity.  In addition, total turnover is not available from VAT statistics and so on because some goods are zero rated and would not give an accurate turnover figure.  There is a difficulty also in relation to linking details for businesses from the different tax systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy, in the spirit in which the question was asked, that discussions are taking place with Revenue and other Departments to ensure that the administrative systems and records are standardised as far as possible so that we can minimise the amount of form filling that will have to be done by retailers and businessess generally.  As the Taoiseach said &mdash; the Minister is in the House at the moment &mdash; a task force on jobs in the service area has been established and I understand that is giving close attention to the whole area of collecting statistics. Certainly, any recommendations made to me as the person responsible for the <Col N="1095" /> Central Statistics Office will be given careful consideration.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to clarify that I am not knocking the Central Statistics Office.  As recently as yesterday it provided me with very valuable information on population, etc. How will the information that is sought from this particular businessman help to create jobs in Ireland?  Will this man have to pay his accountant an additional £100 or £200 to supply information that any sane person would object to supplying? That is how most small businessmen feel at the moment and some of them have given up their businesses.  I know of two business people who simply gave up, they were getting old and they could not take the hassle any more.  They were asked to complete VAT forms, PRSI forms and so on.  They were honest people and they worried constantly about having their accounts up to date.</P>

In case the Deputy is not aware, a total of 24 CSO field officers are employed for four months of the year to assist business people who experience difficulties with the form.  If the Deputy wishes to give me the names and addresses of people who are having difficulty with this form I will arrange for field officers to call to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as industrial start-ups are concerned, I am aware that there has been a decline in recent years in the number of such start-ups assisted by the two principal industrial development agencies, the IDA and SFADCo.  However, as indicated in my reply to a question by Deputy Bruton on this matter on 27 October 1993, there are several other agencies and groups, apart from the IDA and SFADCo, involved in business start-up, including industrial start-ups.  The most significant of these, in terms of spending power, are within the aegis of other Departments.  Examples of the latter would be the Leader and rural development programmes for which my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has responsibility and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area-based companies for which the Taoiseach's Department has responsibility.  Statistics are not readily available on the number of industrial start-ups arising from the agencies and groups, other than IDA and SFADCo, involved in this area.  However, it is probable that the decline in the IDA and SFADCo start-ups in recent years reflects the wider choice available in that period of alternative sources of finance for start-ups.</P>
      <P>While I am not aware of any statistics which show that the number of business start-ups generally is in decline, I am acutely conscious of the need to increase substantially the current level of start-ups with a view to making inroads on our unacceptably high levels of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> In this connection, the primary focus of the county enterprise boards initiative, which is currently being put in place, will be on proposals for start-up in enterprise. The boards will have a multi-sectoral brief, although projects in industry and manufacturing and in the internationally-traded services sector which exceed a threshold of ten persons in terms of employment potential will be reserved to Forbairt.  The new boards will complement the work of the existing State agencies and will not displace or duplicate local enterprise initiatives.  The CEBs will be in a position to offer grant support to start-ups to a maximum of £50,000 involving investment costs of up to £100,000.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the risk/reward ratio must be in balance if we are to succeed in encouraging start-up businesses in the future.  In this regard I see the role of Government as twofold.  First is the creation of a climate conducive to business start-ups and growth.  This involves issues of broad Government economic policy &mdash; fiscal policy, pay restraint, taxation, interest rates etc.  Second is the extent to which Government agencies and services can support individuals to get their projects up and running and to assist them in the early phase of development.</P>
    <P>In terms of the environment for enterprise, inflation and interest rates are currently at historically low levels.  As regards financial supports, the Government, apart from the CEBs, supplemented the current wide range of supports available to start-ups with the introduction of a new seed capital investment scheme and the extension of the business expansion scheme for a further three years in the 1993 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, the small business task force, which I set up in June 1993 in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister of State responsible for commerce and technology, Deputy Séamus Brennan, has been examining and will make recommendations soon on all of the main issues affecting small firms, including start-ups.  The task force, which is chaired by the Minister of State, consists of the owner managers of 14 small <Col N="1098" /> businesses.  Therefore its members have first hand knowledge of the problems faced by small businesses.  I can assure the Deputies that the recommendations of the task force, when they emerge, will be given full and prompt consideration.</P>

Would he not agree that the figures supplied by his Department indicate a 50 per cent decline in five years?  Would he not agree that only one-third of the target set in the last national plan for export growth from the small to medium enterprise sector was reached and that there was a dismal failure on the part of his Department to achieve the targets set for the small business sector?  Finally, would he not agree that the appropriate response to the problems of small businesses is to render small business profitable, not to establish a proliferation of agencies and numerous, new grant-giving bodies which the Culliton report indicated was past its sell-by date as an approach to industrial development?</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's assertion.  This question was asked before and a reply given in October.  As we heard already from the Taoiseach in reply to an earlier question today, there is a clear need, at local level, in that people who sought to create jobs on the lowest possible scale were simply not being listened to by the Industrial Development Authority because it was restricted to manufacturing and internationally-traded services and would not deal with firms below a certain scale of size.  I might add that the county enterprise boards nationwide were designed specifically to deal with them.  There is no duplication in that area.  The Leader programme, with which the Deputy may be familiar, is designed to address the particular and acute problems of rural depopulation in the context of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and agricultural activity generally.  In addition, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area programmes are designed specifically for 12 areas of concentrated, long term, acute unemployment where the nature of the problem is totally different.  We have come forward with three totally different and specially designed responses to different kinds of problems because the nature of unemployment and business start-ups is different in different parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House but I have just been asked a question to which I must respond.  On 12 January 1993, when this Government came in to office, we had received the last of the Moriarty Task Force recommendations.  Within less than a year we have done precisely what people had been seeking for years, which was to divide the Industrial Development Authority into two, one an internationally-focused organisation for inward investment and the other dealing with indigenous industry.  These agencies will be legally operative from 1 January next, less than 12 months after we assumed office.</P>

    <P>To date I have not personally prepared a formal submission to the forum on the subject of unemployment.  Deputies will be aware, however that the Government is represented on the forum by the Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  I am maintaining <Col N="1101" /> contact with the Tánaiste's office on the work of the forum and expect that, as the forum requires, I will be making submissions on various issues to assist the forum in the very important work in which it is engaged.  Officials of my Department and its agencies have maintained contact with the secretariat of the forum to assist in their work in any way possible and this will continue.  Yesterday, for example, FÁS made a detailed submission to the forum on measures to deal with long term unemployment.</P>

Would he not agree that the onus is on him, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to submit to public scrutiny proposals by a group of people drawn from every sector of our community to tackle this problem?  Is it not unrealistic to assume or believe that those people alone can produce ideas?  Would he not agree that this is a question of dialogue and, as the Minister never tires of saying, partnership?  Would he not agree that the onus is on his Department to submit its proposals to scrutiny by that forum?</P>

It would be the height of interference and arrogance for us to give a view before they furnished theirs to us.  They only recently published their first report to which we will respond.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I have noted the views of the Governor of the Central Bank as expressed in an address which the Governor made to the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin on 18 November 1993. In his address the Governor did say that research recently undertaken by staff of the Central Bank indicated that domestic policy factors account for about one-half of the rise in Irish unemployment.  He went on to say that while one cannot accept the results of such studies as scientific fact they do indicate areas for reform and improvement.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in accepting that domestic policies are the key to how well we tackle the unemployment problem. Clearly, they are not sufficient in themselves as demographic and external factors are equally important in determining levels of unemployment in Ireland.  But even if these latter factors become more favourable to employment creation in Ireland we will not achieve a turn-around in dealing with the unemployment problem without appropriate domestic policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the thrust of the Governor's remarks are in accord with current policy, including: the achievement of consensus on the need for wage moderation; ensuring through competition legislation and associated administrative action that open competition prevails across all sectors of the economy and that artificial barriers to entry into business trade or profession are removed; removing administrative barriers to the start-up and development of the small business sector and encouraging greater activity in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I agree that there are many factors affecting employment which are within national control.  The actions already taken by the Government since it came to office, and the policies it has put in place for the future, indicate clearly the Government's resolve to use all the means at its disposal to make the maximum contribution possible to the creation of employment and the reduction of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government set out a very comprehensive response to the recommendations of the Culliton report in its publication &mdash;&ldquo;Employment through Enterprise&rdquo; published on 4 May &mdash;&mdash; which sets out in some detail the actions being taken by the Government to promote employment creation across a wide range of policy areas.  These include many of the areas referred to in the address of the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>

The section of the IDA that was to deal with indigenous industry &mdash; Forbairt &mdash; is still awaiting the appointment of a chief executive officer, despite the fact that the executive officer of the overseas section of that organisation <Col N="1106" /> was appointed months ago.  When will the Government appoint a chief executive officer to Forbairt.

Forbairt is up and running and will be legally incorporated on 1 January 1994 ahead of any time table that anybody foresaw when the Dáil debated the issue.  In relation to the other matters raised by the Deputy, we have set up county enterprise boards at local level so that people can have access in a way that never previously existed.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The recent publication of the IBEC survey on employer public liability claims for personal injury confirms what I have been saying regarding the level of insurance costs in Ireland.  There can be little doubt that the cost of employers' and public liability insurance is a major hindrance to employment creation and maintenance here.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the IBEC survey is to be regarded as an important contribution to considerations of why and how the cost of personal injury compensation ought to be reduced, particularly in the context of job creation.</P>
      <P>Both the number and the average cost of employer and public liability claims are increasing.  The cost of these claims is ultimately met by business and so on, such as local authorities, through their insurance premia which totalled £157 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>Thus, the insurance reform unit, which I established in my Department, is examining ways and means of reducing the level of personal injury compensation, which substantially determines the cost of employers' and public liability insurance.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the time although it does not ease my frustration. This question, which I tabled on the last occasion, concerns me because in regard to industry it is beginning to inhibit job creation.  Out-of-court settlements can be as high as £13,800 whereas court settlements average £21,000. During the summer recess the Minister got considerable mileage out of this issue. Last May he said he felt so strongly about the issue that he would hold a referendum if necessary in order to obtain views on this issue.  In the past the Minister secured concessions <i>vis-á-vis</i> juries in regard to <Col N="1108" /> legal representation and yet the cost of insurance cover is soaring.  The Minister appears to be latching on to one issue all the time &mdash; the pain and suffering element &mdash; as the easy issue?  The Minister has not put forward any proposal. When will the Minister stop waffling? When will the ideological difference between Cabinet members be eliminated? The Minister is nodding his head.

This morning I had a letter from a firm which stated that their employers' liability insurance had risen to £80,000 from £40,000 last year.  That small company employs 60 people and has a turnover of £3 million.  Its employers' liability insurance doubled in one year.

Every effort is being made in conjunction with our veterinary staff to maintain service to the industry.

      <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry highlighted the abuses that were frequently taking place because of inadequate staffing in the meat plants.  With the agricultural officers on strike in these four plants, and quite likely to go on strike in all plants nationwide, is there not a likelihood that we will have a repetition of the wholesale abuse of the system in the meat factories? Is it not possible that again we will have our knuckles rapped by the European Commission for dereliction of duty in this most important sector?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister intervene in an effort to resolve the dispute?  It was quite outrageous for the Minister to state that I was being dramatic when the whole country was horrified by the extent of the abuse which was highlighted at the Beef Tribunal.  This was largely due to a lack of supervision and as a result of this strike there will be no supervision.  Previously it was inadequate but now it does not exist at all.  What is dramatic about stating the facts?  People were horrified by the abuse and will not accept this kind of answer from the Government.

I raised this matter a considerable number of months ago and I understand that the Department was looking at this very closely.

      <P>The agricultural officers threatened industrial action and on 22 April last an agreement was drawn up between the Department and IMPACT. In practice, some agricultural officers have interpreted this agreement to mean that they can determine the working levels and the number of hours of overtime. The Department could not accept that.  In the agreement reached with IMPACT, it was accepted that the veterinary inspector in charge at each meat plant would determine the level of overtime <Col N="1112" /> necessary.  IMPACT is relying on another clause of the agreement which stated that the staff in attendance would be in accordance with custom and practice. There are mechanisms through which disputes can be resolved and I ask that those mechanisms be used.</P>

Will he not accept from what he has just said that it is clear that the roots of this problem go back several months and that it was a ham fisted effort by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to put arbitrary limits on overtime that created this problem?  Does he agree that it has been very clear for some months past that every meat factory in the country has had difficulty in meeting its killing and production schedules because of the way the Department has introduced these overtime restrictions?  Will he reconsider his manner of dealing with this issue and not adopt this flagrantly confrontational method of controlling expenditure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 was enacted to provide for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing and for the better control of greyhound race tracks and coursing grounds.  The Act established Bord na gCon and gave to it the responsibility for the control of racing and the improvement and development of the industry. Up to 1958 greyhound racing had been controlled throughout the 32 counties by the Irish Coursing Club.  That club continues to control racing at Northern Ireland tracks and coursing throughout the 32 counties.  The 1958 Act recognises the Irish Coursing Club as being, subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds and gave it responsibility for the maintenance of the greyhound stud book which it had been producing since 1923.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry is a significant source of employment in rural areas.  I understand about 8,000 people are involved in the industry as breeders, owners and trainers.  If those involved in operating racing tracks or in the supply of ancillary services are included, it is estimated that some 10,000 people derive their livelihoods either directly or indirectly from the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greyhound breeding and rearing are integral parts of rural life in Ireland.  It is primarily carried on by the agricultural community, in particular on the smaller, less economic holdings, to augment the earnings of small farmers, agricultural sector employees and rural dwellers.  The profile of a typical Irish breeder is that of a small farmer or rural dweller who keeps one, two or three dams for breeding purposes; who sells some of the puppies produced <Col N="1193" /> at 8 to 12 weeks old to other neighbouring farmers and rears the balance of the litters to racing age.  The greyhounds are then raced to demonstrate their capabilities for sale or export.</P>
    <P>According to recent surveys carried out by Bord na gCon and the University of Limerick, farmers, mainly with small holdings, account for 6,000 of the total of 8,000 breeders, rearers and trainers. These activities generate an estimated farm income of about £16 million or an average of £2,600 per farmer.  It is estimated that the industry is worth about £40 million per annum to the economy. As such, it must be regarded as a genuine alternative farm enterprise making a significant contribution and capable of making an even greater contribution towards retaining people on the land and in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is an enterprise with a long tradition in which we are skilful, have natural advantages and market potential.  It is basically export orientated, its main market being the United Kingdom.  The industry at the breeder and rearer level is in reasonably good condition. However, if the sector is to reach its full potential existing export markets must be exploited to the full and new markets identified and developed.  Apart from the many merits which the greyhound racing sector has to recommend it on its own account &mdash; such as the direct and indirect employment that it provides and its contribution to the quality of life for residents and tourists &mdash; it is also the shop window for the industry.  Without this the breeding and rearing sector cannot develop fully.  It is the performance of greyhounds at top quality racing meetings which attracts buyers from abroad and encourages them to pay top prices.</P>
    <P>I regret that the current state of the greyhound racing industry could not be described as healthy.  Attendances at greyhound race meetings fell from 1 million in 1975 to about 700,000 in 1992. Bord na gCon's main sources of income, in other words the sources of income available to the industry for its development, are the on-course betting levy, profits from tote betting, Government grants <Col N="1194" /> and sponsorship.  The levy income increased between 1981 and 1991 only from £1.1 million to £1.2 million.  This represents a substantial reduction in real terms.  Levy income is believed to have dropped to a figure slightly in excess of £1 million in 1992.  Reduced attendances have also affected the tote.  Net proceeds from the tote dropped from £700,000 in 1981 to £169,000 in 1991.  Provisional figures for 1992 show a slight recovery to about £300,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the board's contribution to prize money has been well maintained over the last decade.  In 1991 and 1992 its contribution represented about 55 per cent of its operating income. Total prize money has seen a marked increase since the mid-eighties with the contributions from private sector sponsors increasing steadily.  The sponsors were recruited by the board and the track managements themselves.  However, the board's contribution is by far the greatest at over £800,000 per annum.  Sponsorship by outside commercial interests has reached a record high of £560,000 i.e. almost 30 per cent of the current total prize money of £2 million.</P>
    <P>The board's income has been supplemented in recent years by grants-in-aid from the proceeds of the off-course betting levy.  These grants-in-aid amounted to £0.5 million in 1990 and £0.75 million in each of the years 1991, 1992 and 1993.  Despite this, all of the board's income is now used up on administration and prize money, leaving no funds available for developing the industry or for grant-aiding the maintenance or improvement of facilities at tracks.  The tracks themselves have to rely on income from admission fees, trial fees, bookmaker pitch fees and profits from bar and catering activities.  The tracks find it very difficult to operate profitably on this basis and there are no funds generated which could be used for reinvestment in facilities. The net result is that the tracks have become progressively run down.</P>
    <P>In the current climate with an ever-increasing array of leisure time activities to choose from, I believe that there is little prospect of attracting the punters <Col N="1195" /> back to greyhound racing in increasing numbers unless the facilities provided are upgraded to the standards expected today.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCon is at present in the process of implementing a five-year plan which was adopted in 1990 in order to restore the organisation to profitability and to redevelop the industry.  The main features of the plan are computerisation of operations; adoption of cost cutting measures and the reorganisation of management functions; reallocation of prize money with emphasis on raising attendances at the premier tracks; securing increased sponsorship and other income generating activities; introduction of improved controls of racing and betting; greyhound breeding to be designated as an alternative farm enterprise; a national stud and a marketing centre to be established and Shelbourne Park to be developed as the premier greyhound track in the country.  Under this plan Clonmel track was sold and the board is now seeking to sell its track at Youghal. It is also considering the possibility of selling Harold's Cross track and of transferring its racing fixtures to Shelbourne Park.  However, the implementation so far of the development plan has not had the desired effect on the fortunes of the industry which remains in a depressed state.</P>
    <P>It was in these circumstances and in view of the fact that current legislation governing the industry is now 35 years old that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, in July 1992 established a task force consisting of representatives of Bord na gCon and officials from the Department to examine the structures, financing and legislation governing the industry.  The remit of this group also included the issue of coursing.  The task force concluded its deliberations some time ago.  Subsequently, the Department submitted a position paper on the industry to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and me.  Following consideration of the issue by us proposals were put to and approved by Government last June.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> The Government recognised that a comprehensive amendment of the Greyhound Industry Act would be a time consuming and complex exercise.  They therefore approved the preparation and introduction into the Dáil of a short Bill dealing with three issues of an urgent nature.  Heads of a more comprehensive Bill updating and amending the provisions of the 1958 Act are at present in the course of preparation in the Department and I will be pressing to have this work completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House proposes to amend section 9 of the 1958 Act so as to give the Minister power to appoint the ordinary members of Bord na gCon without reference to vocational background and to provide that the term of office of directors shall be three years, terminating on a rotational basis; to amend section 36 of the Act to empower the Minister to make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and for veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after such meetings; to amend section 23 of the Act so as to remove the ban on greyhound racing on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>The board consists of a chairman and six ordinary members.  Under the current Act three of the six members, and not more than three, shall be members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  I believe this provision is too restrictive.  It means that only three places are available for all other sectors of the industry such as owners, breeders, trainers, private track owners and bookmakers. A case could also be made that the board should include someone with good business and financial experience and expertise.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that members of the ICC could claim to represent greyhound owners, breeders, trainers and even private track owners and, indeed, a new board might well contain several people who happen to be members of the standing committee of the ICC.  However, I believe that the statutory requirement is no longer valid and should be removed.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this provision in the <Col N="1197" /> 1958 Act must be looked at in the light of the circumstances obtaining at that time.  Until the 1958 Act was adopted and Bord na gCon established, the ICC was the controlling body for both greyhound racing and coursing.  It was logical that, as the body with the expertise at the time, it would, in the interests of continuity, be given a major role in directing the new body.  That situation no longer exists and I propose to avail of this opportunity to remove these unnecessary restrictions on the Minister when appointing a new board.</P>
    <P>The current legislation also provides that the ordinary members of the board are appointed for a five-year term of office and that a new board is appointed during every fifth year.  In the interests of greater flexibility and continuity I am proposing that membership of the board will be for a three-year term and that vacancies will occur on a rotational basis. In other words, after the initial &ldquo;running-in period&rdquo; two vacancies will fall to be filled each year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that earlier this year the question of coursing was given a comprehensive examination by the House in the context of the Wildlife Bill, 1993.  During that debate I announced that I had reached agreement with the ICC that controls aimed at eliminating the kill during coursing meetings would be introduced.  These controls include rule changes which would reduce the number of courses, improve veterinary supervision and provide for better conservation of the hare stock.  The club also agreed to complete its research programme aimed at developing a muzzle which, while having regard for the welfare of hares and dogs, will lead to all dogs participating in enclosed live hare coursing being muzzled.  The club further agreed that a significant number of courses in the current coursing season would be used as trials to allow for the introduction of muzzling for all courses at an early date.</P>
    <P>I have established a monitoring committee within the Department to oversee the implementation of these measures and to assess their impact.  In accordance <Col N="1198" /> with their agreement, the ICC commenced the phasing in of muzzling on a trial basis at the beginning of the current season.  In the initial stage of the trials the greyhounds participating in the semifinals and finals of all stakes were muzzled. The ICC recently agreed to extend these trials on muzzling to more than 50 per cent of all courses.</P>
    <P>Muzzling has certainly brought about a considerable improvement.  The latest information available, covering the period up to 21 November, is that out of 1,029 courses involving muzzles four hares were killed and eight were injured and were put down.  The momentum towards increasing the level of muzzling will continue with all greyhounds being muzzled at enclosed coursing in time.  My target is the elimination of the kill and I will continue to work towards that goal. Initially a soft leather muzzle was used and more recently a plastic one.  The search for the ideal muzzle will continue. I will continue to monitor the situation, the ultimate aim being the elimination of the kill.</P>
    <P>The agreement we reached with the ICC will be observed without the necessity of legislative backing.  Nevertheless I consider it prudent to avail of this opportunity to include a provision authorising the Minister to make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and for the veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after such meetings.  These are enabling provisions which will give the Minister power to introduce the required measures without delay if the need arises. Deputies will also observe that these powers are being given added teeth by the level of the penalties being prescribed.</P>
    <P>The third provision in the Bill proposes to remove the ban on greyhound racing on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Various interests within the industry have represented to me that several highly remunerative meetings could be held on Sundays if this ban were lifted. As I stated, the greyhound industry is in competition with a variety of other forms of entertainment, none of which suffers <Col N="1199" /> from a similar ban.  I am therefore proposing its removal in the interests of fair competition.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I have accepted for some time that this ban should be removed but its removal got caught up in the wider issues which were under consideration.  Two Sunday race meetings were held during the past year in the knowledge that steps were being taken to have the ban removed.  I am now proposing that the removal of the ban will have effect from 1 December 1993 in accordance with an established precedent whereby the amendment gives legal effect to the provision from the date on which the policy decision was taken.  The removal of the ban on Sunday racing and the reconstitution of the board were recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies in its report on Bord na gCon.  The remaining recommendations of the committee can be classified under two headings.  They are either matters for Bord na gCon and as such need not directly concern us here or they are proposals which require legislative changes. I can assure Deputies that these latter proposals will be given careful consideration when the comprehensive Bill is being drafted but I will comment briefly on some of the more important issues raised.</P>
    <P>I consider that satisfactory and generally accepted control structures which will win the confidence of the punter are essential if the fortunes of the industry are to be reversed.  A major cause of the current lack of confidence in the controls derives from the fact that the board owns seven out of the 18 tracks currently operating.  The general public are not convinced that the one organisation can satisfactorily operate racing tracks and at the same time objectively administer the various control procedures necessary to ensure scrupulously fair treatment for everyone.  This is a matter to which I will have to give serious consideration before drafting the second Bill.</P>
    <P>Another issue which will require careful <Col N="1200" /> consideration is the statutory relationship between Bord na gCon and the ICC. The Oireachtas Joint Committee recommends that there should be no statutory relationship.  This begs the question of whether it is wiser to allow the ICC to operate as an entirely private body or to retain some control over its activities.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Joint Committee's recommendation that the international marketing centre should only be proceeded with if it has a high chance of commercial success, I fully appreciate the concerns expressed and in fact the project was not proceeded with during the programme which is now drawing to a close. However, the motives behind this proposal deserve some sympathy in my view.  As I stated, the industry is basically export orientated.  A very attractive potential market exists in the United States.  Unlike other markets, the emphasis in North America is primarily on stamina. While greyhounds in Ireland run in track racing of six-dog races, mostly on grass and to an outside lure, in the United States they run in eight and sometimes nine-dog races on sand to an inside lure.</P>
    <P>American buyers are not prepared to hold Irish-bred dogs for the recommended acclimatisation period.  Major US buyers have recommended that Irish greyhounds destined for export to North America should be trained in Ireland for US conditions.  This was the function which the proposed marketing centre was intended to fulfil.  Because of the emphasis on stamina in the United States, greyhounds have also to be specially bred for this market.  The original marketing centre proposal envisaged a national stud and marketing centre.  The Department has discussed this matter with Bord na gCon and as a result I am hoping that the new structural funds programme when finalised will include more flexible arrangements in relation to this issue.  I fully recognise that a venture of this nature cannot be guaranteed to be a commercial success but I consider that the allocation of a certain amount of funds to the projects is justified.</P>
    <P>I would again draw the attention of the House to the substantial nature of this <Col N="1201" /> industry.  It employs about 10,000 people, mostly in rural areas, thereby helping to maintain the demographic balance between urban and rural areas.  Greyhound rearing and breeding are genuine alternative enterprises in the agricultural secor.  In terms of overproduction in our main agricultural products this sector has an important role to play in maintaining farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The role of this House is to provide the legislative framework which will enable the industry to reach its full potential. The current legislative framework is the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  A thorough overhaul of this legislation is now called for.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile a preliminary Bill dealing with three urgent matters is being presented to the House for adoption.  The issues, namely, the reconstruction of the board of Bord na gCon, the removal of the ban on Sunday greyhound racing and enabling provisions empowering the Minister to make regulations governing the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and veterinary supervision of hares are not controversial and I recommend their adoption to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an astonishing air of unreality about the way this debate has started.  In his final words, the Minister of State spoke of the measures he contemplates here as being uncontroversial. The only way in which they could be regarded as uncontroversial is that the Minister of State has deliberately avoided any area of controversy in presenting these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to show that a series of controversial areas are not dealt with in this Bill.  There is an even greater element of unreality about the fact that for the first time in a long time we have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the House when we are dealing with a Bill to do with agriculture, and he has said nothing.  The Minister sat through this presentation of his proposals without saying a word.  Is he muzzled, or has he volunteered to be muzzled?  Maybe the Minister is quiet because he wants to avoid controversy.  That would be very <Col N="1202" /> much in keeping with his conduct.  He avoided controversy yesterday when the IFA held a major rally in Dublin on GATT.  The Minister came in, said his party piece and left immediately.  He did not wait to hear any of the controversial matters that other people, including myself, wanted to raise.  The Minister may have thought he had honeyed words for those people yesterday but none of these people believe that he understands the issue before us well enough to do anything worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, we had the Minister running away from a GATT debate and today we have the Minister of State saying a lot of overblown things in his presentation of the Bill.  He spoke about the importance of greyhounds as an alternative farm enterprise and how important alternative farm enterprises are.  For a great many people who are involved in this industry the keeping of greyhounds is not in any sense an alternative farm enterprise.  It is something they enjoy doing and many continue to do for as long as it does not cost them too much money.  Most people do not make a substantial amount of money from keeping greyhounds.  In presenting this as an alternative farm enterprise, the Minister is badly mistaken.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister, of State in his heart of hearts knows that what I am saying is right, although I am not so sure about the Minister for Agriculture.  He does not seem to have time to bother with these matters.  I am afraid my words will be borne out in the future.  There is no point in looking to alternative farm enterprise such as this to take up the slack, to make up the losses that Irish farmers will suffer because of what the Minister for Agriculture has failed to do about GATT on account his connivance in the ridiculous CAP reform manufactured by one of his predecessors, Ray MacSharry, of which he personally approved.  He has gone to some trouble in this House, Sir, to tell me it was the CAP reform he approved of and not the GATT.  I have looked over the references and, as Deputy Rabbitte would say, the Minister's well tailored posterior is well <Col N="1203" /> out the window on both those issues.  To present greyhound keeping and participation in this industry as an alternative farm enterprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being presented as being only a part of a wider review of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 and we are told that the rest is to come at some time in the future, although we are not told when.  The Minister of State indicated he is now in the process of preparing the heads of a Bill.  I would like to know why there is a delay.  What is there in the animal that is being gestated in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry that has taken so long in the birthing?  How long will we have to wait for the review to appear?  How long will we have to wait to see the full picture? By the Minister's admission this Bill is only part of the picture.  The explanatory memorandum states that the Government recognises that this comprehensive amendment of the 1958 Act would be a complex and time consuming task which apparently is not even yet in its early stages.  The three measures proposed in the Bill are being brought forward to deal with immediate problems and perhaps to whet our appetites.  That is not a satisfactory way of dealing with this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Minister's admission it is an industry that is experiencing serious difficulties. The Minister devoted a great <Col N="1206" /> part of his speech to illustrating the situation in the industry.  He painted a fairly accurate picture of the position. There are some matters he did not mention which I intend to refer to later.  He referred to declining attendances which dropped to 700,000 in 1992 from one million in 1975.  I believe there has been a peak in the intervening years.  In ten years levy income increased from £1.1 million to £1.2 million and it is believed it will decrease this year.  Net proceeds from the tote dropped from £700,000 in 1981 to £169,000 in 1991, although there is some hope of an increase in 1992.  It is curious that on 1 December 1993 the Minister is in a position to give only a provisional figure of the proceeds of the tote in 1992.  Surely that is indicative of another problem which the Minister has not mentioned in his remarks this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us how difficult the situation is in the industry, yet he has come into the House with a Bill that will deal with only a small part of the problem.  He expects us to believe that what he is doing will be worthwhile for the industry which, on his own admission, is in a very poor state.  Why are we not presented with a proper and comprehensive response to the problems of the industry?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention a number of matters, some of which are difficult and some controversial.  I will elaborate.  At present there are very serious difficulties in the relationship between Bord na gCon and the rest of the industry.  People in the industry, the Irish Coursing Club, trainers, track owners and even Deputies, find it difficult to get information from Bord na gCon. Some time ago when a colleague of mine, Deputy Ivan Yates, asked the Minister in this House for some pertinent information about the greyhound industry the Minister referred him to Bord na gCon, who replied voluminously but without giving the required information.</P>
    <P>In addition, there seem to be serious difficulties of communication internally in Bord na gCon, and that is putting it mildly.  For example, if my information <Col N="1207" /> is correct, last July the members of the board of Bord na gCon felt so strongly that they passed a motion of no confidence in the chief executive of that body.  Apparently there has been no response, neither has there been a meeting of the board since then.  There is nothing in this Bill about the structure of Bord na gCon.  I am not even sure if the Minister intends to include provisions about the structure of Bord na gCon in the next Bill that is supposed to be introduced. The Minister is making proposals which he pretends will help make some progress in this industry.  However, far from alleviating the problems in the industry the Minister's proposals will further exacerbate them.  I am talking about difficulties that seem to exist in terms of communication within one of the main agencies of the industry and between that agency and other people involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to delete from the legislation the explicit provision for the participation of the Irish Coursing Club in Bord na gCon and that seems to be unjustified.  I have looked in the Bill and the explanatory memorandum and I listened to what the Minister had to say but nothing indicates that this is a measure that will achieve a constructive result.  The current problems in Bord na gCon do not arise from participation of the Irish Coursing Club in that body.  If the problems are to be addressed they will have to be addressed on their own merits, not by coming sideways at the problem by this measure which the Minister has not explained, defended or justified in any way.</P>
    <P>In the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the Oireachtas went to the trouble of drawing up a constitution for the Irish Coursing Club, which is included as a schedule to that Act.  The Oireachtas felt it was important to legislate for a constitution for a body representing private individuals in the industry.  It was felt at the time &mdash; I have no doubt for very good reason &mdash; that that was appropriate.  The 1958 Act set out specific functions which the Irish Coursing Club would carry out. <Col N="1208" /> It seems entirely proper and logical that explicit provision be made for participation in Bord na gCon of the Irish Coursing Club, with its constitution and functions determined by statute.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister proposes to depart from that arrangement.  He has given no clear explanation in this regard. Perhaps that provision is founded on some proposal the Minister has in mind to make a fundamental change in the status, constitution or functions of the Irish Coursing Club which he wants to hide from us.  Is this change part of what the Minister has in mind for the next Bill, the heads of which are being drafted in his Department?  Is it part of the further plan the Minister will not reveal until he is ready to do so?  If that is what the Minister has in mind the honest, open and constructive thing to do is to abandon this Bill and not come before us with a proposal of that kind until we see the whole context of the measures he is proposing. I do not say that lightly, and I am normally of a very open disposition, but when Ministers come into this House proposing to make changes in bodies of this kind without explaining what is involved, particularly when they tell me that another Bill will be introduced shortly, I become suspicious.  That is a political recipe for the sucker punch, and we will not see the sucker punch until the other Bill has been drafted and the Minister's proposals are outlined.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister would want to do something like that.  There are few indications in his speech as to why this proposal is before us.  He said he believes that the provision governing participation of the Irish Coursing Club in Bord na gCon is &ldquo;too restrictive and means that only three places are available for all other sectors of the industry such as owners, breeders, trainers, private track owners and bookmakers&rdquo;.  The category to which the Minister did not refer is political hacks.  At present the Minister appoints the chairman of the board and three ordinary members.  Not more than three members are members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club which has some status under the Act.  If <Col N="1209" /> this measure is passed the Minister will appoint one chairman and six ordinary members of the board.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that this proposal would give the Minister power to appoint the ordinary members of Bord na gCon &ldquo;without reference to vocational background&rdquo;.  The Minister has not explained why he believes it is appropriate or desirable to appoint members of the board without reference to vocational background.  That does not seem to be what he said in his speech, which is that he recognises the Irish Coursing Club could claim to represent other people but that there is not room to represent all of them on the board. The Minister stated: &ldquo;I believe that the statutory requirement is no longer valid and should be removed&rdquo;, without giving any evidence on which he bases that proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated in his speech:</P>
    <P>Another issue which will require careful consideration is the statutory relationship between Bord na gCon and the ICC.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee recommends that there should be no statutory relationship.  This begs the question of whether it is wiser to allow the ICC to operate as an entirely private body or to retain some control over its activities.</P>
    <P>That statement is of some significance as a pointer to what the Minister will do in the next Bill.  It confirms my suspicion that the Minister has plans to create a statutory relationship between Bord na gCon and the ICC which he is not telling us about.  We can equally read, with some justification, the words &ldquo;statutory relationship between Bord na gCon and the ICC&rdquo; as &ldquo;the position of the ICC&rdquo;. If, as I suspect, the Minister has some plans in mind for the ICC he should tell us, withdraw this Bill and not come back before the House until he has shown us the shape of his proposals.  Anything else will be deception.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me in my contacts with the industry that the Minister gave or caused to be given certain <Col N="1210" /> implicit undertakings to the effect that interests in the industry other than the Irish Coursing Club would be included in Bord na gCon.  The Minister referred to some of these interests &mdash; bookmakers, track owners, etc., those legitimately interested in participating directly in the work of Bord na gCon by having representatives on the board.  However, the Bill contains no guarantees, either explicit or implicit, possible, probable, contemplated or thought about to that effect.  There is nothing about this undertaking in the Bill.  I wonder whether this omission is an indication that the Minister wishes to have enough leeway so that he can renege on any implicit undertakings or commitments which may have been given.</P>
    <P>Taking all those thoughts together, I find that the Minister has not presented a case that is in any way articulate or comprehensible of why he wants to take the measures proposed in section 2.  This House should not be asked to agree such a measure in isolation without being given the full picture.  I cannot see any urgency in doing this, especially as the situation in the industry is as bad as the Minister said.  We should not be expected to agree measures without knowing why we are agreeing them or in what framework we are agreeing them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for ministerial powers to make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds of coursing meetings and for other matters concerning the conduct of meetings.  I have to say &mdash; this is not a criticism of the Bill &mdash; that for once I can agree the provisions for the making of regulations in a Bill before this House.  The matters which require to be regulated under this Bill should properly be regulated in this way, and the Minister should not be required to come before us to get the active assent of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the regulations.  I am not going to sing my usual part on this occasion and make my normal case for not accepting the regulations.  This type of regulation is entirely appropriate in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the ICC has already embarked on the practice of <Col N="1211" /> muzzling dogs at, I think, 50 per cent of the coursing meetings which have taken place.  We have heard reports about this practice but it was not until today that we heard anything which would pass as a comprehensive report on the experience in this area to date.  The Minister gave us an indication of the experience to date in this area when he said:</P>
    <P>The latest information available to me covering the period up to 21 November is that out of 1,029 courses involving muzzles, four hares were killed and eight more were injured and were put down.</P>
    <P>The least one could say about this issue is that if the system currently being operated by the Irish Coursing Club is satisfactory and worked reasonably well on a trial basis, being monitored as it is, I do not see any reason to push ahead with this partial and ill-considered Bill merely to enact it.</P>
    <P>The ICC has made it clear that it will continue this practice during the current season, and may do so on a wider scale than that suggested by the Minister.  This does not seem to be a matter which requires immediate legislation.  In fact, it seems that the process of legislation, and the making of regulations in this regard, might well gain in relevance and perception if we were to wait until the end of the current season for the more detailed Bill the Minister spoke about. We could then have a debate in the House on the basis of a full season's experience and make some sensible decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 3 as drafted seems to be deficient in a number of respects, and I will table a number of amendments to it on Committee Stage.  In order to ensure that we do a proper job, we should wait until we see the full picture.  If we wait for that long we will not be running the risk of any reversals on this issue.  Indeed the Minister pointed out the following:</P>
    <P>I believe that the agreement which we have reached with the ICC will <Col N="1212" /> be observed without the necessity of legislative backing.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister going to come before the House early next year with a more comprehensive Bill?  We do not know when this will be and, having regard to the promises made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as to when matters, such as the payment of money to farmers, will be brought before this House, the only thing we can be sure of is that it will take longer than promised. We would do a much better job and be in a much better position to judge what should be done if we knew how this practice worked on the basis of a full season's experience.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Part of the Bill the Minister said:</P>
    <P>These are enabling provisions which will give the Minister power to introduce the required measures without delay if the need arises.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister is proposing to us on 1 December that we should pass this Bill, not having presented much evidence and not having waited for an entire season, he is still saying he will have the power to introduce the required measures without delay &mdash; who would believe that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry nowadays? &mdash; if the need arises.  He is not saying he will bring in the regulations immediately and he is not saying that if the Bill is passed he will adopt these provisions.  Indeed the Minister's demeanour and presentation of this Part of the Bill indicates a fairly relaxed attitude; he does not want to do all this in a hurry.  Why are we being asked to pass this partial Bill without being given the entire picture?  Why did the Minister not bring the full design before the House?  What is so complex about the plans put before the Government, and which are now being translated into the Heads of a Bill, that the Minister feels he has to have this Bill passed urgently while the other measures will take some time?  Until we are given answers to those questions we can only be suspicious of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> It is fair to say that we can expect a general welcome for section 4 which opens the way for Sunday racing.  The Minister dealt with the issue in a way which did not answer the question I have in mind.  Is he saying that he wants to promote greyhound racing on Christmas Day and Good Friday, days he mentioned. If he does, he should make the case for this.  However, if he does not want to promote greyhound racing on those days then section 4 has been very sloppily drafted.  He was a little ambiguous about that in his speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to make some extraordinary statements about two Sunday race meetings that were held this year and the necessity for retrospective approval.  I am not in the business of handing out prizes to Ministers or Ministers of State for Agriculture but the comments the Minister makes in his statement about Sunday race meetings and retrospective approval represents the greatest gobbledegook I have ever heard. If the Minister has something to say he can say it much more clearly than that.  It is extraordinary that the only part of this Bill that deserves to be taken on a stand alone basis, which is the section 4 provision, is the one that is wrapped up in the greatest amount of gobbledegook.</P>

      <P>I am concluding now, Sir. What we should have before us today, if there is a need to have anything before us, is a simple Bill to provide for the licensing of greyhound racing on Sundays. That seems to be the only part of this grand plan that the Minister will not reveal to us.  It is the only part with which we must deal and unless the Minister has some very solid answers to give when he responds to us on this Bill, the rest of it should be treated with the greatest of suspicion unless and until we are shown the remainder of that grand design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay <Col N="1214" /> the House.  The Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill contains two main proposals.  The first proposes changing the method of appointment of members to Bord na gCon and the second is the granting of powers to the Minister to require that muzzles be worn by all greyhounds at coursing meetings.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's long introductory speech it is clear that our greyhound industry is in a very bad state.  I am referring in particular to the greyhound track racing industry.  The large fall off in the numbers of people attending race meetings and the fall off in the revenue are clear indications of an industry in decline. The greyhound industry in general is worth approximately £40 million or £50 million to this economy and it is incumbent on any Minister who holds the portfolio with responsibility for this industry to take positive action to deal with the obvious crisis in the industry.</P>
      <P>Of course, this Bill was not brought forward because of the Minister's concern for the industry, despite the fact that in his introductory speech he refers to a more detailed Bill which he has prepared. It is fair to say that we are here today because of a Private Members' Bill which was introduced by Deputy Gregory at the end of the last session and the commitments which were extracted from the Government during the course of that debate that some action would be taken in regard to the kill in coursing.  The Minister has fulfilled his commitment in that regard but has totally ignored the broader needs of the industry and the crisis with which it is confronted.  The industry certainly has not thrived under the 1958 Act which established Bord na gCon and which introduced heavy handed bureaucracy into the industry. There is need for radical reform to instil into the greyhound track industry the enthusiasm, the commitment and the hard work of the greyhound owners which was so evident in the past but which seems to have been stifled due to the structures that are in place at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should introduce some major measures to deal with that and to free up the market forces within <Col N="1215" /> the greyhound industry to enable it to thrive in a way which it did in the past because of its value to the economy and the huge number of people who derive an income and employment from it.  The industry has got a very bad name because of the revulsion of the public at the events that take place at some coursing meetings arising from the killing of hares and the circumstances which allegedly led to those events.  I would express appreciation to Deputy Gregory for highlighting this issue and forcing this House finally to face up to it.  I hope that the proposal in this Bill, which is a direct response to Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill, will prove to be effective.</P>
    <P>In regard to the third main item in the Bill, to which Deputy Dukes has referred, the idea that the Minister would amend the Bill to enable greyhound racing, I presume coursing and track meetings, to take place on Christmas Day and Good Friday is quite extraordinary. The State does not allow public houses to open on these two days but now a special Bill is being introduced to enable greyhound racing take place.  Obviously, the Government feels some distinction must be made between these two leisure activities.  I see no demand to have greyhound racing on Good Friday or Christmas Day and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position in regard to what he is proposing.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have very serious reservations about the changes in the method of appointment to Bord na gCon proposed in this Bill.  We see them as a retrograde step to old style political patronage where the Minister, by personal selection, appoints all six members and the chairman of Bord na gCon.  I will elaborate on this at a later stage and I hope to move amendments on Committee Stage to give vocational groups the right to nominate members.  One can easily identify the types of vocational groups who should have the right to nominate people to a body such as Bord na gCon.  I hope it will be a reformed Bord na gCon under whatever new legislation <Col N="1216" /> this House accepts following the Minister's second proposal.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Irish Coursing Club should have the right to nominate some of the members of Bord na gCon. The greyhound owners have a legitimate right to have a representative on Bord na gCon, as have the employees of the tracks and of the industry in general and the track management.  In addition, bookmakers and veterinary surgeons should also have representatives.  The Minister should have an official on the board holding a watching brief, namely, a representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that this same Minister proposes vocational group nominations to his new Irish Horse Racing Authority while, at the same time, withdrawing the only vocational representation that exists in the case of the Greyhound Racing Authority.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 3 that muzzles must be worn by all greyhounds at coursing meetings is in direct response to Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill. In that debate I outlined my revulsion at the practice where hares are chased to be killed and I accept that the new requirement of wearing muzzles is aimed at removing this objectionable aspect of coursing.</P>
    <P>I understand that the new plastic muzzle which has been devised has worked reasonably well in all the coursing meetings held so far this year.  The Minister has given more up-to-date statistics than I had available to me.  He states that four hares have been killed and that a small number of others had to be put down subsequently because of injuries received.  I understand that the hares killed during the course were hit by the muzzle.  Obviously, there is a need for ongoing research to determine the right quality, texture and shape of a plastic muzzle that will eliminate this possibility, no matter how rare its occurrence.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 give the Minister power to introduce new regulations as well as muzzles.  These include veterinary supervision of hares which is designed to ensure that rigid controls <Col N="1217" /> apply at all coursing meetings in the future.  I wish to sound a note of caution. While these provisions constitute a major advance on the position obtaining, it must be remembered that this overall matter is still at experimental stage and developments will have to be monitored on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>This Minister may convince us of his interest and commitment to introduce extensive and effective regulations.  But this Bill, as worded, does not place any legal compulsion on him to do so.  Therefore, it is imperative in order to satisfy genuinely held concerns that the provisions of the Bill when enacted require the Minister to do the things set out in section 3 rather than merely allow him to do so if he so desires, as provided in the Bill as published.  In other words, when we reach Committee Stage we will be proposing that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; be substituted by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; on page 3, line 30.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to the principle of vocational representation.  I believe this principle has been generally accepted in legislation introduced in this House in recent years establishing State boards or introducing some amending legislation in regard to existing State boards.  Indeed, the principle has been strongly advocated by the spokespersons of different parties in this House.  Certainly on numerous occasions I can recall spokespersons for the Fine Gael, Labour, for my own party, the Progressive Democrats, and Democratic Left strongly advocating that there should be the right to nominate members to State boards from various vocational groupings.</P>
    <P>I can recall the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs providing for this principle in the Bill which established the current An Bord Pleanála.  When Minister for the Environment he introduce amending legislation which altered the method of appointing the members of that board.  Indeed, the method which the then Minister for the Environment, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, put to the House and was accepted was that various vocational groupings who had an involvement in the <Col N="1218" /> planning sphere would have the right to nominate people to make up the membership of that board, thus changing the position that had obtained heretofore when the Minister made his own personal choice and appointed people on whom he personally decided.</P>
    <P>In more recent times Deputy Mary Harney in introducing the 1992 Bill to establish the Environmental Protection Agency, went to very great pains to ensure there was full representation of vocational groupings on the board of that agency.  I myself, when introducing the Radiological Protection Bill, 1991, amended that Bill in the course of the debate in order to strengthen the representation of outside groups and to reduce the involvement of the Minister in making personal selections with regard to who should be represented on the board of that institute.  Indeed, in more recent times, in the debate on the Animal Remedies Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland, accepted Opposition party amendments tabled along those lines and introduced the right to nominate members of the special advisory committee being established under the provisions of that Bill from various vocational groups, and he has acted on that principle since.</P>
    <P>I understand, from information passed on to me, that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who has just left the House, himself is proposing to do exactly the same thing in relation to the new Irish Horse Racing Authority and that in that case he proposes that the following be nominating bodies: the Turf Club would have the right to nominate three members; the race courses would have the right to nominate two; the horse owners would have the right to nominate one; the horse trainers would have the right to nominate one, horse breeders one, employees in the horse racing industry one and that the bookmakers would have the right to nominate one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the punters.  Why not?  These are people who are involved, have an interest and who can make a contribution?  It has been considered proper and correct to remove as far as possible the stigma of political appointees, or &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  Political patronage of a blatant kind has brought politics in general in this country into disrepute.  The more enlightened approach of recent times of nominating representatives of different vocational groups has been widely acclaimed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am astonished that there is now a reversal to the old system of political patronage, that we have this Minister seeking to revert to the old, discredited practice of Ministers making all the appointments.  Experience has shown that in the case of Ministers who appoint political friends from their own party &mdash; it has often happened &mdash; that such appointees had little knowledge or expertise to bring to the boards to which they were appointed and, that outstanding committed people were ignored.</P>
      <P>From my past experience, both as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the past and as a member of Government, I am only too well aware of the mad scramble that goes on every time a vacancy occurs on the board of Bord na gCon. The people who were appointed in the past would have had to have very strong party affiliations before even being considered for appointment.  That does the industry absolutely no good.  From the sad history of Bord na gCon which the Minister of State outlined in his introductory remarks, obviously they have not had any great success in managing this industry; whereas it is an industry with committed people, whose energy, enthusiasm and commitment has not been harnessed for the betterment of the industry.  Therefore, there is resentment, a kind of holding back, when it is seen that those who have been put in charge of the industry are not those who have the greatest interest in it in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there would be some people who would be genuine, who would do their best and would have a <Col N="1220" /> valuable contribution to make; but the present appointments system have not led to the kind of development we should like to see because of the structure under which Bord na gCon operates.  It would be a very retrograde step indeed to revert to allowing the Minister make all of the appointments.  I would suggest to him that he should give this matter very serious consideration.  He should increase the numbers on the board of Bord na gCon from the six ordinary members in order to ensure there is widespread representation on that board so that the organisations requesting representation who are deemed to be suitable would be examined by the Minister and that he would make provision for them, as has been done in legislation introduced here on numerous occasions in recent years.  It is very audacious of the Minister to seek to do to the greyhound industry that which he would not dare to do in the case of the horse racing industry. Why the distinction?  I suspect it was a feeling that he might just get away with it on this occasion.  But Dáil Éireann must not allow him to get away with this.</P>
    <P>I shall be requesting the Minister to consider tabling amendments himself or to accept amendments tabled by us on Committee Stage in relation to that representation aspect.  It is necessary that the Bill be altered to ensure that these regulations regarding muzzles are put in place, because some other person taking over the Minister's office may not feel as committed to do so.  Therefore, the provisions of this Bill should place that responsibility squarely on the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>One has to accept that we are still at the experimental stage, that this is a matter which must be kept under close scrutiny and be the subject of review.  I would urge the Minister to come forward with the major Bill for the reform of Bord na gCon and the greyhound industry in general within a reasonable period of time.  By then we shall have had the benefit of the experience of this coursing season to ascertain whether the experiment with muzzles achieves the desired <Col N="1221" /> objective of eliminating the kill from coursing.</P>
    <P>I understand that at all of the coursing meetings &mdash; and we are now halfway through the coursing season &mdash; the muzzle has been used at different stages, and the Minister says now it will be extended to 50 per cent of course meetings. For the remainder of the coursing season it would be important that muzzling be a requirement for all meetings, that all dogs coursed between now and the end of the season should have to wear a muzzle.  The industry, knowing the concern of the general public, knowing the concern expressed in this House, should respond to that call from this House, from me, and, I hope, from others today and agree, prior to the provisions of the Bill being enacted, to do that for the remainder of December.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed and comes into operation, as the Minister proposed, on 1 January 1994, then I hope the Minister will act immediately to ensure that it applies to all dogs participating in coursing for the remainder of the 1993-94 coursing season.  This House should be able to review its operation and should have ample evidence before it from the officers of the Minister's Department who will be observing and reporting to him on its success or otherwise.  We have not yet reached a stage where one can say one is satisfied that the kill has been eliminated or that the kill will be eliminated because of these muzzles.  Certainly, it is a major step forward, but the matter must be kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for his references to my Private Members' Bill.  It must be acknowledged that the Bill before the House was precipitated by the coursing issue, but whether it was precipitated by my Bill is a matter of argument.  Two of its three proposals relate to coursing: the muzzling issue and the removal of the obligation to appoint members of the Irish Coursing Club to Bord na gCon.  Yet it was not <Col N="1222" /> until he got to page six of his speech that the Minister first referred to the word &ldquo;coursing&rdquo;.  The whole issue was glossed over right down to the extraordinary final sentence where the Minister said:</P>
      <P>enabling provisions empowering the Minister to make regulations governing the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and veterinary supervision of hares are not controversial and I recommend their adoption to the House.</P>
      <P>I have to disappoint the Minister when he suggests that the cruel treatment of wild animals is not controversial.  Muzzles do not remove the cruelty involved in coursing.  I will deal at length with that issue in my contribution.  To suggest that that whole area is not controversial shows, with respect, that the Minister has his head in the sand.  The whole issue of wildlife and cruelty to animals is a major issue, certainly in Western Europe and around the world, and it is becoming an increasingly important issue in this country also.</P>
      <P>This Bill, despite some positive features and despite the very good intentions of the Minister in presenting it so speedily to this House, is essentially a dishonest and flawed attempt to sanitise, to clean up live hare coursing by the cosmetic innovation of muzzling, which clearly cannot and will not remove the fundamental cruelty involved.  This Bill is a last ditch attempt to save what is now a discredited activity in this country before Western European and world opinion eventually brings us to our senses and forces us to follow the example of most of the civilised world by banning any and all forms of cruelty to animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a capitulation to a small but aggressive minority who insist on clinging on, in any shape or form, to a cruel and immoral activity which involves the terrifying of a timid and gentle animal, the hare &mdash; one of our protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 &mdash; under the guise of sport or rural culture and tradition.  Both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, and the Minister of State in their <Col N="1223" /> speeches on my Private Members' Bill referred to the inextricable link to the greyhound industry in this country.  The truth is that it is none of these things.  To say it is a sport is an insult to sport.  To say it is part of rural culture and tradition debases and is unfair to our fine rural culture and traditions.  To say that cruelty to animals is inextricably linked to the greyhound industry is a falsehood, easily rejected by the huge success of drag coursing, which does not involve live hares, in countries such as Australia, Canada and many other countries around the world.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be over critical of the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, whom, I accept, firmly and honestly believes he is taking a major step forward with this Bill. Equally, I firmly believe that the Minister is mistaken in his view.  On 30 June 1993, at column No. 649 of the Official Report, in response to my Private Members' Bill, the Minister stated that &ldquo;There will be no delay in introducing changes...&rdquo;.  In that regard the Minister has been true to his word.  In my view the Minister has shown considerable resolve and courage in facing down the very aggressive coursing lobby by imposing muzzling on them.</P>
    <P>Only a short time ago the June 1992 edition of <i>The Greyhound News</i> had a banner headline entitled &ldquo;Coursing's future secured &mdash; muzzling ruled out&rdquo; over an exclusive article by John Martin which claimed that the Irish Coursing Club &ldquo;had received Government assurances that the muzzling of dogs had been ruled out&rdquo;.  Little more than a year later at the annual general meeting of the Irish Coursing Club in Portlaoise, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 12 August 1993: &ldquo;media representatives were asked to leave the chamber while they discussed the vexed issue of muzzling&rdquo;.  The report continues: &ldquo;The in camera debate took up the whole afternoon and ended with an acceptance that they would have to bow to change, albeit reluctantly&rdquo;.  Ironically, the report was by the same John Martin.  It had a very apt headline <Col N="1224" /> entitled: &ldquo;Irish Coursing Club put muzzle on media&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the inconsistency of the executive director of the Irish Coursing Club, Mr. Gerry Desmond, on the issue of muzzling.  Mr. Desmond earned himself a quote of the week in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 20 October 1991 with the statement:</P>
    <P>There were, in fact, trials carried out by the Irish Coursing Club a number of years ago and it was found that the hares were being damaged by the muzzles.  We felt that it led to suffering by the hares afterwards.  When hares get injured they find it very difficult to recuperate from any form of injury.</P>
    <P>Exactly two years later, on 12 October 1993, in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> Mr. Desmond has seen the light, and I quote:</P>
    <P>So far muzzling is working out quite satisfactorily.  The dogs are galloping freely and normally.  There are no negative effects yet.  It is an innovation and a change to see dogs muzzled and it has been very well accepted by people. The feedback has been generally quite positive.</P>
    <P>I do not know how anyone can take that man seriously following that display. However, I want to say why muzzling is not the answer.  In this House on 30 June 1993, at column No. 649 of the Official Report it is stated:</P>
    <P>The object of these controls will be to prevent cruelty and eliminate the kill.</P>
    <P>Muzzling certainly results in a huge reduction in kills.  Yet when 160 lbs of muscle comes thundering down at 40 miles per hour on a weak little creature it will inevitably result in kill.  Even the most closely monitored courses in the whole history of coursing, which we have had during the past couple of months, have resulted in four direct kills, as we have been informed by the Minister today, and eight hares so badly injured that they had to be put down.</P>
    <P>Whatever validity arguments about eliminating the kill may or may not have, <Col N="1225" /> to suggest that muzzling prevents cruelty simply does not stand up.  The hare does not know the dogs are muzzled and runs for its life in terror.  Is it cruel to terrorise an animal in this way?  Perhaps the Minister or other Members who speak on this Bill might answer that question.</P>
    <P>Let us take the evidence presented by the general purposes committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  In its report on the high number of kills at Clounanna last February it was claimed that some of the hares were in fact drowned when they ran into a drain at the end of the coursing field, as stated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, in the Official Report of 30 June 1993, volume 433, column 645.  Those unfortunate hares were so terrified that they drowned in their desperate efforts to escape the greyhounds.  There have been instances where the hare simply collapses and dies of fright, as Deputy Brendan McGahon, who is present, has told us in the past.  If the Minister genuinely believes that his new measures prevent cruelty, may I put his case to the test by drawing to his attention the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, section 1 (1) (a)? This provides that if any person &ldquo;shall cruelty infuriate, or terrify any animal, or permit any unnecessary suffering to any animal, such persons shall be guilty of an offence of cruelty within the meaning of this Act, and be imprisoned with hard labour for six months.&rdquo;  However, section 1 (3) (b) provides that &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall apply to the coursing or hunting of any captive animal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me put it to the Minister, as I did on 7 April 1993 in a parliamentary question, that he should amend this Act. In his reply to my question the Minister stated that his comprehensive review of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, will of necessity include the relevant provisions of the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1965.  I again challenge the Minister.  If cruelty has been prevented by muzzling, then he should remove the exemption from coursing and let the courts decide whether muzzled hounds terrify hares during coursing.  The Minister will get six months if he does that.  If, one the other <Col N="1226" /> hand, he refuses to amend the Protection of Animals Act in the way I suggest, it defeats his whole argument that he has taken cruelty out of coursing.</P>
    <P>Of course, the essential cruelty does not begin or end during the actual coursing meeting.  Dr. John Whelan of the environmental study section at the department of agriculture in UCD, has studied the hare and is accepted as an expert in this field.  He points out that the hare is a solitary and most individual of creatures and that the real cruelty is in netting and trapping the hares.  He states that taking them from their natural habitat is a most stressful and deeply cruel experience for this little animal.  Hares are injured during the netting process and when packed into carrying boxes and transported in the boots of cars.  They are then herded in scapes for five to six weeks before coursing and often injure themselves trying vainly to escape through wire fences.  The hares are terrorised during the so-called trials and training procedure.  Will the hounds be muzzled for trials and training sessions?  This Bill refers only to greyhounds participating in events.  I hope the Minister takes note of this and clears this up on Committee Stage.  Furthermore, there is a high mortality rate among hares held in captivity and disease spreads rapidly through the hares herded in what is a most unnatural way for them.</P>
    <P>All of this constitutes an obscene and immoral abuse of little animals.  This whole practice should be banned.  That would be the only acceptable solution to the coursing issue.  I do not think the day is very far off before a more courageous and a more just Government will ban coursing, or be forced to do so.  As long as live hare coursing remains legal, whether the dogs are muzzled or not, and as long as the netting of this otherwise protected species is provided for in law, we will facilitate the most despicable of all the ingredients that make up the coursing scene.  I refer here to the odious practice of blooding, which I also referred to when introducing my Private Members Bill on 22 June 1993, as reported in the Official Report at columns 1605-1606.  Since then <Col N="1227" /> additional cases have been brought before the courts and one very interesting case is before the court on this day.  I will briefly repeat one of the accounts I gave on 22 June, at column 1605 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 11 September 1992 reported the following under the head-line: &ldquo;Two found guilty of blooding a greyhound by using a live hare&rdquo;: </P>
    <P>Two men were convicted in Tipperary yesterday of blooding a greyhound by using a live hare. </P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>Both defendants were employed by Matt O'Donnell at the time.  The ranger claimed Matt O'Donnell abused him when he went to his house about the matter... Judge William Harnett convicted both men.</P>
      <P>As Members may know, Mr. Matt O'Donnell is a leading greyhound trainer, a most respected greyhound trainer in the greyhound world.  Recently a case before the courts was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on Friday, 12 November 1993 and I understand the same case is before the court today.  The headline was &ldquo;Dog trainer charged &mdash; three accused of causing unnecessary suffering&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Top greyhound trainer Matt O'Donnell was one of three people who appeared at Killenaule Court, County Tipperary yesterday, on charges relating to the blooding of greyhounds. O'Donnell of Mountaylor, Killenaule, was charged with permitting unnecessary suffering to be caused to a rabbit at Mountaylor on November 18 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After reading about this type of activity, which apparently is quite commonplace, it is appropriate to refer to two video nasties, one of which featured prominently in recent weeks and is called <Col N="1228" />&ldquo;Child's Play III&rdquo;.  I am sure Members saw references to it in the newspapers recently.  The other is a video which the Irish Council against Blood Sports sent to every Member of this House of an Irish coursing meeting, not a prominent coursing event that one gets snatches of on RTE.  It is video of a local run-of-the-mill coursing event.  I, most reluctantly, watched both videos.  One is restricted to viewers over 18 years &mdash; and Members probably know the one I am talking about &mdash; the other is for general family viewing. I have seen very small children with parents at such coursing events.  In the video &ldquo;Child's Play III&rdquo; good eventually triumphs over evil, but in the other evil in the form of brute savagery triumphs over the weak, vulnerable and the gentle. I challenge any Member of this House, including the Minister, to view both of these videos and tell me which of the two he or she finds the more repulsive and which of the two he or she would rather not look at a second time.  In truth, I have no doubt what the result would be.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I believe it is the duty and obligation of this House to set proper standards of behaviour and decency for the general community.  This Bill does not do that.  In fact, it does the opposite.  It sends out the message that unleashing two large, aggressive, savage and bloodthisty hounds in an enclosed area, surrounded by a bellowing crowd, and pitting them against defenceless hares, of terrorising and terrifying these gentle animals, is inherently acceptable and good.  That is the message from the Government.  I believe that such a message is extremely dangerous.  We must ask why not extend it to pitbull terriers and Dobermans, as they have to be muzzled too.  But against whom or what will they be set?  That is the moral of the Minister's message in this Bill.  When young people are allowed to witness such violence towards animals it is a signal to them that this violence is acceptable, even desirable. A few years ago an American psychiatrist, Doctor Boris Levinson, found a strong connection between children's violence to animals and their subsequent violence to people.  We cannot really <Col N="1229" /> blame it all on videos and television. According to psychologist, Miss Geraldine McLoughlin, it is all about power and control.  Whether they are torturing animals or other children a common factor is a complete lack of empathy with the victim.  If we as a society were to promote care and affection for animals and an abhorrence for any form of cruelty we would all be the better for it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who read the supplement to <i>The Irish Time</i> of 27 November, 1993 and the report on the Jamie Bolger murder trial will see a frightening context.  A reference to Robert Thompson, one of the ten-year-old boys involved, was as follows:</P>
    <P>He twisted the heads off live pigeons, didn't he?  The baby was just an extension of that, they treated him like an animal.</P>
    <P>Only this week six young men from Kirkby, the area of Liverpool where the Bolger family lives, who were on a youth training scheme in the south were brought to trial for kicking a wild rabbit to death.  What is the difference between kicking a wild rabbit to death and throwing a live wild rabbit to greyhounds?  I suggest there is none.  I have to mention again what I witnessed at a coursing meeting in Ballymore which was documented in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 November, 1991:</P>
    <P>During the first half of the event a hare turned towards us and tried to escape between the cars, but two young boys, no more than 14-years old shouted and shooed the poor desperate hare back into the jaws of the dogs. Both dogs caught the hare simultaneously and tugged wildly at the screaming victim,...</P>
    <P>In that context, making a virtue on economic, sporting or traditional grounds of inflicting terror on a defenceless animal is essentially wrong and dangerous, no matter what cosmetic changes are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Muzzling is only a tiny <Col N="1230" /> step away from what I witnessed at Ballymore. The terror of the little animal remains.  Are we to make a sport and indeed a virtue of terror?  This Bill legislates to provide terror.  I have listed my fundamental reservations and that is the context in which I deplore this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is grossly inadequate.  It is essential that there be independent supervision of the release of the hares after the coursing meeting.  It is essential that the hares be released into the wild and not onto some coursing club preserve to be re-netted some time later and that this distinction is made clear in the Bill. It is essential that the hares be marked or tattooed to prevent them being recoursed and that this be independently witnessed.  The only accountable independent witness would be an officer of the Wildlife Service or an official of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  There is no reference to any of this supervision in the Bill, despite the Minister's commitment on 20 June, 1993 as recorded at column 649 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The statement of Deputy Noel Dempsey on 2 September this year that the release of the hares after all coursing meetings will be carried out under the supervision of control stewards of the Irish Coursing Club is a bad joke in very poor taste.  To then infer as Deputy Dempsey did that there would be spot checks by wildlife officers is an insult to our intelligence.  In reply to Question 116 on 17 December, 1991 it was revealed that out of approximately 80 coursing meetings held, only nine were attended by wildlife rangers, all of whom are well known and readily identifiable.  Spot checks are ineffective.  A member of the Northern Ireland Assembly after they voted overwhelmingly to ban live hare coursing in the North was reported in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> of 11 October, 1984 as saying:</P>
      <P>To leave the control of this so-called sport in the hands of those who have been inflicting such senseless cruelty over the years is like leaving Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> Incidentally the British Government at the time refused to ratify that ban.</P>
    <P>Another matter not even mentioned in the Bill is the length of time and the conditions in which hares are held in captivity prior to coursing meetings.  The fee-paying public and the media must be given unrestricted access to all coursing meetings and should be permitted to witness the release of hares if they so desire. As coursing enthusiasts here will know, a coursing card often contains the phrase &ldquo;no photography permitted without special permission&rdquo;.  All that needs to be eliminated if there is to be any real step forward, although I doubt if that will be possible in the context of this Bill.  The type of Mafia operation which controls many local coursing meetings should be rooted out.</P>
    <P>It has been reported in papers recently that observers from the Irish Council Against Blood Sports have been beaten up and ejected from coursing meetings for committing the sin of observing.  I hope some of the enthusiasts of coursing, one or two of whom are here, will enlighten us on how they feel about that type of thuggery at coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>The requirement that all greyhound owners be members of a coursing club must be removed.  That was mentioned in the debate on my Private Members' Bill but it seems to have been forgotten. I can guess why.  I hope the issue is resurrected because I have received letters from greyhound owners who do not want to be members of coursing clubs as their one interest is in their dogs and in racing.  They do not want to be associated with the cruelty of using live animals whether dogs are muzzled or not.</P>
    <P>All these matters are straightforward and should be dealt with in the Bill and I hope the Minister will see to this before Committee Stage.  I generally welcome section 2 of the Bill, although it is open to abuse.  Provided the section is used to prevent any one interest from controlling the board it is acceptable.  A recent study showed that all the members of Bord na gCon and its chief executive had a long involvement with coursing.  It was the one <Col N="1232" /> common factor among all members.  A copy of that report was submitted to the Oireachtas in the past and it is there with all the details.  I trust section 2 of the Bill will remove from Bord na gCon the undemocratic dominance of people with a vested interest in coursing.  I hope that is the motivation and that it is used by the Minister for that purpose.  Nevertheless, I accept the reservations of other Members in that anything which allows a Minister to appoint all members to any such body is, unfortunately, open to grave abuse.</P>

      <P>I support this Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  The greyhound industry has great potential for growth and employment.  However, of late it has faced challenges which must be tackled.  That is the ultimate aim of the Bill.  The greyhound industry has not had a fair hearing recently with undue criticism coming from certain quarters concerning coursing.  Fortunately, those who breed, rear and train greyhounds are committed to the long-term future of the industry.  Trainers, along with Bord na gCon, are taking steps to increase the number of people attending greyhound meetings.  Anyone who has attended such meetings will testify that they are good entertainment and excellent value for money, particularly when one considers how much one might pay for other forms of entertainment such as concerts or going to a pub for a few drinks.</P>
      <P>The greyhound industry is a great Irish tradition, but a tradition with a future and one which needs to be developed.  It must evolve to suit changing times if it is to meet its full potential.  For that reason I welcome this Bill.  It will usher in a new phase in the history of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hare coursing arouses extremes of emotion both for and against it.  I support our coursing industry, not merely for economic and employment reasons but for broader social ones.  Rural Ireland is <Col N="1233" /> subject to a variety of pressures at present.  Emigration and unemployment have taken their toll and there is a real need to maintain the cohesion of rural communities.  One way that vital cohesion can be achieved is by maintaining rural traditions and the values which bind our communities.  Hare coursing is one of those traditions and it is important that we recognise its inherent social value.  Much of the debate on hare coursing ignores that factor.</P>
    <P>As I stated already, coursing has important economic benefits.  Greyhound exports are a multi-million pound industry and our greyhounds are in great demand in Great Britain.  It is significant also that in recent times breeders in the United States and Australia have been importing greyhounds with coursing bloodlines to rejuvenate the bloodlines of their own animals.  Coursing bloodlines were present in the pedigree of 77 per cent of winners of major track events in England and Ireland during the past ten years.  Irish greyhounds are top quality, much sought after by foreign importers, and enjoy a status to which other branches of Irish industry should aspire.</P>
    <P>Coursing makes a major contribution to the commercial life of rural Ireland. A study of the economic significance of coursing was carried out in 1990-91 by the department of agricultural economics in UCD and revealed that the value of coursing to the economy is in excess of £14 million per annum.  That is a massive figure and it can be increased.  As a whole, the greyhound industry is estimated to be worth £40 million per annum to the economy.</P>
    <P>Employment generation is the central task of this Government and now is as good a time as any to refer to the employment provided by the greyhound industry, which includes greyhound trainers, their assistants, veterinary surgeons and their assistants.  The Minister stated that they number in excess of 10,000.  Spinoff employment is provided in manufacturing specialised dog food, medications, tonics, collars, car trailers and so on.</P>
    <P>In 1958 the Irish Coursing Club was <Col N="1234" /> reconstituted under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  That Act states that the Irish Coursing Club should be the controlling authority in matters relating to the breeding of thoroughbred greyhounds and greyhound coursing here and should have such functions in relation to greyhound racing and the training of greyhounds for reward as may be in accordance with law.  It states also that the objects of the club shall be the promotion of the breeding of thoroughbred greyhounds.  All supervisory officials, such as judges, slippers and control stewards are licensed by the club.</P>
    <P>Since 1927 the regulation and control of greyhound racing in Northern Ireland has been the responsibility of the Irish Coursing Club.  That club issues licences to all racing officials on affiliated tracks in Northern Ireland and to those who train greyhounds for reward, subject to conditions.  It appoints control stewards who report directly to the Irish Coursing Club on every greyhound race meeting conducted on the three tracks in Northern Ireland affiliated to the club.  The Irish Coursing Club is a member of the World Greyhound Racing Federation because of its responsibility for greyhound racing in Northern Ireland.  A special Northern Ireland sub-committee has been appointed by the Irish Coursing Club and that sub-committee has been consulted by Northern Ireland Government departments on many occasions on aspects of greyhound sport.</P>
    <P>The use of drugs has always been prohibited in track and coursing events in Ireland.  In 1988 the rule on the prohibition of the use of drugs in coursing was amended and strengthened, reflecting the determination of the executive committee to enhance the image of the sport and the Irish greyhound in that regard.  The executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club comprises members elected by the four provincial committees whose members are elected from the representatives of the various clubs and track executives.  Every person involved in greyhound racing and coursing has a voice in the election of his or her representative member through club membership. <Col N="1235" /> The process is clearly enunciated in the Greyhound Industry Act and is adhered to rigidly.  It is structured so that as many as one-third of the membership of the executive committee may be changed each year and the entire membership of the executive committee can be changed within three years, should the various representatives of the clubs and greyhound tracks so decide.  The executive committee also appoints sub-committees to deal with specific matters in accordance with the Greyhound Industry Act.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of that Act, three members of the executive committee are nominated by the Minister as members of Bord na gCon.  They are appointed as individuals and have no responsibility to the Irish Coursing Club for duties carried out in connection with Bord na gCon. The positive and impartial contribution by such appointees to the greyhound industry down the years is widely acknowledged.  Through the system of election to the executive committee, members of the executive committee are the only truly democractically elected representatives of all greyhound owners and breeders.  The appointment of executive committee members to the board of Bord na gCon guarantees greyhound industry expertise on the board as well as nonpartisan representation of owners and breeders at that level.</P>
    <P>It is in the best interests of the industry that such representation continue.  As in the case of the proposed new horse racing authority, the Minister will appoint the members of the authority as follows: three members from the regulatory body, two representing race courses, one each representing trainers, breeders, owners, bookmakers and employees and three others at his discretion.  At least one will be representative of the industry in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry has a very positive commercial effect.  It benefits not only those immediately connected with the industry, but also a wider circle of individuals.  Hotels, guesthouses, bars and restaurants benefit from the influx of <Col N="1236" /> people to an area where a greyhound meeting is taking place.  At present we are only scratching the surface of the employment potential of that sector; much more can be achieved.  We need to market greyhound-related activities to boost its undoubted potential.  The industry has had to cope with a great deal of negative publicity, much of it inaccurate. I hope the provisions of this Bill will put an end to such publicity and allow for a more reasoned and rational appraisal of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Like any other industry, the greyhound sector must adjust if it is to continue to prosper.  This Bill recognises that basic fact and I commend the Minister for introducing it.  It is timely legislation.  I welcome in particular the proposal to amend section 36 of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the section which proposes to muzzle greyhounds while also introducing the veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after coursing meetings.  While the protestations of the anti-coursing lobby have been much exaggerated, those measures more than adequately address the concerns. It is the wish of everybody with an interest in the greyhound industry that the killing of hares is kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>At a recent coursing meeting in Kerry where the dogs were muzzled only two hares were killed.  I welcome the Minister's statement that out of a total of 1,029 coursing meetings held up to 21 November this year where dogs were muzzled, only four hares were killed and eight were injured and put down.  I hope these new regulations will be strictly adhered to.  The Bill provides for penalties in the event of a breach of the regulations.  These should be applied without hesitation.</P>
    <P>Despite these measures there are still those who are vehement in their opposition to coursing.  It is regrettable that these individuals have failed to acknowledge the moves the Minister has made to protect the hare.  Their criticism is no longer valid.  As a result of this Bill coursing will be no more cruel than shooting <Col N="1237" /> or angling.  Will anti-coursing protesters now target their opposition at anglers, like Jack Charlton, on the grounds that it constitutes cruelty against fish?  I think not.  They should give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>The Bill highlights the fact that the greyhound industry is now at an important turning point.  It has faced difficulties in recent times but there are opportunities for the taking also.  The 1958 Greyhound Industry Act is no longer adequate in allowing the industry to fulfil its potential.  This Bill paves the way for growth and development.  I hope it marks the beginning of a series of positive measures on the part of the Government. It is well intended and balanced legislation and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time with me and allowing me to make a contribution on this important legislation.  I am happy to commend it to the House as it is both apt and timely.  The Minister of State should be congratulated on introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members may be aware, I have a keen interest in the greyhound industry, which has terrific economic and employment potential.  This Bill goes some of the way towards tapping its potential and I hope it is the first of many such measures.  In many ways this Bill has been introduced in response to Deputy Gregory's Wildlife Bill.  While I do not doubt his sincerity, that Bill betrayed a profound lack of knowledge about the realities and traditions of rural life.  Tolerance is a virtue.  However, Deputy Gregory revealed a high level of ignorance about rural life.  In this regard we would like him to visit Munster during the next few weeks when many of our coursing meetings will be held and I am sure he would learn much.  What was most distressing was the dismissal of the right of rural communities to maintain their traditions and sports and to make a living in this way.  This was not only intolerant but undemocratic.  I am relieved that it did not succeed.  The Bill <Col N="1238" /> before the House is a much more balanced and a well considered creation.</P>
    <P>The anti-coursing brigade has displayed intolerance, and despite the measures contained in this Bill I have no doubt that it will continue its dogmatic opposition to coursing.  Ultimately, they are zealots, and history has taught us that zealots are not rational people.  It is impossible to negotiate with them and in the case of this Bill they will not give credit where credit is due.  However, the vast majority of people will be more than satisfied with this Bill as it allays any fears and concerns they may have about coursing, even though these were unfounded and based on anti-coursing propaganda.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy McGahon is present in the House as he is a great believer in traditional rural field sports.</P>

      <P>I have never been found wanting.  There has been much talk about the potential of the greyhound industry.  Now is the time to allow it to fulfil that potential.  What we need is a coherent national plan to be implemented over a period of years to modernise and develop this industry. This should provide for the modernisation of tracks around the country and a marketing drive to develop greyhound related activities as a leisure industry and as events to be enjoyed in the same way that people enjoy a night out in the pub or the cinema.  The industry has a bright future.  In this regard the Bill represents a vote of confidence and as such I am glad to commend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a number of other points.  I understand that the members of the new board may not include members of the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, which has been to the forefront of this industry for many years.  When Bord na gCon was set up in 1958 under the Act of the Oireachtas the Irish Coursing Club was the body with expertise at the time. Much has happened since then and every effort is now being made to modernise <Col N="1239" /> the industry.  The Irish Coursing Club has always been responsible for the registration of greyhounds and the stud book. I understand that it will continue to fulfil this important role, which it has carried out with efficiency, dedication and sincerity.  By and large, no mistakes have been made.  Despite this, it has been much maligned.  However, I support it in every way possible.  We should never forget that it has played a major role in the greyhound industry.  It was founded in 1916 and has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>If one wants to discover just how popular the greyhound industry is one should look at the sponsorship figures.  I should say in this regard that the anti-coursing lobby has been active to discredit sponsors in the industry and those who are prepared to make funding available.  This is absurd.  No one should adopt the tactics that they have adopted.  The attendance figures for track meetings are substantial. I understand that in 1990 approximately 704,000 attended track meetings.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems that the board has faced during the years has been a lack of funding.  Substantial funding will be needed if the new board is to be successful in putting the greyhound industry on a proper footing.  In this regard we may need to introduce a leavy. Recently, the new racing board was set up.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for making the much needed changes and also the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for putting these proposals to the House.  I understand that the racing industry is to receive a share of the funds raised by way of off-course betting.  I suggest that something similar should be put in place for the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>I support everything that the Irish Coursing Club stands for.  It has made no mistakes and is a credible organisation. It has never interfered, maliciously or otherwise, with anyone outside the business. It is therefore heartbreaking that the anti-coursing lobby has adopted such a negative attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of <Col N="1240" /> State for introducing the Bill.  It gives us an opportunity to debate a number of issues in relation to the greyhound industry. This is a positive first step in the revision of legislation dealing with the industry.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers have mentioned, the greyhound industry is now worth about £40 million to the economy.  It provides about 10,000 jobs in rural Ireland which is a figure to be reckoned with. Trainers, veterinary surgeons, suppliers of equipment such as leads, muzzles, dog food etc. depend for their livelihood on the greyhound industry and if it were disrupted in any way these people's livelihood would be endangered.</P>
      <P>The coursing industry makes a major contribution to the greyhound industry. It is worth £16 million of the £40 million already mentioned.  The greyhound industry is confined mostly to rural Ireland not alone in the south but in the North.  People who oppose coursing fail to recognise that it is a 32-county sport which brings together all sections of the community of all religions and from all strata of society.  It is a sport that, more than any other, transcends all boundaries.</P>
      <P>Coursing is an integral part of the greyhound industry and should be recognised as such.  Buyers of dogs from abroad look for dogs with coursing bloodlines because they are the strongest and have more stamina.  They are the most sought after. That is why, within the framework of the greyhound industry, the coursing bloodlines must be preserved and that can only be done if coursing is retained and allowed to develop further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the reconstituted Bord na gCon.  I was amazed at the two previous speakers, Deputies Denis Foley and Ned O'Keeffe.  I recognise they are both committed coursing supporters. They praised the work of the Irish Coursing Club and so on but forgot to mention that the ICC is concerned about this Bill.  They quoted extensively from the briefs supplied to all of us by the ICC which were quite useful and saved much of the time it would have taken to carry out research.  Neither Deputy went to the <Col N="1241" /> core point of this Bill, that is, that if the Minister's proposals got through the ICC will no longer have a say in running the greyhound industry here.  It is true the Minister can appoint people from the ICC to that body.  However, because the membership is so small, it will be very difficult for the Minister to look after the interests of bookmakers, owners etc. and still make provision for ICC members. The ICC has played an important and historical role in the development of the greyhound industry and they should therefore have a right to nominate perhaps not three but two members to the board.  This would lessen the monopoly that Deputy Gregory referred to but it is important that they be included as members of the board.</P>
    <P>I find it objectionable that the Minister has decided to amend section 9 of the Principal Act by removing the automatic right of membership of Bord an gCon of three members of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  We should compare this to membership of the proposed horse racing authority a draft of which I have in my possession. The regulatory body, the Turf Club in this instance, will be entitled to three members on the authority set up by the Minister.  Why treat the ICC differently in the context of the reconstituted Bord na gCon?</P>
    <P>The system of election to the executive committee of the ICC ensures that those elected are totally representative of all greyhound owners and breeders in the 32 counties and are possessed of immense knowledge and expertise in the greyhound industry.  Nobody in this House would dispute that.  Why have a different approach to the reconstituted Bord na gCon as opposed to the proposed horse racing authority?  Perhaps the Minister is giving in to pressure from the anti-coursing lobby and wants to marginalise the ICC.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously reconsider this section and, before we leave here tomorrow, put down an amendment that restores the right to the ICC to have at least two members on the proposed reconstituted board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> It would be no harm to state the importance of the ICC in the context of the world greyhound industry.  I wish to cite information which was supplied to me by the ICC for which I thank them most sincerely.  The Irish Coursing Club is a member of the World Greyhound Racing Federation which is recognised as a controlling authority by all the greyhound control agencies throughout the world.  The chief executive of the Irish Coursing Club is currently General Secretary of the World Greyhound Racing Federation.  The Irish Coursing Club is a member of the International Stud Book Alliance and other members are the National Coursing Club of England, Australian and New Zealand Greyhound Associations and the National Greyhound Association which covers the USA.  That involvement of the ICC on the international pitch is very important to further promote the export of greyhounds from Ireland and ensure that the revenue we derive from such exports is maintained and improved upon.</P>
    <P>The club's status as a controlling authority within the industry would be undermined and its position marginalised if it were excluded under this Bill. Furthermore, the ICC contends that any Act dealing with the greyhound industry and excluding the ICC would be merely a greyhound racing industry Act rather than an all-embracing greyhound industry Act.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with their fears and reservations about this section.  Under the terms of the present Greyhound Industry Act three members of the executive committee are nominated by the Minister as members of Bord na gCon.  They are appointed as individuals and have no responsibility to the ICC for any duties carried out in connection with Bord na gCon.  This has been pointed out already by Deputy Foley.  The positive and impartial contribution by such appointees is widely acknowledged and could not be questioned.  It should be noted that through the system of election to the executive committee, members of the executive committee are the only truly democratically elected representatives <Col N="1243" /> of all greyhound owners and breeders.  The appointment of executive committee members to the board of Bord na gCon guarantees greyhound industry expertise on the boards as well as nonpartisan representation of owners and breeders at all levels.  It is also widely acknowledged that the Irish Coursing Club is an integral part of the coursing industry and it would appear totally illogical to deny its representatives the right to membership of Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why the Minister excluded them.  The importance of the ICC to the development of the greyhound industry, the fact that they control all the greyhound industry in Northern Ireland, should surely be a factor to be reckoned with when we are trying to hold out the hand of friendship to the people in Northern Ireland at this time.  We must recognise that historically they are the people who got the greyhound industry off the ground in Ireland.  They have every right to be annoyed in regard to this provision. Before the Bill is put to a vote tomorrow I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this section.  I ask him to consider reducing the monopoly of the ICC on the board to allow just two of its members, selected by the Minister to join the Board.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provisions in section 3, which are similar to those put forward by Fine Gael in a Bill which I drafted last summer at the time we discussed Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill.  Section 3 provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds participating in events, and the manner and type of muzzle to be used.  That is welcome.  The section also provides for the supervision by a veterinary surgeon of hares coursed in events prior to, during and after the events and that is a provision which we sought.  The section prohibits the coursing of a hare in an event if it is not fit to be coursed and it includes other provisions to which I will not refer now.  I agree with those provisions and they are similar to those suggested by the Fine Gael Party during the debate on Deputy <Col N="1244" /> Gregory's Private Members' Bill last June.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be an avid coursing supporter but there are times when I would attend a coursing meeting.  For example, at Christmas, people return from England, America and other parts of the world to attend the Abbeyfeale coursing meeting.  I attend the meeting the odd time to meet old friends and to make new friends.  The Minister should attend the meeting to witness the spirit and sense of occasion.  If Deputy Gregory realised the importance of that type of event at Christmas he would review his total opposition to hare coursing.  I would like to refer to some of his statements on hare coursing.  I notice he referred to old quotations.  I do not justify the ill treatment of a hare or any animals. Deputy Gregory should consider this matter in context.  Some of the examples he raised today and in the past are disgusting. I hope the Deputy reads an article on coursing on pages 18 and 19 of today's <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>I would be the first to acknowledge that certain coursing meetings have been poorly run and scant respect has been shown for the hare in the past.  That is why the hare coursing industry is under scrutiny at present and probably why the Minister has responded by introducing this legislation.  In many cases the blame lies with the hare coursing clubs.  The message from the debate on Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill in June was clearly that the coursing fraternity must get its house in order if the sport is to survive.  Since that debate the ICC has responded positively.  It has issued all clubs with medication for coccidiosis and worms.  It has insisted that veterinary inspection of hares take place prior to and during each coursing meeting.  It has appointed an expert to visit each club and advise it on hare husbandry, conditions of the escapes and so on.  It has also experimented with different types of muzzles, starting with a leather muzzle which was found to be unsuitable because of breathing difficulties experienced by the greyhounds.  It has now introduced a plastic muzzle which has proved effective. <Col N="1245" /> Now that this Bill has been introduced and the ICC committed to ensuring that the sport continues, it will experiment further.  I am confident that the ICC will provide an ideal muzzle after a period of time.  Muzzling has proved to be effective.  The Minister gave us an answer in that regard today.  At 129 course meetings involving muzzles four hares were killed and eight were injured and put down.  That is a miniscule fraction of 1 per cent of the hares killed on Irish roads and elsewhere during that period. Deputy Greogry and the other people who are so concerned about hares should consider that statistic.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the dogs are muzzled and the hare is given fair play no pair of dogs will be a match for a good hare.  I did not get an opportunity during the last debate on this matter to expand on this because I shared my time with colleagues, some of whom were for and others against Deputy Gregory's Bill.  As a person from the country I know a fair bit about hares because I have observed them from my youth.  Nature has equipped the hare with a number of vital attributes. The hare's heart is five time larger in proportion to its body weight than that of a rabbit.  As a result it has a corresponding increased blood supply which gives it tremendous stamina.  It has a powerful pair of back legs which give instant acceleration to get it out of danger.  Its most outstanding attribute is its ability to turn at right angles without losing pace.  It can stop and reverse direction almost as quickly, which gives it a great advantage over a dog.  The dog has only one asset, speed.  It has very little stamina and cannot turn well in tight circles.  All things being equal, the hare will win 99 times out of 100.  However, all things are never equal.  The dog is a well fed and efficiently trained running machine but more often than not the hare does not get the same preparation.</P>
    <P>Regarding hares being collected for a meeting, I understand one-third of those hares are not fit to course, being too young, too old, too thin or diseased.  I am convinced that a professional input as proposed by the Bill and by Fine Gael <Col N="1246" /> would be beneficial.  Clubs' hares stocks should be subjected to an individual veterinary inspection before the draw for the meeting takes place.  This would allow stakes to be cancelled if there were not sufficient hares stocks.</P>
    <P>All hares deemed fit for courses should carry an identity tag to enable the organising committee to monitor further the hare's progress as the meeting continues. All hares should be dosed for coccidiosis on entry to the paddock, followed by a second compulsory dose about two weeks before the meeting.  That could be made to coincide with the veterinary inspection and tagging.</P>
    <P>The most crucial point in hare management is feeding.  A high proportion of post mortem's show that hares suffer extensively from malnurtition.  Many clubs use only grain oats in trays which is unsatisfactory.  It is alien for a wild animal to learn to eat out of a tray or a pan in a few weeks.  Many of them would go hungry rather than eat from such a container. There is no substitute for good sheaf oats.  Three hares could thrash the grain from two sheaves every night. Therefore, hares and husbandry is very important.  Adequate drinking water should be provided at a number of points together with a coccidiostat.  It should be changed every day as the hares contaminate it by washing in it.  The size of the paddock where the hares are kept in captivity is important.  It should be regulated &mdash; at present it is not.  It should be well drained and dry and provided with numerous shelters and feeding points.  Consideration should be given to a longer slip.</P>
    <P>If Deputy McGahon or Deputy Gregory wish to find out about hare coursing they should read the article on pages 18 and 19 of the <i>Irish Press</i> by Zarina Geloo, a visiting journalist from Zambia, who said, &ldquo;I saw no savage exaltation on the faces of the crowd&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Bill is, I hope, the start of the revitalisation of the industry which is of critical importance to the livelihood of many people in all parts of Ireland.  I <Col N="1247" /> welcome the fact that the debate is taking place in a much calmer atmosphere than that which prevailed during the recent debate in Private Members' Time on coursing.  Deputies on all sides should realise that coursing is an integral part of the industry and must be not only protected but developed.  The Minister of State deserves great credit for handling this matter in an even-handed and objective way.  This represents the most progressive change initiated and implemented by the Irish Coursing Club and will ensure that coursing will take place as long as greyhounds are bred, despite the best efforts of a very small, misguided group who are prepared to stop at nothing, even the destruction of our tourist business, to achieve their aim to have coursing banned.</P>
      <P>The media has been somewhat one-sided in its coverage of hare coursing. However, I would like to put on record some statements from the objectives and balanced article referred to by Deputy Deenihan which appeared in today's <i>Irish Press.</i> The article was written by a visiting Zambian journalist who attended a coursing meeting and she concluded that coursing does not live up to its reputation as a barbarian or uncivilised sport.  She said she had travelled thousands of miles to see what she had been told was the worst possible sign of Irish barbarism. She wanted to see the barbaric people who had hares killed for fun, but to her surprise the picture that emerged was quite different.  She said:</P>
      <P>I saw a watchful vet look out for unfit hares.  Cheers went up for the hare.  I saw no savage exultation on the faces of the crowd when two hares got killed, the only indication I got that something had happened was the silence from the crowd at a time when I expected them to go into a wild frenzy.</P>
      <P>Adjectives like &lsquo;criminal&rsquo;, &lsquo;barbaric&rsquo;, &lsquo;uncivilised&rsquo; etc, were used to describe coursers.  But what I saw were ordinary folk who simply had different interests from most urban dwellers. </P>

      <Col N="1248" /> Earlier in the debate Deputy Gregory described people involved in coursing in local areas as the mafia.  Deputy Gregory owes an apology to the people in parishes of rural Ireland who run coursing meetings. The Deputy will see plenty of examples of the mafia in his own constituency; he certainly will not find them in rural parishes where coursing meetings take place.  Deputy Gregory had to resort to the same rhetoric last June during the debate on coursing.  Unfortunately for the Deputy, time has passed him by and, despite his best efforts and those of other people, coursing is and will continue to be a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory also referred to statements made over the years by a number of members of the Irish Coursing Club in relation to muzzling.  Many years ago trials with muzzling took place, but what the Deputy refused to acknowledge was that these were wire muzzles which caused more damaged to the dogs and hares than the plastic muzzles which are used at present.  Some newspaper coverage of coursing is an absolute disgrace. Some papers grudgingly publish the bare results without any comment.  Others try to find a negative issue of a particular coursing meeting about which to write, without any reference to the actual meeting.</P>
    <P>The introduction of muzzles on a phased basis has been an unqualified success and this will encourage more people to attend meetings who heretofore may not have wished to do so because of the occasional killing of the hare.  I predict that the national meeting in February in Clonmel will have a record attendance.  I would bet any day with Deputy McGahon that the record will be broken because more people are now interested in coursing than ever before.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is the first step towards improving the whole structure and management of the industry, it is imperative that the make up of the new board clearly reflects the expertise of all strands of the industry.  Deputy Dukes earlier complained about the board and said that he and others are unhappy with the present board.  Was he suggesting that that board <Col N="1249" /> remain in office until it comes to the end of its term on 31 December?  An important proposal in the Bill is that the new board will exist for three years rather than five years.  It is proposed that the Irish Coursing Club will lose its right to nominate three people from its executive. As other Members said, when appointments are being made this body cannot be ignored or forgotten as it was that organisation who introduced, organised and controlled greyhound track racing in Ireland, North and South, between 1927 and 1958 when no-one else was interested or in a position to do so. Since 1923 it has published the stud book which is recognised worldwide.  Like other Members, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Since 1958 there have been three members of the Irish Coursing Club on the board of Bord na gCon.  Deputy Deenihan suggested that at least two members of the Irish Coursing Club be appointed to the board, but I will be the honest broker and ask that at least one person be nominated from the Irish Coursing Club.  In doing so, the Minister would have the support of the vast majority of Deputies.  The Minister should reconsider this matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration should be given to the establishment of an advisory body to the board which would embrace all strands of the industry, including the Irish Coursing Club, breeders, owners, coursing people, trainers, track management, bookmakers, punters and anybody else involved directly or indirectly in the industry.  Such a system operates in Britain and its introduction here would be of great benefit to the board in the coming years.  I concur with the views of other Deputies in that at present there is much discontent within the sport.</P>
    <P>The recession has hit greyhound racing in the same way as it has hit other sports. It has been indicated that if adequate funding was allocated to the industry facilities could be improved, thus making it more attractive for people to attend meetings, which would generate extra revenue.  It is necessary to provide funding <Col N="1250" /> for the development of this industry. The amount allocated should not be less than £5 million over a three-year period. This would allow for the necessary improvements to be carried out at tracks to make the facilities more comfortable for the public.  It would require a development plan for all tracks, with priority being given to tracks with the worst facilities. Difficulties will arise in relation to privately owned tracks.  Nevertheless the board must accommodate these tracks, many of which were kept open by owners who had a genuine love of the sport.  I know families who have owned tracks for generations and who have not received a dividend of any kind from that property, some of which is worth a considerable amount.  I have no doubt that if these tracks were owned by other people they would have sold them long ago for housing or commercial developments.</P>
    <P>The new board must address the issue of marketing and seek to promote the sport as an entertainment, encourage more sponsors and create a better image for the sport.  The breeding and selling aspects of the greyhound industry must be developed and expanded to meet demands from new markets which must be explored by the board with great vigour.  If greyhounds are needed for new markets in Denmark, Sweden, Turkey and Russia, together with the lucrative and expanding markets in Great Britain and the United States, we should be able to meet the demand.  The sales aspect of the industry must be developed so as to encourage more buyers from abroad to come to Ireland to purchase all breeds of greyhounds from the average to the top class.  This will required a marketing expertise which has not been applied previously. We should aim to have greyhound sales similar to the horse sales at Tattersalls and Goffs.  We have the necessary raw material for this industry and what we require is a board which will have the necessary drive, incentive and expertise to meet the challenges in this area and develop a thriving industry.</P>
    <P>There is no reason any track should be closed down.  The closure of a track leads to a reduction in the number of breeders <Col N="1251" /> and owners in the surrounding areas. Many breeders and owners will not run their dogs in tracks in other areas as it is costly to travel and it is not always easy to get races for the average dog.  This industry should not be let fall into the same trap as the horse racing industry which believed that a few tracks for the best horses was the way forward.  One has only to compare the Phoenix Park race track with the tracks in Kilbeggan, Bellewstown, Tralee and Listowel to understand what I am saying.  People who go to greyhound racing meetings want proper facilities where they can meet, chat and have a drink, place a bet, run their dogs or support their neighbours' dogs.</P>
    <P>The introduction of Sunday racing should benefit the greyhound industry. However, there must be astute planning to ensure that the industry capitalises fully on the removal of the ban.  There is no point in the industry trying to compete with other established Sunday sports. The timing of meetings will be of critical importance.  In addition, there will have to be co-operation with the horse racing board to avoid clashes in timing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to amend section 3 on Committee Stage to provide that the Bill will apply only to enclosed hare coursing.  The Minister referred to enclosed hare coursing in his speech and I hope the Bill will be amended accordingly. If the greyhound industry is to move forward less emphasis will have to be placed on peripheral problems such as hare coursing, the relationship between the ICC and Bord na gCon, the membership of coursing clubs, the affiliation fees, the registration of litters and adult dogs and the keeping of stud books. These issues are deemed to be problems by people who do not understand the industry and whose only interest is to ban or curtail coursing.  I have been attending dog racing and coursing meetings for years and I meet the same people on the coursing fields as I meet at the tracks. These people do not complain about hare coursing.  They regard it as part and parcel of the industry and do not think it <Col N="1252" /> should be interfered with as it has a proven record which will stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The greyhound fraternity want better conditions for the public, more prize money, better conditions for owners and trainers, better equipped tracks, more incentives to breed greyhounds and a proper sales and marketing strategy.  I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration over the coming months to the points I have made and to ignore the spurious arguments put forward by people who do not care if this industry is let die.  I know the Minister is committed to ensuring that this industry does not die, and I look forward to the introduction of more changes in this area over the coming months which will guarantee the future of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a one time owner of a number of rather slow track greyhounds, I can speak with some &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience on this issue.  I come from County Sligo which, unlike other parts of the country, is not well known as a good greyhound area.  However, Sligo has consistently produced some of the best greyhounds over the last number of years.  The number of owners, breeders and trainers in the county is not very large but they are all very dedicated followers of the sport.  All these people have a great interest in other sports, for example, gaelic football, soccer and golf; they are among the best supporters of sport in the county.  It is only correct to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Not so long ago, say, 30-35 years, every second household in County Sligo owned a greyhound.  I am not talking about the pampered, well fed greyhounds one sees at coursing or track meetings but rather about greyhounds which had to catch their own dinner if they did not want to go without food for the rest of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greyhounds which run a time of 29.50 seconds at a race in Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross, Dundalk or Navan are entirely different.  People used to keep greyhounds for hunting in the fields and bogs near their homes.  One of the great sources of entertainment for young <Col N="1253" /> people at that time was to go out with their neighbours hunting hares over their own territories and their own runs.  Sometimes the hares were caught and other times they escaped, but apart from the fact that a greyhound was accompanied by a terrier, which is better at sniffing out hares, the entire pursuit was as near to the natural order of things as one could get.  I do not know whether this would now be regarded as cruelty, but for those who took part in it, it was simply sport, a contest between the hares and the hounds.  Very often the hares won in their own habitat; but, more important, it was your hound which won against your neigbour's hound.</P>
    <P>I totally accept that closed coursing is very different and I agree that something had to be done about it.  Indeed, action should have been taken in this area before now.  I am glad that the present Minister and the Minister of State have finally addressed those problems to some extent.  The Minister proposes muzzling of the greyhounds at selected coursing and race meetings; and it must be said that the figures the Minister gave us here this evening are impressive, particularly in a trial period.  I welcome also the veterinary supervision of all hares that will be in place before, during and after coursing meetings.  I would like the Minister of State in this reply to assure us that no hares would be used at more than one particular coursing meeting.</P>
    <P>The future of coursing depends on the success or otherwise of the muzzling that is taking place at present.  Under this Bill the Minister is giving himself authority to introduce regulations for muzzling.  He should tell us now that once this Bill becomes law, dogs will have to be muzzled at all meetings.  He should make the declaration at this stage because it is an important issue for the future of coursing.</P>
    <P>This sport has a great tradition and that is why I am interested in it.  It is part of the way of rural life and is also an important industry in its own right.  It is an important source of income to many people.  Not in GATT terms or matters of that nature, but vital to a well targeted area.  The Minister gave figures this <Col N="1254" /> evening, arising from the research by the University of Limerick and Bord na gCon, that of the 8,000 breeders, rearers and trainers, 6,000 were mainly small farmers and their activities generated an estimated farm income of approximately £16 million or an average of £2,600 per farm.  The Minister stated that the industry is worth approximately £40 million. They are impressive figures because extra income is needed in that area.  I would regard the greyhound industry as an ideal type of agri-business.  It provides additional income for the farmer and an interest, in sport, with the chance, of course, of hitting the jackpot and producing a great champion such as Spanish Point, which, incidentally, was owned and bred by a former Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the necessity for a more detailed Bill.  However, he has referred to the complexities of such a Bill and that he cannot introduce it at this time.  But the Minister is aware of the need for this Bill since the Government came into office a year ago.  With all the expertise at his disposal in the Department and the advice of the parliamentary draftsman's office, surely he could have produced a comprehensive Bill at this time.  That would have been a better way to approach this issue.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas which the Minister says he will examine, but the most important aspect of this Bill is the introduction of the muzzling of greyhounds at all coursing meetings and the veterinary supervision of hares before, during and after those meetings. From the figures the Minister has already given us it would seem that his aim is the total elimination of the kill.  From what he has told us about the experiments that are taking place, I believe that is possible and would prove to be a solution to what has been a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister's intention to seek to develop the American business, I believe he is going about that in the proper way.  That would be an appropriate use of Structural Funds.  A different system is in operation there, which includes the use of eight or nine hounds <Col N="1255" /> on the track per race.  It is necessary for the industry here to carry out some work in this area because otherwise we will be unable to develop this very useful market, which is worthy of an allocation of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this Bill rather intrigues me and it is in relation to the provision for the appointment of directors to Bord na gCon.  If the appointments follow the normal pattern in Irish politics, they will be &ldquo;doggy men&rdquo;; and if the Minister subscribes to the gender balance, women will be appointed also.  We wish all of those directors well and certainly the last thing anyone would wish is that they should die, but the Minister is making a provision in this Bill for a director dying in the period between his or her appointment to the board and this Bill coming into effect on 1 January 1994.  In such an event the Minister states that the person who, say, dies on 20 December, will, for the purposes of this Bill, not be deemed dead until 1 January 1994.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a person who before his death met my colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, in his capacity as a bookmaker or, more likely, if these appointments follow the normal political pattern, met the Minister's colleague, Deputy Seán Power, and placed a £1,000 bet on a dog running in a race on Christmas Day. What complications would arise if that person died in the meantime and the dog won the race?  Would the bookmaker be required to pay out the winners because the man was deemed to be alive under the provisions of this Bill?  The Minister should clarify that matter for us.</P>
    <P>There is a more urgent need now for the Minister to bring in a more comprehensive Bill as far as the greyhound industry is concerned.  I am glad the Minister is introducing regulations for the muzzling of greyhounds.  That is an important aspect of the Bill and I wish it well.  I would like to give the remainder of my time to Deputy McGahon.</P>

      <P>My views on the coursing industry are well documented and I am sorry to have to cross swords with my <Col N="1256" /> friend, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, who I know has a great interest in this area. Many Deputies here have been force-fed propaganda by the Irish Coursing Club. It is extraordinary to see how successful that propaganda has been on an issue that is repulsive to so many people and which brings international shame to this country.</P>
      <P>I am not against the greyhound industry. In fact, in an hour from now I will be, I expect, the only Deputy who will be present at Shelbourne Park.  Therefore, I welcome some of the proposals in this Bill, an amendment of the 1958 Act which has not been updated for 35 years.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil do now adjourn&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to reverse the decision taken by the Minister for Finance, without the authority of the Dáil, to change the terms of a tax incentive scheme, agreed after a very hotly contested debate here in this House by a majority vote, to make it much more generous than had been the original intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may explain what is involved.  We are not talking here simply about a tax amnesty.  Normally a tax amnesty is understood to mean that people who did not pay their taxes on time are allowed, at a later date, to pay them in full but without any interest or penalties being added; that is a tax amnesty.  This is not a tax amnesty.  This is what is rather insidiously described as a tax incentive scheme.  Effectively it is an offer whereby people who should have paid income tax at, say 52 per cent, the top rate in 1990 or 1989, or capital gains tax at a rate of 40 per cent, but did not pay it at the time, broke the law and ignored their obligations, will be allowed to pay it now.  Not only will they not be <Col N="1257" /> asked to pay any interest or penalties but they will be allowed to pay it at a rate of 15 per cent.  In other words, more than twice as much as the tax they will actually be paying will be written off.  They will have a large part of the tax struck out in addition to being exempted from penalties or any normal interest requirement.</P>
    <P>This very strange, unprecedented offer to write off the tax of people who did not pay it on time was justified by the Minister for Finance at the time on the grounds that only if one did something like this would one be able to bring in some hot money from overseas.  There were supposed to be vast amounts of money in secret accounts, in Swiss or Channel Island accounts, which people would never bring into this country and the only way one would get anything from these people would be to offer this special low rates of 15 per cent tax on the income they derived from this money, as against the 50 per cent rate of tax they might have paid had they left that money at home.  It was to get this money from abroad that would not otherwise come in that this perversion of the tax system was to be allowed.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with this, my party did not agree with it, and we opposed it quite strongly.  We believe it to be unfair to those who pay their tax in full and on time to see others who did not pay their tax get away with paying only 15 per cent of their income in tax.  Our arguments fell on deaf ears because the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties were so desperate they felt they needed this hot money from abroad to plug a hole in their budget because they were over spending.  They argued that they would only get the money into the country by doing it this way.</P>
    <P>It now transpires that this 15 per cent tax rate, which involves a write-off of the equivalent of approximately 35 per cent of tax, is being offered in respect of money that had already been declared, that the Revenue Commissioners knew all about already but just had not got around to collecting.  In other words, it is being offered in cases where there is <Col N="1258" /> absolutely no need for the incentive to bring the money in because the money was already here and had been identified by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister was willing to allow those people pay at 15 per cent, whereas those who paid their tax on time paid up to 50 per cent.  How could that possibly be fair? The cynics will say fairness does not exist in the tax code, it is a question of getting the money in.  That is not so.  Any law that is not based on some sort of concept of the general good, on some sort of concept of fairness, ultimately will pollute the entire legal system.</P>
    <P>This decision of the Minister for Finance, apparently supported by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, is polluting the Irish tax system in a very serious and undermining way.  It is undermining the integrity of the system in a way that is very serious indeed.  People will say maybe there will be another tax incentive scheme in 1998 and another in the year 2004.  They will put the money aside for three or four years and eventually there will be another Fianna Fáil and Labour Government in office who will again be desperate for money and, in their search for solutions will pull down the 1993 Bertie Ahern model and offer another tax incentive scheme.  They will then get away with paying much less than the proper rate of tax.  That calculation will be made by lots of people who do not avail of this tax incentive scheme.  Lots of people who will earn money next year &mdash; who obviously could not avail of this tax incentive scheme because they will not yet have earned the money &mdash; will be weighing up in their minds whether to pay.  Many of them will decide to wait for another incentive.  In particular I predict they will say that if, when an incentive or amnesty is announced, they put on enough pressure through their Fianna Fáil or Labour TD they will be able to have the scheme extended.  They will not pay their tax on time but will wait for the announcement of another amnesty.</P>
    <P>That sort of thing undermines the integrity of the tax system.  It undermines the whole concept of standards in public <Col N="1259" /> life.  It is quite ironic that, on the same day the Government approved an intrusive Ethics in Government Bill &mdash; under whose provisions everybody will have to declare all sorts of information about what they own &mdash; the same Government introduces a completely unethical change to a tax incentive scheme to extend it to people who broke the law and did not pay their taxes and offer a reward for their malfeasance, even though the Revenue Commissioners had found them out and there was no need to offer them an incentive.  What concept of ethics in Government could that possibly represent?</P>
    <P>I wish to make another point which is relevant to this debate.  I believe that this proposal is unconstitutional in the same way that I believe the President will decide today to refer the Matrimonial Home Bill to the Supreme Court because of a doubt as to its constitutionality.  The reason the President will be referring the Matrimonial Home Bill to the Supreme Court for examination of its constitutionality is that it discriminates in its treatment of two sets of families in exactly the same situation but for the accident of a date.  A family who broke up before a particular date will not be able to avail of the provisions of the Bill while those who broke up after that date will be able to avail of them.  It is on that discrimination, on the simple accident of a date, between people whose circumstances are otherwise exactly the same that I believe the President will decide, on the advice of the Council of State, this evening to refer that Bill to a test of its constitutionality.  There is at least a 50-50 chance that the Bill will be struck down on that ground.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same circumstances apply in the case of this amnesty.  Let us take the case of two taxpayers both of whom have four children, both of whom earned £20,000 in 1988, both of whom had the same mortgage, are exactly the same in every respect, one paid their taxes on time, at the top rate of 52 per cent, while the other did not declare his tax on time but was subsequently found out by the <Col N="1260" /> Revenue of declared himself to the Revenue and agreed to pay the tax over a number of years and has not yet paid it in full.  That second party who is exactly the same in every other material respect, in terms of the actual liability to tax in respect of the year in question, will get away with paying only 15 per cent tax whereas the former party will have paid up to 50 per cent tax.  In other words, two people in precisely the same situation will be charged different rates of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister also that that was the basis upon which the Supreme Court made the famous Murphy judgment.  They found there was discrimination between two couples in exactly the same situation in terms of tax liability.  One couple, who were married, were paying more tax than another who were cohabiting.  The Supreme Court said that was unjust.  The two people are the same, therefore they should pay the same rate of tax.  The same argument that applied in the Murphy case, to declare that that form of tax discrimination between married couples and co-habitees was unconstitutional, can be used to declare this tax incentive unconstitutional on grounds of discrimination between people in equivalent and similar circumstances. One may ask who will challenge it.  That, I respectfully submit, is not the point. The point is that regardless of whether anybody challenges it, every official of the Revenue Commissioners, every civil servant, every Minister in the Government is bound by the supreme law of the country which is the Constitution.  It is not a question of whether you are caught by somebody suing you, you are bound to adhere to the principles of the Constitution. Anybody who lends support &mdash; here I am addressing myself to the officials &mdash; to an unconstitutional proceeding, as is now happening where people are lending support to this <Col N="1261" /> amnesty, is in breach of the Constitution and is culpable.</P>
      <P>I condemn the Minister, the Government, the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the officials in the Department of Finance and the officials in the Revenue Commissioners.  I recall when we assumed office in 1981 people were asking why some officials had not resigned over what had happened previous to that.  The question must be asked why no officials have resigned over this totally immoral and unconstitutional proceeding in introducing a tax incentive which involves radical and gross discrimination against compliant taxpayers in favour of those who did not comply with their obligations.  It is wrong and the fact that the Government may be able to get away with it, because of its majority in this House, makes it no less wrong; it makes it all the more wrong.  It is unfair and it is a disgrace and it will remain a blot on the Minister for Finance's career as long as he remains in politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act provides the basis for the tax amnesty, the primary objectives of which are to obtain the best possible yield from undisclosed tax liabilities for the period up to 5 April 1991, given that such liabilities are difficult to detect; to facilitate the use for the purpose of general economic activity and employment of those funds, related to tax evasion, which have up to now been held dormant, and to give those who failed to meet their tax obligations in the past one last chance to put their tax affairs in order, in advance of more stringent penalties for tax fraud, and the continuing strengthening of Revenue's compliance programmes.</P>
      <P>It was essential to the achievement of these objectives to introduce an incentive for taxpayers to encourage them to bring their tax affairs up-to-date.  However, this incentive is balanced by the introduction of stringent penalties for those who fail to put their tax affairs in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in a few moments. I want to emphasise again that the amnesty is not an option for those who failed to pay their taxes in the past.  It is an obligation to which they must adhere under pain of penalties.  Moreover, the benefits of the amnesty are only available to those who regularise all of their pre-1991 tax affairs and also make a full disclosure, on time, in relation to their present tax liabilities.  The legislation also provides for new penalties which include mandatory prison sentences and fines ranging from 25 per cent to 200 per cent of the tax evaded.</P>
      <P>Taking the full view of both its carrot and stick elements, the tax amnesty is far from being an absolution for past wrongs. It is a pragmatic mechanism for bringing in those who have not met their obligations in the past and exposing them to their full liability for tax from this point on.  This can only be to the benefit of the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that, in the early stages before publication of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, speculation regarding the incentive amnesty was that it would apply only to hot money i.e. undisclosed income which was held overseas.  The Government had considered this point and concluded that it would be impossible to confine the incentive amnesty to funds held offshore, and that, even if this could have been done, it would be illogical to do so.  The owners of those funds who had not paid tax were in the same position as the owners of such funds held in the State who had not paid tax.</P>
      <P>The Government also considered that it would be inappropriate to exclude from the incentive amnesty arrears of tax, some of it very old and much of it based on estimates.  This was tax which, notwithstanding the success of their arrears compliance programme initiative in 1989, Revenue was having considerable difficulty collecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to read all the letters received from all sides of the House putting <Col N="1263" /> ferocious pressure on me, as Minister for Finance, to extend this amnesty.  The list is an interesting one.  The people who have raised this issue are making the point that the arrears are on record with the Collector General for the years covered by the amnesty and are either estimated arrears &mdash; which they are in many cases &mdash; or they are equitable liabilities. In either case they are the poorest quality arrears on the Revenue records.  The arrears which have been collected under the Revenue arrears compliance programme are those which it has proved possible to collect during the period. Revenue have collected much of the arrears during the period and some was paid in the 1988 amnesty.  The people who had been out of business, out of pocket or were not in a position to avail of the 1988 amnesty because they could not afford it, based on estimates, are as much outside the system as some of the hot money we have heard much about in connection with this amnesty.</P>
    <P>What is at issue is compliance.  There will be the same opportunity for these arrears to come onside as the offshore funds.  I find Deputy Bruton's argument totally illogical.  It appears he considers it to be in order for a person in the Cayman Islands or with money in some offshore account to use the incentive amnesty, but for somebody who was so poor and in such difficult circumstances that he could not avail of the scheme in 1988 not to be able to avail of this scheme either.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if you can work that out, perhaps you could explain it to me.</P>
    <P>The Government considered that it would be inappropriate to exclude from the incentive amnesty arrears of tax, some of it very old and much of it based on estimates.  This was tax which, notwithstanding the success of the arrears compliance programme initiative in 1989, Revenue was having difficulty collecting. That is why we deal with it.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum published with the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, indicated that the incentive amnesty covered <Col N="1264" /> income tax, sur-tax, capital gains tax, income levy, health contributions and employment and training levies for the period up to and including 5 April 1991, which had not been paid by individuals. Accordingly, the incentive amnesty applied to unpaid tax on both disclosed and undisclosed income.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition are suggesting that the Government have changed or extended the scope of the amnesty.  I want to make it perfectly clear that the only change has been to extend the deadline for the making of confidential declarations to the chief special collector by three weeks up to midnight on 21 December 1993.</P>

      <P>The scope of the amnesty is set out fully in the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, and there has been absolutely no change in these.</P>
      <P>In case there is any doubt as to what is covered by the amnesty, I will quote from my opening speech on Second Stage at column 405 of the Official Report for 30 June 1993.  I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity, which I would not otherwise have, of answering this in the House.  I said:</P>
      <P>The overall amnesty scheme covers the generality of undischarged tax liabilities in respect of the period up to and including 5 April 1991.  There are certain exceptions designed to protect the yield from ongoing Revenue enforcement activities to the fullest extent possible.  Otherwise, it extends to all arrears of such taxes, comprising both liabilities in respect of previously undisclosed activities and other amounts unpaid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt but that the reference here to the &ldquo;overall amnesty scheme&rdquo; included the 15 per cent incentive amnesty, because of the reference to exceptions which is only relevant to that tier of the amnesty.  It was made clear by me, therefore, from the very beginning <Col N="1265" /> that otherwise the incentive amnesty applied to all arrears of the relevant taxes.  This position was further clarified in my Second Stage speech when I again stated that the incentive amnesty related to &ldquo;outstanding tax, levy and health contribution liabilities on income and capital gains&rdquo;.  Could any statement be more unambiguous?</P>
    <P>This position was elaborated on at the first and second pages of the amnesty leaflet issued by the Revenue Commissioners within a few days of the enactment of Amnesty Bill and which, I understand, was circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  It was taken up by the various tax practitioners and accountants at that time.  Whatever else needed clarification, it certainly was not that point.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these clarifications, some confusion has since persisted on the matter.  A second amnesty leaflet, published by the Revenue Commissioners in mid-October, dealt with many issues that were raised throughout the country and again made it quite clear that areas of tax were within the incentive amnesty.  The point was also clarified in letters to taxpayers and at seminars hosted by the Revenue Commissioners throughout the country over the autumn months up to November.  I find it inexplicable that some Deputies have pointed to a reference in my Second Stage speech to the exclusion of agreed taxes for the incentive amnesty.  The actual legislative provision which I was summarising states that the only agreed sums which are excluded from the incentive amnesty are those</P>
    <P>which, following inquiries made or action taken by an inspector pursuant to section 15 of the Finance Act, 1988, or any other investigation by an inspector, had been agreed before the designated date by an individual and an inspector as being the individual's tax liability.</P>
    <P>In nine lines of my speech I set out in general terms the specific exclusions which are set out in over half a page of detailed legislation.  Surely it is obvious <Col N="1266" /> that any speech by a Minister on legislation can give only a broad outline of the actual legislative provisions.  It is unfortunate that certain Deputies may have misunderstood the extent of exclusion of agreed taxes from the amnesty.  There can be no doubt, however, that the only agreed taxes which are excluded are those which had been agreed following an investigation or inquiry instigated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I would reject as absurd any notion that a Minister's speech should be a purely technical restatement of the detailed legislation.  The Deputies will agree that the legislation is paramount and that in this instance the text of the legislation is absolutely clear.  If there was any doubt about the intent and effect of this particular aspect of the legislation, there was ample opportunity to have this matter fully clarified in the course of the detailed debate on the Bill.  I need hardly remind Opposition Deputies that this short 15 section Bill received the most comprehensive scrutiny by the Select Committee for three days, and in this House, thanks to the ingenuity of Deputy Cox who kept us talking at length on this subject during a discussion on another Bill &mdash; but, of course, he was totally in order.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise that the revised deadline of midnight on Tuesday, 21 December 1993 represents absolutely the last chance to avail of the benefits of the incentive amnesty.  Under no circumstances will this deadline be extended further.  Moreover, the 14 January deadline for the payment of the settlements and for the general amnesty will not be affected.  It is clear that over <Col N="1268" /> the past few weeks interest in the tax amnesty scheme has snowballed.</P>

      <P>Large numbers of people have been looking closely at what is on offer.  Professional bodies have been hard put to deal with the avalanche of inquiries and have had to work up to midnight and on Saturdays and Sundays. This is why the Government has extended the declaration deadline.  I hope that applicants will now seize this great opportunity to put their tax affairs in order and to play it fair with the compliant taxpayers.</P>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of this amnesty is the freeing up of hot money, which has been hidden away at home or abroad in an effort to avoid its detection. The aim is to release these funds so that they can be used for productive purposes in the economy.  The amnesty provides a generous incentive for the owners of such money to come clean, become complying taxpayers and put their hidden funds to better use for their own benefit and the benefit of the economy.  They would be ill-advised to ignore it.</P>
      <P>The tax amnesty covers, and has always covered, unpaid tax liabilities for years to and including 1990-91.  In general, it extends to all arrears of taxes.  It covers both liabilities in respect of previously undisclosed income and other amounts unpaid.  In other words, it covers not only hot money and undisclosed income but also tax arrears.  The basic condition of the amnesty scheme is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This special debate tonight is called to discuss the extension of the tax amnesty, which, from the outset, was an outrageous, unprincipled attack on the integrity of the tax system, and a calculated insult to the intelligence of compliant taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The extension of the amnesty refers to more than just the three-week postponement of the deadline.  It is clear at this stage that the large-scale evaders, the so-called hot money merchants that the amnesty was meant to trap, have decided in large measure not to take the bait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give them a call for us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>So, who has been clogging up the telephone lines in the special collector's office in recent days to such an extent that the Minister for Finance and the Government felt obliged to grant this extension?</P>
      <P>If one was to read all the Dáil debate on the amnesty, one would come to the inescapable conclusion that those phones were busy due to thousands of callers with previously undeclared tax liabilities wanting to come clean, but that conclusion would be wrong.</P>
      <P>The first chance the Dáil had to discuss this matter was on an amendment which my party proposed on the Report Stage of the Finance Bill in June last.  Then the Minister for Finance told us, as reported in column 1666 of the Official Report of 2 June:</P>
      <P>The Government has decided there will be an incentive scheme directed at those with previously undisclosed tax liabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on:</P>
      <P>We must be careful that the scheme we devise does not make it attractive for compliant tax payers to become non-compliant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So enthused was the Minister's partner in crime, Deputy Kemmy, Chairman of the Labour Party, about this tawdry legislation, that he came into the House and told us, as reported in column 1491 of the <Col N="1270" /> Official Report of 2 June to &ldquo;face down the Opposition&rdquo;.  He told us that there were three ways to look at this amnesty, that we could ignore the money abroad, we could condemn those who had money abroad as being unpatriotic or illegal or we could accept the fact that there was possibly £2 billion to £3 billion invested abroad which we could bring home under the amnesty and use in an intelligent way, among other things, to help eliminate the 1 per cent levy.  It is clear that most of the money which is abroad will remain abroad.  It is clear from the Minister, from the trade unions and from debates here that the 1 per cent levy is here to stay notwithstanding what Deputy Kemmy and his naive colleagues might have supposed some months ago.</P>
    <P>The amnesty Bill was finally published at the end of June and the Minister made its purpose clear and explicit when he said in column 405 of the Official Report of 30 June last:</P>
    <P>This present amnesty has been framed with a particular focus on the liabilities from the pre-1991 era which are not on the record&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered a specific question from me on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to question whether this was because of partial concealment or because they had entirely escaped the tax net.  The Minister then went on to spell out specific exclusions from the 15 per cent incentive amnesty scheme.  Among these was a reference to tax due on or before 25 May 1993 which, as reported in columns 409 and 410 of 30 June, &ldquo;had been agreed with an inspector, but had yet to be paid&rdquo;. This point was repeated by the Minister during the debate.</P>
      <P>To further emphasise the nature of the amnesty, the Minister told the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on Committee Stage on Thursday, 1 July as reported in column 655 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The function of the special collector is to meet the non-compliant taxpayer, receive the money and issue the certificate.</P>
    <P>He went on to reassure us, in column 657 of the Official Report of that date that:</P>
    <P>We are trying to reach non-compliant taxpayers who have undisclosed liability.  They come out of the dead wood, back from the Isle of Man, or wherever, change to their right names and declare the sums of money. </P>
    <P>On Report Stage on 6 July, as reported in column 1213, volume 433, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>If an individual was not previously known to the Revenue, that is the starting point.  The knowledge represents progress and there is now a trail for audit purposes.</P>
    <P>He added:</P>
    <P>As the House will recall, the areas excluded are agreed with the inspector but not paid.</P>
    <P>It is little wonder that the man who said that he was not a Matt Talbot socialist, Deputy Kemmy as Chairman of the Labour Party, led his colleagues who were pledged to put &ldquo;trust in politics and justice in economics&rdquo; into the division lobbies to vote in favour of this large golden carrot and the threat of a future stick to encourage hot money home.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Revenue Commissioners issued the first of two explanatory notes to tax practitioners on the tax amnesty scheme, 1993.  This note made explicit that the 15 per cent charter for cheats could, would and should be applied to outstanding liabilities whether previously disclosed or undisclosed for the period before 6 April 1991.  The Revenue Commissioners set it out as it was, something which the Minister did not do with any great clarity.  This turn of events ran totally counter to the reasonable Deputy here who had followed the detailed debate on the amnesty legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> A close reading of the law, as distinct from the essence of the Minister's presentation of its intentions, opened the door to taxpayers in the system prior to 6 April 1991 but who had not yet fully discharged their known, undisputed and agreed liabilities.</P>
    <P>The tax profession was still unsure of where it stood.  The Minister said tonight that some confusion persisted in the matter, so a second amnesty leaflet was published by the Revenue Commissioners. Much of the confusion was generated by the Minister who pretended that the amnesty did not really affect disclosed income already on the record. So that there would be no room for misinterpretation the second leaflet asked how would one treat a taxpayer who had made a part payment for the relevant period but had not fully discharged his or her liabilities.  The answer to the question was an example of someone earning £40,000 and the Revenue said what the Minister has confirmed tonight, that if one has an undischarged liability that is already in the system, this amnesty obliges one to use it or else be in trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the extent of the breathtaking unfairness of what is now the law here, and following Revenue's cue, I have compared four cases of people with a total taxable income of £40,000 for the tax year 1990 to 1991.  The total tax, PRSI and levies paid by a PAYE person who is so trapped by the system, that he or she cannot but comply is £16,624.  The total tax, PRSI and levies paid by the self employed person who was fully compliant and for whom the amnesty offers no relief is £17,200.  Total tax, PRSI and levies paid by the self-employed person who part complied by paying £8,000 tax and is now availing of the amnesty for the balance outstanding is £10,335.  The total tax, PRSI and levies paid by the tax dodger coming into the system for the first time is £6,865.  From the point of view of equity and fairness between taxpayers this is a travesty.  On an income of £40,000, the gap between the person paying the most and the person paying the least, that is the tax dodger, is <Col N="1273" /> £10,335.  This is more than a quarter of the gross income of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The political point used to sell the amnesty was that the dodgers would come in and that at least would make us better off in the future.  The reality is that most of the people who want to avail of it are already in the net and known to the Revenue authorities.  When we see the statistics of income next year we already know that every £10,000 of apparent income will probably mask an actual tax write-off of £20,000 in collectable tax. A sum of £500 million was likely to be collected out of more than £2 billion according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 1992.  This amnesty will write down much of that and collect only part of it.</P>
    <P>This amnesty is an absurd perversion of the tax system.  It is a kick in the teeth to compliant taxpayers and its benefits will largely accrue to people already known to Revenue.  The unearthing of that bonanza is why the phone lines were clogged up and why the amnesty has been extended.  People finally copped on how grave this write-off is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Ceann Comhairle allowed this debate tonight and hope it augurs well for the future when Deputies from this side of the House seek to have matters of current concern to the public dealt with here in a proper and extensive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Government to extend by three weeks the time limit for applicants for the tax amnesties, and to renege on commitments given to the Dáil by changing the terms of the 15 per cent incentive amnesty to include arrears declared but not collected, is a further stab in the back for compliant taxpayers and an indication of the extraordinary lengths to which the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government is prepared to go to accommodate tax criminals.  While the Minister has extended the deadline for applications under the amnesty to 21 December, 25 December might have been a more appropriate date, given the Government's Santa Claus approach to <Col N="1274" /> some of the wealthiest tax cheats in the country.</P>
    <P>The principle of the amnesty was morally wrong in the first place and the decision to alter the terms and extend the deadline adds insult to injury.  What is involved here is not simply a question of turning a blind eye to a few people who failed to fill in a few forms or who took a short cut through some bureaucratic red tape.  This is a case of a Government deliberately setting out to legally pardon and financially reward some of the biggest financial criminals in the country who over a long period of time thumbed their noses at the tax authorities and compliant taxpayers and deliberately ignored exchange control regulations.</P>
    <P>It is now almost five months since the legislation to allow for the amnesties was passed by the Oireachtas.  It was widely publicised at the time and later extensively advertised and promoted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A special office has been open in Harcourt Street for more than four months to protect the confidentiality of the tax cheats.  Given those factors there is simply no justification for a further generous extension of the deadline for those cheats who have now only made up their minds to apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that there has been heavy lobbying by accountants and tax consultants to have the deadline extended, but they are not disinterested parties.  Those people are making big money from the two amnesties and stand to make even more if the deadline is extended.  The more tax evaders they recruit during the next three weeks, the fatter their basket of fees will be by 21 December.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that &mdash; as is the case with many farmers &mdash; tax evaders seem quite willing to pay huge amounts of money to accountants and tax consultants, but are unwilling to pay anything to the Exchequer.  The greed of tax consultants and accountants is not sufficient grounds for extending the deadline for an amnesty which was set out by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I dispute the right of the <Col N="1275" /> Government to effectively change the terms of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, which have been set out by the Oireachtas.  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas specifically set 30 November as the deadline for the receipt of applications for the amnesties.  The very first section of the Act defines the specified period for applications under the two amnesties as &ldquo;the period beginning with the passing of this Act and ending on the 30th Day of November, 1993&rdquo;.  The Act did not give the Minister, the Government or anyone else &mdash; other than the Oireachtas &mdash; any power to change that date.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter on the Order of Business yesterday the Taoiseach said there was no need to introduce any legislation now to validate the extension and indicated that this would be done in future legislation &mdash; presumably the 1994 Finance Bill, which will not be enacted until around the end of May.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on the part of the Minister to warn tax criminals who may be considering availing of the extension that they now enjoy no legislative guarantees with regard to confidentiality or immunity from prosecution which were available to those who applied prior to 30 November.  It is clear from the Act that these lavish guarantees were available only to those who applied within the specified period.  It is clear also that the &ldquo;permanently binding declaration of confidentiality&rdquo; which the special collectors were obliged to take will not apply to declarations made from today.  Any information which comes to the attention of an officer of the Revenue Commissioners from today will enjoy no special protection and the officer will be entitled to bring such information to the attention of other sections of the Revenue Commissioners or the Garda.  Any guarantees that the Minister may purport to give has no legislative backing.</P>
    <P>Another major development is the change in the terms of the tax amnesty and the reneging on commitments given to this House by the Minister for Finance. During the Second Stage debate the <Col N="1276" /> Minister specifically said that &ldquo;tax which, on 25 May, has been agreed with the inspector but had not yet been paid&rdquo; would be excluded from the terms of the amnesty.  We should compare this with the reality of how it has operated, as described by a leading accountant in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, who stated that many of those availing of the amnesty on this occasion were already being pursued by the collector general.</P>
    <P>Pat Newham, a partner with accountants Grant Thompson, stated that it is obviously better to pay 15 per cent tax on income up to April 1991 than on the full tax already declared, which may be due to the Collector General and that many of the applicants had tax arrears already and took advantage of the amnesty to clear up long outstanding amounts at a low rate.  I would like the Minister to comment on the claims in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that accountants used computer printouts from the Revenue Commissioners to locate clients who were slow in paying taxes for prior years.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the terms of the amnesty were extended because it was not meeting the lavish targets predicted by the Government when it was first announced last May.  According to the Minister the really big evaders, the mortal sinners, are not coming forward under the amnesty.  Is that any surprise, given the huge amounts of money that can be made from tax evasion and the indulgent attitude of successive Governments to this form of crime, represented yet again by this extension?</P>
    <P>This is the fifth tax amnesty that we have had since 1988.  Those who availed of the 1988 amnesty and who subsequently reneged on their tax obligations are again covered by this amnesty, which is again being extended beyond its original terms and deadline. What message does that convey to the serious tax evader?  The message plainly is that there is no need to worry because if they wait long enough the Government will look after them and there will almost certainly be yet another amnesty.</P>
    <P>Threats of jail are not taken seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> As far back as the Finance Act, 1983, stiff penalties, including jail terms, were provided for a wide range of tax offences. Yet when have we ever heard of tax offenders going to jail?  There are no Lester Piggott's in Irish jails.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised once again that tax evasion is not a victimless crime. Every pound of tax evaded by the rich puts an extra pound on to the bill of the PAYE sector.  There are many other victims of these criminals &mdash; children in overcrowded classrooms, the handicapped denied facilities, the sick enduring long waiting lists for treatment and the homeless with no hope of accommodation. Those are areas where money robbed from the Exchequer by tax evasion could and should usefully have been spent.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the amnesty to facilitate financial spivs marks a further humiliation for the Labour Party.  Those who represent Labour at the Cabinet table appear to have thrown in the towel and are prepared to meekly go along with whatever Fianna Fáil decides.  Is there not one person among the timid 33 prepared to take a stand on this issue and oppose with their Vote tonight what many privately admit to be totally unjustified?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Deputies will have to make up their minds about where they stand.  Will they stand with the tax cheats and their supporters at the Cabinet table or with the PAYE workers, the sick and the unemployed, in support of a fair and just system where everybody pays a fair share?  That is what tonight's vote is about.  That is what the Labour Party must make up its mind on.</P>

      <P>I thought Deputies Cox and De Rossa would have a go at me this evening and for that reason I came into the House.  I will be a long time in this House before allowing either of those Deputies to lecture me, because on matters from Northern Ireland to taxation my record will stand compared with that of Deputies Cox and De Rossa.  I would be a very poor socialist if I took my leadership principles from Deputy De <Col N="1278" /> Rossa who would be much better off controlling his own party &mdash; all four of them &mdash; putting his house in order and developing a policy which would appeal to the Irish people rather than lecturing me on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am here as the Chairman of the Labour Party while the Deputy is here as the leader of a party of four.  Like Deputy Cox, Deputy De Rossa spoke with great moral indignation and adopted a self-righteous attitude.  Both are men of the world.  It is possible, though unlikely that I am naive; I have travelled many a long road also and, I therefore, am not prepared to listen to any homilies from the Deputy.  We live in an imperfect society. There is a saying in Limerick, of which Deputy Cox must be well aware, &ldquo;we robbed and plundered but we kept the faith&rdquo;.  It is true that if everybody paid their taxes, this amnesty would be unnecessary.  It is an indictment and a reflection on our society that we have to offer this amnesty at this stage.</P>

I am aware that some of these accounts are innocuous in that they are in the names of schoolchildren and may contain nothing but it is also possible that many people have a number of bank accounts, not always for honourable purposes.  In this regard, we have two choices.  Deputy Cox quoted what I said in the House on a previous occasion accurately and I am grateful to him for that.  We can either ignore reality and close our eyes to tax evasion or else tackle it.  I would be more stern and draconian than the Minister in dealing with it but we are partners in a Coalition Government and have to reach a compromise.  My party supports that compromise because we are in the minority in Government and cannot insist on getting our own way on every issue. There has to be give and take and a reasonable compromise.</P>

    <P>These people have been indicted as tax cheats, hot money merchants and so on but, as I mentioned in a previous contribution, <Col N="1281" /> they are to be found among many occupations.  Indeed, clergymen are often indicted for evading taxes.  I am amazed when I see the details of wills that have been published.  Often people whom one would have thought had nothing, leave hundreds of thousands of pounds on which they could not have paid their fair share of taxes.  I am also amazed when I see the list of occupations of those who reach tax settlements with the Revenue Commissioners.  Anyone who has looked at that list would have to accept that tax evasion is endemic in society.  I wonder how these large sums of money are amassed.  The amnesty has been offered in an attempt to face reality and to discover the money that has been hidden.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bruton criticised officials in the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not accept this as I deal with them on a regular basis in Limerick and they are people of high intelligence, ability and integrity.  I am confident when the amnesty has expired they will go after tax evaders with renewed vigour.  I am also confident that the penalties enshrined in the legislation will be enforced and, if necessary, people will be sent to jail.  This has happened in other countries.  I am not vicious by <Col N="1283" /> nature and would not go after anybody in a vindictive way but it is important that the amnesty should not be seen as an easy means of avoiding taxation; rather, it marks a watershed.  In the future tax evaders will be dealt with sternly by the Government and, if necessary, they will be put in jail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up where Deputy Kemmy left off, this week Dublin Corporation passed its estimate.  It decided that it would pursue vigorously those who had failed to pay their rents. In some cases, the people concerned are only paying £2-£3 a week.  We decided to take draconian measures to make sure that these liabilities would be met.  It is ironic that Deputy Kemmy, chairman of the Labour Party, should be party to such a draconian measures which has to be taken to ensure the credibilty of our rent system but is happy to come into the House and tell us it is all right to wipe out the arrears of the high rollers who have been unwilling to pay their way for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has a habit of talking to us about equity, ethics and social exclusion but these words have a hollow ring.  This is a moral issue.  The first issue I ever raised when I came into the Dáil in 1982 was that of tax evasion.  I still have the statement I read on that occasion, when it was quite clear that our Revenue Commissioners were not enforcing the law in respect of the tax code.  Over the years we have tightened up the procedures to ensure that people will pay their tax on time and that interest payable on penalties will be collected. Broadly speaking, we have succeeded in creating an honest and complaint business and trading sector.  What we are doing in this Bill, and doing again tonight by extending the time limit, is thumbing our noses at those people who have been willing to comply and telling them that their efforts to pay up on time and pay what was due was folly, that when Ministers found they were running out of money to finance their over ambitious <Col N="1284" /> schemes they would wipe out the obligations and tap into what they called &ldquo;difficult to collect&rdquo; money.  That is not an acceptable way to run our tax code.</P>
    <P>Anyone who examined our tax code with a view to establishing the inequities in it would not look first to the design of the code.  It is true there are inequities in our code.  We refuse to recognise children. We insist on taking levies from the first £1 of people who are in the PAYE workforce.  But the real inequity, as we all know, is the difference in the opportunities there are for people in the taxpaying community to conceal their liability and to evade.  These are not the PAYE sector that Deputy Kemmy talks about.  What we have done tonight is to say that the insider traders who have been able to conceal are to be rewarded.</P>
    <P>The sums at stake are not chickenfeed. We are not launching a new crusade just to tidy up things; we have had several crusades in the eighties.  We are not discarding small sums.  In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which were received recently, it is stated that amounts outstanding in respect of which this amnesty applies comes to £1,500 million, and many of those are disclosed sums that are not disputed, are under demand and being enforced.  These are sums that the Revenue Commissioners are actually in the course of pursuing.  To say that we will forget about all that, that the people who have paid on time and have carried the can will be written off, and that those people who were willing to drag their feet and go to the last ditch to evade their responsibilities are to be let go scot-free, is no way to establish a tax code or any code that we hope will bring us into a competitive Europe.</P>
    <P>Many Ministers complain about the lack of enterprise here.  The Minister himself is on record as saying that it is a shame that the enterprise and energy of many of our people is distracted into elaborate schemes and tax wheezes, trying to generate schemes that can avail of grants.  We have heard many lectures and seen Ministers nodding sagely about what a shame it is that people waste their time searaching for clauses in the tax <Col N="1285" /> code that will allow them to evade responsibility.  Now the whole integrity of the tax code is being thrown out so that we can get a few hundred million pounds into the Exchequer, which will be spent, as all the rest of the money is spent, and forgotten about quickly.</P>
    <P>We have a Government that in the last few years has allowed spending to run rampant, ahead of the ability of the Government and the economy to pay interest.  Then, when they are running out of steam, they squeeze the cloth dry in this way by allowing people who should have been paying on time to get away with it.  There is nothing more corrosive to enterprise in this country than the belief that is spreading that if one is cute enough one will get away with it.  That is not the signal the Minister for Finance should give to young, enthusiastic, dedicated people who can give their talents to create enterprise in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that the Minister for Finance has a sacred trust.  It is he who is set up as the defender of the legitimacy of the money that is put into the coffers. It is he above all who is there to make sure there is fair play and that money is used wisely.  It is ironic that it is he who has decided to adopt this approach to tax arrears.  It was amusing to hear him say that various representations are made to him, as much as to say there are Deputies out there who are phoney.  Of course, he will get representations.  We have developed a political culture where anything that is passed along will be passed on a little further.  The Minister is elected and given a sacred trust to stand between the taxpayer and all sorts of representations and backsliding, but he is not willing to take his responsibilities seriously.</P>
    <P>The great saving of the tax code was to be self-assessment; it was to be the watertight answer.  We would have random and detailed audits and anyone who was found not complying with their responsibilities would have the book thrown at them and no mercy would be shown.  That was until 1988, when they were shown mercy and told that they could get away with it while the rest of us <Col N="1286" /> had to pay our way.  Again, the Minister is doing the same thing.</P>

      <P>The Minister talked about the importance of equity between the cheater who lives in Ireland and the cheater who lives in the Cayman Islands. What sort of equity is it that the Minister is trying to introduce on the floor of this House?  There is no future in that sort of talk.  What we want is a tax code which the Minister, despite his many years now in occupation of that office, has been unwilling to provide.  We want to see tax reform, but on the basis of fairness, where people pay what they are liable for and honour the integrity of the tax code.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Minister has destroyed everything that was being built up.  A strong tax code, from which there would be no shirkers, has been thrown out the window; and people know that all this talk about this being the last chance is phoney.  The Government has bored the House with its talk of how it almost invented the notion of morality, ethics and equity in politics.  There are many in this House who for years before the 33 came in here and lectured about fairness sought to establish fairness in our tax code.  What we are talking about here tonight is the integrity and morality of the way we do business as public servants, which all of us here are.  The Labour Party is not honouring the trust placed in it by the electorate when they got such a large vote based on the notion of equity, of change, of ethics.  On the Labour Party above all must fall the responsibility for allowing this to reach the floor of the House.</P>

The estimated outstanding taxes for the self-employed were always accorded banner headlines although the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners was always at pains to explain the difference between estimates and the likely tax take.  Deputy Cox quoted a figure of £531 million outstanding likely to be collected; £165 million of that related to income tax. Corporation tax, which does not come under the amnesty, took up a large amount, plus VAT, PAYE and PRSI, which were agreed figures.  The Deputy should get his figures correct.</P>

      <P>This amnesty will afford an opportunity to establish realistic figures for the future and put a stop to headline-grabbing figures often out of line with the factual situation.  In my years in practice as an accountant and as a TD I have encountered many people who were worried sick about what would happen to them if the Revenue Commissioners discovered that they had some undisclosed sums, no matter how small. Some were close to distraction in that regard but were not willing to legitimise their funds because of the penalties which would be imposed and the tax that would be deducted if those funds were disclosed.  The amnesty allows those people to legitimise their funds and, by so doing, it will benefit those people, their local economies and the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amnesty when first mooted was viewed with scepticism by many acountants, tax advisers, commentators and-politicians. However, during the past few weeks a change of attitude has occurred and the number of people who wish to <Col N="1288" /> participate in the amnesty has increased greatly.  They include those who wish to clear up the outstanding tax Bills or submit undeclared income.  The income collected from those sources through the amnesty will have a beneficial effect on the economy.  Additional capital will be freed to be used in the economy at local and national levels.  Investments will be boosted as people will no longer be afraid to use this money for repairs, extensions and development of their businesses. People who were afraid to use that money in the past will no longer be afraid to spend it.  The tax base will be widened as a number of people who operated in the black economy, on a full-time basis and sometimes on a part-time basis, will now come within it.  The tax base will be spread over a greater number of people. There will be an increased tax take for the future.  The tax take for 1990-91 cannot be accurately estimated yet, but it has been stated that it will be in the region of £250 million to £300 million. The Exchequer will stand to gain a further 40 per cent to 50 per cent in tax on the money declared for the subsequent tax years 1991-92 and 1992-93 and for future years.</P>
    <P>Since the MacSharry amnesty my colleagues and I have noticed a sea change in attitude in relation to tax compliance and tax payment and this is borne out by the Revenue Commissioners.  People are becoming more aware of their duty to keep their affairs up to date and they pay their tax on time.  They are helped by greater vigilance, quicker enforcement of the law and the imposition of penalties and interest charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past few years the new approach by tax inspectors of moving around the country rather than looking at PCs has and will continue to ensure that the tax system will be more effective, that compliance will improve and that there will be greater equality between all taxpayers thus ensuring a reduction in the tax burden of all individuals. PAYE workers may not realise <Col N="1289" /> that the amnesty is also available to them. Those who have undeclared investment income, whether sourced from inheritance or gifts or from some sideline, may and should avail of this opportunity to legitimise their income.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to extend the amnesty to 21 December as it will bring more money into the Exchequer and enable the Government to do more for the economy.  While, in principle, I do not favour amnesties the Government decision was a practical one which in the long run, will benefit the economy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important extension of the date of the amnesty.  I, like my colleagues in Labour and Fianna Fáil, support the extension.  It is worthwhile.  I was appalled by Deputy Bruton's attack on the Civil Service and the Revenue. The people will judge what he said.  His comment was uncalled for.  I have been busy in my constituency and I am well aware of the number of people who want the closing date extended.  They include people who own small and large sized businesses who want to put their houses in order.  A few months ago Deputy Cox was the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on Finance.  While I admire him I cannot let him get away with everything. He spoke earlier about tax cheats, a remark that was uncalled for.  The wealthy and those who own property are <Col N="1290" /> represented by Deputies opposite.  We do not represent that section of society. Deputies opposite cater for those who live in the Dublin 4 area.  Deputy Cox's party can identify most with that sector of society.  His party was founded to represent that niche.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a quota. The attitude of the Deputies opposite is nonsensical.  Their opposition to the tax amnesty smacks of hypocrisy and humbug.  That is particularly true of the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael who both supported the previous amnesty but for reasons of unadulterated political opportunism have decided to oppose this amnesty.  We should not be so surprised as that is typical of Progressive Democrats behaviour.  Their accusations are emotive and do not hold up.  The electorate will judge them shortly when its members will be on platforms around the country.</P>
      <P>This amnesty is about putting down markers for future tax evasion policy. Initially it is important to clear the decks. This amnesty is a practical response and should be welcomed as such.  The Minister has the courage of his convictions and is putting the house in order.  From now on we will have a level playing pitch and our people will be looked after legally on such a pitch.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that in every system there is an obligation to clear tax arrears and this is an opportunity to do so.  The amnesty is a good opportunity to do this.  Bad-mounthing the amnesty will not do our taxpayers, who do not avail of it, any good.  They are being frightened by the Opposition and by the two major political parties who represent the wealthy and those who own property.</P>

      <P>Their opposition serves to undermine this obligation and frightens people who may be caught in the system.  People who support the parties <Col N="1291" /> opposite are concerned.  It makes good business sense to comply with the amnesty as more and more people are dependent on tax claim certificates to do business.  Every day questions are tabled by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats as to when a tax rebate may be made to a person whose details are supplied. Do Opposition Deputies recognise this aspect of commercial life?  Businesses must continue and people must live.  This is the reality of living in Ireland and being part of Europe in 1993.</P>
      <P>Under the amnesty the Minister answered a call for a practical response to the current situation.  It behoves everyone, including Deputies opposite to co-operate with him.  I urge those Deputies to rise from their slumbers and wake up to the needs of those involved in commercial life.  They should cease their endless carping.  There is a substantial amount of money out there.  I congratulate the Government on introducing the amnesty.  I am not afraid, like Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>The health boards' liabilities are being cleared and this could not be done without putting in place a mechanism to collect funds.  I understand the figure of approximately £80 million will be made available to our health boards which will result in us getting a health service that will rival that of any in the western world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy referred to housing.  I attend local authority meetings at which Deputies opposite constantly scream about the housing waiting list.  Now they want to stop us collecting funds to provide housing for those on those waiting lists.  I admit we have a housing problem. If Deputies opposite want houses built they must find the money to do so.  We now have an opportunity to provide housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to send people to Belfast for hip operations because we cannot perform those operations in our hospitals. We cannot afford to expand the existing facilities to provide that much needed service.  Some of the money collected under the amnesty will be used for that purpose.  We are a caring Government. <Col N="1292" /> Fianna Fáil has always been a caring party and it has always done its best for the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First I thank you, Sir, for allowing this motion under Standing Order 30.  It is not a common event, but you and your officials understood the gravity of what was involved.  Having listened to the speech of the Minister for Finance tonight, I know how Jacques Delors felt in relation to the EC Structural Funds.  Having sat through six days of debate on this Act and going through the debate line by line in the last 24 hours, I cannot understand how the Minister could make such a speech here tonight. It was a monstrous whitewash and a barefaced attempt to try to gloss over Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage debates on this matter.  I will quote for the record of the House exactly what was said on each Stage.  As regards the inclusion of tax arrears in the 15 per cent incentive amnesty, the Minister seriously misled the Dáil and the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs from 30 June to 7 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's Second Stage speech of 30 June he said that &ldquo;this present amnesty has been framed with a particular <Col N="1293" /> focus on the liabilities from the pre-1991 era which are not on the record&rdquo;.  He referred to the tax liability on such undisclosed income and said that the scheme was aimed at bringing these people within the tax net.  However, tax arrears represent money that has been already disclosed and the people involved are in the tax net.  Later in the Minister's speech he outlined the exclusions from the scope of the 15 per cent amnesty, one of which is &ldquo;tax which, on that date, had been agreed with an inspector but had yet to be paid&rdquo;.  What reasonable conclusion could anyone draw but that that tax was in the Collector General's office.  The Minister said specifically that that money would not be included in the amnesty.</P>
    <P>There were so many references to this matter in the select committee that it is embarrassing for the Minister, and I regret his absence.  On the incentive amnesty the Minister said: &ldquo;We are talking about a person who is non-compliant and who may be outside the tax net, perhaps somebody who is working on 50 per cent or 60 per cent of their figures and they fill in a form for 1992-93&rdquo;.  He went on to say that the incentive amnesty has two principal objectives.  The first is to take the maximum amount of tax paid at the 15 per cent rate in respect of periods up to 1991, the bulk of which in all probability would not otherwise have been declared to the Exchequer.  This is not arrears but money that would not otherwise be declared.  The second objective was to create a substantial body of new compliant taxpayers in the year 1992-93.  There was no mention of a third category of people who were in arrears. This is an analysis of what took place in the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the function of the special Collector General is to meet the non-compliant taxpayer, receive the money and issue the certificate. He said that these people would not check anyone other than the non-compliant taxpayer.  He went on to say that we are trying to reach non-compliant taxpayers who have undisclosed liability. The Minister made abundantly clear time and again that the point of this amnesty <Col N="1294" /> is not to forego tax which he received in any event.  In answer to my question to the Minister as to what section 2 of the Bill covers, he said: &ldquo;It is undisclosed liabilities up to April 1991&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage the Minister gave similar assurances to the House.  Not once did he say in this House or in the committee that the amnesty would relate to tax arrears.  The Minister said on Report Stage:</P>
    <P>There are thousands of individuals outside the system who are not known to Revenue, who are holding back at least part of their taxes on an annual basis and have done so for several years.  Many of these people ignored the 1988 amnesty and will take the opportunity of availing of this amnesty.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to individuals with undisclosed liabilities, not only of income tax but of all taxes.  He said the amnesty would help to maximise tax revenue which would never be collected otherwise. Non-compliant individuals with liabilities before April 1991 would be required to present themselves, or their adviser, to the special collector's office and in the case of income tax and capital gains tax 15 per cent interest would be paid.  The Minister made that clear time and time again.</P>
    <P>At no stage did the Minister say that people with tax arrears before April 1991 could go to the special collector and recalculate their tax liability on the basis of the 15 per cent rate, and I defy anyone on that side of the House to produce a quote to that effect.  I am advised by people in the media that in the Minister's private briefings, when he was asked explicitly about the questions of arrears, he clearly repeated that the 15 per cent rate did not apply in those cases.  This not only undermines the integrity of the tax system but makes a mockery of the credibility of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Act provides that people who avail of this amnesty will receive a special certificate which, when presented, exempts these people from a rigorous analysis by the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore, people in the <Col N="1295" /> system who owe £20,000 in tax will avail of the 15 per cent rate and will have the privilege of a certificate which will give them immunity from analysis by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is absolutely farcical.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister had to leave the House, but I would like to know why this change was made.  There is no doubt that this matter was misrepresented to the committee and to this House.  Either tax experts realised the ambiguity of section 2 of the Act and threatened to fully avail of it, or alternatively &mdash; and more likely &mdash; the well was dry, there were no inquiries and it was a dead duck.  The Minister, having last year received £174 million from the sale of shares in Greencore and Irish Life, realised there would be a shortfall in next January's budget.  Therefore the reason 14 January was stated as the date for payment of this tax was so that it would be included in the 1994 balance sheet to make it look respectable.</P>
    <P>We want to know why this change was made and when it was made.  The reality is that the scope of the amnesty was <Col N="1296" /> greatly widened about six or seven weeks ago to include all arrears.  The Minister must quantify the loss to the Exchequer from this change.  Most of the money that is being included would have been collected anyway, but now it is being discounted.  I accept that the figure of £3 billion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General is not correct.  The figure is probably £400 million and, taking into account VAT and taxes paid at 15 per cent, the amount paid on a discounted basis will be probably in the order of £200 million to £250 million.  We need to know exactly how much is being written off in this case.</P>
    <P>The people in charge of this amnesty, who are not available to take telephone calls, realise that the amnesty is out of control.  It has gone beyond that which was originally intended.  I am bitterly disappointed that the Minister did not admit tonight that he was in no doubt, in his presentation to this House and to the committee, that arrears were included. The Minister seriously misled the committee and the House and that gravely reflects on his credibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I refer to a problem which is symptomatic of what has been happening in rural Ireland to an increasing extent over the past 12 months.  Last Sunday evening in the little village of Straide, not far from Castlebar, at 8.30 in the evening three masked and armed men wearing balaclavas burst into a house which was occupied by a son and daughter of the householders, a girl aged 12 and a boy aged 15.  The raiders tied these young people up amidst great terror, ransacked the house and made off with several thousand pounds.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago a robbery occurred on the Westport Road in Castlebar where a retail premises was broken into at night and up to £10,000 worth of goods and cash was taken.  It is obvious that criminals from large urban areas are travelling to remote and isolated areas in the country and are wreaking havoc and putting fear into young and old people alike.  It is fair to say that in rural parts of Ireland, with the declining population due to emigration and people having to seek employment elsewhere, many elderly folk are living alone in terror, loneliness and isolation and they need protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain measures can be taken by the Minister and the Minister of State. Where gardaí are stationed in rural areas, <Col N="1299" /> there is a need for adequate transport and communication facilities.  In the case of the robbery last Sunday, the nearest garda who was stationed in the village at Ballyvarry, three miles from Straide, had no transport at his disposal.  Transport must be available between at least three to five rural stations which would allow gardaí to reach any point in a given area within a few minutes.  Communication and information is the key to both the prevention and the detection of crimes such as these.  This is a problem which must be addressed because people need the visibility of the Garda for protection.</P>
    <P>I would like to the Minister of State to consider also the problem of bogus charity collectors and salesmen around the country.  Where a licence or a permit is given to these people to collect money or sell goods in particular areas, such notice should be announced on the local radio on a daily basis giving the area where the collection or sale is to be held.  That would at least inform people and allow those who are genuine to make their collections. The Minister of State will be aware that strangers knocking on doors in isolated parts of rural Ireland instill a sense of terror in people when they read and hear in the media the general reports of robbery and other crimes.</P>
    <P>In the two cases to which I have referred, it is fortunate that nobody was shot, beaten up or molested.  Those robberies have left a sense of terror and fear in peoples' minds and hearts.  While the Garda at local level are doing the best they can to detect the culprits and bring them to justice, it is a broader issue than that.  The Minister and the Department of Justice should ensure that facilities, such as transport and proper communications, are made available to gardaí on a general basis because intelligence, along with communications and transport, comprises the key to prevention and detection of dastardly crimes like these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House and to Deputy Enda Kenny for being late, which was quite unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Naturally I am very concerned at the incidents of crime referred to by the Deputy, particularly so in the case of the robbery last weekend where armed raiders held at 12-year old girl at gunpoint. I fully appreciate Deputy Enda Kennedy's concern in raising this matter tonight in the House.  I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the policing arrangements that exist in the Mayo division and the measures being taken by the Garda authorities to prevent and detect crime.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of serious crimes have been committed in the Castlebar area recently.  I am particularly disturbed by the nature of the robbery involving the 12-year-old girl and her 15-year-old brother who were alone when the raiders entered the house.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are carrying out intense investigations into these crimes and they report some progress in the case specifically referred to by the Deputy.  I am informed that every effort is being made to track down the culprits.  I can assure the House that no resource problems are getting in the way of progress in these investigations.</P>
    <P>It is evident to the Garda that some of the crimes in the Mayo area are being committed by travelling criminals from outside the area.  They inform me that they are taking measures to deal with this type of crime.  These measures include the closer co-ordination and use of foot and mobile patrols and checkpoints at various locations and unpredictable intervals and the deployment of Garda resources to meet the special requirements of particular areas.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda manpower to individual areas within the State.  There has been no significant change in the overall manpower levels in the Mayo division over the past three years.  It now stands at 256 members.  In addition, there are now six clerical civilian staff employed in the divisional headquarters at Castlebar. The allocation of Garda transport in the <Col N="1301" /> Mayo division is kept constantly under review and the Garda authorities have a policy of replacing Garda motorcycles in remote areas with vanettes.  This process is on-going and the Garda authorities have plans at present to replace motorcycles attached to outlying stations in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The number of community alert schemes in the Mayo division is increasing. I would, of course, encourage this development in all rural areas.  Five schemes have been launched in the Castlebar district so far this year, one of which is in the Straide area, and a further three schemes will be launched within the next two months.  It is also planned to launch a scheme in the Keelogues area of Ballyvary in the near future.  These schemes greatly assist the Garda in the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>While there has been an increase in the number of burglaries in the Castlebar area recently, it should not go unnoticed that in 1992 the Mayo division recorded the third lowest level of crime in the country, while the detection rate was the second highest in the country.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda in the Mayo division on this achievement.  I am also glad to say that the preliminary indications for this year are that there will be a further reduction in the level of crime in the Mayo division.  That is not to say that we can be complacent in these matters.  The recent spate of serious criminal activity in County Mayo needs to be tackled with all the strength the Garda can muster.  I assure the Deputy that this is being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enda Kenny mentioned the question of bogus salesmen allegedly collecting for charity.  The Deputy may be aware that a commission was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Costello of the High Court which has reported to the Minister for Justice, making 90 recommendations for changes in the law. Legislation to implement the recommendations of that report is at present being prepared in the Department of Justice. I can assure Deputy Enda Kenny and the House that when that legislation is on the Statute Book bogus charity collectors <Col N="1302" /> will be put out of business once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>As a member of Bray UDC I am well aware of the demands made on local authorities and the difficulties they experience in fulfilling their requirements, particularly the difficulty of extracting funding from Central Government. Bray UDC is a progressive authority which has attempted to keep pace with the rapid development of the town, now the eighth largest town nationwide, its population being approximately 28,000 and likely to see a further increase.</P>
      <P>The amount of roadway has increased substantially over a very short period as a result of this development.  For example, since 1979 cumulative length of roadway has risen by 84.4 per cent, an indication of the massive expansion that has taken place.  The cumulative length now in charge is 55.25 kilometres whereas pre-1979 that figure was 29.89 kilometres. This is an indication of the very rapid expansion that has taken place, an astonishing increase that any town would have great difficulty in bearing, particularly in that we have many needs to be met including those in tourism, housing and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible for the local authority to provide good quality roads and footpaths with the low allocation we have received from the Minister's Department. This year the Minister announced an increased allocation for local authority grants totalling £340 million, the highest ever provision for roads.  Sadly, within that allocation Bray has done very badly, receiving only £32,000.  When one considers the grants allocated to other urban district councils in the same year one realises just how badly Bray is losing out. For example, the town of Birr, a much smaller place, was allocated £45,000; Clonakilty, £50,000; Cobh, £63,000; <Col N="1303" /> Dundalk over £2 million, Killarney £50,000; Templemore £35,000.  All received more than Bray.  I appreciate that these allocations include special grants as well as the block grant but that does not alter the fact that, at the end of the day, the amount of money going to those areas in comparison with Bray is a lot more substantial.  Bray is simply not getting adequate funding.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister by way of parliamentary question but the response I received was totally unacceptable. He stated that two urban district councils had received an allocation of £32,000, the highest grant given out under the block grant.</P>
    <P>I have two points to make.  First, we in Bray have not received any special grant. I am not sure whether we are the largest urban district council but certainly we would be one of the largest, a town experiencing massive growth over quite an extended period and which will continue to witness such growth because of its proximity to Dublin.</P>
    <P>An application has been submitted today to the Minister for a special grant for road strengthening.  It is in that regard I would ask the Minister to consider the inequity that Bray is experiencing.  The application is for the strengthening of 17 roads to be carried out on a phased basis. I would urge the Minister to look favourably on this application which would make up the shortfall we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>At present we have a major traffic problem in the town, partly occasioned by the general growth, but exacerbated by the fact that there is only one bridge over the river, leading to a concentration of traffic within the centre of the town which in turn creates its own pressures and a major headache for people using the roadways.  As part of our initiative to tackle this problem Bray Urban District Council has commissioned a traffic plan which would cost £2 million if implemented in total.  We will endeavour to implement that plan albeit on a phased basis.  It incorporates many innovative ideas and might well form a model for <Col N="1304" /> other areas.  For example it contains many ideas on traffic claming and environmentally-friendly traffic controls.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take on board the case I make.  I do not make it lightly.  I appreciate that every local authority feels hard done by.  Before I engage in special pleading I put a certain amount of thought into it.  There are many arguments I could advance for funding for Bray Urban District Council, but this is of particular importance because of the shortfall we have experienced. I ask the Minister to approve the special grant application before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy McManus for raising this matter.  The Deputy will be aware that the improvement and maintenance of urban roads in Bray is the responsibility of the urban district council's own resources supplemented by the discretionary block grant allocation provided annually by my Department.  The total block grant provision available for urban authorities this year is £5.5 million. Two councils, one of which was Bray UDC, received block grant allocations of £32,000 which were the highest such grants notified to urban district councils.</P>
      <P>Some authorities, including urban councils received additional special grants for specific works on non-national roads in their area, the effect of which may have been to bring their overall level of grant assistance from the Department above the allocation made to Bray.  I must emphasise that these special grants were made in respect of applications submitted to the Department by the authorities concerned and following the assessment of their merits on a case by case basis.  A limited provision is set aside each year for such grants &mdash; £5.7 million in 1993 &mdash; so that the maximum possible funding can be made available in the form of block grants for use at the discretion of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of road for which Bray UDC is responsible has, I understand, increased by more than 80 per cent since <Col N="1305" /> 1979 due in large measure to the number of housing estates constructed in the town which were subsequently taken in charge by the council.  However, any particular difficulties which may have arisen in relation to the maintenance and improvement of roads have not been brought to the attention of the Department, nor has an application been made for a special grant allocation.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the allocation to Bray UDC this year is reasonable having regard to the overall funds available for urban roads and the competing demands from other councils.</P>
    <P>I understand that the UDC has engaged consultants to prepare a traffic plan for the town and that an assessment has also been carried out to establish needs in respect of road strengthening. My Department will consider any application which may be made for special grant assistance on foot of these studies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that under the National Development Plan it is proposed that State road grants amounting to £475 million will be provided for the improvement of non-national roads in the period 1994 to 1999, of which £235 million is expected to qualify for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund.  The co-financed expenditure will be directed specificially towards roads which are important for the generation of economic activity and jobs in industry, tourism, fisheries, forestry or rural development.  The precise criteria, which have to be agreed with the EU Commission, will be finalised as soon as possible and notified to local authorities. Road grant allocations will be determined annually on the basis of applications submitted by authorities to the Department.  The level of individual allocations will depend on the overall amount of the State funding available, the compliance of the applications with the relevant eligibility criteria and the relative priority of projects.</P>
    <P>The non-co-financed element of grants proposed to be available for non-national roads over the period 1994-99 &mdash; £240 million &mdash; will be distributed between local authorities and discretionary block <Col N="1306" /> grants generally on a similar basis as applies at present in the case of these grants.  The dual scheme of grants will afford every opportunity to Bray UDC to increase its share of State road grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and also the Minister of State who has come to reply.  Saint Joseph's special school is a two storey building which was reconstructed as a primary school in 1962-63.  The changeover to a special school began in 1968 and it ceased to be a primary school in 1976.  There are four classrooms downstairs and seven upstairs.  The pupils range in age from five to 18 years.  The physically disabled pupils in the school should have access to all parts of the school just as their fellow pupils have; that is to the seven classrooms, the principal's office, the staff room etc. on the upper storey.</P>
      <P>Through custom and practice, since the establishment of the school, pupils have progressed from the reception class, through the junior classes on the ground floor, to the post primary and senior classes on the second floor.  It is part of the ethos of Saint Joseph's that pupils look upon going upstairs as a milestone in their education and development.  The physically disabled pupils fight a daily battle to live with their disabilities.  The school encourages and supports their spirit and courage.  They do not dampen their spirits by confining them to a specific area of the school.  Furthermore, it is not feasible to accommodate the physically disabled pupils on the ground floor because furniture, fittings and toilet facilities are geared specifically for young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If senior disabled pupils with their classes were to be accommodated downstairs the problems would merely be compounded because many younger pupils have walking difficulties or lack sufficient co-ordination to get up and down the stairs safely several times daily.  This so-called <Col N="1307" /> solution would actually worsen the problem and increase the need for a lift.</P>
    <P>The report of a special education review committee, chapter 7, paragraph 3.5, deals in detail with the current need. The summary recommendation is that the Department of Education must ensure that all necessary funding is made available speedily to school management authorities who wish to make modifications to school buildings, furniture, fittings or lighting in order to accommodate pupils with disabilities.  Five pupils use wheelchairs or crutches and four have walking difficulties.</P>
    <P>Application was made to the Department of Education in March 1981 for the building of ramps and the installation of a lift.  In that month the school received an estimate of costings as follows: lift installation, £22,500 and ancillary building work, £16,890.  I spoke to the school principal on a visit to Saint Joseph's on Friday last and it appears that the final figure could be much lower.  In October 1991 the Department's professional advisers looked into the matter.  Having received no further reply, the board of management again wrote to the Department in 1992 outlining the ongoing hardship and safety aspects.  In February 1992 they received a letter from the Department informing them that they would be grant-aided for the provision of ramps but, it stated: &ldquo;the Department does not grant-aid lifts to schools&rdquo;.  The ramps have now been provided.</P>
    <P>In April 1992 the school reapplied for a lift, once more outlining the discriminations, safety hazards etc.  In April 1992 a question was tabled in the Dáil to which the Minister replied: &ldquo;The matter is being reviewed and a decision will be conveyed to the school as early as possible&rdquo;. Since then the school authorities have written on several occasions again pleading their case.  The Minister replied that she was looking into alternatives and that it was not the policy of her Department to grant-aid lifts to schools.  This message was once more conveyed to me, in reply to a Dáil question on 11 March 1993.  I wrote again to the Minister on <Col N="1308" /> 19 July, received an acknowledgement dated 29 July, but I have heard nothing further.</P>
    <P>When I visited Saint Joseph's on Friday I saw a 12-year old girl and a 14-year old boy trying to go down the stairs.  On average it takes this young girl 25 minutes per trip while the young boy can manage it in 15 minutes.  On a normal day this girl has to negotiate that stairs on six occasions while on one day per week, when she has a cookery class downstairs, she must negotiate the stairs on eight occasions.  This means that this unfortunate young girl spends three hours and 20 minutes on the stairs.  The boy also has six normal trips in a day but on two days per week he has to attend classes in a central technical institute across the road, which requires an extra four trips for him.  Therefore, on those two days he spends two hours and 30 minutes on the stairs.  Ironically, when he goes to the technical institute there is a lift to take him to the upstairs of that building.</P>
    <P>This young man is quite determined and through his own efforts has progressed from a wheelchair to a walker and now on to crutches.  However, his doctor is most concerned that his progress will be halted due to the strenuous efforts he must make every day in negotiating this stairway.  It is ludicrous that so much time must be spent on the stairs. Even on a wet day the staff must ensure that the stairs is dry for the pupils as they pull themselves up and down on their bottoms.  I have a photograph which I can give to the Minister which shows the situation there.  Previously it had been suggested that alternatives were being looked at.  I had thought of the possibility of a chair lift but having looked at the stairs I am satified it could not accommodate such a chair lift.</P>
    <P>Ministers are worried about creating precedents.  There are not that many special schools in the country and there are even fewer situated on two floors. The problem will not go away when these two children eventually leave the school as there are others downstairs who will soon have the problem.  It is an ongoing one.  Therefore, I implore the Minister to please make the necessary funding available <Col N="1309" /> to provide a lift and end the misery for these children.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kenneally for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>A request was received from the chairman of the board of management in October 1991 regarding grant-aid for the provision of ramps and a service lift to cater for four wheelchair-bound pupils. Following the receipt of a report from my Department's professional advisers on the matter the chairman was informed that a grant would be approved for ramps but not for a service lift.  These ramps have now been satisfactorily provided.</P>
      <P>An appeal was received in April 1992 which focused on the dangers facing physically handicapped children in the event of a fire.  However, it is the case that fire regulations preclude the use of lifts in the event of a fire.  It is the accepted norm to locate or rearrange classes on the ground floor with a view to general safety, easier access and organisational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Apart from the considerations in the event of fire, lifts are not considered essential for schools' facilities for physically or mentally handicapped.  Furthermore they are very expensive in an individual case and prohibitive as a policy.</P>
      <P>The safety of the children is the main consideration in not providing lifts in national schools.  Also it is the policy to make pupils independent and simulate the home situation.  In the event of a power cut or faults in the system children could be standed in the lift for some considerable time which could cause them to panic or put them in a state of distress.</P>
      <P>The special education inspectorate have recommended that alternative renovations in lieu of the provision of a lift be carried out to provide better facilities in that school for the wheelchair bound children.  My Department's professional advisers have been requested to investigate the feasibility of these improvement works including necessary alterations to toilets on both floors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> In view of Deputy Kenneally's interest in this matter I have asked my Department's officials to make every effort to have the necessary works carried out as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now 1 December 1993.  In just over six months time, in June 1994, 20,000 home economics students, 15,000 woodwork students, 15,000 technical graphics students and 15,000 music students will sit their junior certificate examination.  For them it is a big occasion.  The two major examinations, so far as they are concerned, are the two certificate examinations, the junior and leaving certificates.  Here we are approaching the Christmas before the examination and the students and their teachers simply have not a clue where they are going.  It is tantamount to putting somebody in a car and asking them to undertake a journey without telling them where they are going let alone providing them with a road map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers of home economics, woodwork, technical graphics and music were all assured when the junior certificate was launched that they were undertaking an examination, the course for which had been well charted and the examination for which had been well pre-determined. It was new, different, exciting and challenging but they were assured that no stone would be left unturned in terms of providing them with the necessary resources and back-up.  The courses were duly determined and there was also a new and challenging dimension and that is that for the first time there was going to be external assessment of students' performances in certain subjects with a considerable portion of the marks awarded thereto.  The teachers and the pupils undertook the new course with enthusiasm.  However, as time passed, they quite naturally began to inquire as to what system of assessment would be used, what kind of marking scheme would be used for the assessment and what criteria would be adopted in order to determine a student's achievements and competence.  Phone call after phone call, representation after representation, <Col N="1311" /> request after request have failed to elicit from the Department of Education the vital information as to what system will be used.</P>
    <P>Teaching is difficult enough when working to a well charted pre-determined course.  Studying for examinations is likewise difficult but is impossible if you do not know exactly at what you are aiming. To leave totally in the lurch youngsters who are undertaking the first State examination of their lives is unpardonable. The failure of the Department of Education to clarify the criteria and the procedures for external assessment in these four subjects is nothing short of a disgrace. The Department of Education has the manpower, the expertise and the obligation and it still has not delivered.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects.  The NCEA has been very strong in its recommendation that assessment be taken on board by teachers.  Yet, the Department of Education by the manner in which it has handled this whole affair has undermined any semblance of goodwill that is there on the part of teachers and students to assessment procedures.  It has done irreparable damage to what should be a fundamental element in all future examinations and that is the awarding of a certain and hopefully increasing proportion of the marks and points using external objective, assessment procedures. One would have hoped that teachers would have been weaned on external assessment, although the teachers' unions and individual teachers had understandable anxieties in relation to whether school based assessment would work.  Irreparable damage has been done to that process.  The handling of this affair has been so bad that one would be forgiven for thinking it was deliberate.</P>
    <P>There is the additional factor that, in the view of many people, practical subjects, despite their undoubted intrinsic and real value to students, have been treated as the poor relations.  To relegate them to uncertain also-rans in the run up to a crucial examination when students <Col N="1312" /> do not even know how or where marks will be allocated almost seems like a deliberate attempt to relegate these subjects further.</P>
    <P>I am now calling on the Minister for Education to instruct her Department immediately to issue by Friday of this week the official guidelines, absolute clarification and full details to each and every school.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter and I appreciate his concern.</P>
      <P>As pointed out in replies to recent parliamentary questions the introduction of a practical test, incorporating project work, for all homes economics students is under consideration.  However, the Minister for Education expects to be in a position shortly to issue a circular to schools outlining the broad arrangements that will apply in the case of home economics, and also in junior certificate music, for 1994.</P>
      <P>This circular will include information on the timing of the tests and on the options available to schools in arranging for the conduct of the tests.  Further information on the detailed arrangements for the home economics practical tests and on course content will then be sent to schools together with sample examination papers.</P>
      <P>In the case of materials technology the Minister has already made it clear that there will be a project which will test the practical component of the course and which will be completed as part of course work commencing in early 1994.  The Minister expects to issue a circular shortly to schools which will include information on the content of the project, the duration of project work, and on the arrangements to be made by schools to undertake the project.  Sample examination papers will also be issued at that stage.</P>

      <P>Under the designation system, industrial projects in designated areas qualify for a maximum fixed asset grant rate of 60 per cent.  This contrasts with projects in non-designated areas which qualify for a maximum grant rate of 45 per cent.  In addition, industries in designated areas may get a two thirds remission of rates for ten years at the discretion of the local authority. However, the fact of designation does not automatically guarantee support at the maximum rate, nor does it guarantee rates remission.</P>
      <P>The importance and impact of designation in industrial policy has lessened in recent years and a maximum rate of fixed asset grant is seldom given.  The grant level proposed for any project increasingly depends upon the economic benefits in individual projects.  There is also a major shift away from fixed asset grants to supporting other areas of perceived business weakness e.g. marketing, R &amp; D, and management development. Support and grants in these areas are not differentiated on the basis of designation.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report proposed, among other matters, that there should be a decisive shift from grants towards equity and that most of the grant schemes for indigenous industry should be scaled down.  The group felt that most industrial expansions and most assistance by the State agencies involving a grant resulted in an unhealthy dependency mentality on the part of many industrialists.  Furthermore, greater selectivity continues to be pursued by the agencies and is resulting in a reducing cost per job figure.</P>
      <P>The Moriarty Task Force supported the approach of the Culliton Group and, in the document &ldquo;Employment Through Enterprise&rdquo;, the Government endorsed the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of Culliton's comments and the manner in which our industrial policy <Col N="1114" /> has evolved over recent years, I believe that further gains can be achieved through the optimum use of the existing range of industrial supports, rather than seeking to augment this range for particular areas.  I have no proposals, therefore, to designate further areas at this time.</P>

      <P>Any implications for us arising from the British opt out depend on the nature and content of the specific measures which are adopted by the European Union.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has just tabled a Green Paper on Social Policy to be followed in mid-1994 by a White Paper.  That White Paper's specific proposals will set the future direction of the European Union's social policy.  In the meantime &mdash; specifically, at the December European Summit &mdash; the Commission has announced it will propose a White Paper on Employment, Growth and Competitiveness on which it hopes to have a common approach adopted by all Union member states.</P>
      <P>The text of the Green Paper, Commissioner Flynn's comments on it and early indications of the White Paper's contents on employment indicate that there has been close co-operation within the Commission in the drafting of both documents: the employment and competitiveness implications of social policy proposals are matters which the Commission and all member states wish to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the social policy proposals to be formulated in mid-1994 will have to take full account of the common approach to employment, growth and competitiveness which will already have been put in place.  In the unlikely event that <Col N="1115" /> the European Commission failed to do so the member states in Council can be expected themselves to assure this in examining the proposed measures.  Furthermore, the Agreement on Social Policy concluded by 11 member states, including Ireland, has a number of provisions which may be invoked in the event of proposals presenting particular problems. These specifically include proposals seen as having a significant competitiveness implications including, of course, any seen <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act, which applies to all 12 member states of the Union, is expected to continue to provide the legal base as far as possible for Commission proposals in the social field.</P>
    <P>Given the links between the upcoming proposals in the social and wider economic field, the relative timing of likely decisions on these proposals, the concerns, at this time, of all member states to foster employment, the terms of the Agreement on Social Policy and the continued general use of pre-Maastricht legal bases for proposals can be expected to minimise any danger of the kind referred to in the question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the concerns which underline his question are understood and that developments in this area will be kept under close review. I would also refer the Deputy to the Dáil Official Report of 30 April 1992 (col. 2246-2249) wherein this matter was also discussed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be <Col N="1116" /> aware, the Industrial Development Act, 1993, provides for the amalgamation of IDA and Eolas supports to indigenous industry under the new agency Forbairt. The new agency will commence operations at the beginning of 1994.  Its creation will provide for closer integration of the IDA and Eolas grant supports to employment.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1993, also provides for the establishment of Forfás whose primary role is to advise on the development and co-ordination of policy in respect of Forbairt, IDA Ireland and other relevant State bodies, such as FÁS, involved in supporting industry.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 28, 130 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, a new GATT Agreement has not yet been concluded. As a result it is not possible at this stage to state in detail what will be the exact employment impact of such an Agreement.  However, it is possible to say that the overall employment effect, in so far as this country is concerned, would be positive.  The boost to trade from a satisfactory GATT deal will provide new and increased opportunities for our exporters and that is why business and industry in general welcomes a successful outcome in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> As a small open economy exporting over 70 per cent of its production, a stable world trade environment would be of considerable benefit to Ireland.  The conclusion of a global and balanced Uruguay Round Agreement would serve to create such an environment and would give a much needed boost to the world economy generally.  Such an agreement could be anticipated to create opportunities for Irish industry to further develop its export potential.  If these opportunities are grasped, the overall impact on industrial employment in Ireland should be positive.</P>
    <P>It is possible, however, that certain sensitive sectors such as clothing and textiles may experience some job losses.  We are making every effort, therefore, during the negotiation process to ensure that such losses would be kept to the absolute minimum.  Our objective is to ensure that, for these sectors, the liberalisation of trade will be implemented on a phased basis; the GATT rules and disciplines will be strengthened and a satisfactory market access package will be secured.  It is essential for the clothing and textile sectors to restructure and reposition in order to concentrate on the higher quality end of the market.  A number of specific measures have been put in place to facilitate the efforts of these sectors in this regard.</P>
    <P>In general, it could be said that prolonged delay in or failure to conclude a new GATT Agreement can only retard the recovery of international economic activity and the prospects for employment growth.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of actions already taken by the Government to bring about a competitive economy such as the implementation of the Culliton report and most recently the National Plan.  I expect the Small Business Task Force to report shortly.</P>

      <P>The Culliton report highlighted the need for a greater emphasis on the development of indigenous industry and this is reflected in the priority being afforded this sector in the National Plan 1994-1999.  While emphasising that we should, where possible, seek to reduce the cost of attracting mobile industry to Ireland, the Culliton Group also strongly acknowledged the benefits inward investment has brought to the country.</P>
      <P>There are now over 1,000 overseas companies operating in Ireland employing in excess of 90,000 people.  Overseas companies spend over £4.1 billion annually in the Irish economy and create significant downstream employment in supplier and service companies.  Culliton noted that &ldquo;while the main emphasis of our recommendations is on creating the environment and the instruments to enable Irish-managed firms to grow in efficiency and help replace a dependency orientation with enterprise it will be important not to lose the ability to attract foreign firms.  In order to do this Ireland has to pay the &lsquo;going rate&rsquo; in competing with alternative European locations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Given the depth of the worldwide recession, multinational companies across the globe have in recent times been rationalising their operations, resulting in job losses not just in Ireland but in many other countries as well.  Despite the job losses which have occurred here, Ireland has little choice but to pursue a substantial inward investment programme given the significance of overseas firms in the economy and the fact that new initiatives to develop indigenous industry will take some time to bear fruit. This view has been reinforced in the recent NESC Report on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of strategy for the promotion of inward investment under the National Plan 1994-1999 will be to concentrate on the sector and market niches in which Ireland has the greatest competitive <Col N="1122" /> advantage.  The establishment of a separate dedicated agency &mdash; IDA Ireland &mdash; to promote inward investment will ensure this concentrated effort.</P>
    <P>A second pillar of the approach to maximising the benefits on inward investment will be to seek to achieve an increased level of linkages between indigenous and foreign-owned firms.  The role of Forfás in co-ordinating the work of the different agencies will be vital in ensuring this takes place.</P>
    <P>In the Industry Operational Programme 1994-1999, the inward investment sub-programme will comprise a measure targeted at the further integration into the Irish economy of overseas-owned firms already located in Ireland and a measure directed at attracting international mobile investments to generate new job opportunities and to inject new skills and new technologies into the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>A range of sectors will be targeted but pharmaceuticals, healthcare, electronics and software will continue to be the subject of a special focus.</P>

      <P>The latest information available to me indicates that, in absolute terms, Ireland's labour costs in manufacturing are at the lower end of the member states of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hourly manufacturing earnings in national currency terms are expected to increase faster in Ireland in 1993 than among most of our main trading partners. However, this should be offset by the impact of the end-January devaluation and there should be strong competitiveness gains against our main trading <Col N="1123" /> partners other than the United Kingdom.  A loss of labour competitiveness of about 1 per cent is expected against the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The main policy implication of these developments is that it is vital that Ireland remains competitive in its labour costs, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>No definitive published work has yet emerged on the question of the likely employment effects of redistributing the existing burden of employers' PRSI.  A reduction in employers' PRSI would help maintain existing jobs, particularly in the low-paid intensive sectors.  Different views exist as to the level of job creation that would arise from reductions in employers' PRSI.  Estimates from econometric analyses of the demand elasticity of labour in Ireland vary significantly.</P>
      <P>The 1990 report of the Interdepartmental Group on Income Tax/PRSI and the Lower Paid found that a reduction in PRSI relief would lead to a small increase in employment; the group noted the ESRI research at the time which suggested that extra employment resulting from a redistributive measure would be small and confined to the long term.  A study carried out by the ESRI in 1991 concluded that a reduction in employers' PRSI of £300, with no offsetting tax rise, would result in an increase in employment of 13,000 by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its recent report <i>&ldquo;A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment&rdquo;</i> the National Economic and Social Council expressed the view that a restructuring of PRSI can contribute to improve employment performance.  The report <Col N="1124" /> states that the impact on employment of restructuring PRSI could be maximised if the restructuring was focused on achieving greater reductions at lower income levels.</P>
    <P>The experience to date of using PRSI reliefs as an instrument of employment policy has not been as positive as was originally anticipated.  A number of exemption schemes have been introduced in recent years but the uptake by employers has been relatively low.</P>
    <P>While the available literature on this subject is somewhat limited, it is the view of my Department that a reduction in employers' PRSI for the low-paid labour intensive sectors would have a positive impact on job maintenance within those sectors.  An interdepartmental group has been established to carry out an urgent review of the impact of employers' PRSI on low-paid manufacturing employments. This group is expected to complete its report shortly.  I look forward with interest to considering the findings of that report.</P>

      <P>Over the period of the National Development Plan 1994-99, which is the largest investment programme in the history of the State, it is estimated that about 200,000 jobs will be created in industry, services, natural resource sectors and construction.  These jobs are expected to translate into net non-agricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 depending on the level of wage competitiveness improvement achieved and the strength of the growth in the world economy.</P>
      <P>The achievement of high and sustained rates of economic growth is an essential prerequisite for the more effective tackling of our employment problems.  Therefore the first priority is to achieve levels of economic growth which, when associated with appropriate policies to improve its employment content, will facilitate a reduction in the level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Government is pursuing several courses of action in its efforts to encourage a more labour-intensive growth. Government policy is directed at: improving competitiveness and input costs; economic and fiscal strategies that support enterprise, job creation and maintenance; and training and education of workers, including the young and long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 we will have the highest level of economic growth in the European Union at up to 3.5 per cent.  That position should improve further in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in keeping with an improved external trading environment.  Of course, <Col N="1126" /> economic growth is fundamental to the creation of employment and, in that domain, we are doing the best in the European Union.</P>

    <P>In any event, the Deputies can rest assured that the IDA will be monitoring, on an ongoing basis, the impact of NAFTA on US investment here.  With the establishment of a separate agency to promote inward investment and having available to it an incentive package which compares favourably with the best available, I would be confident that we can continue to attract US investment here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>The number of notifications of proposed redundancies notified to my Department in the first nine months of 1993 was 14,049.  This compares with a total of 12,876 for the corresponding period in 1992.  The corresponding figures to end-October are 15,514 and 14,478, an increase of 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The problem of redundancies is one that has to be addressed at a number of levels.  There are macroeconomic issues which impinge on firms' survival and employment levels, such as interest and exchange rates, that are the concern of all members of Government.  At the other end of the scale are issues relating to individual firms, such as good management and internal efficiency, that are exclusively in the hands of those within the firms.</P>
    <P>Turning to my particular area of responsibility, I recognise that, while job losses can occur in any area of economic activity, it is the indigenous industry sector that is most vulnerable.  The National Development Plan 1994-99 recognises that these firms tend to have needs in areas of marketing, technology, skills and finance which represent an obstacle to their development.  Obstacles to development are also threats to the future of existing jobs.  Under the heading of building competitive capability at firm level, support from the indigenous industry sub-programme will not be linked directly to additional output or employment but to increasing the profitability of firms and creating a sound basis for a subsequent extension of capacity.  Firms in traditional product sectors that are losing competitiveness or in decline will be encouraged and assisted in undertaking the adjustment necessary to reposition themselves in more remunerative product and market segments, as a means of reducing job losses.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, at the beginning of August, I established, within my Department, a new Competitiveness and Employment Protection Unit.  A commitment to do this was part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Firms that contact the unit will be given the full support and advice available under the whole range of State programmes for industry and business. The unit will co-ordinate and oversee the provision of such assistance to firms in difficulty.  The unit will not be a means of providing subsidies to firms but every other aid and support that can be offered will be provided.  I have written to all <Col N="1129" /> Deputies and Senators about arrangements for contacting the unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 58, 81 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of motor, employers' and public liability insurance in this country is considerably higher than in competing economies.  The current level of insurance costs in Ireland is a major cost penalty on Irish-based firms.  The premia charged by insurers for motor and liability insurance are determined by the frequency and cost of selling claims which is higher in Ireland than in other European countries.  Ultimately, claims costs are <Col N="1130" /> met by insurance policyholders, that is business and private consumers.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Inter-Ministerial Group on Insurance made a series of proposals aimed at reducing the frequency of motor insurance claims by strengthening road traffic legislation, increasing enforcement of the road traffic laws, and reducing the legal and other costs associated with settling personal injury claims.  Some of these proposals have already been implemented, others are in the course of implementation &mdash; mainly by the Minister for Justice, the Garda and the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Personal injury compensation represented 67 per cent of the cost of motor insurance claims in 1991; almost all the compensation costs in employers' and public liability claims would be for personal injury.  My Department estimates that the cost to business of personal injury compensation is of the order of £300 million per annum.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to assist in the further improvement of the environment for insurance I have recently established an Insurance Reform Unit within the Insurance Division of my Department to consider proposals to reduce the level of personal injury compensation.</P>
    <P>In particular, I am considering a proposal to allow me to have a function in relation to one particular and important aspect of insurance costs &mdash; i.e. the cost of pain and suffering compensation in personal injury claims.  Proposals to reduce such costs would require Government approval.</P>
    <P>From data on 1,600 High Court awards available to my Department, it is estimated that up to 75 per cent of the compensation awarded in personal injury actions is attributed to general damages. Indeed, it has been estimated that the level of general damages in Ireland would need to be reduced by an average of 70 per cent to bring them in line with the average in all other EC states and by 48 per cent to match those in the United Kingdom.  Furthermore, a recent survey by the Irish Brokers' Association of 358 personal injury claims shows that pain <Col N="1131" /> and suffering compensation represented 80 per cent of the compensation paid to claimants.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there should not be recourse to the courts for those personal injury claims which cannot be resolved between the parties involved. But I do think that the reduction of the cost of pain and suffering compensation requires an initiative by the Legislature, particularly if we are to ensure a substantial reduction in the cost and also ensure that the benefits are passed on to insurance policyholders.  I would like to stress that I would not favour proceeding with an initiative unless it can be demonstrated that reductions in claims costs can and will be passed on to insurance consumers.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that it is in the area of small to medium size claims that the substantial bulk of compensation costs arise.  Therefore, it is in this area of small and medium-sized claims that we particularly need as a society to take a choice &mdash; less pain and suffering compensation and lower insurance costs, or retain the present regime of compensation that is higher than in other EC member states and, thus, our current high level of insurance costs.  I would add that I do not have details of the distribution of compensation for personal injuries across social categories.  However, it would seem to me that the adverse impact of our high personal injury compensation levels and the resulting high insurance impacts broadly across all sectors of our society, particularly in terms of employment costs.</P>
    <P>I have not finalised my conclusions as of yet.  But I have commenced a public debate on the very complex issues involved with a view to taking necessary action as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>To my knowledge there are no data within the public sector which would enable me to provide a precise answer to the Deputy.  Furthermore, I am unaware of any relevant material within the private sector which is readily available and which would allow a comprehensive response to the Deputy's question.  Nevertheless, from relevant data which is available, broad conclusions can be reached regarding the returns which manufacturing businesses in Ireland achieve.</P>
      <P>Each year the IDA undertake a survey of Irish manufacturing industry within which data on profits and turnover of manufacturing companies operating in Ireland are analysed.  During the year 1991 this survey for the first time also included data on the return on capital employed of Irish-owned industry.  For the purposes of this exercise capital employed is defined as: shareholders funds plus long term debt.  The survey provides information on profit margins expressed as a percentage of sales before corporation tax for manufacturing industry operating in Ireland.  For 1991, information is available also on the percentage return on capital employed for Irish-owned industry.</P>
      <P>Given that corporation tax is assessed on manufacturing industry at a rate of 10 per cent the percentage profit margins and the return on capital employed percentages can be adjusted to show the approximate after corporation tax positions.</P>
      <P>The data contained in the schedule, which has already been circulated to Deputies and will be included in the Official Report, provide the detail of the response to the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the data relating to year 1991 contained in the schedule referred to, the following broad conclusions can be drawn in regard to the Deputy's question. The average profitability of Irish-owned manufacturing industry is at best modest and not conducive to attracting significant <Col N="1133" /> investment into that sector in general; the profitability of foreign-owned industry is significantly higher; the yield on gilt-edged securities is perhaps one of the more appropriate indicators of a relatively risk-free return for any investment.  Gilt yields during 1991 were generally between 9 per cent and 10 per cent.  Current gross redemption yields on Irish gilt edged securities are approximately 6 per cent, and the latest year <Col N="1134" /> for which figures are available i.e. 1991, show that the percentage returns on capital employed for Irish manufacturing industry, at 7.2 per cent, were not as favourable as the returns achieved on gilt investments.  At the same time, it should be noted that the data contained in the schedule suggests that the financial performance of Irish-owned manufacturing industry over recent years appears to be one of consistent improvement.</P>

    <P>While accepting that the 1991 data must be treated as preliminary it does show significant variations between ROCE and profit as a percentage of sales.  For example, <Col N="1135" /> as a percentage of sales the food sector appears to have a low level of profitability at just over 3 per cent.  However, ROCE at almost 10 per cent suggests a much better performance.  This result occurs because this sector has annual sales approximately three times its capital employed.</P>
    <P>In relation to overseas investment in manufacturing industry in Ireland, the 1990 US Department of Commerce survey on the performance of US overseas manufacturing investment, which was published earlier this year, contains some relevant material as follows:</P>
    <P>Ireland's rate of return, at 29.3 per cent was the highest rate of return on US manufacturing investment in Europe; Ireland's rate of return (29.3 per cent) was almost four times the EC and world average.  France had the second highest return at 11.8 per cent, and Ireland's average rate of return over the period 1982 to 1990 was 25 per cent.  It was the highest in Europe, being more than twice its nearest competitor Portugal (at 10.3 per cent).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>A strike began at the Dublin plant of the company in question in March 1993 arising from the desire of a number of workers to be represented by SIPTU. The matter has been referred to the Labour Court by SIPTU in early 1991 under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  The Court Recommendation, issued in June 1991, was that...&ldquo;the company recognise SIPTU's right to negotiate with it on behalf of its members in the plant...&rdquo;. Labour Court Recommendations issued under section 20 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, are not binding on employers and, in keeping with the voluntary nature of our industrial relations system, are not legally enforceable.</P>
      <P>The company in this case did not accept the Labour Court Recommendation and has continued to negotiate solely with the Works Committee that represents the majority of its overall workforce.  It should be noted that, while the Constitution guarantees freedom of association, this does not impose an obligation on employers to recognise trade unions for negotiating purposes.</P>
      <P>Numerous efforts have been made to resolve the dispute, including efforts by the Conciliation Service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions took place recently <Col N="1139" /> between SIPTU and the Works Committee under the auspices of an independent mediator; but these proved to be inconclusive.  However, I am pleased to note that these talks have now recommenced.</P>
    <P>I would urge all parties to adopt a constructive approach to these discussions with a view to ending the dispute as soon as possible.  I am sure that Deputies will appreciate the need to avoid any comment which could jeopardise the talks process.</P>

This year, almost £270 million will be expended on FÁS programmes, of which about £160 million will come from the Exchequer. This will provide opportunities for about 55,000 people during the year.  The range of programmes available is kept under constant review and, having regard to the resources available, alterations are made as appropriate to meet perceived needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral Question No. 59 and Written Question No. 137 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS operates a number of employment schemes namely the social employment scheme, the community <Col N="1141" /> employment development programme, the enterprise scheme, teamwork and the employment incentive scheme.  Each of these schemes has its own objective and is targeted on a particular category of unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The largest scheme operated by FÁS is the social employment scheme, community employment development programme which is designed to provide part time opportunities for persons who are long term unemployed.  Currently there are around 20,500 persons participating.</P>
    <P>The scheme is kept under review and changes made as necessary.  The scheme as it operates in the disadvantaged areas was adapted last year to provide a training element for participants and to allow retention of secondary benefits by participants. The extension of the revised scheme throughout the country is currently under consideration.  A formal evaluation of the scheme has not been carried out but I am satisfied that the scheme provides worthwhile opportunities for persons who are long term unemployed on projects which are of benefit to the local community.</P>
    <P>Teamwork is a community managed scheme designed to help local voluntary organisations provide temporary community based employment for the mutual benefit of young people and their communities. Around 840 young people are currently participating.  The scheme has not been formally evaluated but its success can be judged from the fact that the demand considerably exceeds the available resources.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme was evaluated by the ESRI in 1989.  Following the evaluation the focus of the scheme was changed to encourage the recruitment by employers of particular categories of unemployed persons.  As such, the scheme has a social rather than economic focus.</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme was also the subject of an ESRI evaluation when it was included in a study on Self Employment and the Unemployed in 1988.  The only change made to the scheme following the evaluation was to provide payment of the enterprise allowance over 40 <Col N="1142" /> rather than 52 weeks so as to give greater assistance at the start up phase of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that all FÁS schemes are kept under ongoing review by my Department and FÁS and will be adapted if and when circumstances demand or allow.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the targets for indigenous industry included in the National Plan 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The policies-measures outlined in the National Plan and the Government's response to the Culliton-Moriarty reports, Employment through Enterprise, are designed to improve the competitiveness of indigenous industry, essential if the export and employment targets are to be achieved.  I would emphasise that these targets are set over a relatively long time-frame and in a period of increased global uncertainty. They assume a continued improvement in Ireland's overall competitiveness across all facets of the economy and an improvement in international markets over current conditions.  For the initial years, based on current economic forecasts, it is likely that targets will only be achieved with difficulty.  The targets are, therefore, set as an average performance over the whole period with individual years possibly varying to a considerable degree.  They assume a substantial improvement in the growth of our international trading partners from 1994 on.</P>
      <P>I am, however, satisfied that policies have been put in place to ensure that the targets are achieved to the maximum extent possible.</P>

The process industries unit of the Health and Safety Authority comprises one supervisory and three operational inspectors whose task it is to monitor and enforce health and safety measures in the chemical industry, with emphasis on the prevention and control of major accidents in that industry.  These resources have been augmented for the purposes of the special review of safety in the chemical industry, which the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, requested the Authority to undertake, by the reassignment from other duties of a further three full-time inspectors and two other inspectors on a part-time basis.  The special review is now underway and the Authority will report its findings to the Minister of State when it has concluded its examination.  The staffing of the Authority is continually kept under review and the question of additional staffing resources will be decided presently in the context of the 1994 Estimates.</P>

It does operate an overseas sponsorship programme whereby Irish people are placed in employment with overseas companies for up to two years.  FÁS funds the outward travel costs for the participants with the employer paying the going rate for the job.  There are currently 28 participants on the programme.</P>
      <P>FÁS also participates in a number of transnational programmes which provide short periods of top up training abroad for trainees on FÁS courses.  The numbers involved would vary from time to time but would not be substantial.  FÁS operates a training support scheme which provides grants to small and medium sized companies to provide training for their employees and on occasion employees are sent abroad by their employers for training.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is my intention in drawing up the operational programmes which will give effect to the National Development Plan to deal with the issue of protecting jobs in sectors where employment decline is predicted. Work on these operational programmes is already underway.  Their detailed content has to be agreed with the EC Commission <Col N="1145" /> and once that is done their content will be announced.  I am not in a position to do that at the moment but will be early in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the problems regarding bureaucratic requirements experienced by business houses, in particular, the procedures, regulations and requirements to avail of grants or benefits in an extension or new start up of business; and his views on whether a one stop shop on a regional basis would assist in overcoming some of these difficulties.</Quest>

      <P>I recognise that a key element in the creation of an environment conducive to enterprise involves reducing to a minimum the level of bureaucracy in so far as it relates to small business start-ups and expansions.  This whole area, including the role of State agencies in the provision and delivery of support services to small business, is among a wide range of issues being examined by the small business task force which I set up in June 1993 in conjunction with my colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce and Technology at my Department.  The task force which is chaired by the Minister of State and is made up of 14 owner-managers of small businesses is expected to report shortly. I can assure the Deputy that any recommendations made by the task force on reducing undue administrative and regulatory burdens on small businesses will be acted on promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such burdens arise not just at national level but at EC level as well.  In this connection my colleague, the Minister of State has recently been actively pursuing with the EC Commission the need for the Commission to examine the burden on very small enterprises in particular, not just of new legislative proposals but of existing Community Directives as well, to see if they unduly hinder the capacity <Col N="1146" /> of such firms to develop and create employment.</P>
    <P>A one stop shop arrangement involving the main industrial development agencies has existed for some years in each of the regions.  These arrangements are now being reviewed in the light of the restructuring of agencies currently taking place in my Department, the establishment of the county enterprise boards and the new regional authorities.  The Task Force on Small Business may also have views on this issue.</P>

      <Quest>the aid received in Ireland under each of the Community Initiatives, PRISMA, EUROFORM, NOW and HORIZON, both in terms of the results achieved and the amounts of money received; if Ireland has not received aid under these initiatives; and if not, the reason therefor.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The four Community initiatives, EUROFORM, NOW, HORIZON and PRISMA between them have been approved for Structural Fund aid of £38.2 million up to the end of 1994. EUROFORM, NOW and HORIZON are human resources community initiatives receiving European Social Fund aid and PRISMA is an infrastructure initiative in receipt of European Regional Development Fund aid.</P>
      <P>All the projects under these initiatives source the matching funding to draw down aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EUROFORM concerns the development of new skills, new qualifications and new employment opportunities on a transnational basis.  Sixty five projects have been approved and they will fully draw down the £10.6 million European Social Funding available.  By the end of June 1993, 6,199 people were receiving training under EUROFORM (1,133 trainers and 5,066 trainees) on projects which are piloting new approaches to training in the area of new skills, new qualifications and new employment <Col N="1147" /> opportunities.  At this stage it is already possible to see results from the EUROFORM initiative.  New qualifications have been approved in a number of cases and the intention is to transfer the training developed to mainline provision after the end of the Euroform funding.</P>
    <P>In other cases, training organisations are working with private companies.  This ensures the development of training relevant to the needs of industry.  However, most projects are at an earlier stage of development and their objectives will be delivered at the end of 1993 or in early 1994.</P>
    <P>NOW aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training on projects also with a transnational dimension.  The total EC contribution under NOW is £4.7 million.  Thirty three projects have been approved for funding, many of which are being implemented by voluntary organisations who would not previously have had access to EC funds.  Many of these projects will not finish until the end of 1994, but some have already been successful in achieving their objectives of piloting new approaches to the training of women.  At the end of the current NOW funding period, 2,122 women will have received training.  A further 6,000 women will benefit from the advice and guidance services provided under the initiative.</P>
    <P>HORIZON provides Structural Funds for innovative projects aimed at assisting the disabled and the disadvantaged.  The programme seeks to facilitate the social and economic integration of its participants into the labour market in particular and society in general. Transnational partnerships are an essential feature of this initiative also and the Structural Fund allocation is £15.5 million. Ninety-four projects are now operative and some will carry on activity until the end of December 1994.  Most of the organisations receiving funding are voluntary or community based.  Already jobs have been created within implementing agencies and as a result of enterprises funded under the programme. <Col N="1148" /> In June 1993, 2,055 people were being trained and over 300 people were receiving work experience or being supported in new enterprises.</P>
    <P>PRISMA is an initiative supporting a range of infrastructural developments in both the public and private sectors and is covering a range of activities.  Twenty projects have been approved and they will fully draw down the £7.4 million European Regional Development Fund funding available up to end 1993.  The projects range from the ESB's development of a pan-European database on public procurement contracts and the modernisation of the Legal Metrology Service at my Department to co-financing the upgrading of several commercial calibration laboratories and the development of a computer aided knitting design classroom.</P>
    <P>The PRISMA Programme is being closely supervised by my Department and its results will be examined in detail in the early months of 1994.</P>

      <P>I have not had formal negotiations with financial institutions on the specific issue raised by the Deputy. However, a number of Government initiatives are currently in train to address the issue of finance for business, including the provision of long term finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> The Minister for Finance is having discussions with the Irish Association of Pension Funds with a view to encouraging increased investment by pension funds in Irish venture and development capital projects.  Arising from these discussions it was agreed that a detailed study should be carried out to assess, among other things, the opportunities for investment in this area.  This study has just been completed.</P>
    <P>Secondly, financial institutions have committed £95 million to a scheme of special loans to assist small, growing businesses. These loans are to be used in conjunction with the county enterprise partnership boards.  The loans do not involve personal guarantees, are available at AA rates of interest and can be flexible with regard to the period of repayment.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the work of the Task Force on Small Business chaired by the Minister responsible for commerce and technology, Deputy Seamus Brennan.  One of the areas the Task Force is examining is the finance requirements of the sector.  The Task Force has met with representatives of the financial institutions to discuss the banking and financial needs of the small business sector.  I look forward to the outcome of the work of the Task Force with interest.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would mention that earlier this year I met with representatives of the four associated banks to discuss business trends and the outlook for the business sector generally in Ireland.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Community <Col N="1153" /> Employment Development Programme (CEDP).  The training element within the CEDP is designed to provide work based development opportunities for participants and supervisors.</P>
      <P>Training within the CEDP happens at two levels.  At level one, training is provided for supervisors through a FÁS Supervisor Development Programme. This programme is designed to enable supervisors to develop a training plan for participants in their project.  Certification is available for the initial group of supervisors by means of an Extra-Mural Diploma in Adult Education from St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.</P>
      <P>At a second level training is provided for participants within projects.  This training is organised by the supervisor in consultation with participants.  Where possible, this permits the individual needs of participants to be met.  The training opportunities provided are therefore locally authorised and cover many areas.  Training is provided in both technical and employment skills by the project.  This training is generally foundation or basic training and comprises on average about 20 days per annum.</P>
      <P>In addition participants are provided with some financial assistance to undertake training and further education in the period when they are not working on the project.  This is an innovative element of the CEDP and preliminary feedback would indicate that it is both popular and successful.</P>
      <P>At present participants on CEDP do not receive certification for all training undertaken.  Some of the training is certified by various bodies and FÁS are currently assessing what percentage has been certified in 1993.  The objective is to progressively ensure in 1994 that all training undertaken is subject to certification.</P>
      <P>The CEDP is a new programme and changes will be made on the basis of the experience to date.  The training element is being delivered in a manner that ensures local control and local consideration of the individual participant's needs.</P>

      <P>Our low inflation of recent years has helped to narrow price differentials between Ireland and our EC partners.</P>
      <P>With regard to prices in general, I should stress that Government policy aims at the development of competition throughout the economy and encouraging further consumer awareness of prices.  In this regard, the Competition Act, 1991 sets down the legal framework which is necessary to protect the market and to promote the principles of free and fair competition in which the market operates.  Consumers also have a particular role here and should be sensitive to the range of prices on offer and purchase accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1993 provides for the creation of three new autonomous bodies &mdash; Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland. Each body has a distinct mission and goals.  However, all three agencies will operate within a framework which facilitates co-operation and mutual support.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1993 was enacted on 6 July 1993.  Subsequent to the passing of the legislation, I established interim boards for the new bodies to begin to consider the various policy and logistical issues which need to be finalised before the new bodies can be formally established.  These boards are operating in parallel with the existing IDA Authority and board and with the board of Eolas, thus ensuring that the needs of industry are fully addressed during the transitional period.  In due course I intend that the interim boards will become the boards of the new bodies.</P>
      <P>The Chief Executive Designate of IDA Ireland has now been nominated and an acting chief executive has been put in place for Forfás.  The selection process for the Chief Executive of Forbairt is progressing.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of the three bodies has been circulated to the relevant agency personnel, boards members and trade union representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be fully aware of the priority I attach to the establishment of the new bodies.  However, I am equally conscious of the multitude of issues which must be addressed in order to ensure that the new bodies start off on the right foot and are fully equipped to function effectively <Col N="1156" /> from day one.  My Department is currently working closely with IDA and Eolas to identify the issues and put in place the detailed arrangements leading up to formal establishment.</P>
    <P>Any cutting of corners in the restructuring process would do a profound disservice to the new bodies, their staff and, indeed, the whole process of industrial development.  At the same time I have sought to ensure that the transitional period between the passing of the Act and the Establishment Day could be utilised to productively take stock of the wider issues facing the new organisations and to examine the strategic options for their development.  This is precisely what the interim boards have been doing.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the constructive and dedicated efforts of the interim boards and the detailed planning process involving IDA, Eolas and my Department will allow Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland to commence operations at the beginning of 1994.</P>

All county enterprise boards have met and are in the process of drawing up the area plans.  I am at present considering questions relating to the formal establishment of the boards, probably as companies limited by guarantee.  Legislation in this regard is not foreseen.</P>

      <P>The dealings of small businesses with the Revenue Commissioners exceed those with any other Government agency in their volume, frequency, and importance.  It would be surprising consequently if difficulties were not encountered in some cases.  Those difficulties differ in their substance and in their seriousness.  There are also other small businesses that experience few if any problems in their relations with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Task <Col N="1159" /> Force on Small Business is currently examining all major issues of concern to small business.  It is expected to submit its report early in the New Year.  Any recommendations it may make to reduce the administrative burden on small business or to improve the procedures and practices of Government Departments in dealing with small business will be fully and promptly considered.</P>
    <P>Outside the State sector, the most critical relationship for small businesses is generally that with their bank or financial institution.  The Task Force will also have observations or recommendations to make on this issue.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I met with the heads of the Associated Banks.  At that meeting it was decided, in the interests of all sections of the business sector, to establish a standing liaison group comprising senior representatives of my Department and the banks.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this group is to provide a forum in which significant matters of common interest or concern can be discussed, among them, where appropriate, the needs and problems of small business.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 109 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that both questions relate to the provisions of the public sector transfer scheme, under which employees may transfer service for pension purposes from one member organisation to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that participation in the transfer scheme is voluntary &mdash; public sector organisations are not under any statutory obligation to join the scheme. In the case of Aer Lingus, the company decided to become a member of the scheme with effect from 1 June 1973.  As <Col N="1161" /> a result of that decision, the company is obliged to reckon all prior pensionable service in the case of employees who left other member organisations, including the Civil Service and the Defence Forces, on or after that date and subsequently joined Aer Lingus.  As a member of the scheme, Aer Lingus could also, on a purely voluntary basis, agree to reckon prior service in the case of company employees who left other member organisations prior to 1 June 1973.  In the event, Aer Lingus decided that it would exercise this voluntary option in respect of certain other member organisations on or after 1 September 1968.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken by Aer Lingus are entirely consistent with the provisions of the transfer scheme, and the company is not in breach of any statutory directive in this matter.  Although Aer Lingus could &mdash; if it so wished &mdash; adopt a more flexible approach, and reckon the prior service of employees who left other member organisations prior to 1 September 1968, the scheme does not empower me to compel the company to adopt such an approach.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners and by tax practitioners, both through their representative bodies and in the course of Revenue seminars, that there has been a late surge of additional interest in the incentive amnesty.  This was causing considerable difficulty for professionals in dealing with such a large number of potential applicants before the deadline of 30 November. For this reason, strict adherence to the date set in the legislation may have militated against the outcome of the incentive amnesty.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government yesterday decided to extend the deadline for the making of the confidential declarations to the chief special collector to Tuesday, 21 December 1993.  Provision for the extended deadline will be made, to apply retrospectively, in next year's Finance Bill.  This provision provides an additional three full weeks for practitioners to process applications.  It also gives those who may not have fully appreciated the serious consequences of passing up this opportunity to get their tax affairs in order, a reasonable further period in which to fulfil the requirements.</P>
      <P>Under the confidentiality arrangements which apply to the incentive amnesty scheme I may obtain only certain information and this only in the form of aggregates.  In these circumstances it is not possible to provide estimates at this stage of the number of participants or of the overall yield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a research paper published last year¹ the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, examined the effect of a unilateral adoption in Ireland of a carbon energy tax of $10 per barrel of oil equivalent imposed for a ten year period to the year 2000.</P>
      <P>They estimated that, if the proceeds were applied in full to reducing PRSI contributions, by the year 2000 consumer prices would be slightly higher than otherwise but gross wages would be lower &mdash; on the basis that the reductions in PRSI would have a beneficial effect on wage determination.  In consequence GNP would be almost 0.5 per cent higher and total employment 0.75 per cent higher than otherwise.</P>
      <P>In principle, I would agree with the thrust of the findings, given the assumptions stated by the ESRI.  Clearly, any reduction in the cost of labour would be expected to result in increased employment. However, a number of qualifications arise with respect to applying the ESRI's analysis to current proposals about a carbon energy tax:</P>
      <P> (a) The tax which has been proposed by the EC Commission would apply initially at $3 per barrel, rising by annual increments of $1 to $10 per barrel by the year 2000.  As the proposed tax increase is less than that tested by the institute, its impact would be correspondingly smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) A key element in the Commission's proposal is that the tax would <Col N="1165" /> not be adopted unless similar measures were taken by other OECD countries. The ESRI's analysis was based on unilateral adoption by Ireland.  If the tax were to be adopted by the EC while other countries did not take equivalent measures there is a risk that the EC economy could be weakened.  Any such weakening would have negative implications for Ireland, not reflected in the ESRI study, in view of our dependence on EC export markets.</P>
    <P>(c) Consideration of proposals for energy taxes must have regard to sector specific implications, which the ESRI study, of its very nature, could not take into account. </P>
    <P>Finally, I would re-emphasise the significance of the institute's assumption that the tax would be applied to a reduction of PRSI contributions.  In the model used by the institute, this is a key factor in reducing labour costs and, hence, in promoting employment.</P>

      <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme provides a financial cushion for people in receipt of unemployment payments and lone parent's allowance who take up self-employment or paid employment in indigenous industries or in the voluntary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who participate in the scheme receive 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare entitlement, including adult and child dependant allowances, for the first year of payment and 50 per cent for the second year.  They also retain access to a range of secondary benefits such as for example fuel allowance, butter vouchers, <Col N="1166" /> back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the Christmas Bonus.</P>
    <P>Persons must be over 23 years of age to participate in the scheme.  It is open to certain recipients of either unemployment assistance or lone parent's allowance.  In the case of the former, they must be in receipt of unemployment assistance for at least 12 months at a rate more than £40 a week, if single, or £62 a week, if married.</P>
    <P>It is believed that a significant proportion of those in receipt of unemployment assistance or lone parent's allowance would satisfy the eligibility criteria.  However, detailed statistics on the number of people who are eligible to participate in the scheme are not available on a county basis.</P>

Some details are still outstanding for the 1991-92 tax year and further inquiries are being made.</P>

    <P>However, following a review of her case it has been established that the person concerned is entitled to &ldquo;pre-entry&rdquo; credited contributions and on this basis she is entitled to unemployment benefit without reference to her insurance record in France.  She has been awarded unemployment benefit of £55.60 per week.  She is also entitled to arrears of £435.80, in respect of periods of unemployment since January 1993 and <Col N="1167" /> after deduction of £318 supplementary welfare allowance paid by the South Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I would be concerned that the introduction of compulsory employers' liability insurance might increase the cost of insurance to business and thus further increase the insurance cost penalty on employment retention and creation.  This cost penalty already exceeds £400 million annually in respect of motor and employers' and public liability insurance.</P>
      <P>I understand that many employers' already maintain employers' liability cover.  My statutory responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure, through prudential supervision of authorised insurers, that moneys are available to meet claims arising from such as employers' liability insurance.</P>
      <P>Also, given the current adverse underwriting situation with regard to liability insurance I am not satisfied that employers' liability insurance would be readily available on a viable basis to all employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employers' liability insurance market in the United Kingdom is significantly different from the Irish market, particularly because the cost of personal injury compensation and consequently <Col N="1172" /> the cost of employers' liability insurance is substantially less than in this country.</P>
    <P>In a sense a balance may need to be drawn between the need for self-sustaining and increased employment and the improvement of working conditions. Perhaps, therefore, employee protection in terms of payment of compensation for accidents at work may be best discussed, initially at least, within employer/employee negotiation arrangements.</P>
    <P>It has not been demonstrated that any problems which arise in the area of the non-payment of successful personal injury claims for accidents at work in Ireland can necessarily, or best, be resolved by the introduction of compulsory employers' liability insurance.</P>

      <P>No decision has been taken formally to dissolve the Western County Development Teams.  However, primary responsibility for their functions in relation to the general promotion of economic development at county level, and in relation to the administration of grant schemes for small business, is in the process of transfer to the County Enterprise Boards in the relevant counties. As regards application forms for assistance from the County Enterprise Fund, my Department will be contacting County Enterprise Officers shortly with general guidance on application procedures. The imposition of a formal common application form is not considered appropriate at this stage.  I would emphasise, however, that the County Enterprise Fund is open for applications. Promoters of small business projects who wish to be considered for grant assistance from the Fund should contact their <Col N="1173" /> County Enterprise Officer, who is now in a position to submit qualified applications for consideration to the County Enterprise Board.</P>

      <P>I believe that successful entrepreneurs have a role to play in assisting persons who wish to start up in business and I am informed that the IDA and SFADCo have a scheme in operation for some time for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The scheme is known as the Mentor Programme which has been in operation since 1989.  It is designed to provide advice and support to existing and start-up companies on matters such as general management, strategic planning, financial structuring, marketing and distribution. The Programme embraces all industrial sectors ranging from food and electronics to printing and clothing so entrepreneurs from all sectoral divisions are needed.</P>
      <P>The mentors themselves are retired or semi-retired business people who volunteer their experience and expertise for the benefit of small start-up enterprises. There are three mentor panels.  These concentrate on start-ups, quality and marketing issues.  The role of the mentors is to listen and advise, to help identify problems and suggest solutions.</P>
      <P>Since commencement, the Programme has proved very successful with the 700 manufacturing or internationally traded companies which it has assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary focus of the County Enterprise Boards initiative, which is currently being put in place, will be on proposals for start up jobs in enterprise, including projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services area with a potential for employing up to ten people. In the setting up and development of <Col N="1174" /> these fledgling enterprises, the need will be greater than ever for entrepreneurs who are willing to be generous with their time, advice, expertise and experience. It is intended therefore that a Mentor Programme on the lines of that currently operated by IDA and SFADCo will form part of the support services provided by the Boards.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to whether the Connacht/Ulster Regional Sheep Dipping Committee at its meeting on 19 October 1993, passed the resolution that the Connacht/Ulster (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan) Sheep Dipping Committee request the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that no change be made regarding the compulsory dipping of sheep under the Disease of Animal Acts, 1966, and the Sheep Dipping Orders 1965 to 1993, in view of the importance of the export of live sheep and also in view of the fact that 75 per cent of the sheep population comes from within these counties; and his views on the matter.</Quest>

In cases where there are changes, original 25&rdquo; maps will be required in 1994 only in respect of the new areas.

      <P>I propose to <Col N="1185" /> take Questions Nos. 155, to 157 inclusive together as they refer to the same case. The reason two animals, which were presented as suckler cows at an inspection on 6 October 1992 in the herd of the person named, were rejected as uncalved heifers is that the two inspecting officers concurred in the opinion that the two animals were uncalved heifers.  The reason the person named was not informed at the time was because of his hostile attitude to the inspecting officers. The reason a second inspection was not carried out when it became apparent that there was a discrepancy between the inspecting officers' findings and the description of the animals in a report on a herd test was that the animals were very carefully inspected on 6 October 1992 and the two inspecting officers were satisfied their findings were correct.  A second inspection therefore was not seen as being necessary.</P>
      <P>The person named had a meeting with two officials from my Department in the district livestock office in Roscommon on 13 November 1992.  At that meeting he was requested to submit proof that the two animals, rejected by the inspecting officers as uncalved heifers and which he claimed were cows, had calved by the date of application.  He was also asked to provide proof that he had, at the date of application, the 20 suckler cows on which he claimed cattle headage and suckler cow grants.  He was informed that on receipt of satisfactory evidence the question of paying grants could be considered but to date he has not submitted satisfactory evidence.</P>
      <P>Since the person named has not produced the documentary evidence requested his case cannot be advanced further.  In the absence of the documentary evidence requested I am not convinced that an independent inquiry would serve any useful purpose.</P>

In this particular case no record of the number of the three-in-one vaccination was made available to the expert medical group and a copy of the expert medical group's file has been sent to the mother of the person concerned.</P>
