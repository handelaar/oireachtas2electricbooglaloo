      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 in order to consider the continuing deadlock in Dublin Bus. There have been no Labour Court hearings, no negotiations and no Government initiatives.  As we approach the start of the third week, the dispute threatens to disrupt business in the city, those doing school examinations and the holiday weekend.  Another week will pass before this House will get another opportunity to consider this issue.</P>

It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Second Stage of No. 2 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon and the remaining Stages, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health; (2) business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today, and (3) the Dáil at its rising today shall adjourn until 12 noon on Wednesday, 9 June 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the Dáil will debate the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 2 after Question Time, or is it intended that if the Second Stage debate continues up to 4.45 p.m. that there will be no time for the Committee and remaining Stages?</P>

      <P>If we leave it until after Question time to take Committee and remaining Stages, that will mean we will have not much more than 45 minutes to discuss the amendments tabled to the Bill.  My party has tabled two amendments which we are anxious to have discussed and 45 minutes is not adequate to debate those amendments.  While we support the Bill in principle there are some provisions that need improvement. I suggest that we agree to finish the Second Stage debate at 1.30 p.m.</P>

As a general principle it is not usual to accept all Stages of a Bill on one day.

Some weeks ago we had extended statements in this House on the situation in Aer Lingus and we were promised a speedy report from Mr. Bernie Cahill.

    <Title>Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1993: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on the Health (Family Planning) Amendment, Bill, 1992 during the Dáil debates in July of last year I set out what I considered to be the two main elements for an effective programme to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus. These were proper and non-moralistic programmes of education directed at the various sections of the community and legislation which would remove the restrictions on the purchasing of condoms.</P>
      <P>In regard to the former, last week, I launched a new AIDS media campaign which deals in a clear, unambiguous fashion with the role of the condom in preventing HIV.  This campaign is directed at all sexually active people and will be complimented by further measures aimed at various groups within the community such as drug abusers.</P>
      <P>On the legislation, I stated during the debates last year that we should have a Bill that is in keeping with the times and does not seek to be a throwback to a time long forgotten.  The Bill which is now before the House is clear in its content and its intent.  It provides for greater access to condoms at a time when there is clear evidence that they are an effective barrier against the spread of HIV.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased, therefore, to bring legislation before the House which demonstrates both my commitment and that of the Government to rationalise family planning legislation initially in so far as this is required for public health reasons but ultimately in regard to all family planning issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to look at the broader issue of family planning as part of an overall strategy for health which is currently <Col N="1727" /> being developed in the Department and which will guide and direct the Department's work over the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>In the context of public health protection, I would like to remind the House of the necessity for the Bill in tackling the problems of HIV/AIDS, and, indeed, other diseases which are sexually transmitted.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we have an increasing number of persons who are testing positive for HIV.  To date, a total of 1,368 persons have tested positive and it is accepted that this figure understates the true situation.  I hope, by several of the initiatives I have taken, to broaden the scope of testing still, of course, on an anonymous basis to have a more accurate picture in the immediate future.  We extended the HIV surveillance programme in October 1992 to include the analysis of blood, on an anonymous, unlinked basis, which is taken at ante-natal clinics for routine clinical purposes and which is surplus to requirements.  We propose to extend the programme, on a phased basis, to include blood taken at STD clinics and hospital in-patients and out-patients, in an effort to develop as comprehensive a picture as possible for the prevalence and spread of the infection in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our current data base indicates that the infection is largely present in certain groups of the population &mdash; IV drug users, homosexuals, haemophiliacs and to a lesser extent, in heterosexuals.  In the latter, there is a steady presence of new HIV positive cases.</P>
    <P>Our efforts, therefore, have to concentrate, to a great extent, on preventing those who are not infected from becoming so, and to ensure that those who have contracted the virus do not transmit it to others.</P>
    <P>People generally are now aware that the main routes of transmission are (i) through sexual intercourse and (ii) through sharing needles while abusing intravenous drugs.  Even though they are aware of these facts many, nonetheless, continue to put themselves at risk of <Col N="1728" /> exposure to the virus.  We must encourage these people to behave in ways which will reduce or eliminate this risk.  We know that the surest way of avoiding sexually transmitted HIV infection is by being faithful to one person who is also faithful to you, assuming that neither person has shared needles while injecting drugs.</P>
    <P>However, there are sexually active people who do not adhere to these guidelines for behaviour and they must be encouraged to behave responsibly.  Our national AIDS strategy, therefore has a strong emphasis on primary and secondary prevention.  Our primary prevention programmes are designed to prevent persons from becoming infected in the fist place and education and information are key components in a HIV/AIDS primary prevention programme. So too is easy access to condoms.</P>
    <P>Our secondary prevention programmes are aimed at preventing the transmission from an infected person to persons who are not infected and this is implemented through risk-reduction service, such as Outreach, methadone availability, needle-exchange, condoms and counselling.</P>
    <P>In programmes to prevent HIV, and other sexually transmissible diseases, it is recognised and accepted that a good quality condom, properly used, is the most effective prophylactic against these diseases.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, that people are aware of the role of condoms as an effective prophylactic and, recognising that people are sexually active from an early age, they should have reasonable access to condoms.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to provide for improved access to condoms, as a necessary and practical response to the evolving HIV/AIDS problem here.  The Bill implements the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, which called for the supply of condoms, through vending machines.  It also brings us into line with public mores and thinking in Ireland and with the situation in other EC member <Col N="1729" /> states where condoms are supplied through vending machines.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the amendment of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, which is the Principal Act, and for the amendment of the Health (Family Planning) Amendment Act 1992, as follows: (i) the removal of controls for the supply of condoms, (ii) the exclusion of condoms from the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo;, and (iii) the provision of enabling powers to the Minister for Health to regulate the location of vending machines for condoms and to prescribe standards for condoms.  I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill to remove the licencing requirements to import and manufacture other contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines &ldquo;contraceptive sheath&rdquo; to include condoms for men and women.  Deputies will recall that the position under the legislation of the female condom was raised during the Dáil debates last year.  I have included the female condom in the definition of contraceptive sheath under section 2 to ensure that it is also excluded from the legal controls.</P>
    <P>Section 2, therefore, amends the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; to exclude condoms, thereby removing the controls over the sale and supply of condoms altogether. The consequences for the 1992 Act of amendment to section 2 are as follows.  As a result of the exclusion of condoms from the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; under section 2, I am proposing, in section 8, to repeal sections 5 and 6 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992.  These are necessary and consequential on the proposed new definition.  The effect of this will be to remove the controls in section 5 of the 1992 Act which prohibited the sale or supply of condoms to persons aged under 17 years or from certain outlets, such as vending machines, mobile outlets or street vendors.  It will also remove the controls contained in section 6 of the Act relating to the age limit of 17 years of persons to whom condoms could be supplied for resale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> I consider the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; and the consequent removal of the controls over condoms arising from this and the repeal of section 5 of the 1992 Act as being extremely important developments, not alone in the fight against HIV/AIDS but also towards ensuring that the State is now retreating from unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of its citizens.</P>
    <P>In the context of HIV/AIDS, these proposed amendments and repeals are fundamental and essential.  The attempts in the 1992 Act to liberalise the availability of condoms have simply transferred their supply from one type of supervised sale to another type of supervised sale.  This did not result in a realistic, practical or effective approach to HIV prevention.  It is reasonable to assume, however, that the supply of condoms through vending machines will provide that degree of privacy to encourage sexually active persons who require the protection of condoms to avail of them and thus protect themselves and their partners from exposure to disease and infection.</P>
    <P>The Government was mindful, however, of the possible adverse consequences of removing the controls contained in the 1992 Act and has decided to include in the Bill, a provision in section 3 which would enable the Minister for Health, if it was deemed necessary, to prohibit by regulations the sale of condoms in places which could be considered to be inappropriate and a provision in section 4 which would enable the Minister to prescribe, by regulations, standards for condoms.</P>
    <P>Section 3 might be required in the event of a proliferation of vending machines in, for example, places where very young persons congregate or in certain locations in main streets.  The expectation is, however that the removal of the controls in section 5 of the 1992 Act will lead to the location of such machines in appropriate internal locations to the extent that inappropriate internal or external locations may not arise.  I expect, therefore, that it may not be necessary to bring in any regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> Section 3 (3) provides that a person who contravenes this section will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides an enabling power to the Minister for Health to prescribe standards for condoms.  This provision is necessary to safeguard against the supply of condoms which are inferior and do not meet recognised international standards.</P>
    <P>The European Committee for Standardisation has drafted standards for latex rubber male condoms.  It is expected that the draft standards will be finalised and adopted later this year as a European standard.  The European standard will then become our national standard.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I propose to recognise, in regulations, a recognised standard of an EC member state or condoms of an equivalent standard.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the section provides that a person may not sell or supply contraceptive sheaths which do not comply with the standards set.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that a person who contravenes subsection (2) will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for technical amendments to the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>It provides for the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with section 3 (3) of the Principal Act&rdquo; in section 4 (1) paragraph (b) (i) (iv) of the Act of 1992. This is necessary as section 3 of the 1979 Act was repealed by the Act of 1992.  I am sorry to be so convuluted but it is difficult to follow a series of amendments to Bills that relate to previous legislation and, indeed, to a Principal Act.  I hope that the clarity of the legislation will be followed by all in the House.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for the amendment of paragraph (c) of section 4 (1) of the Act of 1992.  This is consequential on the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the Principal Act under section 8 of the Bill.  I will refer to section 8 later.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Act of 1992 sets out the list of persons who may sell contraceptives. That section provides in general terms, that contraceptives may be sold by the following categories of people, pharmacists, registered medical <Col N="1732" /> practitioners, employees of health boards, family planning services and employees of hospitals.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1992 Act also provides for the sale of contraceptives by a licenced importer or manufacturer to the persons which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is designed also to remove the licencing requirements to import and manufacture contraceptives, other than condoms, by repealing sections 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act.  As a result, paragraph (c) of section 4 (1) of the 1992 Act requires to be amended to delete the references to sections 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act, but at the same time ensure that importers, distributors or manufacturers of contraceptives can sell contraceptives to the persons listed in section 4 (1) of the 1992 Act, whom I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the making of regulations in relation to any matter referred to as being specified or prescribed by regulations.  This is a standard provision in legislation.</P>
    <P>The sections of this Bill which refer to regulations are: section 3 regarding controls on the location of vending machines and section 4 regarding standards for condoms.</P>
    <P>Section 7 specifies the penalties for offences committed under the Bill when enacted.  The sections to which it applies are section 3 for contravening regulations on the location of vending machines, and section 4 for contravening regulations on the standards for contraceptive sheaths.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, section 8 will repeal the current requirements that imports and manufacturers of contraceptives, other than condoms, should be licenced, through the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the 1979 Act.  The EC Commission has expressed its unhappiness at the existence of these controls in the context of the completion of the EC Internal Market.  I am pleased this Bill will remove those restrictions.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned earlier that section 8 of the Bill proposes the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) gives the short title of the Act and is a standard provision.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) provides that the Health <Col N="1733" /> (Family Planning) Acts, 1979 and 1992 and this Act may be cited together and will be construed together.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the enactment of this Bill will bring to a conclusion the longrunning saga of legislation relating to the control of condoms in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Irish society has moved a long way from the era of &ldquo;Irish solutions to Irish problems&rdquo; and the all party support which I have received following the publication of this Bill is a sign of the maturity of the Members of this House. We have moved in a period of 14 years from the restrictive 1979 Act with its emphasis on &ldquo;bona fide family planning&rdquo;, through the 1985 Act which restricted the sale of condoms to registered outlets, through the 1992 Act which failed to recognise the requirements of an effective AIDS prevention programme to the present enlightened Bill.  I look forward to the contributions of Members to this debate.</P>
    <P>I hope I have explained the Bill in sufficient detail and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I wish to state our support for this measure and wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House and on to the Statute Book.  However speedy a passage I might wish for this legislation, I would like to record my total dissatisfaction at the manner in which the Bill is being treated in this House.  It was explained in the House earlier by my party's chief whip that because of the extension of time given to the Finance Bill the consideration of this Bill would have to be somewhat limited.  It is bordering on the outrageous that Opposition spokespersons should be required to submit amendments to legislation in 24 hours before the legislation is introduced by the Minister.  It makes a joke of many of the Opposition's contributions.  It is an indication of the manner in which successive Governments &mdash; and I do not blame the Minister in this regard &mdash; have treated the contributions of Opposition Deputies within the Chamber.  There should be a time lapse of at least 48 hours <Col N="1734" /> between the conclusion of the Minister's Second Stage speech and a consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage. However, there is little we can do about it and I welcome the Minister's initiative in introducing this Bill.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of this Bill has had a turbulent history spanning over 20 years which generated heated debate of a type rarely seen in this House and aroused passions throughout society resulting in unfortunate and consequent bitterness and divisiveness.  It is most regrettable that the matters contained in this Bill were not addressed last year by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration. Indeed, if amendments in the name of Fine Gael and Deputy Howlin had been adopted by the then Government we would not as a Legislature be discussing condoms in the House in June 1993.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this initiative which brings our family planning legislation somewhat closer to current thinking in society as well as addressing the far more important public health issues involved.  By dealing directly with matters expressly opposed last year by the then Minister, we are enacting legislation reflecting the majority view of Members in this House. The ban on vending machines and the imposition of an age limit by former Health Minister, Dr. O'Connell, was an absolute nonsense.  The thinking in certain circles was so removed from reality that one could be forgiven for believing that sexual activity was confined to a 40-hour five-day week among people of a certain age.  Under the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992 birthdays were given the added status of a licence for sexual activity.  It is surprising that the present legislation has not been challenged as to its constitutionality on the basis that it unduly interferes with the right of married couples under the age of 17 to have access to the purchase of condoms.  In this regard it is worth recalling the words of Judge Brian Walsh in the McGee case 23 years ago when he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> It is outside the authority of the State to endeavour to intrude into the privacy of the husband and wife relationship for the sake of imposing a code of private morality upon a married couple which they do not desire.</P>
    <P>He further stated:</P>
    <P>The right to the use of contraceptives by married couples cannot be frustrated by the State taking measures to ensure that the exercise of that right is rendered impossible.</P>
    <P>The present restrictions being placed on married couples under the age of 17 would be found to be beyond the powers of the State.  It is surprising that no action was taken within the last 12 months on the matter.  Of course, such action is rendered unnecessary by the Minister's Bill this morning.</P>
    <P>In the existing legislation consideration was not given to the fact that many shops close at weekends and at night thus denying access for those who may be interested in the purchase of a condom. Outside our major cities access to condoms was severely restricted, in that many licensed outlets refused to retail condoms while others hid them away in a corner, almost embarrassed to display them.  The vending machine will remedy the access deficit.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a recently reported incident in a provincial town where a licensed vintner, in anticipation of the Minister's legislation, installed a condom vending machine after Christmas.  Being the law abiding citizen that he was, he did not furnish the machine with condoms. While preparing the machine in advance of the Minister's legislation he found, to his amazement, the sum of £70 lodged in the machine.  The point worth bearing in mind is the embarrassment and furtiveness on the part of people wishing to purchase a condom.  That licensed vintner did not receive one complaint from any member of the public or any consumers on his premises and no one asked for a return of their money.  In the light of this example, we must examine the <Col N="1736" /> manner in which we as a society regard the condom.  The anonymity in using the vending machine is welcome.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world sexual activity should be carefully planned but unfortunately we do not nor will we ever live in an ideal world.  Up to now the restricted availability of condoms added to a view that they were in some way unsafe or dangerous.  By curbing the sale of condoms we contributed to unsafe sexual behaviour.  Machines are important not only in broadening access but in preserving anonymity and minimising any embarrassment for those purchasing condoms. The age restriction was even more ludicrous.  Young people can under existing legislation marry, work, obtain full driving licenses and drive cars, serve prison sentences, purchase cigarettes, even, in some circumstances, obtain a licence for a shotgun and yet they cannot buy a condom.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dwelt at some length on the matter of HIV and AIDS.  This Bill, as he said, is basically an anti-AIDS measure and this is welcome.  Sadly however, it speaks volumes for our society that it has taken the killer disease AIDS to highlight the need for an increased use of condoms throughout society.</P>
    <P>AIDS is a problem that we underestimate at our peril.  Those testing positive for HIV are increasing in numbers as are deaths from AIDs.  There are far more people HIV positive than the officially recorded statistics reflect.  It is now known that the period of incubation &mdash; prior to the manifestation of any symptoms &mdash; may be ten or 12 years.  It is likely that much infection took place in the late seventies and early to mid eighties.  Since prior to 1985 no reliable HIV testing procedure existed, many new AIDS cases are being discovered. The fight against AIDS must be close to the top of the Minister's agenda.  The Department of Health AIDS publication clearly states that, besides celibacy or a life long monogomous commitment, for sexually active people who are not in one faithful partner relationships a good quality new condom, correctly used, is <Col N="1737" /> the single most effective defence against HIV infection.  This does not mean that condoms will rid us of the AIDS crisis. Neither does it mean that every condom all of the time guarantees 100 per cent that the virus will not be transmitted. It does mean, however, that for many people who are sexually active condoms offer a method of protection of life saving proportions.</P>
    <P>The number of AIDS cases is rising each year and will, unfortunately, continue to do so for the foreseeable future. There are no medical means available to prevent the spread of the virus.  Neither is there any cure for the disease.  The provision, therefore, of sound information and good education is of critical importance in curtailing the spread of the condition.  Major risk categories in respect of the AIDS virus are not the same throughout Europe.  In the UK and Germany, for example, the homosexual community form the largest at risk group while in Ireland, Italy and Spain intravenous drug abusers are top.  In common however with all our European neighbours the incidence of the disease is rising among the heterosexual community.  In the six years to 1992 heterosexual cases have risen from 6.5 per cent to 10 per cent of the overall while over the same period in Ireland the increase has been from zero to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>AIDS is no longer the concern of any one group within society; it is a concern of us all.  There is no danger if persons or their sexual partners do not engage in high risk sexual behaviour or use shared needles or syringes to inject illegal drugs into the body.  Those who engage in high risk sexual behaviour or who shoot drugs are risking infection with the virus and are risking not only their own lives but those of others including unborn children. The most certain way to avoid infection and to control the spread of AIDS is for individuals to avoid promiscuous sexual practices, to maintain mutually faithful monogamous sexual relationships and to avoid injecting illicit drugs.  The real world and the frailty of human nature, however, means that avoidance is aspirational and as legislators <Col N="1738" /> we must accept reality as it is.  Our responsibility is to act in the public good and in a society where people engage in high risk sexual behaviour we must offer a measure of protection by way of education and information.  We cannot, as has often been stated in the Oireachtas, legislate for morality.  We cannot set ourselves up as a chamber of morals but we must legislate for reality.</P>
    <P>Much has been said on the matter of condoms and AIDS.  There can be no doubt that the overwhelming evidence suggests that use of a condom is of extreme importance in curtailing the spread of HIV.  It is however interesting to note that many opponents of the condom in the drive against AIDS are those groups who oppose the use of condoms in any event.  I recently heard a member of Family Solidarity argue that condom failure actually contributes to the spread of AIDS.  It is extraordinary however that this line should be spun by a group opposed to all forms of contraception from a perspective that has nothing to do with AIDS.  I would venture to say that groups such as the one mentioned are using the AIDS issue to peddle their propaganda.  This type of scaremongering is of little help in the fight against HIV.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to regulations concerning the quality and standards of the condoms that will be more widely available under the legislation.  This is a matter that should be reverted to in the course of Committee Stage.  I note that the Minister has power to require standards and it is the monitoring and policing of this power that is of importance.  The Minister said he hopes to imprint on Irish regulations the European standard.  That reminds me of a story told about the purchaser of a condom, not in this jurisdiction because it was purchased from a machine.  On his purchase the person questioned the occupier of the premises as to the British standard stamped on the condom, asking &ldquo;What does this standard mean?&rdquo;.  The owner of the premises responded that it was British Standard 1234, to which the purchaser replied, &ldquo;We must remember <Col N="1739" /> that the <i>Titanic</i> also conformed with the British standards of the day&rdquo;.  We must ensure a proper system of monitoring and policing in this area so that all retail outlets conform with whatever standards apply, be they Irish or European.  There should be provision for appropriate penalties in the event of non-compliance with the standards.</P>
    <P>The location of vending machines, as dealt with under section 3, requires reflection.  The Minister has stated &mdash; not in the House &mdash; that he does not envisage the location of vending machines in schools.  It is important that machines are not placed in locations where easy access would be available to young people or where the availability of condoms might act as an allurement to young people towards sexual activity.</P>
    <P>Location should be restricted to places where only adults frequent, such as public houses, discos, night clubs and so on.  Again, this matter can be reverted to on Committee Stage.  What standards will the Minister employ to ensure substandard products are not peddled?  It has been said that condoms stored in machines for a long time lose quality and are more likely to fail by virtue of storage. These claims are without foundation as no supporting evidence has been produced to show that distribution by way of vending machine diminishes the quality or strength of the condom.  I am sure the Minister will take expert advice on this matter and will allay my fears before the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <P>Evidence however does suggest that condom failure is more likely to occur from ignorance or misuse than from poor quality and this is a matter that must be addressed.  The World Health Organisation, the Paris Centre for AIDS Research and governments all over the world agree that condoms when used properly can and do prevent the spread of disease.  I quote from Dr. James Walsh, former Irish AIDS co-ordinator:</P>
    <P>There is no argument on this one; all the data and research in Western Europe indicates that the condom is <Col N="1740" /> more than 90 per cent effective in preventing the spread of disease. Everyone agrees that HIV is lethal if contracted but it is not in itself a particularly infectious agent.  The condom therefore is a most effective barrier. Condoms represent an important health protection for those who remain sexually active.  Those who do not use a condom may be exposed to 100 per cent risk.  Condoms in effect are a vital weapon in the battle against AIDS.  It can in effect be a matter of life and death.</P>
    <P>As well as the issue of AIDS, the greater availibility of condoms will hopefully lead to a decline in the number of unwanted pregnancies in this State.  The tragedy of thousands of women seeking abortion abroad every year and figures showing one birth in five to single mothers should be sufficient to prompt positive action in this regard.  A recent survey of 2,000 leaving certificate students in Munster revealed that one in four had engaged in sexual intercourse. Teenage pregnancies continue to rise here and studies of teenage pregnancies show that 855 were unplanned and most had not even considered contraceptives.</P>
    <P>By liberalising our condom laws we are as a Legislature recognising the changing pattern of sexual behaviour in recent times.  It is a fact that young people are more sexually active than ever before and our response must be more than to make condoms more widely available.  I regret that successive Governments have failed in their duty to inaugurate a programme of education seeking to promote a clear appreciation of responsible sexual behaviour. It is an indisputable fact that there is a direct link between teenage pregnancies and a lack of education in the area of sex and relationships.  Teenage pregnancy rates vary directly in inverse ratio to the provision of sex education in our schools.  It is regrettable that we do not have in our schools an adequate programme of lifeskills and sex education.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will consult with his colleague, the Minister for Education, on this matter.  It is of fundamental importance that we set in place a comprehensive <Col N="1741" /> health education programme in schools, with the aim of promoting an understanding of responsible sexual behaviour.  This process should commence in primary school by way of lifeskills and should be properly part of the school curriculum thereafter until the completion of secondary school course.  I ask the Minister, before the conclusion of this debate, to give specific commitments in this regard.  I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with the matter.  Our negative attitude towards sex is fostered by a refusal to include proper sex education in our schools.</P>
    <P>I am surprised and disappointed the Minister did not avail of the opportunity in this Bill to address the lack of a comprehensive family planning service in the State.  Last year the then Minister, Dr. John O'Connell, burdened himself with the task of &ldquo;securing the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services&rdquo;, a rather convoluted task.  The insertion in legislation of phraseology such as that is most unhelpful.  Success in the last 12 months in regard to the former Minister's initiative has been very limited. The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women dealt at some length with this matter.  Perhaps the Minister will address these concerns in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Family planning throughout much of the country is limited, haphazard and unsatisfactory rather than comprehensive. Sterilisation services vary greatly throughout the country.  A uniform service in this regard is required.  In many areas sterilisation is assessed on the basis of moral, theological or philosophical grounds rather than on a medical basis.</P>
    <P>The report examined the practice in our maternity hospitals and found that the scheme of family planning services is less than uniform.  Some hospitals have family planning clinics.  Others provide information only in respect of natural family planning.  Others have little or no information process of any description. We need a full family planning service as part of post-maternity care.  The recommendations <Col N="1742" /> contained in the report will be referred to by my able colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Many people of differing political persuasions and differing religious persuasions passionately oppose all forms of contraception.  The sincerity of these views in most cases cannot be called into question and must at all times be respected.  Many people in our society campaign against the use of condoms and speak against the use of contraception at every opportunity.  It is their right to do so.  These people may use every opportunity to dissuade people, particularly our young people, from using condoms, but the line must be drawn at seeking to impose one's moral view on our fellow citizens.  In the matter of private morality, the State has no role and must remain on the fence.  Justice must be based on the concept of equality and respect for the belief of all people, not only those of a majority persuasion.  Tolerance and respect are the cornerstones of a genuine pluralist, just and equitable society.  The repeal of the offensive sections of the 1992 Act are very welcome in this regard, and the new proposals outlined this morning by the Minister are fully supported by Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am happy to welcome it on my own behalf and on behalf of my party.  It represents another sequel to the long and tortuous road in the availability of contraceptives by legislation and jurisprudence which touches on the vast area of public policy which has evolved with regard to female reproduction and contraception.  It is strange that the impetus which drives this legislation is not a loosening up of the law restricting access to reproductive freedom for women, but part of a comprehensive and very welcome anti-AIDS initiative.  I am tempted to indulge in irony, and the only reason condoms are being liberated from the law with regard to family planning restrictions is not to allow reproductive freedom to women but to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS.  I will not labour the point as I <Col N="1743" /> am genuinely delighted in any context to welcome this legislation.  I wonder if this legislation would be going through unopposed if it were not for the threat of HIV and AIDS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  It has taken 25 years of lobbying and legislation, long periods of inaction, Supreme Court decisions and Private Members' Bills by former Senator Mary Robinson, now our esteemed President, to liberalise contraceptives. This issue has dodged politicians since the seventies.  The issue has divided parties.  Former Deputy Liam Cosgrave, as Taoiseach, voted against his Minister's legislation in 1974 and our Ceann Comhairle had a political difficulty with the Labour Party at one time.</P>
      <P>For years, the pill had been prescribed as a cycle regulator.  Only this year this lie has been undone by the welcome availability of oral contraceptives to GMS patients as contraceptives.  All contraceptives should be available free to GMS patients.  The slow gestation of public policy around reproductive freedom goes on and much has still to be achieved.  Tubal litigation is still only available in a very restricted way in public hospitals for medical reasons rather than on the free choice of a woman who does not wish to have any more children. Indeed, the right of women not to have children has never been conceded yet in this State.  One of the first frontiers of the women's movement was the right to have true reproductive freedom for women. The battle goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is motivated solely to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS.  I applaud the Minister for dealing with this public health issue in a forthright way. The growing problems of HIV and AIDS needed strong, effective, courageous action from the Minister and he has risen to that challenge.  Nothing happens by chance in politics, especially when <Col N="1744" /> moving towards the liberalisation of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the National AIDS Strategy Team who have done excellent work over the last few years.  I note also that the Minister has been strong in his response in dealing with the campaign to halt the spread of HIV and AIDS in confronting head on the opposition to the advertising campaign by the conservative mandarins in RTE.  The Catholic Church, through the Bishops, have restated their traditional opposition to the campaign. That is to be expected and they have a right to put it on record in terms of their brief in this world.  Our brief is to deal with public health and not spirituality.</P>
    <P>The freer availability of condoms is only one part of the comprehensive approach which is appropriate and desirable in the fight against the spread of HIV and AIDS.  The other major aspect, which the Minister has taken on board, is the educational response.  The television advertising campaign is a major part of that.  The educational response in terms of targeted messages being sent to high risk sectors is important.  We need to get this right and ongoing evaluation and consultation with specialists such as AIDSWISE and Dr. Kevin McKeon of the Merchant's Quay Project, and the GPs who run the STD clinics throughout the country is needed.  It is essential to develop a truly informed educational response based on feedback from the front line.</P>
    <P>We have a very high level of infection associated with HIV drug users in Dublin in particular.  A recent report stated that over half of the Dublin hard drug population is HIV positive.  That estimate was much higher than the Department of Health estimate but it was endorsed by the Irish College of Practitioners.  The high incidence of the virus among IV users accounts for the abnormally high incidence in hetrosexual men and women who become infected with the virus.  The departmental emphasis has been influenced by this fact and there may be a fear that the national policy is being determined by a Dublin perspective which may not be necessarily true for the rest of <Col N="1745" /> the country.  Ongoing evaluation of the campaign is in order.</P>
    <P>The STD clinic in Cork, which covers Cork and Kerry, report a much greater incidence of infection of homosexual men rather than drug users.  Likewise, smaller urban centres in Limerick, Galway and Waterford where there is not a very large hard drug abuse culture as there is in Dublin, reports similar figures.  The tendency so far in this excellent campaign has been to try to influence the whole community and not to target specific categories of particularly high risk people. This may have to change as we learn more and evaluate current campaigns.</P>
    <P>The task force set up by the Department of Health has mainly been influenced by the Dublin experience.  Walkin clinics and needle exchange, while appropriate for Dublin needs, may not be so appropriate outside Dublin.  Targeting of schools and sexually active adolescents is the way forward to kill the myth particularly among the very young people that this disease affects &ldquo;30 somethings&rdquo; and has no relevance for them.  That message must be got across, especially to sexually active adolescents.  There needs to be an audit of the quality of the educational response nationwide.  It should not be allowed to be an <i>ad hoc</i> response dependent on individual teachers and schools. For example, a health board may write to a school inquiring whether they have a type of HIV/AIDS module included in their curriculum.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that there be some standardisation, that the real issues be focussed on and confronted in the case of young people, such as how to use a condom; when to put it on.  It must deal also with negotiation skills on the part of couples.  This is particularly important for young girls who may very well need to adopt an assertive role in sexual relations.  It must be pointed out that girls are in a double jeopardy in all of this, being subjected to the original risk of becoming pregnant and also to the secondary risk of being susceptible to HIV and AIDS infection.</P>
    <P>The positive increase in the number <Col N="1746" /> of births mentioned earlier, among girls outside marriage between the ages of 15 and 24 is quite astonishing.  Indeed, we, as a society and in this House, have been remiss in addressing that pheonomenon, by allowing it merely to happen and throwing welfare at it.  That is not appropriate in the case of a phenomenon which is reshaping our society in such a major way, placing a huge burden on our welfare services, housing and so on.  There is not yet in place a specific targeted response to that issue which I shall return to it at another time.</P>
    <P>Child pregnancy must be brought to the top of the political agenda.  I predict that, if we do not address it, we shall be banking up a huge sociological problem in the future which will only fester and worsen.  The statistics in this respect are frightening in that one in every five births is to single women, mostly those aged between 15 and 24.  We should remember that many of these girls are condemning themselves unwittingly to a life of poverty their children to inevitable disadvantage, particularly if they come from urban areas already heavily disadvantaged. There is a limited benefit to be had from treating the problem by throwing welfare at it.  The wisdom of girls giving birth on their own &mdash; in some cases exchanging their dolls for babies, enjoying the whole notion of having buggies provided by the State &mdash; must be challenged by public policy sooner rather than later.  I was glad to note that the Minister is interested in this issue and I hope we shall return to it at a later date.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning the startling phenomenon which has emanated from the Merchant's Quay project report, that many of the partners of HIV drug users are willing to have children.  There is a desire there to procreate, another tragedy emanating from an existing one which also needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>On the quality of condoms, as with all consumer products, a condom must be suitable for the purpose for which it was bought.  It must be of BSI standard, which is internationally recognised as appropriate, and the highest and, indeed, the only standard we, as public policy <Col N="1747" /> makers, should promote.  I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the European standard which should be adhered to also.  We should be aspiring to the highest possible standard.</P>
    <P>Since the purpose and impetus of this Bill is the prevention of the spread of HIV and AIDS &mdash; of which we must keep reminding ourselves &mdash; the preventive product must be particularly robust and stand up to wearers' demands.  In other words, the condoms promoted in this campaign must be of good quality.  They serve a dual purpose, first to prevent pregnancy and, second, to prevent the virus from entering the body fluids of the sexual participants.</P>
    <P>The main brands of condoms are lubricated. The lubrication is a spermicide which, in the event of failure of the condom, can kill the virus and also deactivate the sperm.  This vital ingredient is called Nonoxynol 9.  I believe that the Durex company has introduced a hypoallergic lubricated condom called Sensitol to respond to those who are allergic to Nonoxynol 9.  However, the lubricant in Sensitol is an effective spermicide for contraceptive purposes but does not appear to kill the HIV virus.  That issue must be discussed since the distinction to be drawn in the efficiencies of the spermicides used in lubricants are very important, not to mention the added risk of wearing a non-lubricated condom in the case of homosexual men if it is the case that Nonoxynol 9 is a vital ingredient.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I agree with him, that previously the response of the State to HIV and AIDS has been coy.  I have no wish to go into the intimacies of homosexual acts here for fear, God forbid, we might tempt opposition to this Bill, but I do not think we can be coy. Nonetheless, I hope I will not offend anybody by the hardy spirit of my approach.  Indeed, a hardy spirit is a vital ingredient in politics, especially in regard to the issue of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has acknowledged, many of the condoms at present available are not up to standard.  This deficiency <Col N="1748" /> must be tackled if we are to be comprehensive in our approach to this campaign. For example, I have heard that some of the condoms available from some illegal vending machines at present are substandard.  That is not good enough.  Vending machines must be available in places frequented by women; their traditional placement being in gents' toilets.  They should be available in women's toilets also since women have a double incentive in gaining access to the best possible product, and must be vigilant in their choice of protection.  I agree that there should be a regulatory process to inspect the quality of condoms available on the market and their availability through clinics.  Will the Minister advise us as to the quality monitoring envisaged under the Bill; everybody is extremely interested in that matter.</P>
    <P>I note that there have been some noises from traditionalists that condoms are not effective in the fight againt the spread of HIV and AIDS.  If I can keep the language simple and non-medical, their claim is that the micron of the virus is smaller than the micron of the condom. That is true but the virus exists only in a molecule of water, not on its own, so that the molecule of water embracing the virus is actually bigger than the micron in the condom.  That would appear to put an end to that piece of scare-mongering. Nonetheless, I should like the Minister's assurance on that micron issue.  Indeed, the advancement of that argument &mdash; to knock the wisdom of the use of condoms as an efficient method against the spread of HIV and AIDS &mdash; is very feeble, but must be answered.  Dr. Jim Walsh said that hypocrisy would lead to a greater spread of HIV and AIDS than any faulty condom.  Therefore, we must confront these issues head-on, answering the scientific and technological argument advanced against their good usage.  We must remember that condoms were the original and best prophylactic and, as far as I can ascertain, are the best we can promote in this campaign.</P>
    <P>A further argument advanced by the traditionalist is that greater availability of condoms contributes to and actually <Col N="1749" /> promotes promiscuity.  That is a hoary old chestnut, like the notion that umbrellas bring rain.  We are all fairly new to this research material on AIDS but the international community has undertaken a wide body of research into people's behavioural responses, particularly for campaigns such as this.  For example, a recent report to an international AIDS conference, based on a very scientifically researched three-year programme in Switzerland, had some interesting findings on this matter of relating availability of condoms to sexual behavioural changes and safe sex practices.  The findings of that report showed that the liberal availability of condoms, which is part of this campaign, does not encourage young people to be more sexually active than they would be normally, it does not induce more sexual partners.  Rather the findings showed that it encouraged those already sexually active to use condoms and safer sex practices.  After the campaign, among adolescents, there was an increase of 17 per cent in the number of girls who adopted safer sex practices and 13 per cent among boys.  It will clearly be seen that international experience disproves that argument, even if it needed disproving, which I do not think is the case.</P>
    <P>Most young people here are sexually active from as early as age 13.  While that may be unwise, undesirable and horrific to us as parents to accept, nonetheless it happens.  Our public health responsibility places a duty on us to respond to real life, rather than to the sort of Brigadoon or aspirational 30s' dream of de Valera's Ireland.  We must respond to circumstances prevailing in today's Ireland. The Bill removes the age limit which is a welcome step.</P>
    <P>Sex and condoms should go together like a horse and carriage &mdash; I was going to say like love and marriage but I will avoid the moral debate about marriage. The issue of morality is only relevant in the period prior to sexual activity and does not apply in respect of the act itself. Whether one should use a condom or another contraceptive is a public health issue and I have no problem with the issue of morality which centres around <Col N="1750" /> the relationship and a person's individual freedom to enter into relationships.</P>
    <P>It is honest and worthy to note the vast contribution which has been made in combating the spread of HIV and AIDS by non-governmental agencies in the field.  Groups such as AIDSWISE, AIDS Alliance, the Merchant's Quay Project, Condomsense, individual GPs and many other voluntary agencies throughout the country have set the agenda which has been taken up admirably by the Minister and by his predecessor to a limited degree.</P>
    <P>In particular, I commend AIDSWISE as I have a special interest in the educational response which is its territory.  It is a small educational effort which I hope will be resourced as part of the promised educational response aspect of this campaign. With very meagre resources, both financial and human, and often driven by purity of commitment to health they have undertaken important work in the cause of public health and the related rights of gay men.  Almost all of their work has been funded from DG V in Luxembourg. In all they have received £94,000 from Europe.  Last year they received a total of £5,000 from the Department of Health but they have received nothing this year although they submitted an application last September for funding.</P>
    <P>They are compiling a European AIDS directory and in the autumn they intend to provide grief bereavement training for health professionals working the field of HIV and AIDS and a peer educational training programme for young adolescents in Ballymun.  Along with many other non-governmental agencies, they have to be congratulated for playing their part.  I know that the Minister has risen to the challenge but those people have set the agenda.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I warmly welcome the Bill which has my full support.  It is a pity that it is being rushed through in one day since I am sure in a healthy Committee Stage debate we could tease out some of the matters I have raised in my contribution on which others would like to dwell.  This matter will not go away but there are people waiting in the long grass <Col N="1751" /> for us, as legislators.  This is significant legislation and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I would like to commence by saying what it will not do.  It will not put an end to the spread of AIDS or the number of teenage pregnancies.  It is not a licence for promiscuity, either heterosexual or homosexual.  Neither is it an undue restriction on human sexuality, either heterosexual or homosexual.  It is a Bill which provides for greater access to condoms which have been available for some time.  Although legal, under certain restrictions, many outlets do not stock them because of the personal beliefs held by shop owners.  Three years ago a survey carried out in my home town of Bray showed that about 50 per cent of chemists did not stock condoms.</P>
      <P>We need to be specific in acknowledging the limits of this Bill.  When it comes to AIDS and HIV false information or over reliance on obvious solutions are dangerous; they can endanger people's lives.  We must be clear and unequivocal about the effect the Bill will have.</P>
      <P>The availability of condoms is only one part of the prevention strategy which needs to be put in place to combat the spread of AIDS.  As Dr. Joe Barry said recently at the IMO conference: &ldquo;Once the condom machines are in place the debate should move swiftly to education because that, not condoms, is the real issue&ldquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Condoms however, are the matter of today's business and education forms part of this in relation to advising people about condoms.  People do not automatically know how to use a condom; this is not knowledge they can absorb in their mother's milk.  When people are ignorant, condoms fail; condom failure is mainly due to incorrect use rather than to a flaw in the material it is made from. This matter is not referred to in the Bill. There is no reference to the need to educate people in the use of condoms.  I suggest to the Minister that he accept the <Col N="1752" /> amendment which will be put forward by Democratic Left in this regard.</P>
    <P>Providing unrestricted access to condoms is the least that can be done.  We need to be more aware of the myriad conditions which define their use.  This is particularly important in the context of education in the use of condoms as a possible barrier to HIV and AIDS.  It should be openly acknowledged that the condom will change sexual practice not just because of its presence as a barrier but because it introduces the idea of negotiation to sexual relationships. Things cannot go on as they are &mdash; it needs to be stated openly and honestly that condom use will change the context of sexual relationships.  It is not a question of adding condom use to the store of existing practices.</P>
    <P>If this is to be effective, access to the market cannot be limited.  The expectation that by leaving it to individual shop keepers, pub owners and disco owners somehow everybody will be catered for is false; that is not the way of the world and access does not guarantee that those whose behaviour puts them at risk will start to use condoms because one will be able to buy them over the counter more easily.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a serious attempt to encourage the use of condoms it will be necessary to make them available free to medical card holders.  In Britain pilot projects are already in place where doctors provide condoms free to anyone who wants them.  So far no assessment has been made of the efficacy of the projects but it would be a good model to examine closely.  At this stage it would be foolish to ignore the usefulness of such an approach.  Again, I will be tabling an amendment which I hope the Minister will consider seriously.  Targeting risky behaviour should be much easier if this facility is provided in the medical and social services and through them to the risk groups.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting shift in the Bill which is worth noting.  The condom, or the contraceptive sheath as it is described, is being taken off the list of contraceptives.  Its use as something <Col N="1753" /> other than a contraceptive is being recognised. This gets rid of the knotty moral question which has dogged the debate about contraception for so long. However, this shift should be reflected in the way manufacturing companies market their products.  Condoms are generally marketed as contraceptives whereas they should also be marketed as health promoters.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the power to set standards in relation to condoms.  This is an important element of the Bill.  I was glad to hear that European standards will apply in the case of male condoms but I would ask the Minister to specify the standards which will apply in respect of the female condom.  The evidence shows that condoms with the certified British standard mark can be declared safe for contraceptive purposes; the co-called &ldquo;fun&rdquo; condoms do not provide the same protection but standards may well have to be reassessed once HIV protection is taken into account.  For example, if condoms are viewed solely as contraceptives gay men will see them as having no application to their behaviour.</P>
    <P>Once condoms are viewed as health promoters the need to use different criteria will arise.  Condoms for use in anal intercourse need to be stronger and of a higher quality.  At the moment there is no way of knowing if condoms are of sufficiently high quality to match the use to which gay men put them.  Setting standards in manufacturing should also include the setting of goals in relation to advertising the product and promoting its health aspects.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertising I must express certain reservations about the current television advertising campaign.  I have no argument against the idea of a television campaign but it may not be possible to justify the amount of money spent on it.  In Britain the frightening advertisments used did not have any effect and it is obvious that that is not the way to proceed.  I felt that the designer approach adopted in those advertisements, which were rather bland and middle aged, did not have an impact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> There may be better ways of using this costly process to get the message across to people.  If television does not get the message across there may be other ways of doing this.</P>
    <P>One criticism which has been made of the advertisement is that it does not sufficiently target the relevant groups. In this context there is a much wider problem which needs to be mentioned and which was not given the importance it should have been given.  It is clear that targeting is a crucial factor in the fight against AIDS.  We need to target young people, drug abusers, gay men and men who have sex with gay men but who, for understandable reasons, for example, discrimination or legal reasons, may not regard themselves as gay.  It is important that HIV/AIDS is not inherently associated with the margnalised &mdash; the gay plague or a junkie's disease.  The targeting of the advertisement should not marginalise people; rather it should reach people whose behaviour may be putting them at risk.  This is a distinction which needs to be made.  The professionals working in the field are very sensitive to this difference.</P>
    <P>I note that the Department of Health does not provide a gender breakdown of people with HIV-AIDS.  It should be useful to have figures on the number of women affected by this disease as opposed to the number of men, as specific services may need to be geared towards women.  Targeting applies equally to prostitutes of both sexes.  It is something of a myth that the greatest threat of AIDS to heterosexual men is posed by prostitutes. It seems that the opposite may actually be true.  Women who regard sex as a commodity are more likely to insist that their partners take precautions. However, it should be pointed out that there may be pressure by clients not to use condoms even though it may put them at tremendous risk.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the provision of condoms in our prisons. While no research has been carried out on the level of sexual activity in our prisons, research in other countries shows a significant level of such activity in <Col N="1755" /> prisons.  The availability of condoms in prisons might offend some people but given the high rate of HIV among some prisoners, the provision of condoms might save lives and protect those at risk. I was very impressed when I visited the Outreach satellite unit in Amiens Street. The principle behind those units is very sound.  This kind of approach meets the needs of people who may have difficulty in coming forward to the traditional medical or social services.  I was very impressed by the level of care and attention being given by this unit to these people.</P>
    <P>This raises two questions about the future of satellite units.  First, the areas of high deprivation and poverty in Dublin city where these units are primarily located are also the areas in which considerable illegal drug dealing is carried out.  If a similar level of illegal drug dealing &mdash; in some areas this drug dealing is quite open &mdash; was carried out in places such as Foxrock and Castleknock, I have no doubt that there would be a far swifter response by the Garda and the State.  It seems that there is an acceptable level of drug peddling when it comes to our poorer, more marginalised communities. This ambivalence needs to be challenged. We need to be ruthless when it comes to the perpetrators of drug use while at the same time being compassionate to its victims. Second, the satellite units need to be expanded.  The AIDS-HIV infection is not solely a Dublin problem.  The problem in Cork city requires urgent attention. The profile of AIDS-HIV infection is different in Cork city but it is still of worrying proportions.  The disease is largely sexually transmitted in Cork city. The Outreach programme is capable of taking on that factor and dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The overall profile in Ireland shows a significantly high number of drug users who are either HIV positive or have AIDS.  In December 1992, 243 out of the 308 cases of AIDS were from the categories of drug users and gay men.  We should not over-dramatise the extent of the problem.  Of the 12 EC counties we have the second lowest rate of AIDS, <Col N="1756" /> next only to Greece, and the rate of the increase is less than previously estimated. The failure of the actual rate to match the projected rate is a phenomenon that has appeared in many countries.  We need to be absolutely accurate in terms of any information given out about AIDS.  If the problem is over-dramatised people will not believe the information being given out and if it is under-estimated it will not be treated as seriously as it should be. The reality is that HIV and AIDS are on the increase.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy, as described in the most recent Eastern Health Board report, is based on prevention, care and management, AIDS-HIV surveillance and anti-discrimination. Another heading which should be included in that list is education. At present within the formal education system schools can opt in or opt out of any AIDS and sex education programmes. This is not good enough any longer; such an approach does not meet modern needs.  The Green Paper on Education refers to the preparation of a plan by each school.  Sex education and AIDS education could be easily slotted in as a matter of course in that plan.  The Department of Education has never faced up to this aspect of education.  It has run away from this aspect and left it to schools, boards of management and principal teachers.  The Department has never given leadership in this area.  It is time this matter was challenged and the Department finally faced up to its responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The Outreach programme is vital in getting to groups whose behaviour may put them at risk &mdash; gay groups, drug users, prostitutes, etc.  During the period 1991-92 HIV growth showed an increase of 67 in the number of intravenous drug users; an increase of seven in the number of children at risk; an increase of 44 in the number of homosexuals and an increase of 37 in the number of heterosexuals, risk unspecified.  There was a noticeable growth of HIV in the heterosexual community during the year.  It would be useful to know more about that community, the characteristics of these <Col N="1757" /> heterosexuals, if we are to target them within the general population.  It is probably harder to target that group than any other group.  We need to have more basic information about their characteristics.</P>
    <P>When it comes to targeting, it is clearly the matter of judgment and knowledge upon which to base that judgment.  Too wide a focus and the purpose is lost; too narrow a focus and vital omissions are made.  In order to get the focus right we require research, resources and resourcefulness. It has taken ten years for a Bill which will make condoms widely accessible to be brought before the Dáil, ten years during which we have know about AIDS and its implications.  We have been slow to fully realise the dangers of AIDS. It is important that we do not over-estimate the problem or underestimate the strategy required to combat it.  I agree with the approach being adopted not to make this a notifiable disease.  Driving the issue of HIV - AIDS underground has its own dangers and obviously we need to prevent this happening.  Research carried out in England shows that less than 50 per cent of HIV infected patients inform their GPs that they have the disease.  The figure in Ireland is higher.  In the context of the relationship between the doctor and patient, it is important that we are able to extract information in a way which is acceptable to the patient and feasible for the doctor.  At present many notifiable diseases are not notified.  Thrush is a notifiable disease but I do not imagine many doctors go to the trouble of advising the health boards about the number of cases of thrush they deal with.</P>
    <P>Truth is paramount if people are to take the killer disease seriously.  We do not need any inflated claims as to the efficiency of this Bill or the role of condoms in the fight against this disease. Neither do we need any diminution in the long haul that lies ahead with regard to AIDS, nor scaremongering about the extent of AIDS, which is still a relatively rare disease, particularly among homosexuals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  My party, Democratic Left, supports it and we are glad to have the opportunity to discuss it.  We <Col N="1758" /> have reservations about access to condoms and the crude approach that presumes that because condoms are for sale everybody has access to them.  One needs to take into account that many people simply have not the resources or the knowledge to acquire condoms for themselves. A much more subtle approach would be to avail of the health boards and the services general practitioners provide for medical card holders to draw people into thinking about prevention and to ensuring that the entire population, who are at risk, are covered.  That will cost money and I am not arguing that point. It should not be a question of having money in your pocket that determines whether you are at lesser risk of getting AIDS.</P>
    <P>I will be suggesting amendments to improve the Bill.  At the end of the day I am conscious that, while the Bill removes limitations, it will have only a limited role to play in the much larger battle against AIDS and HIV infection.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome this Bill.  This has been part of Labour policy for a long time.  As chairman of the party I am very pleased to have this opportunity to say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister for bringing it before the House so quickly.  This is a good day not only for democracy in this House but in the country at large.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the provisions of the Bill will ensure there is greater access to condoms in our society. As Deputy McManus pointed out, many chemist shops are squeamish about stocking condoms.  That is a pity.  As both Deputies McManus and O'Donnell pointed out, this measure will not stop AIDS or bring unwanted pregnancies to an end; but it should be said that it will be a positive help.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus was somewhat critical of the television advertising campaign but it must be remembered that this is the first attempt to make our society aware of the dangers of AIDS.  In that context both the Minister for Health and his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, should be congratulated.  While the advertisements are not perfect and will not win an Oscar award, they make an honest and direct effort to inform our people of the scourge of AIDS.  That is a good thing.  Those people, the young and not so young, who took part in this advertisement deserve to be congratulated for their courage. They have faced this problem in a very direct way.  I am sure the advertisements will be improved with the passage of time.</P>

    <P>I was one of the founding officers of the Limerick Family Planning Association some 18 years ago.  I invited officers from the Irish Family Planning Association to a meeting in the Royal George <Col N="1760" /> Hotel in Limerick and from that meeting the Limerick Family Planning Association was set up and the first family planning clinic was established in the teeth of very strong opposition, some of which came from members of Deputy O'Donnell's party.  One of the strongest opponents was Deputy O'Malley.  He spoke out against encouraging fornication and promiscuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  He has experienced a conversion.  Perhaps his wife and family have played a part in his change of heart and I am very pleased to hear him speak this morning on this issue. If he can change his mind on that fundamental point, there is hope for Irish politics.  I did not think I would live to see the day when a measure such as this would come before the House and be totally supported by all parties.  I did not think I would live that long.  Now that realism on this issue has at last reached the floor of this House, there is hope for Irish politics.  I could write a book about my experiences in the Limerick Family Planning Clinic.  A canon from Kilfinnane, County Limerick, condemned me from the pulpit and in his newsletter to his parishioners.  He called the women who entered the family planning clinic &ldquo;Kemmy's femies&rdquo;, which was a very good phrase.  I bear him no bitterness. We live in a democratic society and people are entitled to voice their opinion. When I look back at those times it is with sadness rather than anger that so much misinformation and well intentioned advice was misdirected.  I will not labour that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I have experience of working as a volunteer in the clinic over a number of years I can echo some of the points made by Deputies O'Donnell and McManus.  Both Deputies have to be complimented on the forthright way they expressed their views, because for all too long the floor was left to the men.  This issue has convulsed Irish political parties in the past and caused distress to individuals and parties.  I am delighted that <Col N="1761" /> this Bill is totally unopposed and has been warmly welcomed by all parties.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa, a country with many problems, including AIDS.  I would hate to see the pain and suffering that has been caused by AIDS spreading to other countries.  It is a cruel thing that one sexual act can cost a life.  I was alarmed to read a report in a Sunday newspaper that a female prostitute has AIDS.  I do not know if this has been confirmed by the medical authorities in the Eastern Health Board, but if it is true it has serious consequences for our society.  I think the Minister is obliged to check on this reported case because a sexually active prostitute with AIDS is a time bomb which will go off constantly and will cause disease to spread in the country.  Will the Minister have this matter looked into?</P>
    <P>There is no point in being squemish. We have to face up to the issue.  Deputies McManus and O'Donnell took a commonsense approach to the matter.  The work of groups, gay groups in particular, in raising our awareness and educating people on AIDS is to be welcomed.  Their pioneering work has also pushed the politician to take action in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has been practical, determined and enlightened in his attitude to this matter.  He has refused to bow to prejudice, pressure or superstition and has taken a good deal of pressure off the rest of us.  He has adopted a commonsense attitude and I am pleased that our party has led the way.  I should like to share my time with Deputy Derek McDowell.</P>

I am delighted today that <Col N="1762" /> realism has reached the floor of this House.  I welcome the measure and congratulate the Minister for his work in this regard.

      <P>I am particularly happy to welcome this Bill today.  I am especially happy that a Labour Minister is introducing the first chunk in the Government's social programme.  My party was the first to come to grips with this issue some 20 or more years ago, at a time when I and some other Deputies in the House were still at school.  That is an indication of how long it has taken this country and the House to come to grips with an important social issue.</P>
      <P>In his contribution this morning the Minister dealt in some detail with the contribution which condoms can make in combating the spread of HIV and, indeed, sexually transmitted diseases generally.  That is absolutely clear and the Opposition spokespersons have also cited the medical evidence to this effect. It is important that we say that because there has been a campaign by groups and individuals outside this House to sow the seeds of doubt in the public mind &mdash; groups and individuals who, in large part, are following an agenda which has nothing whatever to do with preventing the spread of disease.  I am disturbed and distressed that individuals who have a religious or theological objection to the use of family planning methods or condoms generally should encroach on the area of disease prevention in order to follow their particular agenda.  They are behaving dishonestly and irresponsibly and I regret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dealt in great detail with the role of condoms in preventing the spread of disease.  We must also acknowledge the other important contribution which condoms can make to our society in preventing unwanted pregnancies. <Col N="1763" /> It would be nice to think that every pregnancy and every child was wanted but, sadly, that is not the case. We are all painfully aware that there are many unwanted pregnancies.  Our alarmingly high abortion figures are adequate testament to that.</P>
    <P>We have to give the wherewithal to people, to individuals, to couples, to women, in particular, freely to exercise their consciences in taking whatever measures they wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Previously healthy relationships come under deep strain if an unintended pregnancy results.  It is particularly traumatic for a woman who had not intended to become pregnant.  It also has an impoverishing effect on many families and individuals.  A pregnancy is expensive &mdash; rearing a child in the nineties is expensive.  There are many individual women and families who simply cannot afford it.  As a State and as a Legislature we have a duty to give those people the wherewithal to ensure, in so far as we can, that unwanted pregnancies do not occur.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House would advocate or defend casual or promiscuous sexual relations.  We have an obligation in our school and elsewhere to engage in sex education programmes which will give people the wherewithal to make conscientious decisions.  Our record in sex education in our schools is by no means unblemished.  I am aware there has been considerable progress in recent years in individual schools in programmes initiated by individual teachers.  In recent years the Department has come to grips with this issue but there is still much room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and his colleague, the Minister for Education, clearly have a role in this matter.  We must provide inservice training of teachers.  It does not come naturally to many teachers, who are not trained, to give sex education classes in schools.  It is a particularly sensitive issue.  It is important that teachers are given facilities, including video tapes and easy access media communications paraphernalia so <Col N="1764" /> that children can be given the knowledge they need to equip them for life.</P>
    <P>If we do not defend or encourage casual sex, likewise we should not pretend it does not happen.  It happens regularly. We cannot legislate for hormonal urges &mdash; we certainly cannot legislate them out of existence.  We must recognise that there is a problem with casual sex and unwanted pregnancies.  Essentially what this amounts to is the free exercise of conscience.  If people are satisfied in their own minds to use condoms or whatever other method of contraception they wish, then they are perfectly entitled to do so.  It is high time the Legislature bowed out of the bedroom and left that decision making, as it should be left, to two consenting adults.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this section of the Government's social programme will shortly be in place.  I am happy that it appears to have the support of all Members.  It is a remarkable commentary that something that has tortured our political life for about 20 years, as Deputy Kemmy has so well illustrated, should go through the Dáil so quickly today.  It is a commentary on the maturity of this House and our society.  I am happy to suport this Bill and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this matter which I regard as of vital importance to the Irish people.  It is wonderful to see the measure going through the House in such a harmonious fashion considering the incredible bitterness the issue engendered through the years.  I am delighted that a Labour Minister is introducing provisions to eliminate controls over the supply of condoms while recognising that they are harmless objects in their own right but beneficial in their effect.</P>
      <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1993, embodies the commitment of the Government to a comprehensive effective strategy to combat AIDS.  That is one of the priorities in ensuring that this Bill was brought forward speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> We recognise that the AIDS problem has become an epidemic in this country and is spreading at a considerable rate. A total of 1,368 people in Ireland have tested positive for HIV.  This is a complete understatement of the situation. More blood testing has been carried out since 1992 on a random basis in hospitals and clinics than had been carried out previously.  Proposals to include blood samples taken at sexually transmitted disease clinics and hospitals' in patients and outpatients should provide a much clearer picture of the prevalence and the spread of the infection.</P>
    <P>I compliment the gay community on their responsible approach to dealing with this problem and particularly their emphasis on awareness in the community at large when other sections of the heterosexual community were turning a blind eye.  Indeed, many sections of the medical community want to turn a blind eye to what is happening in our community.</P>
    <P>I am extremely dissatisfied with the manner in which the problem of AIDS infection is dealt with in our prison system, where probably the greatest percentage of people who have been infected with the virus are to be found at any given time.  There is a practice there whereby anybody tested positive for the AIDS virus is immediately penalised by being segregated in a section of the prison designated specifically for people with the AIDS virus.  That is an entirely unacceptable approach to the problem.  It should be dealt with in a humane way. The last thing that should be done is to point the finger, stigmatise somebody and confine them, making it obvious to the world both inside and outside the prison that that person is there because he or she is infected with the HIV virus.  I urge the authorities, if they still have not dealt with the situation properly, to change their approach to dealing with the incidence of the disease in prisons.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in relation to the sexually active young population.  We have been turning a blind eye to the fact that morality is not as <Col N="1766" /> certain sections of the community would like to imagine it is.  We must recognise that people are becoming sexually active at a younger age.  Awareness, particularly at school level, has become paramount. Every school should incorporate sex education as part and parcel of a life skills programme and it should be an essential part of the curriculum.  The Department of Education should take on board the provisions we are in the process of implementing here today and ensure that a programme is implemented in every school, certainly every second level school, to ensure that the information is made available to young people as to the precautions that need to be taken.  I do not in any way condone promiscuity, but people are sexually active at a young age and precautions must be taken.  There must be awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancies.  The relevant information should be communicated to the population at large at a younger age than it has been hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Kemmy speak of the greater realism in this House.  He also mentioned that there was sadness.  It struck me during the debate that there is a lot to be sad about because the energy and effort that has gone into this tortuous debate over the years has had implications in people's lives.  There may indeed have been a great deal of personal tragedy caused by the failure to address this issue in a comprehensive way before now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in this Bill for free availability of condoms, but it is ironic that in taking this step the Minister is excluding them from the definition of a contraceptive, that is, the means by which people can prevent pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shift in public opinion is in terms of the openness of the sale of contraceptives. Undoubtedly this has been <Col N="1767" /> brought about in some measure by the tragedy of AIDS and the serious health questions which it poses.  Again, I would congratulate the Minister on the approach he has taken in this area.  I would congratulate him on the public information campaign which is in place at the moment.  I would urge him, however, to consider further public information campaigns targeting women particularly.  International research is showing that women are vulnerable to AIDS and they need to be well informed. My own experience, working as a social worker, has shown me that many of the most disadvantaged women in our society are not getting the sort of information and advice they need.</P>
    <P>The shift in public opinion is not just in this area.  We also saw it following the X case last year.  I am convinced that increasing numbers of Irish people are quite clear that we must also be open and willing to deal with sexuality as a more complex issue, that we cannot pretend that crisis pregnancies do not exist.  A number of Deputies mentioned this.  We have to look at the question in a much more open way.  That involves educating our young people in the whole area of life skills and sexual relationships.  We know that young people are risk takers and that we have to discuss with them and inform them about the consequences of taking those risks.  We have to give people the opportunity to make informed choices about family planning so that they can make the right decisions for themselves morally and healthwise.</P>
    <P>Condom availability is just one piece of a jigsaw puzzle if we are serious about creating a healthy attitude about sexuality. Another piece of that jigsaw is the inclusion of the pill within the medical card system as a contraceptive rather than a cycle regulator, as has been the case.  Undoubtedly these two measures will have benefits, but I would urge the Minister to develop the debate further, if not today then at a later stage so that we can take a more comprehensive view of this very important issue for Irish women and men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> All too frequently people have no proper access to advice and information in the whole area of family planning. This has been a completely grey area, unspoken of and not dealt with in a courageous way by the State or by the health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made condoms more available and also the pill, but what about access to a broader range of family planning methods?  Are doctors' consciences to continue to override the conscience of their patient?  Does the Department know which doctors will provide a full family planning service, where there are gaps, and what steps are being taken to provide such a service?</P>
    <P>To make informed choices people need information, and simply saying that the pill or condoms are more available does not address this.  How is information to be made more accessible?  How are health personnel to be trained to provide the wider service?  I acknowledge the work of many in the medical profession in this area.  Perhaps a survey of GP and health board plans for the provision of service could answer some of those questions. Such a survey should be undertaken as a priority.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the many voluntary organisations who are working in the area of AIDS prevention.  I pay tribute to them and to the work which they have done.  I pay tribute particularly to the strategy commission and people like Dr. Walsh who have spoken out so clearly and have been so articulate about this issue in a society that does not really like to face up to the realities surrounding many of these issues and which has been reluctant to do so for many years.</P>
    <P>Irish men and women have, however, been well served by organisations, often voluntary, and doctors who were courageous enough to provide family planning services when the State and the formal health sector did not want to know.  I hope that their work can now be acknowledged.  Their continued operation of emergency services in towns around Ireland is one indication of how far behind the health service has fallen <Col N="1769" /> in meeting the real as opposed to the perceived needs of Irish people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is one important part of a response but only one part.  We need the comprehensive approach which I have spoken about.  I would urge the Minister to ask the committee looking at women's health needs in the Department of Health to look at the recommendations in this area in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women. It is clearly a critical part of the issue of women's health.  It is central and there is a range of actions which the commission suggests needs to be taken.  I hope the Minister can initiate the sort of debate we need in this area and ensure that we have the widest possible and most comprehensive approach to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I am delighted that this Bill is before the House.  It is another piece of the mosaic of commonsense that should have been in place a long time ago.  It has taken us far too long to get to this point.  I agree with other Members of the House who find section 2 very curious.  It removes condoms from the definition of a contraceptive in the Principal Act.  That is another illustration of the contortions of thought that have been brought to this issue year after year.  We all know that condoms are contraceptives.  To now find ourselves in the legal position where we have to pretend that they are not included in the definition of contraceptives illustrates how stupid our approach to issues like this has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a few points.  In the light of statements in the past few weeks in respect of opponents of this type of measure &mdash; and one was referred to in the newspapers this morning &mdash; we must make the point sensibly that there are very few cases in this area of human social behaviour where the law dictates conduct.  It is more realistic to look at the world around us and conclude that it is the conduct of individuals in society that determine the law.  Deputy O'Donnell put this very well earlier when she criticised people who claim that umbrellas <Col N="1770" /> bring rain.  This Act, if it is passed, will not be an Act that will bring about a major change in the sexual behavour of Irish citizens.  This legislation is required in respect of the way Irish people properly behave &mdash; this is the main wellspring of the inspiration for this measure &mdash; and the way the majority of Irish people see their role in life as partners in marriage, as partners in loving relationships and as parents, if they see such a role for themselves.  That is why we need this legislation.  There are other reasons and considerations which make it advantegeous to have this legislation, but that is the basic reason.  Irish people are the same as people everywhere in the world. They have the right to freedom to make choices about their role as parents and that is the principal basic reason we should have legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>There have been many criticisms, and legislation like this brings the most extraordinary issues to the surface.  I am sure other Members will have received documentation in the last few weeks from a body that styles iself The Canadian Information Service.  I do not know, Sir, if you have seen the documents, but they are the most appalling piece of intellectual pornography.  Reading the documents I had a vision of some crabbed, twisted individual getting on a high writing this material.  This documentation is the most outrageous contribution to any type of debate and I raise it only to say that it is something we should ignore.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that we are at a point where the Government considers it must refer to our concerns about AIDS to justify a measure of this kind in the same way as it was used to justify the last legislation introduced on this matter.  The AIDS problem is a serious one.  It is not the main reason for legislation of this kind.  I will not go into the details and the scientific claims and counter-claims that have been made.  I am not competent to deal with those issues and we have Administrations to do that for us.  It is not true to claim, as Government advertisements now claim, that everybody in Ireland who is sexually active is at risk from AIDS.  That is the most appalling <Col N="1771" /> nonsense to put across as a reason for this measure or any other measure.</P>
    <P>It is far from the truth to say that everybody in Ireland who is sexually active is at risk from AIDS.  That is patently not the case.  To base an advertising campaign on that consideration rather than on the real facts of where the risks arise seems to be not just a waste of money, which is serious enough, but a distortion of the truth.  In attempting to bring about one change in the way we think about sexual behaviour it runs a serious social risk of contorting our thinking in a totally uncalled for way.  I do not mean to indicate any type of smugness or carelessness about the real threat that AIDS poses to our society.  But I ask the Government to come clean on these matters, to speak about the issues as they are and not to use totally extraneous considerations, which are vital and worrying, to justify a perfectly sensible measure such as the one that lies at the heart of this proposal.</P>
    <P>An old hobbyhorse of mine relates to the making of regulations.  In section 6 the old procedure has been followed.  I suggest to the Government that it modify it in one respect.  There is provision in section 3 (1) for the Minister to make regulations prohibiting the sale or offering for sale contraceptives and so on at a place of a class specified in regulations. We know what the Minister has said he has in mind in that subsection, but it seems that if the Minister is deciding that certain places are classes of places where we should not allow the sale of contraceptives he should come before the House and argue that case.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister should have to come before the House and get our active approval for regulations that deal with the standards of condoms.  That is something that is properly in the realm of the expertise available to the Minister and our Administration. However, the question of deciding what types of places are not appropriate for the sale or condoms is one that should be brought before this House.  It relates to people's access to contraceptives and the <Col N="1772" /> way they can use their rights as individuals. It is probably a vain hope to expect that the Government would consider this again.  However, it seems to be a clear case where we can divide the types of regulations that fall to be made here between those that can properly be made in a purely administrative machine-like fashion and those that require a political decision because they relate to the way people behave and their access to exercising their rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to briefly address this issue.  I am totally opposed to the introduction of this legislation.  I am disappointed that the Government and the Minister for whom I have a high regard, would try to con people that the items which are the subject of this legislation are not contraceptives, which of course they are.  They have been promoted as if they were something young people could pick up like sweets or a bar of chocolate and that they are harmless. That is wrong.  We are addressing the wrong issue here.  We are giving the wrong signals and promoting promiscuity. We talk about this issue as if it concerns a whole body of people.  We should consider this in terms of the Members of this House and their families and perhaps then we might seriously consider what we are trying to achieve here. We are putting pressure on honest, good, hard-working, decent people, who do not wish to be involved in this type of activity outside of marriage.  Of course, there is pressure on those people and restraint must be exercised.  People are prepared to do that for the benefit of a happy marriage later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From where are the demands coming for this legislation?  Who are the vocal group?  They are not the majority of young people with whom I am involved and whom I meet, those people who wish to go out, play games, meet their friends or go to a disco.  They will now be put under pressure by a small group of people.  In all walks of society there are young people with problems.  Problems occur in the best of families and family life is about supporting young people <Col N="1773" /> with problems.  This problem existed when drink laws were liberalised here. When I was growing up, and indeed the Minister also, drinking in dance halls was prohibited.  Suddenly the whole scene changed and there was a bar at the end of the dance hall.  Young people were partaking of alcohol as it was freely available. They did not understand the consequences of this and they would become uncontrollably drunk.</P>
    <P>Society has, by and large, come to terms with this and young people are restrained in their drinking.  However, tremendous pressure did exist for many years.  What the Minister is doing now is placing that same pressure on young people.  I have no doubt he will be returning to the House in the future to rectify this but by then it will be too late.</P>
    <P>It has been bandied about that this measure will prevent AIDS.  There is not a scintilla of evidence to indicate that the use of these items will prevent AIDS. However, it certainly will promote sexual activity.  The buzz words nowadays are &ldquo;sexually active&rdquo; young people as if that was the manner in which the majority of young people are behaving.  That is not true and I take it as an insult to the young people who do not wish to behave in this manner.  Young people want to go out and enjoy themselves.  That is quite natural.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the trend is for people to marry at a younger age.  That is to be welcomed as they will grow up with their families.  However, major problems exist in relation to housing which are not being addressed.  Let us not be coy about this matter &mdash; there is temptation for young people in today's society.  Young couples cannot get married because they cannot get a house.  Naturally when they are keeping company there is a certain amount of pressure but the use of condoms is not the solution to that pressure. We must provide these young couples with proper housing where they can marry, live respectably and raise their families.</P>
    <P>There is far too much acceptance of single parents, unmarried mothers and of couples living together who are not <Col N="1774" /> married.  This is not good for society.  I am not here to moralise but I am aware that if the Minister spoke to ordinary decent people the message they would give is that they want no hand, act or part in this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid lives along the Border where these items have been freely available. Can it be said that society in Northern Ireland is better than here?</P>

      <P>One aspect that has amazed me is how some legislation takes months or even years to be brought forward. On the other hand legislation such as this, which has been before this House four or five times in the past 12 or 14 years, can be taken.  It baffles me how these items get on the agenda so quickly.</P>
      <P>I would not always have adopted the position I am taking today.  Ten or 15 years ago I would have been campaigning for change in this area.  I say that in case people try to label me.  I would like to know from the Department of Health if this represents the end of the battle on this issue.  Does it see this as the end of the road or will there be further legislation on the same issue in a year or two?</P>
      <P>There is a moral background to this issue and we cannot get away from that. It will help to create and foster an attitude that casual sex is normal and it will put additional pressure on young people to engage in casual sex.  I do not believe that a promiscuous society is beneficial.  We are in a partnership Government which is a little like the sexual act in that it is supposed to be a loving, caring, sharing relationship.  Both parties seem to have gone to great lengths to take on board the fears and objections of Labour backbenchers on certain issues.  On other issues where people on this side of the House might have some reservations I would like some form of consultation or prior notice of issues such as this at parliamentary party level.  The first I heard about this Bill was in the newspapers and I would like to think that programme managers would take on board our slight reservations on some issues.</P>
    </Speaker>

This can be done far more cheaply and effectively than by transmitting television advertisements into the homes of old age pensioners. I see no merit in that whatsoever.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well know that I support this legislation.  I have been quite vocal on this issue from the start and I am delighted it has reached this stage. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It should put an end to this particular saga which has dragged on for 20 years.  It is time to address the problem and face up to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the progress of the HIV and the AIDS epidemic in conjunction with the state of the European Community, and looking at the problem from a national and global point of view, <Col N="1777" /> we are led to one single conclusion: the epidemic is doing better against us than we are against it.  We have done much but not enough to ensure that we have control over the problem.  HIV is continuing to spread in already affected communities and is now reaching communities unaffected just a short time ago.  The virus is so complex that scientists in this field freely admit we are still probably 20 to 25 years away from a cure or the development of a vaccine.  I believe the major impact of this disease has yet to come.</P>
    <P>How do we control the spread of this disease?  My concern is that we as politicians must strive to protect our small country and take the necessary, and perhaps to some, unpalatable decisions and face up to the reality.  We are a country of approximately 3.5 million people and should this disease get to grip in the heterosexual community, as it has done elsewhere, the epidemic could spread rapidly in a short period of time.  I am not sure I understood Deputy Dukes when he referred to those here who are sexually active.  Is the Deputy aware that in Zambia, a country with 13 million people, one million people now have the AIDS virus?  Is he aware that in certain cities in Africa one in three people is HIV positive?  The World Health Organisation has estimated that five million people in Africa will have HIV before the end of the century and millions of children will be orphaned.  In Latin America more than one million people are affected with the virus; the position in Brazil is alarming and in South East Asia the number of people with the virus has tripled in the last 18 months to 1.5 million.</P>
    <P>If there is no cure or vaccine on the horizon the central challenge to HIV prevention is to influence individual behaviour regarding sex and drugs.  Of course education and information are required, but it is recognised that these are insufficient on their own to effect behavioural change.  The World Health Organisation estimates that 5,000 people per day contract AIDS.  In Europe at present 93,000 people have HIV, with 200 people per <Col N="1778" /> day contracting the virus.  Epidemiologists have said that although the rate of HIV infection is falling in some parts of Europe, in others it is rising &mdash; we are in the latter category, although the increase here is not as great as in some countries.</P>
    <P>It is of concern to me that although we are going through a period of harmonisation in Europe we are clearly divided on policy in this area, particularly on such questions as testing and targeting. Should people seeking insurance be required to have HIV tests and should health care workers be tested routinely? Unless we realise the prevalence of HIV in the heterosexual community the necessary precautions that are vital to prevention will not be taken.  I ask the Minister, together with his European counterparts, to consider, perhaps in a pilot scheme in certain European cities, compulsory or blind testing so that there is some idea of the exact prevalence of HIV in the heterosexual community.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that as regards prevention and cure no decisions have been made in Europe or Ireland on how or whether AIDS issues should be addressed in schools.  We must not become complacent. Ireland and Europe must come to an agreement on how to deal with the risk of HIV to drug injectors.  There must be a common policy on the use of zidovudine &mdash; AZT &mdash; and other anti-viral drugs.  I urgently request the pharmaceutical companies of the world to collaborate with each other and pool their resources rather than compete in their quest to achieve a cure or vaccine. Let them not be lulled into a false sense of security by the seductive but completely false notion that HIV is not the cause of AIDS.  Let me put it bluntly: people with AIDS are people who are infected with HIV.</P>
    <P>Policies and laws must be based upon scientific fact and experience.  I do not condone recreational drug injection or sex with multiple partners, but these behaviours are followed.  We might prefer to believe that people in prisons do not have sex or inject drugs, but they do.  We may find it difficult because of our <Col N="1779" /> cultural or religious traditions to explain condoms to school children, but young people, perhaps more than anyone else, must know how to protect themselves. To fight AIDS effectively we must deal with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be.</P>
    <P>The key to the success of prevention programmes includes the creation and maintenance of AIDS awareness throughout the mass media.  Prevention must include a general openness about sexuality, including sex education in schools, peer education and social support for drug users and other marginalised people, as well as condom promotion and availability.  Many outspoken people who have written to me believe that sex education encourages early sexual activity, but the opposite is the case, as several well known studies have shown.  I would like to deal further with this matter but as my colleagues wish to contribute I will conclude.  I wholeheartedly support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the shortage of time I will address only a couple of important issues.  On 8 July last year the then Minister, Dr. O'Connell, brought forward an amendment to the Family Planning Bill. At that stage I requested that a measure along the lines proposed here be introduced. Although it is a little late, this Bill is necessary and welcome.  I encourage the Government to be more pro-active, to show the way and give a lead to the country.  Section 2 amends the definition of contraceptive to exclude condoms. This is a joke and I ask the Minister to amend the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since his appointment, the Minister has laid great stress on the AIDS problem and the difficulties in coming to grips with it.  It is a growing problem not only in Ireland but throughout the world. Deputy McDaid mentioned Africa and the problems there.  I visited the Cameroons last year and from my experience &mdash; it was not a sexual one &mdash; I would not be surprised if the people there do not wipe themselves out in the near future.  This is a matter that will create <Col N="1780" /> serious problems for medics throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Even if AIDS did not exist in Ireland this Bill would be essential.  Regardless of how we perceive our children or our country.  Tír na nÓg closed down a long time ago.  The reality is that people are becoming sexually active at a much younger age.  Despite the best efforts of parents, teachers and the Roman Catholic Church to encourage people to wait until they marry before indulging in sex, people engage in casual sex at a much younger age and more frequently.  In view of those behavioural changes it is important that the Government makes condoms more widely available.  I commend the Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward.  I also thank other Members for their contributions which I found quite interesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing forward this legislation so quickly in the lifetime of this Government. However, I have one or two reservations to which I will refer later.  As part of our campaign against the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases this legislation is important and will help to tackle what is a serious issue. One or two contributors in today's debate may have, unintentionally, given the impression that AIDS and HIV are confined to a small, clearly identifiable section of our community.  From examination of statistics here and elsewhere, this is not the case.  It may be so if you can depend on your partner but, in view of intravenous drug abuse and increased sexual activity, one can no longer depend on a particular partner.  That is a sad reflection on the world in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the debate has concentrated on the question of AIDS and HIV, but we must take account also of unwanted and unplanned pregnancies, which is a tremendous and growing social problem. Public representatives who meet young single mothers with serious social problems resulting from unplanned pregnancies welcome legislation of this kind which helps to alleviate this problem. Rather than targeting young single <Col N="1781" /> mothers we should target their partners who give rise to the number of unwanted pregnancies and the social problems that arise therefrom.</P>
    <P>In relation to my reservations, I would refer the Minister to section 3 which relates to the prohibition on the sale of condoms through vending machines in certain places.  I know the Minister does not want to intrude on people's private lives.  That is commendable.  However, the introduction of regulations on the prohibition of the sale of condoms from vending machines in certain places intervenes in the ability of people to order their lives in privacy in matters of this kind.  There should be no prohibition regarding the point of sale.  I know this involves youth clubs and schools.  I would prefer to see the people in charge of those places making the sort of decisions which the Minister seeks to make in regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the removal of the controls would lead to the location of vending machines in appropriate internal locations, and then he went on to refer to the extent that inappropriate internal or external locations may not then arise. Will the Minister clarify if he proposes to prevent the provision of condom vending machines in the open, because if they are to be prohibited in the open that is fair enough, but if he intends to allow them to be placed in the open there is no necessity to restrict such machines in premises and it confirms the point I already made with regard to prohibition in certain places.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill and I ask him to take into account whether it is necessary to have regulations.</P>

I have serious reservations about the way the debate has been handled not only in the House but outside the House.  I have no hang-up about the availability of contraceptives to mature people but I have reservations about the contributions of Deputies here, with the notable exceptions of Deputy Ahern and Deputy Boylan, not putting the other side of the story.  This type of debate creates the impression that the availability of condoms or contraceptives in night clubs and discos is normal.  Whether we like it or not that puts pressure on young people. The Minister and the media and everybody pushing the sale of condoms keep saying that condoms should be available in night clubs, discos and so on.  As a parent of four teenage children I would ask, &ldquo;Why should condoms be available in a disco?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>People meet casually for the first time in a disco.  Are the legislators in this House telling young people that we have to make condoms available in discos in case they get the urge to have sex and that it is a normal thing to get the urge to have sex in a disco?  That mentality should not be promoted in this debate. We should have more confidence in the ability of young people to make up their minds about this.  We should not underestimate their ability to be responsible. We should be teaching in our homes and in our schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I thank the Minister for making this time available to me.  I welcome the general agreement to the Bill.  I am somewhat bemused and saddened by the partonising views with regard to young people.  Young people are well able to make up their minds on any issue.  I resent the tone of some contributions which implied that they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> This Bill was introduced for public health reasons.  As Deputy McDaid said, while we may wish that the world was different, we have to deal with it as it is. I am aware that people would like values to be different but we have to cope with what we have.  It is a good thing that there is tolerance of various values in our society.  As a public health measure, I welcome the fact that this Bill is associated with a recent AIDS media campaign which has been launched, after some difficulty, on RTE.  That campaign is a useful breakthrough in that it gets straightforward advertisements onto the national media.  Given its relative success, the campaign should be extended to include a multi-media education which would be available to everybody.</P>
    <P>With regard to the concerns of parents, one of the advertisements which struck me most forcibly in the campaign was an advertisement featuring the mother of an AIDS victim.  I want to put the other side, to compare with some of the views given here today.  In the advertisement Mrs. McCarthy says she tries to remember her son as the colourful person he was before he contracted AIDS, but all she can remember is the pain and suffering he had to endure before he died.  She says: I urge all mothers to talk to their children about safer sex; I ask them to please, please, tell their children to use a condom if they are having sex; I would not wish any mother to see or go through what I did.  That is a message from a parent, one that is being taken on board in the present campaign and in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. Indeed it is long overdue as a public health measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the views expressed by Members, in particular the positive views in favour of the Bill expressed by the vast majority of speakers.  It is historic that such a Bill can go through with that measure of support, with a degree of calmness permeating the debate inside and outside this House that did not characterise previous debates on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> I said in the course of my Second Stage contribution that this Bill was designed for a specific purpose, to deal swiftly with the availability of condoms in the fight against AIDS.  I accept the view put forward by many speakers that the wider availability of family planning needs to be addressed in its own right.  I am doing that as part of the national health strategy being developed and which I hope to have completed by the end of this year. I hope we will have the opportunity, either in the House or in the Select Committee on Social Affairs to debate that in due course.  I take cognisance of the Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women and of the views expressed by Members in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>As Members stated, standards for condoms are an essential safeguard.  That is why I have included the provision for the establishment of standards in the Bill. The EC standard will become the national standard when it is adopted. Until then it is my intention to permit condoms to be supplied here only if they comply with the recognised high standard of another acceptable EC member state. I agree with Members that the monitoring of standards of condoms is essential also.  I can assure the House that compliance with the standards set will be monitored by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan and O'Donnell mentioned the recent media coverage questioning the efficacy of condoms in preventing HIV, AIDS.  I read the report and I read the wide range of reputable research projects which support the efficacy of condoms in the fight against AIDS.  These reports come from international agencies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States and from respected scientists and medical personnel worldwide.  A huge body of evidence attests to the efficacy of condoms as a barrier to the transmission of the virus.  These reports have been subjected to critical peer review and have been published in the medical and scientific press.  Therefore, I have no problem <Col N="1786" /> accepting the findings of these projects and reports.</P>
    <P>On the question of the perishability of condoms, raised by Deputy Flanagan, following long periods of storage, I am advised &mdash; I checked this since Deputy Flanagan raised the point &mdash; that there is no evidence that perishability is a problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus, in her forthright contribution, stated that this Bill would not in itself put an end to AIDS or to teenage pregnancy.  I was a little taken aback at Deputy McManus's comment in relation to the media campaign, when she described it as bland, middle-aged; I can tolerate the &ldquo;bland&rdquo; but &ldquo;middle-aged&rdquo; I found to be a dreadful rebuff to the campaign.  Indeed, the difficulty the campaign faces from a cross section of outside interests attests to the fact that it is a good, effective one that has drawn widespread positive comment from people nationwide within the short period it has been running but, no doubt, it can be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's view that it will not put an end to AIDS.  The liberalisation of condom legislation is part only, albeit an important part, of an overall strategy of public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that education must be a major element of the strategy and I made that point last year when the precursor of this Bill was going through the House.  I recognise the work of the AIDS Strategy Committee who have already stated that education programmes must play a major role in our strategy to prevent the spread of this virus.  Education programmes take a number of forms, including targeted programmes aimed at specific groups.  Deputies questioned whether the advertising campaign was sufficiently targeted. I decided deliberately that I wanted this message to go out to the community at large, not to any so-called vulnerable group.  I know from my contacts that a great number of sexually active people consider themselves to be <Col N="1787" /> immune from this disease, to be invulnerable. Therefore, it is important to get the message across that this is not a disease confined to one tiny group in society, that, potentially, anybody who is engaging in unprotected sex, except with their partner who is faithful, is putting themselves at risk.  The import of the message is that people engaging in sex on that basis should protect themselves.</P>
    <P>In the resource centre at Baggot Street under the Outreach programme prostitutes are offered condoms as part of the programme.  There are a number of other projects in place.</P>
    <P>On the broader question of sex education in our schools, I propose to begin discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education, who obviously has prime responsibility in this area, to prepare a programme.  I propose also to refer to a number of other topics raised in the course of this debate regarding the extension of satellite drug clinics, the danger of the spread of AIDS in prisons and other matters to the AIDS Strategy Committee which I chair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald spoke about access to the full range of advice services.  Obviously, that must be examined very carefully.  I have noted her comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes talked in terms of AIDS being the justification for this Bill.  I repeat that I, as Minister, would have brought forward this legislation regardless because I consider it to be an important measure.  It is doubly important in the context of the prevention of the spread of AIDS.  The reality is that the use of a condom is not only an effective mechanism in preventing conception but is also an important implement in the fight against the transmission of a deadly virus. Deputy McManus succinctly put the contraceptive value of condoms as having no relevance to homosexual men, but they have a very important prophylactic value in preventing the transmission of disease in such circumstances.  Therefore, on both counts, this Bill is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan broke the consensus in the House in his very forthright contribution. <Col N="1788" /> I do not agree with the points he made and those of other Deputies in support of that line.  The points made by Deputy Boylan were repeated by Deputy McCormack.  I do not believe, at this stage of our development, we can lay down moral codes of conduct and pretend they are happening regardless of the reality.  It is my duty as Minister for Health and that of this House, as a national assembly, to provide for the wellbeing and greater good of the people. I am firmly of the view that the Bill constitutes a realistic and genuine way of seeking to address those realities, even if they are unpalatable realities for many Members.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flood made a very important point, that there is no limit to the people who are vulnerable to the AIDS-HIV virus; it is not limited to any particular atrisk group.  I accept that and endorse what he said in relation to the double value of the availability of condoms as a prophylactic against transmission of disease other than AIDS-HIV and also in the prevention of unwanted pregnancies which, as many Members said, is an important social issue that needs to be addressed in its own right.  I hope this House will have an opportunity to do so in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the regulations I intend to introduce, I do not intend bringing in regulations to prohibit the siting of condom vending machines.  I shall leave that issue open but, if it is drawn to <Col N="1789" /> my attention and I accept that vending machines are sited in unsuitable places, and feel it necessary to take action I want to have the legal power to be able to do so.  I am strongly of the view that there will be no need to draw up such regulations because people will show sensitivity in this regard.  The regulations to which I am referring pertain to machines located outdoors which are to be found in many countries.  I have no intention of prohibiting such machines.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the Bill has been broadly welcomed.  It is an historic Bill and closes a chapter which it has taken a long time to close.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through both Houses.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Health (Family Planning) Acts, 1979 to 1993, or of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977, it shall be lawful for any person who is, or is the agent of, a person making available a family planning service, in accordance with section 3 (3) of the principal Act, as amended, to supply to any person availing of such service:</P>
      <P>(a)  any drug preparation or other substance intended to be taken orally, or by injection, or by implantation, for the purpose of controlling or preventing ovulation or conception (not being an abortifacient);</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  any drug or other substance intended primarily for the control or substitution of hormones occurring <Col N="1790" /> in conjunction with the female reproductive cycle; or</P>
    <P>(c)  such other drug or substance as the Minister may by regulation made under these Acts, designate for the purpose of this section,</P>
    <P>without the presence or intervention of any person mentioned in section 3 (i) (b) (i) (I) of the Act of 1992, where such supply is made under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner and in accordance with such conditions, if any, as the Minister may by regulation prescribe for the purpose of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove a difficulty that arose from a change which was made in the 1992 Family Planning Act.  That Act confined the term &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; to mechanical contraceptives.  This had the curious effect of excluding the pill with the result that family planning clinics which supplied the pill under medical supervision were in breach of the law as they did not employ a resident pharmacist.</P>
    <P>Family planning clinics should have the right to supply the pill, certain other drugs and hormone replacement therapy relating to the female reproductive cycle without the need to employ a fulltime pharmacist.  The expense involved would be quite considerable, particularly for smaller clinics around the country where the volume of work would not justify the retention of an in-house pharmacist.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to deal with this matter today rather than wait for a review of the Pharmacy Acts, which has been promised, to be carried out.  It is wrong that family planning clinics would be in breach of the criminal law.  I hope therefore that the Minister will accept this amendment, given that this is an important issue for family planning clinics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, which is an important one.  As I did not have an opportunity to do so on Second Stage, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister <Col N="1791" /> on introducing the legislation.  It is interesting that it is a Minister who is both young and single who has had the courage to bring the Bill before the House.  I am not sure if this would have happened in the recent past.</P>
      <P>On my way to the House the only person I met who was opposed to the legislation was a lady outside the front gate with a tricolour.  She did not attempt to hit me with it, but she told me what she thought of me.  Following my appearance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; with the Minister two weeks ago, I received a letter which contained scapulars and medals.  That was from a person in County Cork who thought I had gone so far in lowering the moral standards of the country that all they could do was to send me scapulars and medals and pray for me.  While it is interesting to note that there has been little opposition, I welcome the intervention of Deputies Boylan, Ahern and McCormack because it should be understood that there is some.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to think I am blaming him, but sufficient time has not been made available to debate this issue.  I would have liked to have had the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage.  It has been a good debate in which forthright views have been expressed, in particular by Deputies O'Donnell, McManus and McDaid.  They were honest and realistic.  It is great that we have reached this stage in the House.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, said in the House this morning, it is only eight years since he abstained on similar legislation and was expelled for conduct unbecoming. I am delighted that we have changed the definition of that term.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern came into the House yesterday to justify the tax amnesty.  Yet he did not feel that this legislation was appropriate.  He also mentioned that this new partnership Government has a loving, caring and sharing relationship.  Given the views and disquiet which he has expressed about legislation of this kind, I would advise both parties that they should continue to wear their political condoms for the moment as I did not detect that they had a loving, caring and sharing relationship.  It is obvious that Fianna Fáil is to blame for the tax amnesty while the Labour Party is to blame for this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In those few words the Minister has said more about the tax amnesty than any other Labour Party Minister since it was proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been contacted by various people who work in family planning clinics. Most of the women I know would prefer to go to these clinics for advice on family planning and health matters which affect their reproductive cycle.  Although the 1992 Act was brought in for technical reasons, it is an anomaly that these family planning clinics, which provide an outstanding and comprehensive service to women &mdash; and to men in some cases &mdash; cannot prescribe the pill, the morning after pill or hormone replacement therapy unless they employ a pharmacist. This would place an extra expense on the clinics in question given that they already <Col N="1793" /> employ medical practitioners.  That should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Despite what some people think, in rural areas nobody is knocking down the door of family planning clinics and waiting at 7 a.m. to get a supply, even for a bank holiday weekend.  An extra burden has been placed on these clinics.  I have spoken to the Minister privately about this matter and he has indicated to me that there is a distinction between legislation dealing with drugs and legislation such as this, but that is just a technicality. It will probably be some considerable time before amending legislation is introduced in this area.  I hope therefore the Minister will be as forthcoming on this matter as he has been on other issues.</P>
    <P>On the question of morality, I hope I was not being offensive when I laughed during the course of Deputy McCormack's contribution.  I am sorry I laughed but I found his contribution offensive. He mentioned that young people may get the urge and think that they have to run off and get a condom.  It should be remembered that many older people engage in sex too.  Perhaps we are becoming elderly or middle aged, but we seem to think that 16 to 18 year olds are different from everybody else.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the bishops reissued a statement which they published last summer on the question of morality in relation to condoms.  In one part of the diocese of Armagh condoms have been freely available for a considerable length of time and I do not think the bishops would accept that the people in one part of the diocese are more moral than people in another part who have not had access to the same degree to condoms and other family planning devices.  It is extraordinary, but some people seem to hold the view that legislation has a bearing on people's moral behaviour or has an influence on their value system.  People have their own value system, which has been shaped by education, the Church to which they subscribe or by their parents. I am delighted that at last we are moving away from a position where we tell people how they should behave in <Col N="1794" /> private.  This is a sign that we are showing great maturity.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not using inappropriate language, but the Minister would put the final nail in the coffin if he were to accept some of the reasonable amendments which have been tabled &mdash; not just in the name of my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, but in the names of Deputies McManus and Flanagan.  Very good amendments have been tabled to this legislation and, even though there was no disagreement on Second Stage, this does not necessarily mean that the legislation cannot be improved.</P>
    <P>Legislation is one thing but it is extremely important that there is education, information and access to the facilities being provided.  This is why I believe the amendment in the name of Deputy McManus in regard to medical cardholders, etc. is very important.  If people do not have access to the facilities being introduced by way of legislation then the legislation will not have the effect we would wish it to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputies O'Donnell and Harney.  It appears that the 1992 law excludes the pill from the definition of a contraceptive.  This left clinics in the anomalous position where they were supplying the pill under the supervision of registered medical practitioners to women in various locations around the country.  They are now in the very strange position where what they are doing is in breach of the law &mdash; they no longer have the authority under the existing family planning legislation to supply the pill to women.  I ask the Minister to consider the following points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Harney said, it is possible for a family planning clinic in a large metropolis to bear the cost of having a pharmacist in residence, so to speak, during its working hours but this is not possible for clinics in other parts of the country.  If the clinics in question were to comply with the law it would impose a very significant extra cost obligation on them.  In terms of making family planning services available <Col N="1795" /> cheaply to people who do not have much money, it seems that Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is not only justifiable but suggests the obvious thing to do.  We should make it possible for family planning clinics to provide the pill to women without the intervention of a pharmacist.</P>
    <P>Going back over the history of the pharmacy Acts, the rule that doctors cannot dispense drugs themselves seems to have originated in the 19th century and seems to have been introduced to prevent quackery and to improve standards. This seems to have been done with the strong support of most people in the medical profession.  They wanted to provide a safeguard for the public under the pharmacy Acts and ensure that people were not exposed to the unrestricted oddities and idiosyncrasies of individual practitioners who might use their pharmacopoeia to do terrible things to people.  In the context of a family planning clinic, moving in a resident pharmacist will not change anything.  These clinics are run on a voluntary basis; they are not run for profit.  A pharmacist is not going to sit at one end of a corridor and say to a doctor at the other end of a corridor, &ldquo;you have got it wrong, your prescription pattern is wrong or is not warranted in this particular case&rdquo;.  This will not happen because the two people will be employed by a voluntary group which will have a single policy.  However much ordinary people may need a safeguard to ensure that they are not prescribed drugs on an odd, unethical or unwarranted basis by individual medical practitioners, a woman going into a family planning clinic does not need to have the protection of a pharmacist as well.  It is anomalous to have somebody wearing a different badge at the end of a corridor carrying out the same function which is being carried out <i>de facto</i> in breach of the criminal law by all these clinics.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make in regard to this matter deserves some reflection by the Minister and his officials.  In terms of prescribing the pill <Col N="1796" /> and familiarity with its dangers, complications and side effects, it seems that women's safety is improved rather than disimproved by having the pill prescribed by people who do it every day and who are specialists in the subject.  The ordinary GP-pharmacist method of getting the pill into a woman's hand is less desirable than concentrating this activity in the hands of experts who are operating clinics and who deal with the side effects of this tablet on a much more frequent basis than an ordinary GP.  Expertise tends to concentrate in these clinics which should not be put at an additional cost disadvantage &mdash; rather they should be encouraged.  The one way they can be encouraged is to eliminate the need to have a resident pharmacist.  If anyone can stand up in this House and put their hand on their heart and say it is essential that there is a pharmacist in the Well Woman Clinic in Leeson Street, Wexford, Waterford or Cork, I will listen to their argument. However, if the ultimate defence for not accepting Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is that it is right in principle but it should be done by another Minister on another day or in some other Bill, all I can say is that it is the usual disease of procrastination which afflicts this House. If we know something is right, why not do it now?  If there is no real defence for not accepting Deputy O'Donnell's amendment, the Minister should accept it.  This would not require a review of broader statutes such as the pharmacy Acts, the medical practitioners' Acts or the family planning code.  If the Minister wishes, he can accept this amendment today.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is that today, tonight, tomorrow and the day after offences will be committed under the criminal law because we are keeping in place a prohibition on the supply of the pill without a pharmacist.  This will be done by well intentioned people running clinics which are at the forefront of bringing family planning to the poorest people in our society.  Why should we criminalise people like that?  Why should these people be forced to act in breach of the <Col N="1797" /> criminal law when there is no good reason for it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker has adequately amplified the problem. The Minister should take on board this reasonable amendment.  Last year's debate was somewhat unfortunate in so far as time restrictions of a very severe nature were imposed.  To take up the point made by Deputy Harney, it is totally unsatisfactory that we are dealing with this legislation in such a rushed manner.  Deputy McDaid said he expected that this Bill would be the final nail in the debate on condoms and family planning in this House.  We had the 1991 Act, the 1992 Act and the 1993 Act in this area.  I would have thought we could have gone along with Deputy McDaid's sentiments by ensuring that by 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. this evening we would have put in place legislation which would enable condoms and the issue of family planning to be moved off the agenda.  Unfortunately, I do not think that will be the case.  If the Minister took on board the Progressive Democrats' amendment he would go some of the way towards putting in place legislation which is more comprehensive than this Bill which, as he said, is basicaly an anti-AIDS measure. In many ways the opportunity to introduce more comprehensive legislation was lost.  It appears that we will have another Health (Family Planning) Bill in 1994, 1996 and perhaps even 1997.  I do not see the need for such legislation and I hope it can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if the consequences of last year's Act were foreseen by the then Minister, Dr. O'Connell.  It seems eminently reasonable that every support would be given by the Legislature to the family planning clinics, particularly when one bears in mind the voluntary nature of these clinics.  They are non-commercial, non-profit making and provide a service which is not otherwise available in the community.  It is most regrettable that we should encourage the breaking of the law through the legislation we introduce.  The amendment deals with the current anomalous situation.  It seems to be at variance <Col N="1798" /> with all our sentiments when a family planning clinic cannot provide the basis of family planning.  It is asking a bit much that a resident pharmacist be employed, whether full time or otherwise.  That would be prohibitive.  It is causing some difficulties.  Will the Minister clarify the relationship between this amendment and the Pharmacy Acts and whether it can be enacted without reference to the Pharmacy Acts.  If it can, I certainly would expect him to take it on board; however, if it cannot, the least he should do is make a commitment that the necessary amendment to the Pharmacy Acts will be contemplated at the earliest opportunity.  As I was given the amendment only an hour or two ago, I have not had the opportunity to look at it in great detail and I do not see why an amendment to the Pharmacy Acts might be necessary.</P>
    <P>We could use this legislation to take a giant step forward in our family planning laws instead of allowing ourselves to be hampered by piecemeal progress.  Given the rapid turnover of officeholders in the Department of Health in recent years, who knows who will be sitting in the chair the Minister now occupies when the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1994 or 1995, will be introduced? For that reason I appeal to the Minister to get it done today if possible.</P>

      <P>I will comment on the Deputy's final comment.  It is interesting that this morning I quoted what I said in the course of the debate in 1992.  I was addressing the then Minister for Health, Dr. O'Connell, on this matter and I said:</P>
      <P>One never knows who will be Minister for Health when this matter is brought before the House again.</P>

      <P>The turnover has been more frequent than that, but I intend to <Col N="1799" /> establish a new pattern of longevity in the Department.  It is important for the health of the nation that there be a continuity of policy for a period and I hope that will be of benefit to the nation at large.</P>
      <P>I hope to give careful consideration to every amendment that comes before the House.  I had the opportunity to discuss this amendment briefly with the mover during the few minutes I stepped out of the Chamber and I am very much in sympathy with her objective.  I understand that what is at issue is to allow family plainning clinics, particularly those outside the major urban areas, to operate as effectively as they can without having undue financial burdens placed on them.  However, the specific request that family planning clinics would be allowed to dispense preparations which are covered under the Pharmacy Acts and under other medical preparations legislation to be distributed without the control of a pharmacist does cause problems.  Anybody who reflects on it will see this.  There is a wide body of legislative provision relating to medical preparations and that has to be taken into account.  It is inappropriate in this legislation to try to exempt from the control of the normal medicines legislation certain products which are clearly defined as medicinal or pharmaceutical in nature.  In the preparation of the pharmacy legislation that will come before the House I will take on board the clear views expressed today to see how they can be incorporated in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctors are entitled under legislation to prescribe and dispense medicine.  If there is a doctor in the family planning clinic the doctor is not only entitled to prescribe but to dispense any medicinal product.  The difficulty arises only when there are no trained medical personnel, either a doctor or a pharmacist, present and we would have to think long and hard before allowing people without professional qualifications' no matter how well motivated, to dispense what are pharmaceutical products.  For that reason I have the greatest difficulty in accepting the amendment, much as I am in sympathy <Col N="1800" /> with the views expressed by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>It was a little disingenous of Deputy McDowell to avail of the opportunity to discuss this matter and hear my reasons in advance of this debate and then come in and use them against me before I had a chance to state them.  I explained exactly my reasoning to him in the corridor outside and I think it was a little sharp of him to say that he would not like to hear me say I was going to postpone it.  That was a little disingenuous.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on Deputy Harney's contribution.  I thank her for her sincere support for this legislation.  I understand her concern at receiving unsolicited mail and religious relics subsequent to her appearance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.  I am used to getting this more frequently and I am sure they will all redound to my salvation in due course.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to inform the House that I am not in a position to accept this specific amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister will not take this amendment on board today, although he accepts there is a problem <i>de facto.</i>  I dispute the case he made that once a doctor is present he or she can dispense the products.  I think the family planning clinics have a difficulty even though they have an in-house doctor because the law requires that a pharmacist dispenses the products. I think I am correct in saying that because we have looked at the matter very carefully.</P>
      <P>There are a great many worthy amendments that we need to tease out so I will not delay the House further.  I am glad the Minister is willing to look at the Pharmacy Acts and I hope he will not delay too long in doing that.  The <i>de facto</i> situation on the ground amounts to a breach of the criminal law and this needs to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I am advised by people who are expert in this matter that all doctors can dispense and that there should be no difficulty with a doctor employed by the family planning clinic dispensing the medical requisites required.  I have not given a commitment that I will automatically accept this amendment.  I said that I am well disposed to the objective, which is to allow for the greatest availability of contraceptive pills or other materials, but I must be mindful of the balance of safeguards. Like the other Members, I have had this amendment for only a few hours and I will certainly consider it in the context of the review of the Pharmacy Acts.  The balance must always be towards the greater good of the patient, that is, the client who presents herself to a family planning clinic.  I need some time to reflect on it.  The review of the pharmacy legislation is due, although I do not know when it will be reached. One of the things I have learned is that virtually every aspect of the medical service is subject to review; a number of reports are pending and there is long term pending legislation.  Obviously, I will have to prioritise and that will be part of the health strategy report which will be ready by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the amendment before us, but having listened with interest to the Minister's contribution I support him.  I am not an expert, but I understand the effect of the female oral contraceptive on the individual can vary.  For that reason we have to be cautious and allow contraceptives to be prescribed only by those who are qualified and have the necessary expertise. With today's alternative medicine quickly establishing itself we have to be careful to avoid a situation whereby very serious damage is caused to a person because strict prescribing procedures have not been followed.  We must examine the Acts concerned and decide whether it would be appropriate to widen <Col N="1802" /> availability through the mechanism outlined in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 2:</P>
      <P>`2A&mdash;The Minister for Health shall provide in conjunction with the Department of Education, a Health and Lifeskills programme of education with the objective of promoting an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of considerable importance.  It is self-explanatory and is an amendment of the type proposed on the last occasion when the legislation was discussed.  Having regard to the fact that <Col N="1803" /> we are liberalising our condom laws and allowing for greater access to condoms it is important that we do not send out the wrong signals to our young people.  It is important once we allow for greater accessibility that we bear in mind the importance of education and information aimed at sexual behaviour of an irresponsible type.  I am disappointed that during the past number of years no initiative of any substance has been taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>Our schools which are the basic educational establishments in preparing our young people for life have a role in ensuring that information on life skills is available. It is somewhat unusual &mdash; I say this without, intentionally, being seen as a philistine &mdash; that Latin and Greek are still taught in some of our schools while we do not have any course on life skills or human relations.  Regardless of the use to which a person may put Latin or Greek and regardless of the benefit from a course in classics, considerable benefit is to be gained from a life skills course and a comprehensive sex education course.</P>
    <P>The reason we were so coy in this regard was, perhaps, the religious influence in many of our schools.  That should not be a barrier or a disincentive to us as legislators in ensuring that there is within the community a proper understanding and appreciation of what is involved in human relationships.</P>
    <P>Statistics on unwanted teenage pregnancies indicate the absense of information available to young people.  It was remarkable in the recently published report of the Kilkenny case that the person in the spotlight stated she was at an advanced stage of pregnancy before she realised she was pregnant.  Such is the level of ignorance in the community that there is a responsibility on the Government and on legislators to ensure that information is not only accessible but, more importantly, is available through a school course.</P>
    <P>I realise that this amendment could involve a possible charge for the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It should be taken seriously, particularly when we are enacting legislation that will allow for the availability of condoms in areas which young people frequent.  It is important that we have a whole new initiative in the area of sex education in our schools.  In his response, perhaps the Minister would clarify the division of responsibility between himself and the Minister for Education.  I do not wish to pre-empt what he will say but I would be extremely unhappy if he says it is not his responsibility but that it should be taken up with the appropriate Minister at the appropriate time.  I expect a lot more from him. The amendment is so important that it should be incorporated in the Bill.  If the legislation was to go through the House today without a division it would open a new chapter, in terms of the treatment by this House and its Members of family planning legislation.  I would be reluctant to withdraw the amendment in any circumstances, with the exception of an absolute commitment from the Minister that the whole area of sex education and human understanding will be taken on board by the Government having regard to the huge level of ignorance in society.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 argues the case for a programme of education and information which, I have no doubt, costs money.  There is an anomaly here in that amendment No. 2 has been ruled out of order.  I appreciate the Chair's interpretation of it.  Amendment No. 2 relates to a key factor which is missing from the Bill and we cannot disregard it.  If we disregard the principle of free availability to medical card holders, we are really knocking the whole system out of kilter and being blind to the reality of how life is lived.  It would be important to pay tribute to politicians, and women in particular, who raised the issue of contraception at a time when it was neither profitable nor politically popular to do so.  I am thinking of the women who were vilified for going on the &ldquo;condom train&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> I welcome the liberal rush in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil now.  It has taken a very short time, when one considers the shift that has occurred in public opinion and among politicians, and that there were many people who were pioneers who took a lot of hard knocks to stand by their principles.  One of those principles was that condoms and contraception should be available to all women, not just women who could afford to avail of contraception.</P>
    <P>There are complex attitudes.  I am glad to hear people who oppose this Bill and feel strongly about it.  Even the little story that Deputy Flanagan told about the condom vending machine in, I think, Galway, is an indication that people may, in principle, agree with the availability of condoms but may still feel self-conscious about them or lacking in confidence.</P>
    <P>The principal point I would make is that we are overlooking the cost factor. Unlike the Minister, I am middle aged enough not to be certain about the price of a packet of condoms.  I think it is around £5 a packet.  Cost comes into everything.  One cannot avoid dealing with the question of cost and to simply rub out this amendment is not facing the reality.  One of the advertisements that I felt was effective was the one that depicted the mother of the AIDS victim, and she was speaking to mothers. Mothers often get loaded with the baggage and the responsibility, and that is fair enough, but what happens if one is a mother on a low income and trying to hold a household together in a family where nobody is working and nobody will ever work?  What happens to that mother when she is faced with the responsibility of trying to ensure that her children are safe from HIV infection?  Let us say one of her children is taking drugs.  Let us say another is sexually active, not abnormally so, but a young person who is sexually active.  That mother may well have to make the decision between spending her limited cash on a pair of shoes for the child going to school or on a packet of condoms for the teenager.  We all know the reality of what would happen in that contest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> The Minister and the party he represents have a responsibility to consider the reality of family life, the reality of the one-third of the population who are living in poverty and the high numbers that are young people and children.  If they are people who need to be protected from AIDS and HIV infection, it is up to us to enable them to have that protection and ensuring that it is solely in the marketplace that condoms are going to be available is simply not on.  I ask the Minister, regardless of the amendment going out the window, to take that point on board.</P>
    <P>Also in the context of costs, let me go back to television advertising.  How effective is it?  It is a very costly business and I wonder if this is the best use of limited resources.  I know, for my own part, the most effective notice I ever saw relating to AIDS was in a public lavatory where somebody had put up a small notice advising on the precautions that one needs to take.  I do not know how it came to be there, but it was very effective; it was very discreet and was simply advising people of the dangers.  I wonder about the whole question of television advertising, but I will leave that.</P>
    <P>There are also problems in targeting. In targeting particular sections in the community, having condoms freely available enables the services to target at risk behaviour and we have to have flexibility for medical card holders in the context of free availability.  We also have to consider the geographic inequities that occur at the moment.  I was involved in a family planning service for years in County Wicklow and most of the business done was mail order not locally but from other parts of the country where people could not get contraceptives.  If it were the case that medical card holders could as of right avail of condoms if they needed to, it would tilt the balance and make this legislation much more acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have made the point already in relation to information and education so I do not have to repeat myself on that score.  However, I would ask that the core point be taken on board by the Minister, that unless it becomes a true prophylactic, <Col N="1807" /> unless it becomes part of medical treatment, health promotion, ill-health prevention and is included in the medical card system, we will be only servicing those people who can afford to be serviced and that is wrong and is ensuring that rather than winning the battle against AIDS we are hampering ourselves before we start.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus raised the question of a charge on the Exchequer.

      <P>This is the third time in the short space of three years that we have been debating health and family planning amendments.  This amendment brings much needed balance to the whole issue. There is a sizeable section of the population that would be reflected by my two colleagues, Deputies Boylan and McCormack, who feel that the only response this House has to the whole question of AIDS, unwanted pregnancies etc., is to throw condoms at the issues.  The Minister's words have been quoted back to him on many occasions since he became Minister for Health.  However, I want to remind him of what he said the last time we debated this issue.  He said, &ldquo;I support the notion of the amendment put forward by Fine Gael in relation to the provision of adequate education programmes.  The education is extremely important and should be addressed in a Bill and a debate of this type&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment brings much needed balance to the debate.  One cannot legislate for morality.  We have to legislate for the reality that confronts us.  The greater availability of condoms is a very necessary response to the AIDS epidemic and other sexually transmitted diseases. There is room for manoeuvre in a Bill like this and I hope the Minister will <Col N="1808" /> accept the very reasonable amendments tabled by Deputies Flanagan and McManus.  I anxiously await the Minister's response to these amendments in view of what he said on previous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody would be against the provision of education.  It is vital that all our young people understand not only the physical aspects of sex but what is euphemistically referred to here as &ldquo;responsible sex&rdquo;.  The difference of opinion relates to what acting responsibily means and how men should act towards women.  Many of us have reservations about this whole issue because it might give the impression that men, particularly young men, should consider that women are there for their personal gratification and that in the act of sex they have no responsibility consequentially. We all know that many people adopt that attitude.  It is a totally anti-woman attitude.  In many unwanted pregnancies the man will flee, adopting the attitude that it was not his problem and that the woman should have taken precautions.  I have always objected to that attitude.  I consider all issues to be issues of morality.  The social welfare Bill is surely an issue of morality.  I do not understand how morality in its broadest concept does not enter this debate as it enters every facet of our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great Christian principle of loving one's neighbour, not hurting other people, should be the ordaining feature of all legislation whether it relates to granting aid to the Third World, helping the poor, providing hospital services or collecting taxes in order to provide services. They are matters of morality, they involve the principle of helping other people.  I expect the same judgment and standard to be applied in regard to what we encourage in society as standard behaviour between human beings.  I do not subscribe to the idea that is often promoted that people are there to be used and that all young people engage in sexual activity.  That is not true; if it were it would not be in the interests of young <Col N="1809" /> women here.  It would give rise to a malecentric world, the advantage resting with the man and if a woman became pregnant she would be left to deal with the problem. That is an image of society I could not accept.  There are not many Members who want that type of society.  I am sure they would prefer a society that promoted in our young people values that would be thorough in practical and technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>Our education system should also lay emphasis on the need for people who engage in sex to be willing to make the commitment to accept responsibility for their actions.  Education in this regard would be more effective than the promotion of the use of condoms.  I do not accept the view that condoms are not freely available.  This Bill will not lead to a decrease in the number of unwanted pregnancies or AIDS cases.  However, the position would change if men were made responsible for the consequences of their sexual activity.  For example, if women could claim damages against partners for stress caused during an unwanted pregnancy, I am sure men would take more responsibility for their actions and that would be welcome.</P>
    <P>We should provide sex education but we should be realistic also.  We must educate our young people to be responsible in the broadest sense, to have responsibility towards others and not to engage in sexual activity unless they are prepared to accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>It has been proven that education is not the only solution to the problem of sexual responsibility.  From a logical point of view most of us find it difficult to understand why people insist on swapping dirty needles after being advised of the risks involved.  It appears to be due to something inherent in some human beings.  We must continue to educate against this practice, but it would be too much to hope that education would provide a Pauline conversion of everyone in society.</P>
    <P>Along with education we must foster an attitude of responsibility among young people.  If this matter is addressed totally <Col N="1810" /> through education it will become like the Irish language.  The children will listen attentively in school because they must do so but when they leave the classroom, like the Irish language, they will leave what they learned behind.  They are in the grown up world and they may think that education does not relate to that world.</P>
    <P>The question of attitude creation was put very succinctly, perhaps more eloquently than I could, by a political correspondent of one of the daily newspapers in an article in a Saturday newspaper some months ago.  That person, not known to have conservative views, succinctly put the point, in respect of this issue, about the creation of an ambience in society whereby our young people seem to consider that they are almost expected to engage in casual sex.  The logical corollary of that view among young people is that if a girl becomes pregnant it is not her partner's problem. I would not like to be part of the creation of that attitude in society because it is unchristian and uncaring.</P>
    <P>The basis of morality when it is stripped of its religious ethos, is the creation of a caring society to minimise the hurt that we all see in our constituency clinics caused by people's uncaring attitudes towards others.  The best education we could give our young people would be to encourage them to be responsible for their actions and be conscious of the need not to hurt others.  I call that morality, others might call it life skills.  I do not care what label is put on it, but the fundamental message we should pass on to our young people is that of morals which relate to sexuality, the Third World, caring for the poor, etc.</P>

      <P>I support the concept of providing a comprehensive educational response in regard to this issue. That response is as important as the free availability of condoms.  Negotiation skills for girls must be taught in school in respect of their role in sexual activity. Boys must be made feel more responsible for the natural and probable consequences of the sexual act.  Boys and men have neglected their responsibilities in this area for too long.  Women have carried the guilt for abortions and unwanted pregnancies and now men must be held equally responsible.  Men must change their attitude towards sexual responsibility.  The long saga of legislation surrounding contraception here is evidence of our inability in the past to tackle the conflicts between Christian morality and the practicalities of sexual health.  I am happy that this legislation is possibly the final step in the long saga of the availabilty of condoms.</P>
      <P>With regard to the large number of women who present for abortions in England and those who decide not to opt for abortion but who have their babies here as single mothers, research has proven that few of those women use condoms or any form of contraception. It is essential that we target young people in our schools in relation to their sexual habits and safe sex practices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement on 19 May of the major action programme on waiting lists in 1993, the relevant agencies have been informed of their individual allocation under the programme and are currently putting the necessary arrangements in place.  The employment of staff is a matter for each agency in the first instance and it will be some time before my Department has an overview of additional recruitment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The main impact of this initiative will be in the form of short term temporary employment.  Given the range of options for implementing the initiative in each health board area, e.g. contracting out, after hours working, reopening of beds and extra use of theatres, the total employment impact cannot be predicted with any certainty at this stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the initiative on the £20 million but I put it to the Minister that the relief consequent on this £20 million will be merely temporary and that, in effect, what is happening in hospitals is the postponement of elective surgery to allow for the use of the theatres to crack his waiting list and that the same staff will be employed.  It is gravely disappointing that the Minister has not stated there would be one new appointment of a permanent nature in the health care area arising out of the spending of £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised that the Deputy opposite would give a less than enthusiastic welcome for this initiative. <Col N="1813" /> An additional 17,254 procedures will take place this year.  I have contracted out the normal requirements in advance and I was careful to ring fence the £20 million to ensure it would not simply be absorbed in current procedures.  An additional 17,254 operations in the range of areas I outlined, ENT, opthalmology, orthopaedics and plastic surgery, will be carried out.  I know the Deputy opposite welcomed my announcement in relation to Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise. There will be be improvements around the country in terms of facilities.  There will be recruitment, some temporary, and better utilisation of available resources. The main thrust of the initiative will have a considerable impact on those waiting for vital procedures for a long time.</P>

Could the Minister elaborate on a point made in his brief reply when he stated that the object of the exercise was the re-opening of beds? Could the Minister be specific on the re-opening of beds?  Would he not accept that what is taking place in hospitals is the widespread closure of beds during the months of June, July and August?  Could I ask the Minister to reply to the point made in my initial supplementary?  Will he confirm that in order to clear the waiting lists the postponement of elective surgery on a wide scale basis is occurring in many of our hospitals?  This is postponed until the end of the year and the £20 million initiative will be successful only in so far as it will clear waiting lists in the areas of ENT and orthopaedic surgery.

      <P>Nos. 1 and 30 are being taken together.  In relation to the bed closures, because of this initiative there will be fewer this year than any previous year.  Bed closures are a feature of hospital services in every country.  Consultants, doctors and nurses take holidays and unless locums are recruited to run the service throughout the year at optimum bed closures in the summer months will take place.  Hospitals programme their lists accordingly and this waiting list initiative will minimise that this year, although it is a normal feature of the service.  The primary impact of this initiative is not to reopen beds, but to make available elective operations to arrange for people who are waiting for longer than 12 months.  A total of 17,254 people will benefit from this initiative.</P>
      <P>In relation to postponement of elective surgery I have said that what I did in relation to this initiative was to deal with each hospital and each health board in advance of their requests for additional procedures.  I was aware of the exact amount of contracted work that was to take place from the initial annual allocation. That was put to one side so that I could ensure that the £20 million would be an addition and would not involve a postponement or reduction of any other service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 28 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous experience has shown that, following adverse publicity about whooping cough vaccine, the number of children being vaccinated falls.  This is regrettable.  Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a severe and highly infectious disease which can have serious short and long term consequences for children who are affected by it.  Whooping cough vaccine has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing and reducing the severity of this disease in children and has significantly reduced illness and death from the disease over many years.  Medical opinion, therefore, strongly supports the widest possible uptake of the whooping cough vaccine.  As with all vaccines doctors take particular care in administering it and guidelines and recommendations <Col N="1816" /> have been issued to doctors in this regard over many years.  Medical specialists in a number of major western countries have now decided that there is no conclusive proof of the whooping cough vaccine causing brain damage.</P>
    <P>In 1975, the question of possible brain damage from whooping cough vaccination became an issue in the United Kingdom and the United States.  As in the USA and the UK a number of persons in Ireland whose children received the vaccine in the late sixties and early seventies and who were brain damaged came together at that time to form the Irish Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children.  Their objectives were to get compensation for their children and to ensure that the vaccination programme was &ldquo;made safer&rdquo; by screening children who had contra-indications to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>As a result of lobbying by the association, an expert medical group was established by the Minister for Health in November 1977, with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To examine persons who, it is claimed, have been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, review the medical information available in relation to them and indicate whether, in their opinion, the damage is attributable to the vaccination.</P>
    <P>The membership of the expert medical group was as follows: Prof. O'Donnell, Chief Medical Officer in Dublin, Dr. Tempany, a paediatrician in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and Dr. Murphy, a neurologist in St. Laurence's and Jervis Street Hospitals, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The expert group examined a total of 93 persons.  Of the 93 cases, the group found there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of the cases.  Of these cases at least two were considered borderline and the group gave them the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>I should add the expert group had completed its work prior to the publication of subsequent studies which concluded <Col N="1817" /> that the vaccine did not cause long term neurological damage.</P>
    <P>In September 1982 on offer of an exgratia payment of £10,000 was made in each of the 14 cases from the initial group of 54 where the expert medical group has found in favour of the children.  This offer was also made on 30 March 1984 to the parents of two further persons considered to be damaged by the vaccine, from the second group of 39.  In its covering letter the Department stated that it did not accept any liability on the part of the State or any public authority in respect of the child's disability.  A condition of acceptance of the payment was that persons could not take any action against the State.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers for Health have held the view that information which was made available to the expert group was confidential to that group and could not be made available to parents.  In the light of the outcome of the Best case, I have decided to release the files if requested to do so by representatives of the people involved.  I have also indicated to the Irish Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children that I will be happy to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply.  I agree with him in regard to the overwhelming evidence of success of the whooping cough vaccine.  Nevertheless, will the Minister accept that his Department has been somewhat tardy in the release of information in this regard? Will he confirm that statements by officials of his Department and health board officials to the effect that record numbers and batch numbers of vaccines were not kept and that batch numbers were destroyed in a fire in an Eastern Health Board office some time ago are incorrect?  I hope that for the first time in 20 years here will be an upfront approach by the Department of Health in this matter to ensure that parents of children who have been allegedly brain damaged as a result of the vaccine will have immediate and full access to departmental records without need to apply <Col N="1818" /> to the courts, a process which involves considerable expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I understand the difficulty experienced by my predecessors in relation to this matter.  It was understood originally that these files would be available for the information of the expert group and the Department of Health. When I became aware that the files existed in the Department I felt they should be released to the parents involved.  It was necessary to carry out consultations with the doctors involved in the original analysis of the files.  I am of the opinion that the balance of goods lies in favour of giving open access to these files to the families of the children involved and I assure the Deputy and the House that that will be done without access to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in the light of the outcome of the Best case and international research it is accepted by many people that the drug, even if not negligently given, as happened in the Best case, involves an inherent risk to a small number of children? Would the Minister not agree that this is stated in the insert with the vaccine and that in rare cases there is a risk to children?  I accept that in the interests of the common good there should be widespread availability of the vaccine in the community and that confidence in the vaccine should be maintained.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a case to be made for the setting up of a trust fund for the small number of families who have proof that their children were damaged by the vaccine?  Perhaps the Minister will recall the case he made for the setting up of the haemophiliac fund where a moral obligation was placed on the State to compensate people who were damaged as a result of receiving a service from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between the two cases mentioned by the Deputy.  Clearly infection was caused by contaminated blood products <Col N="1819" /> in relation to haemophilia and there was a moral responsibility on the State in this regard.  I have sought evidence in relation to the whooping cough vaccine. This evidence is summarised in an article that appeared in one of yesterday's newspapers written by Doctor John O'Riordan which states:</P>
      <P>Where the normal dose of vaccine is given there is still no firm proof of whooping cough vaccine causing brain damage.  Paediatricians in Britain, Canada and the United States have all reached that conclusion independently.</P>
      <P>We are still providing the three-in-one vaccination which is a very important part of the vaccination process.  It is very important that parents have no fears in relation to the giving of this vaccine.  The procedure is carefully monitored and those children with contra-indicators are identified in advance.  We want to encourage the greatest possible use of this vaccine.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of a trust fund, the Best case has resulted in the establishment of certain legal procedures. I have indicated that I am willing to meet the parents involved and to ensure they have access to all information at my disposal.  That is the path that would be best followed immediately.  No doubt these people are receiving independent legal advice.  The matter of a trust fund is not one for consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister explain the setting up of trust funds and payment schemes in England and Germany on a no fault basis to serve the needs of a finite number of people?  We are talking here about a finite number. As the Minister said, procedures for the giving of the vaccine have improved, the criteria are much more strict and there is greater knowledge in this regard.  Would the Minister not accept that we have a moral obligation to compensate the finite number of people who have been damaged?</P>

      <P>New evidence is coming to light all the time.  It is my information that the compensation funds mentioned by the Deputy are in the process of being wound down as a result of the availability of new evidence.  I have not a closed mind on the issue but there are other avenues open to the parents involved.  They have their own independent advice and so do not need advice from me in the matter. The issue of a trust fund is not one for consideration at present.</P>

      <P>Accepting what the Minister has said about new evidence coming to light, will he not accept that the least he might do is provide basic legal aid for the 30 or 40 people involved? As well as making available the files will he ensure that the legal process undertaken by them is minimised in terms of the expense involved?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the number of children and adults on the waiting list for treatment by dentists and orthodontists in the Dublin area and, specifically, in the North Strand and Quarry Road health centres of Dublin 1, 3 and 7; and the approximate waiting periods for those on the lists.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to children's services the Eastern Health Board aims to examine all school children in specific classes and to provide treatment as necessary. In effect children are being seen in the primary schools while in 2nd, 4th and 6th classes.</P>
      <P>The board have informed me that treatment is provided, if necessary, within a matter of weeks of screening and there are no children on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to all children under the age of 16 years.  The phasing in of extended eligibility will commence later this year.</P>
      <P>In regard to adult dental services the board provides a pain treatment service on demand.  Delays for routine dental treatment have arisen, however, because of pressure on the board's services and 282 persons are awaiting routine treatment in the Cabra dental clinic and 580 are awaiting treatment in the North Strand dental clinic.  The waiting period for routine treatment ranges from 12 to 18 months.  Emergency services for the relief of pain is of course available on demand in these clinics.</P>
      <P>In regard to orthodonics the board has informed me that at present the waiting period for Category A children, those most in need, is approximately three months.  The waiting list for Category B, depending on the severity of the case is between three months and four years.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board's current categorised orthodontic waiting list is as follows: Category A, 14; Category B, 66,999.  The Eastern Health Board maintains a centralised waiting list for orthodontic treatment.  Waiting lists are not maintained on a health centre basis.  In total there are approximately 3,500 children receiving orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is at present drawing up plans to develop their orthodontic services and hope to submit these to my Department in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> The Government has provided £2 million this year for the development of the dental services under the Programme for Government.  The introduction of vocational training, as provided under the Programme for Government, for all newly qualified dentists will significantly improve the provision of services to adults.  Additional funding will also be devoted this year to the provision of orthodontic treatment which will also result in further improvements in the orthodontic services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the selective statistics he has given me will the Minister confirm that in the Dublin area there are more than 11,000 children on waiting lists for dental treatment by orthodontists and in excess of 13,000 adults on the waiting list for dental treatment and that this represents a shameful situation affecting children and adults of low income families? Does the Minister accept that this demonstrates yet again that there is a two-tier health service with a readily available service for those who can afford it and long waiting lists for the poor?  Will the Minister indicate what he intends to do about this waiting list?  For example, is any of the £20 million he recently allocated to deal with waiting lists generally to be spent to ensure that children and adults on the dental waiting lists receive the speedy service to which they are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The £20 million was a specific target commitment for waiting lists in acute hospitals for a range of procedures. It does not include the dental services.  I have provided an additional £2 million this year to improve dental services generally.  I am not satisfied with the level of dental services available to public patients.  I am seeking resources to improve that.  One of the measures which is very important in improving orthodontic services in particular is the hiring of consultant orthodontic specialists in each of the health board areas, a process now coming to fruition.  They are in the process of training the health board dentists in the speciality of orthodontics. <Col N="1823" /> That is already having an impact. Obviously further results are required.  I will be only too happy to impact on the waiting lists particularly to see orthodontists, a very expensive speciality, as soon as those resources become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the North Strand health centre there is a four year waiting list for children needing orthodontic treatment.  The children now being dealt with in that centre went on the waiting list in 1989.  Is the Minister aware that there are only sessional orthodontists servicing that health centre on a part-time basis?  There are half days during the week when nobody in the clinic is available to see those children.  Will the Minister confirm in relation to the area covering the North Stand health centre, that the permanent post of principal dental officer has been vacant for almost four years?  Will the Minister investigate this and ensure that those on the waiting lists in this health centre which services a very disadvantage inner city area get the service to which they are entitled and which they cannot get otherwise, as they cannot afford it?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health I am certainly concerned to ensure that matters adversely affecting public health are dealt with.  I am advised that hogweed poses a certain threat to public safety and in particular to persons who frequent our rivers and streams.  Also, I am advised, children find the weed, with its stiff hollow stem, attractive as a plaything; resulting in injury to the hand, eye and mouth.</P>
      <P>Further studies are needed to determine the extent of its distribution. Accordingly, I have asked my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for the Marine, to consider the introduction of measures for monitoring and controlling the spread of hogweed.</P>

I have asked my colleagues to take account of the point made, that the sap which exudes from the plant can permanently damage the skin of children.  As a child I used it, so I know it is an attractive thing to play with as a blow pipe.  It is a feature of rural life and one that should be taken into account.  I hope in my sojourn in the Department of Health account will be taken of the Deputy's concern.  I will ensure that my colleagues act accordingly.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if it is Government policy to reduce the number of doctors in the GMS and accordingly not to replace some of those retiring or leaving the service; and if the doctor retiring in Drimoleague, County Cork, will be replaced.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the long standing policy of successive Governments that there should be a sufficient number of doctors to allow a reasonable choice for GMS patients and, at the same time, have regard to the questions of viability of practices.</P>
      <P>The annual trend in recent years of an increase in the number of doctors in the general medical services will continue this year.  It is expected that there will be a significant increase in the number of doctors with GMS contracts at the end of this year compared with the position at the end of 1992.  As a result there will be the highest number of doctors providing services to medical card patients since the scheme began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of doctors to the GMS and the filling of vacancies which may arise in a particular area are matters for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board in accordance with the procedures agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation.  As regards the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board is currently examining the general practice situation in Drimoleague with particular regard to the requirements of GMS patients and is expected <Col N="1828" /> to make a decision shortly in regard to the filling of the vacancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is an uncertainty in regard to the optimum numbers involved in a particular practice?  What are his views on the size of the average general practitioner's practise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that the average size of panel has actually dropped in recent years, from 875 on average in 1986 to the expected number of 719 this year. The outturn for last year was 778.  The number of doctors participating in the GMS within the same period has increased from 1,512 to an expected 1,770 by the end of this year.  It is very hard for me to have a clear view of what is the optimum practice; it is something we monitor, comprised of a correlation of a number of factors, such as the efficiency with which patients, who are contracted on a panel, are seen and cared for and the provision of a comprehensive service and locum cover in a practice itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that, in many parts of the country, we are seeing an amalgamation of lists to a degree not seen heretofore?  Would he agree that, unless a policy emanates from his Department on the matter, the result will be similar to that experienced already in many parts of the country, where post offices, Garda stations and schools go, with the general practitioner service now, on line for amalgamation and location in a larger town, thus denying many members of rural communities of a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of manpower issues under the GMS that are being addressed, some bilaterally between management and the Irish Medical Organisation, in relation to the provision of services.  On the broader front, the GMS management side are considering how best to address future management issues in relation to practice, with particular reference to the general medical services.  One option which <Col N="1829" /> has been included in the Department's position is the establishment of a national council for general practice.  There are ongoing reviews in relation to the structure of general practice until the end of this decade and into the next century. The establishment of general practice units within the health boards is a very important additional resource which will encourage and help the development of general practice.  By way of policy, I am strongly of the view that general practice has to be strengthened and the whole, primary delivery of medical services should be a new focus in the health services nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the overall review of the general medical services and doctors' location, does the Minister intend to ensure that patients are located within a reasonable distance of their local doctor?  The tendency in the past has been to see the amalgamation of practices with a greater distance growing between a patient in a rural area and their nearest GMS doctor.  With all the attention now being paid to the survival of rural communities, the Department of Health will have to examine servicing patients in rural communities so that they do not have to travel 50 to 60 miles to their nearest doctor.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister considering job-sharing in the GMS to ensure that the maximum number of doctors can work within the provisions of the scheme while, at the same time, ensuring that job-sharing provides a good return in relation to skills and services on a geographic basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be mindful of the first point the Deputy makes in relation to geographic areas.  It was implicit in what I said in relation to the criterion, that it would be most important that patients on a panel would have ready access to a doctor, particularly in times of emergency.  It is primarily the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health boards, in current legislative terms, but it is certainly one on which the Department would have an overview if there were a trend towards <Col N="1830" /> amalgamation which would impact adversely on the smaller community.</P>
      <P>I should say I am well disposed to the notion of job-sharing throughout the health services.  There have been difficulties experienced in the past in a number of areas, particularly in the nursing area.  Difficulties were put forward for which I could not find a justification. I am hoping that those issues can be resolved so that the maximum number of people can be employed in the health service which it can pay for and, at the same time, while providing the greatest flexibility for staff to enable them change their lifestyles.  I have not a closed mind in relation to job-sharing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>I hope there will be the minimum of delay in this matter.  Will <Col N="1832" /> the Minister accept that the definition of borderline products is causing considerable hardship for many companies operating in the State?  There is a very thin line between what is considered to be a medical preparation and a dietary supplement, such as vitamins and nutrients. In view of the fact that there is now increased usage by the consumer of dietary supplements, such as vitamins, I put it to the Minister that there should be a clear demarcation between the two, given that under the regulations licences and certificates are required.  This presents a problem for many companies which manufacture vitamins.  Will the Minister outline a timeframe within which he will receive this report and give the House a commitment that he will act on it as quickly as possible since I hope he accepts there is confusion?</P>

I have asked that the report be presented to me as soon as possible and I have been advised that I will receive it in the immediate future. As I have indicated to the House, there are guidelines in relation to the interpretation of the medical preparations licensing scheme.  It might be useful to circulate these guidelines.  It is a complicated and long document which contains the definition of borderline products.  It makes the definition reasonably clear.  When I receive the report I will take whatever measures are deemed to be appropriate by the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 22, 69 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently met representatives of the Adoption Board for discussions regarding proposals for the establishment of a national contact register to assist adopted persons and birth parents wishing to be put in touch with one another.  I am firmly of the view that it would be desirable for <Col N="1834" /> an adoption contact register to have a statutory basis.  The question of changing the law to give adopted persons a statutory right of access to their original birth records also falls to be considered in the context of proposals for such a register. If formal arrangements were to be put in place to enable parties to legal adoption proceedings, by mutual consent, to reestablish contact with each other it seems to me that it would be reasonasble to allow the adoptee in such a case a right of access to his or her original birth certificate.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputies will appreciate, it will be far more difficult to address the needs of adopted persons whose birth parents do not desire any contact with them and who want to preserve their anonymity.  Many mothers who have given up a child for adoption did so on the understanding that confidentiality would be maintained and that no identifying information about them would ever be disclosed to the adopted child.  These mothers would be extremely concerned about any proposal to modify the existing legal position in relation to access to birth records.  This is a sensitive human issue which requires very careful consideration in order to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights of birth parents and the needs of adopted persons.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of introducing amending adoption legislation, my absolute legislative priority at present in the area is, as I indicated in the House recently, the preparation of the various sets of new regulations required to give full effect in those key parts of the Child Care Act, 1991, which will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in cases of child abuse.  As the Deputies are aware, the report of the investigation into the County Kilkenny incest case has underlined the need for the immediate implementation of the provision in question. It is my intention that the resources of the new child care policy unit which I am establishing within my Department will be fully committed to this task.  When this objective has been achieved the question <Col N="1835" /> of drafting amending adoption legislation will receive full consideration in the light of developments in the adoption area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is a human rights issue and accept that attitudes have changed considerably during the past two decades on this matter?  Will he further accept that an adult or child adoptee should have a legal right to their original birth certificate? That is the kernel of the matter. I am hazy on what the Minister's attitude is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to remove the fog.  A number of sometimes conflicting human rights are involved, including the rights of the adoptee and those of the birth mother, who in some cases gave up a child on the clear understanding and condition that her anonymity would be protected.  We will have to reflect carefully on the emotional trauma that would be caused in changing the statutory provision to give adopted persons an automatic entitlement to their birth certificate.  While I will have to reflect carefully on this matter, I admit that I do not have a clear view on it.  The complexity of this issue is illustrated by the fact that this was the only question on which the review committee on adoption services, which reported to the Minister for Health in 1984, was in disagreement. The majority recommendation was that under the law persons adopted from that date onwards should be allowed to obtain their original birth certificate on attaining the age of 18.  A significant number dissented from that view.  We must reflect on the matter again, but I have not a closed mind on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that since the committee to which he referred issued its report to the then Minister for Health, Mr. Barry Desmond, in 1984, there has been a shift in emphasis and that if a similar committee was to report today the result would be different?  The Minister referred to a &ldquo;significant <Col N="1836" /> minority&rdquo; but I am not sure about the actual significance of that minority.  I put it to him that the most important point is that as a society our attitude has changed considerably and we are now more open in regard to this matter than we were in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy is saying but it is not merely a question of being more open in regard to this matter.  I am concerned at the implications for the natural mother of changing the law in that regard.  I do not have a closed mind on this matter &mdash; I am minded to support it on the balance of good &mdash; but I do not have a firm, definitive view on it yet.  The views of the Deputies opposite are a help in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister has an open mind on this matter.  Would the Minister not agree that some women put their children up for adoption because the children were conceived as a result of rape or incest? The Minister has raised valid points about the destructive effect unilaterally changing a contract could have on the families of those women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the type of case which would have to be taken into account.  Even if it was correct in the overwhelming number of cases to provide ready access to that information, cases such as the one instanced by the Deputy would give me cause for reflection. I hope we can build a new consensus on this matter when legislation is brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt his sincerity in the matter but I put it to the Minister that he is confusing confidentiality with secrecy.  Perhaps he would reflect on that point for a moment. While it may not be right to give that entitlement to the adopted person in a certain number of cases, if the information was confidential instead of secret, as is the case at present, this would get <Col N="1837" /> over the difficulties referred to by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Having regard to the new wave of medical negligence of a type we have not seen in the past in the medical field, I put it to the Minister that this is a matter of extreme urgency.  Over the past five years we seem to have learnt many of the bad habits of American consumerism so far as medical negligence is concerned.  Having regard to the amount of buck passing within the general practice, the consequences of this for the medical profession are grave.  This may be adding considerably to the log-jam within our hospitals.  General practitioners are afraid to treat patients in the manner in which they would like and in <Col N="1838" /> many instances patients are being unnecessarily referred to hospitals.  May I ask the Minister the exact approach he intends adopting to tackle the issue of the huge fees for cover being extracted from many hospital consultants?  Is he aware that obstetricians' defence rates are now approximately £19,900 a huge sum of money in any language?  Will the Minister endeavour to ensure that the group's proposals are put before him at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I am concerned at the growth in the practice described as defence medicine.  Doctors and consultants who are afraid of litigation refer clients and patients for tests which in their heart of hearts they do not really believe are necessary &mdash; they are safety measures for themselves.  This is unfortunate and is also a waste of the scarce resources for the health services. As I have indicated to the Deputy, an interim report has been made available to me and has been acted upon.  A revised medical indemnity scheme was introduced as a result of the interim report. The scheme provides non-consultant hospital doctors, dentists, community doctors, directors of community care, senior area medical officers and area medical officers with indemnity for their work in the public service on a group basis.  Previously this was done on an individual basis.  This group contract is for three years and it is estimated &mdash; it is very expensive, at more than £3.5 million per annum &mdash; to have resulted in a saving of approximately £1 million to the Exchequer.  I am also aware of the expense for consultants.  That is the next phase of the group's work, and I hope to have that report shortly.  I will then consider how this issue can be addressed.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point the Minister made about consultants, I wish to ask him a particular question which I will illustrate with an example.  Where does the liability lie in a case where a consultant believes his <Col N="1839" /> patient requires a drug which is not readily available because of cost and the patient subsequently has a serious illness due to a lack of this drug?  My example relates to my earlier question regarding Prolastin.  One of my constituents has been told by his consultant that Prolastin would be a major boost to his life.  This man suffers from emphysema arising from a genetic defect.  Two or three people in Ireland suffer from this condition, one of whom, I understand is being treated.  The Mater Hospital is not in a position to provide this drug because of the cost, which is approximately £500 per week.  Where does the liability lie in that case?  Will the Minister undertake to investigate the case relating to Mr. Brendan Richmond of Finglas who is in a life and death situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the cost of premiums for consultants and doctors working in public hospitals. Would the Minister agree that much litigation occurs because the initial complaint is badly handled and the initial consultation process between the aggrieved patient and doctor, consultant or hospital is not properly managed? Much could be done to improve the initial consultation process, which would cut down on the need for this indemnity cover.  Much litigation could be nipped in <Col N="1840" /> the bud if there was good initial consultation between the consultant or doctor and the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is some truth in what the Deputy says.  I do not have a breakdown of the various cases. In fact, it is very hard to get a clear grip of the growth in cases because the medical defence organisations are, by their nature, in competition and they regard much of the information as commercially sensitive.  Many cases are resolved in advance of going to court &mdash; they are not resolved publicly.  It is difficult to be accurate about the number and scale of claims, but I am sure there is some truth in what the Deputy says.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, if we could. Obviously we have a commercial relationship with the companies that provide a service to us and we give the contract to the company which provides the best service, bearing in mind the nature and the cost of the cover provided.  I had expected that we would have more accurate information than is available and I hope we can get more information in the future so that we will know the extent of claims.  We can then see what action we need to take to minimise claims, more than simply increasing premia.</P>

      <P>There are other systems for dealing with this problem.  Will the Minister pursue this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, because to look at the cost of medical liability on its own is not the way to tackle the difficulties.  There is no doubt that the difficulties will increase, as the one thing we know is that the number of cases will continue to grow.  Does he agree that by providing financial inducements to doctors in the general medical service to reduce their drug costs he is putting them at risk of an increasing number of claims from patients?  He has criticised the drug companies for providing inducements to doctors but he is directing such an inducement at them.  Doctors who have chosen cheaper drugs may be putting themselves in a vulnerable position when it comes to claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 50 and 88 together.  Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of <Col N="1843" /> both the applicant and his or her spouse. I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  Some of these are more favourable to disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of disabled people living at home with their parents where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I am, however, concerned that assessment of spouse's earnings is less favourable under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  My Department is examining the implications of bringing the method of assessing spouses' earnings under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme into line with arrangements that apply to social assistance schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that someone in receipt of unemployment assistance who has a working spouse receives the full adult dependant allowance but if he or she becomes ill and incapacitated and is transferred to the disabled person's maintenance allowance, every single penny earned by the spouse is taken into consideration and assessed and therefore there is a net loss of up to £50?  I accept that he indicated in his reply that he is having the matter examined but it has been ongoing for a considerable period of time.  Will he give an indication as to when he will amend the regulation to bring equity into the operation of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says and I indicated so in my initial response.  It works the other way as well, the value of board and lodging at home is taken into account when determining the assistance payment to the unemployed but in similar circumstances a disabled <Col N="1844" /> person gets the full disabled person's maintenance allowance allowance without any deductions for the benefit of board and lodgings.  There are pros and cons but I am mindful of the Deputy's point.  Indeed this has arisen at my clinics and I have raised it with the Department since I took up office.  My personal view &mdash; but obviously I need to put it to my Cabinet colleagues &mdash; is that schemes such as the disabled person's maintenance allowance are more appropriate to be paid from the Department of Social Welfare rather than the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>Every employee of a health board is covered under employees liability insurance for any injuries that occur in the carrying out of statutory duties.  If employees suffer an injury they will be covered and compensated.  That is the present position.  There would be a difficulty in singling out one section of the health board staff, psychiatric nurses, because a range of other workers may well be injured, such as nurses in casualty, in out-patient departments, staff working with the mentally handicapped or in geriatric centres or professional staff such as social workers and others.  A range of people may well be injured in the course of duty.  It is important to have a comprehensive system that applies to all rather than to deal with any particular group in isolation.</P>

There should be more consultant posts, for a number of reasons, one of which is that non-consultant <Col N="1847" /> doctors are, theoretically, in training.  I do not think they should spend such a long portion of their professional life in training.  They should be in positions where they are not with a consultant if there is supposed to be a training element involved.  There is a need to improve the career structure, including opportunities for promotion, and that will create a need for more consultant posts.  Obviously, that will be the end result of the process.</P>

In the reply the Department told me that the information was not readily available and that I would receive it some time later.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we reached this question.  In relation to the resolution of outstanding issues between the parties involved in the move to the proposed new Tallaght Hospital, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the boards of the three hospitals &mdash; the Adelaide, the Meath, and the National Children's Hospital &mdash; have now reached full agreement on the proposed board structures and management for the hospital.  I will be arranging <Col N="1850" /> an early meeting with the three hospitals involved to discuss the putting in place of the necessary legal mechanisms to give effect to the new agreement.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the boards of the three hospitals for the spirit of goodwill and co-operation which characterised the discussions.  I am confident that the agreement now reached will represent a firm foundation on which progress can be made to facilitate a smooth and successful transition to the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the building of the new hospital is that I expect tenders to be invited for the construction of the hospital in the middle of next month, and I am confident that construction will commence before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I avail of the opportunity to compliment him on the manner in which he handled this matter, which was a source of considerable disquiet throughout society.  The appointment of the facilitators was the key to its successful resolution.  May I ask the Minister two questions: first, can he confirm that his party's target for the actual construction of the hospital will be met; and, second, in regard to the new charter for the new hospital, if a change in legislation to required for this, will that legislation be brought before the House, discussed and completed before we rise for the summer recess?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first matter, the target for construction, from the first day I became Minister I sought a timeframe and a chart was drawn up in my Department in the first week showing, on a week by week basis, the most expeditious route to construction.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that every milestone on that target has been reached in the timeframe set out and that construction will commence before the end of this year.  In relation to the charter although there is necessity for legislation, it will not be necessary to have the legislation enacted until the hospital is commissioned, <Col N="1851" /> so it will not be before the summer recess.  I hope we will have agreement as soon as is practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing this very good amendment by Deputy Flanagan to the effect that we should have a health and life skills programme of education in our schools with, generally, the objective of promoting understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality.  On Second Stage I spoke of the real need to have an evaluation of the quality of that educational response.  This amendment goes to the core of that.  The Minister is aware that the stay safe programme, which is an example of such an educational response in our primary schools to make children of primary school age more aware of the dangers of sexual abuse and general bullying, has been enormously successful and welcomed right around the country by parents.  There is some opposition to it but that is to be expected, given the innate conservatism of Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need, and the Minister has said he is in agreement with this, to extend the stay safe programme in amended form to secondary schools.  It may be necessary to put it on a statutory footing to give it impetus and introduce a standard <Col N="1928" /> of quality so that it will not develop in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, depending on the response of individual boards of management, the ethos of the school and the perspective that is put on a good healthy sexual programme in schools.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees in particular should have a very targeted response.  They are dealing with adolescents just at the right age who are a captive audience in schools and colleges during the day.  It would be a good extension of the welfare role of teachers to go into this area of life skills and relationship skills.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the great worry I have about the escalation in the number of live births to single mothers in the State.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office show the number of births outside marriage as a percentage of total births. In 1980 it was 5 per cent; in 1984 it was 8 per cent; in 1988 it was 11.9 per cent and in 1992 it was 18 per cent.  That means that one in five children is born outside marriage and this is particularly marked in the 15 to 24 age group.  The great majority of those births, two thirds, are the woman's first child.</P>
    <P>This points to the real need to get the message across to young women and men of the need to take the necessary precautions. Too often in the past it has been left to the women to bear the responsibility and the subsequent guilt of an unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support this amendment and hope that the Minister will respond by taking it on board.  I am not sure whether it will involve a charge on the Exchequer but that may well be necessary in order to launch the stay safe programme in secondary schools in amended form.  It may be necessary for the Department of Education to introduce legislation to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on Second Stage.  This morning the Minister said that we have moved a long way from the era of Irish solutions to Irish problems but, believe it or not, I believe that the 1979 legislation <Col N="1929" /> was progressive for the time.  It was a time when AIDS had not been discovered.  Irish society has changed dramatically since 1979.  In these days of EC bureaucracy sometimes an Irish solution to an Irish problem might be better than imposing a doctrinaire, ideological continental solution to issues.  In future perhaps we should have more Irish solutions to Irish problems.</P>

Regarding the provision of condoms under medical cards, I understood that when the 1992 legislation was debated the only outstanding issue was the question of vending machines.  The Minister is dealing with that issue in this legislation, but there appears to be another issue on the agenda &mdash; the provision of condoms through the medical cards system.</P>

      <P>Hopefully this legislation will finally address the issue. Regarding education, there is no doubt that most children today learn the facts of life in the schoolyard.  That is how it has always been and it is most unsatisfactory. The education children get in the schoolyard is incomplete, inadequate, often confusing and may cause problems. There is no doubt that something must be done in that area.  Our education system is far too academic and it does not place enough emphasis on education in respect of relationships and the practical issues of life, for example, budget management and so on.  This amendment should also be addressed to the Minister for Education.  There is no doubt that education in relation to sexuality and relationships is inadequate at present.  I have no doubt the Minister will say this is a matter for the Minister for Education and perhaps that is something we may pursue at a later stage.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I find it somewhat disconcerting to stand here with no paternal claim to fame in the presence of Deputies Haughey and Flanagan.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Flanagan's amendment. No matter how serious the question of AIDS and HIV infection is we must not lose sight of other aspects of this issue.  We must face the dreadful scourge of AIDS, we cannot shy away from addressing that problem.  It is important that we maintain a balance and uphold standards in sexual relationships. <Col N="1931" /> Regarding the introduction of a programme for schools which would encourage that, an appreciation of responsible sexuality is a <i>sine quo non</i> to use words of a forgotten language.  I am somewhat concerned about Deputy McManus's amendment which proposes to provide information as to the safest and most effective use of contraceptive sheaths.  I would be worried if you have just a lesson on how to use condoms you are suggesting, &ldquo;this is what your life is about, this is what you should de doing&rdquo;.  If the lesson was geared towards responsible sexual behaviour it would be beneficial to students.  It is important that standards are set and I do not subscribe to the argument that because condoms are available everybody should be promiscuous. However, there are standards and everybody need not be sexually active.  I do not know if people are as sexually active as reported in the media. I cannot comment on that.  We should uphold certain standards and by providing options students could make decisions in regard to their sexual behaviour. I did not appreciate the Minister laughing when Deputy Flanagan anticipated that his answer would be that this matter was not his responsibility.  I suspect the Minister will say that despite everything that has been said and agreed, this is a matter for the Minister for Education. I am pleased this amendment was not ruled out for cost reasons.  All teachers are burdened with extra work and costs do not enter the debate.  I hope the Minister will treat this amendment seriously and that if he cannot deal with it now he will deal with it in the future.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Browne has not read my amendment. I wish to clarify that my amendment does not say that school children should be advised on how to use condoms. I want to have that point clear.  My initial point was that the reason condoms fail is very often because people do not know how to use them.  There was no question of my advising school children <Col N="1932" /> in this regard.  That is not part of my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment which is far-seeing and enlightened. I do not wish to enter into the discussion that has ranged between Deputies Browne and McManus.  Much of what Deputy Browne has said in relation to the wording in the amendment is accurate.  I am convinced that there are more problems associated with the spread of AIDS, unwanted pregnancies and so on, than just the availability of condoms.  Providing vending machines is not the answer to the problem.  Deputy Flanagan's amendment goes a little further towards addressing the major problem. We have a spate of unwanted pregnancies here and it is a problem that must be addressed.  However, supplying free condoms and providing vending machines is not the answer.  There are more aspects of the issue to be addressed.  We need an educational programme.  We must educate our young people in responsible sexuality and an education for living should be brought into the equation as well.  Parents are the primary educators of our young people.  I have heard many people today refer to advertising programmes, the provision of information and so on, but we must not forget that the major responsibility for educating our <Col N="1933" /> young people in all facets of life lies with parents.  They have the major responsibility and when children go to school much of that responsibility is passed to their teachers.  Parents must be involved in the design and delivery of any programme for responsible sexuality or education for living.  I commend this amendment to the House.  I hope the Minister will accept it even though much of its scope lies outside his Department. I am sure he has an input in the Department of Education and he could initiate discussions to develop a programme for educating our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support much of what has been said regarding a programme for education and information.  I have listened to much debate here on this issue as far back as 1979.  I was in the Seanad when the then Minister, Charles Haughey, introduced the 1979 Act.  I did not contribute to that debate but in a debate in 1985 I mentioned particularly the need for consultation, information and education.  There was a need for consultation in 1985 but we have progressed since then.  It is important that the question of education and information be addressed now.  If the Minister says it is a matter for the Minister for Education I hope he will continue his discussions with her on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the discussion here last year when the Minister, Deputy Howlin, quoted me during his contribution, in which he attacked the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government at the time.  It seems that I said in the debate on the 1985 Act that that Bill was &ldquo;likely to undermine the values of young people&rdquo;.  Deputy Howlin said at that time that my comments, and those of other Fianna Fáil Members, were cynical and disgraceful.  I will let others decide on that issue.  I may have changed my view on other issues but I do believe that the wrong message is being put across to young people.  The message of responsibility for their actions has not been made clear except by a few Deputies.  Along with other Members, I was hoping to speak earlier in this debate <Col N="1934" /> but through my own fault I was unable to attend.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Departments of Health and Education must emphasise the need for a programme of education and information.  The question of responsibility on the part of both males and females must be emphasised also.  I hope the Minister can accept some part of this amendment or, if not, discuss with the Minister for Education the important need for information and an education programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Flanagan's amendment.  I anticipate, along with other Deputies, that the Minister will, as it were, wash his hands of this by acknowledging that while it is a good amendment it falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Education. The Minister's Department is the appropriate Department to make available the necessary qualified and skilled personnel, albeit perhaps through the schools, but also, as other Deputies have said, through the holding of night classes. Many people who have left school would benefit from an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality. There is a case for the Department of Health to take a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach to this issue and not to wash its hands of it. The Minister, very effectively, referred to another initiative by the Department of Health, the Stay Safe Programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to this programme extensively when dealing with the Kilkenny incest case, in other words, he was piggy-backing on the Department of Education.  The Minister has introduced this Bill, which I welcome, but he should not now adopt a &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; approach to the issue.  There is a need for education and for young and not so young people to avail of the use of condoms if they so wish.  As other Deputies have said, the use of condoms is not being made compulsory, but condoms are being made available.  It is now up to people who wish to practice safe <Col N="1935" /> sex to avail of this form of contraception if they so choose.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to reject this amendment out of hand.  He should give a commitment here today to do more than just discuss the matter with the Minister for Education.  He should initiate programmes in our schools and, indeed, in our communities generally.  He should utilise the skilled staff and the trained nurses available in our health clinics to extend the programme of education.  It must not be left to our school teachers because many of them may not be sufficiently qualified to discuss these issues and to give the type of advice that young people require.  I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of this amendment and incorporate it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We have had a long discussion in relation to the two amendments that have been taken together and, indeed, the third amendment which is not in order but which was referred to by many Deputies.  I would like to deal with each of them because they merit careful analysis and consideration.  May I impose on the good nature of the Ceann Comhairle and indicate in relation to the amendment not in order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that with the adoption of this Bill there will be no legal prohibition on health boards to provide condoms free of charge to any person? In fact, the free distribution of condoms is already an integral part of our HIV prevention programmes and services in many areas.  There is a difficulty in relation to the GMS.  Non-prescribed products are not currently included and there are a number of products that would properly be considered if I were to go down the road of non-pharmaceutical products.  However, I am unwilling to do that because a range of issues would be raised in that regard.  I will give an undertaking to the Deputy and to the House that I will monitor the difficulties in <Col N="1936" /> uptake for vulnerable people, particularly medical card holders, in relation to the enactment of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus referred to finding useful documentation in public conveniences. That is part of the Department of Health's information campaign and these leaflets are present in many public buildings.  They are a positive information medium.  Not all Government Departments wish to become involved in this campaign.  I am aware of this because I have requested other Government Departments to fund these and not all of them wish to take part in the scheme. I hope the message will go out to all Government Departments.  Deputies opposite, I am sure, will have occasion to visit each Government Department and will, perhaps, raise the issue by way of parliamentary question to my colleagues who have not availed of this service. These leaflets are available also in entertainment centres around the country. This medium of information is a particularly effective one and I am pleased Deputy McManus concurs with that view.</P>
      <P>In relation to the two amendments being taken together, one in the name of Deputy Flanagan and the other in the name of Deputy McManus, the first states that the Minister for Health &ldquo;shall provide in conjunction with the Department of Education, a Health and Lifeskills programme of education with the objective of promoting an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality&rdquo;. The second states that &ldquo;the Minister may, by regulations, provide for a programme of education and information as to the safest and most effective use of contraceptive sheaths&rdquo;.  Virtually all Deputies who spoke anticipated that I might indicate that this is outside the remit of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>Different functions are ascribed by statute to various Departments and the education function is a statutory responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy <Col N="1937" /> Bhreathnach.  I have had discussions with her in relation to the Lifeskills programmes and I agree with the views expressed across the House that a new impetus is required now to stay safe programmes and Lifeskill programmes. These are important in educating young and not so young people in the need for responsible sexuality.  There are people suffering from all forms of inhibitions due to the lack of this type of educational programme.  Hopefully, we can provide for this but it is not appropriate to this legislation.  It is not an education Bill and this amendment could not easily be encompassed in this legislation. However, I accept all the views expressed, and give a commitment to discuss the matter with the Minister for Education. I would say to Deputy Owen that I am not washing my hands in relation to this issue.  I have a responsibility to see how we can collaboratively make progress on it.</P>
      <P>Programmes are in existence already. I am aware of the importance of life skills programmes and of providing information to all people about HIV transmission and AIDS.  The Department of Education has issued guidelines on sex and relationship education for use in secondary schools.  A number of health boards has life skills programmes &mdash; for example, the north-west life skills programme is in operation in all primary and second level schools in that area. Another example is the Bí-Folláin programme of the Mid-Western Health Board which is targeted at primary schools in the mid-western region.  The success of the Bí-Folláin programme has been such that other health boards have applied to have the programme introduced in their areas.  Other health boards also have social and health programmes in schools in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's health promotion unit has in place a number of initiatives which educate and inform the public about HIV and AIDS.  For example, almost 500,000 copies of an information leaflet have been distributed.  School materials produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of <Col N="1938" /> Education have been disseminated to all second-level schools and in-service training in their use was provided for teachers. In addition we have produced a video for use in education settings, almost 400 copies of which have been distributed to youth leaders, teachers, health boards and community groups.  I recommend to Deputies who have not seen this video to look at it because it is very valuable and I was extremely impressed with it.</P>
    <P>Information regarding safe and effective use of condoms is included in these initiatives, as is the issue of relationships and sex education.  Such information will continue to be part of the AIDS information programme.  Consideration is currently being given to the needs of primary schools in the area of AIDS education. Much work is ongoing and much needs to be done.  I will bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Education, the views of Deputies, but I do not believe this amendment is appropriate in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his sincere consideration of the amendment. It is unfortunate he is not prepared to accept it or to act on it.  As the Minister's responsibilities extend to the public health arena he has a duty in this regard, particularly as he is the Minister responsible for family planning legislation.  I see no reason that his responsibility should not include education and a programme of information on this matter.  I would use the parallel of the present AIDS information campaign.  The Minister has never said that the AIDS information programme or HIV preventative measures are not the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  There was not involvement by the Minister for Education in the current information-education campaign being conducted on the television.  I put it to the Minister that his responsibilities are a little more than those which he accepts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accepting the bona fides of what the Minister has said about health promotion in schools, health boards have a function not only in the dissemination of information but in the provision of a locally <Col N="1939" /> focused information facility on family planning matters.  There are health centres in almost ever town and village in the community, many of which are closed for the greater part of the week.  A programme of information and education for adults and young people alike could be undertaken in these areas for the benefit of the community.  Perhaps we should think not just in terms of a schools programme &mdash; a reading of the amendment clearly shows we do not propose to confine such a programme to schools.  We are engaged in the all-embracing task of making information available and pursuing a programme of awareness in the form of an education process.  I am not going to press the amendment.  Maybe I should but I am sure the Minister would use the substantial Government majority to ensure its failure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should arrange to report to the House on his deliberations with his colleague, the Minister for Education, so as to ensure that this matter is addressed <Col N="1940" /> as quickly as possible.  Since our last discussion of similar legislation programme managers have been appointed to the political process.  I suggest that the programme managers of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education work together on this matter to ensure the introduction, with the sanction of Cabinet, of a proper system of education and training of the type envisaged in the amendment.  I regret the Minister has not taken on board the content of an amendment which everybody, without dissent, has reckoned to be entirely plausible, reasonable and sensible.</P>

      <P>This debate has been very useful.  I want to emphasise that I do not disagree with the impact of the Deputies' views.  I am simply concerned about this legislation and it would serve no purpose to insert in it an inappropriate clause if, by common consent, we can achieve the objective of the amendment in another way.  I have outlined to the House the work done to date by health boards.  I intend to encourage all health boards to become involved in similar activities.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; has been used as if the enactment of legislation to provide for freer availability of condoms must be balanced by education.  Many people who traditionally object to the availability of condoms equally trenchantly oppose life skills education.  Many of them oppose the stay safe programme and other initiatives in this regard.  Deputies should not be under any illusion that people who are opposed to this legislation will be in any way placated or balanced by what is perceived to be an education programme. They would see that measure in the same light.  That must be understood.</P>

      <P>In relation to my amendment there is a certain misconception. I am concerned about the tone of the debate since Question Time. The message coming across to me is that somehow young people can be irresponsible and older people are not irresponsible. If my amendment was to relate to any group, it would not be to schoolchildren but to older people.  I put down this amendment bearing in mind the type of person who is likely to avail of a condom vending machine.  They may be schoolchildren but I presume the bulk of them will not be.  The age group that presents as being at risk from HIV infection is from 18 to 40.  Those are the people I am targeting in my amendment.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to provide the opportunity to buy a device but a certain amount of basic information should be provided.  I am not talking about an education programme in schools but about something else.  The Minister has a responsibility in this area.  Perhaps there is an automatic overestimation of the knowledge and responsibility of adults. There was a famous case in recent times where a woman became pregnant where one could say that an adult did not act responsibly.  We are failing to see the point if we are concentrating only on young people or school going children and presuming that everybody else understands the mechanics of condoms and appreciates the responsibility attached to using them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment should be in the Bill. I will not push it to a vote but the point <Col N="1942" /> should be considered again.  I am sure there will be opportunities in regulations to consider the point.  It is not a matter for the Department of Education but for the Department who produced this Bill to enable people to be responsible.  To enable people to be responsible requires the knowledge of how to be responsible.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Health on this section.  He has given a fair and firm commitment on education programmes.  As the Minister said, there are programmes initiated by the Department of Education and also programmes run by the health education unit of the Department of Health and by the health boards.  The House should recognise the commitment of the Minister in this regard.  We should also recognise that the people who oppose this legislation may not be happy with whatever type of educational programme is undertaken by the Departments of Health, Education or any other State Department.  They have opposed the stay safe programme and other such programmes initiated by the Departments of Health and Education.</P>
      <P>I support this legislation.  It is pragmatic and much needed.</P>

      <P>In section 3 the Minister is giving himself a negative power.  He will not intervene in relation to where machines should be placed until he sees how the Act is working and then he might make regulations to prohibit them in some places.  Does that mean that if a person or a group believe that the presence of a machine is offensive, they can mount a campaign and the Minister might find himself making a regulation prohibiting the placing of a machine in that place?  In his speech the Minister says that section 3 might be required in the event of a proliferation of vending machines in places where very young people congregate.  Young people often congregate in hotels and in other places of public resort.  It would not be their <Col N="1943" /> normal place of congregation but they congregate in such places.  I would like the Minister's assurance that he will not make the effect of this Bill null by giving in to objections to certain locations.  I would have preferred had the Minister indicated what he thought would be an inappropriate place so that people would know where not to put them and everywhere else would be open.  Will the Minister assure me that this section will not be used to return to the pre-1975 situation?</P>

      <P>We have made a significant step forward by allowing vending machines.  We are removing the regulations that govern the sale of condoms and the age barrier for the purchase of them.  On balance, I decided to keep this power.  Only two powers are left to the Minister for Health in relation to condoms. The Minister may prescribe certain locations, because it is possible, particularly in the case of outdoor vending machines which will probably become available here, that there would be inappropriate locations for such machines.  I do not foresee, for instance, any school board or management installing a condom vending machine in a school.  I would deem such location to be inappropriate and unsuitable.  It is theoretically possible, and the argument was put to me, that outdoor condom vending machines could be sited in locations that would be deliberately offensive to people.  I felt we would have to have some residual power to ensure that that did not happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was thinking more of one being sited beside a church or place of worship, which would be inappropriate and might give offence to some people.  We should be sensible about their location.  The idea simply is that sexually active people would have ready and easy recourse to condoms.  That is the import of this Bill.  It is as simple as that.  We can do that without giving <Col N="1944" /> offence to other people, who are entitled to have different views, whose sensitivities and sensibilities in this matter are entitled to be protected.  That is the simple impact of this reserved power.  I genuinely do not foresee it ever being used.</P>
      <P>The only other provision with which we might deal in a few minutes is that in relation to the quality of condoms.  If we are to have an effective prophylactic in preventing the transmission of disease we must have set, clear standards.</P>
      <P>Those are the only two residual powers I reserve to the Minister of Health.  I think both are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the Minister's wisdom in this regard since, in section 3 (1) he has retained power to regulate in the negative.  I would consider it to be of extreme importance that the Minister would issue guidelines on places that might be considered unsuitable for condom-vending machines.  Since this debate began the Minister has mentioned two locations only, schools and churches. I would take it for granted that it would cause extreme offence to many members of the community were condom vending machines to be installed in either of those locations.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about areas in which perhaps different companies might compete for prime space within a specific location.  What about that?  Has the Department drawn up guidelines or regulations to prohibit a multiplicity of machines in certain locations?  The Minister mentioned in the course of his Second Stage remarks internal or external locations.  I do believe that regulations should be laid down as to locations the Minister regards as being unsuitable. These should be outlined.  If he is not going to do that, at least his Department should issue guidelines as to the unsuitability of certain areas.  Otherwise, it might not be too long before the Minister would be forced into making regulations. The Minister should give a lead in this regard and issue guidelines for the benefit of everybody involved.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy Flanagan says, I am afraid I must disagree with him.  The wrong thing for me to do would be to introduce legislation containing a list of places where I think condom vending machines should not be sited.  I do not foresee that being necessary.  That would be the wrong signal to give.  I believe that commercial companies involved in the production or distribution of condoms will find appropriate locations.  They will not, on a commercial basis, give offence to anybody because they are in the business of satisfying consumers; that is what it is about.  I have reserved this residual power in the event of its being necessary.  It has been inserted as a safety net to ensure that power is vested in the Minister to take action if and when that should be appropriate. I do not foresee any commercial company causing people deliberate offence.  If they do, certainly I will take action to ensure that such offence is eliminated. It would be the wrong tactic for me to gather round my advisers and rack my brains on all the places of installation that might give offence to somebody.  I am sure any such list would be inexhaustive. Reserving residual power to take action, in the event of somebody acting irresponsibly, is by far the better avenue to travel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Year in, year out I continue to raise this matter without receiving any response whatsoever.  I am talking about the wholesale destruction of wildlife habitats in this country.</P>
      <P>I raised this question originally this year in the middle of the nesting season. That was in April last when I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance.  My question was not totally honest because I tabled it in the name of Deputy Timmins since my own quota for questions on Finance had been virtually exhausted that day.  The answer given to the question was so irrelevant and insufficient I felt I had to raise it in the House on the Adjournment.  My question referred to wildlife habitats in general, bird nesting in particular, and the destruction of the specific areas in which these wildlife species breed.</P>
      <P>The reply consisted of five different parts, the first referring to all the protection afforded wildlife in our national parks.  That does not consist even of 5 per cent of the total area of the country. The second part of the reply stated that the Office of Public Works, whose responsibility it is to protect wildlife, do so in conjunction with landowners.  That is a complete misnomer since that does not happen.  The third part of the reply refers to something of which we have all long been aware, which is that one cannot light fires within a mile of any forestry. This law has obtained since the year of dot.  It was not the information I was seeking in my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth part of the reply stated that, under section 40 of the Wildlife Act, it is an offence to destroy, by burning or otherwise between 15 April and 31 August, vegetation grown on any land <Col N="1947" /> not being cultivated for agriculture or forestry.</P>
    <P>There is no control in regard to the burning or cutting of vegetation, be it hedgerows or other habitats.  Never have I seen such destruction as I saw this year during the bird nesting and breeding season when mountain sides were set alight, particularly in the month of April and the first two weeks of May when vegetation was dry.  It is a disgrace that we are not protecting wildlife habitats. As a result entire species are being destroyed.  Because of our neglect the 1976 Wildlife Act means nothing; it is not worth the paper it is written on.  If we are not prepared to implement the law we would be better off scrapping it.</P>
    <P>We speak about interpretative centres in Mullaghmore and other areas but because of our neglect the most valuable part of our heritage is being wilfully destroyed.  I am raising the matter in the House today to have a stop put to this. First and foremost, the wildlife section should not be operating under the auspices of the Department of Finance but rather the Department of the Environment. A realistic effort should be made to safeguard wildlife because entire species of song birds and other wildlife are being wiped out.  These include the skylark, grouse, woodcock and other birds which live in rough woodland, undergrowth and on the mountain side.  As things stand they do not have a chance because of our neglect.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher who is deputising for the Minister for Finance, to do something. I am aware that it is the intention of the Government to amend the Wildlife Act but these amendments could just be as worthless.  The Minister of State should see to it that wildlife is protected because at present no back-up services are provided.  The legislation has had no effect.  I want us to reach a stage where wildlife is genuinely protected.</P>

      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is responsible for the implementation of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which provides a measure of protection for flora and fauna and their habitats. In areas that the Office of Public Works has control e.g. national parks, nature reserves and refuges for fauna, there is strict protection for wildlife habitats and species.</P>
      <P>There are provisions under the Wildlife Act which prohibit the burning of vegetation growing within one mile of a wood which is not the property of such person, or a nature reserve or refuge for fauna.  Deputy Deasy made reference to the Department of the Environment and I am sure that it could play an important role in this regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cutting of hedgerows I have arranged that the National Parks and Wildlife Service write to all the county councils pointing out our concern and asking them to take due care of bird nesting places at this time of year.  I also take this opportunity to appeal to the public to take care at this time and show some consideration for our birds and wildlife.  Conservation of habitats is a vital element in any wildlife conservation programme.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is also committed to the conservation of Irish peatlands. Its target is to conserve 10,000 hectares of raised bog and 40,000 of blanket bog.  It has acquired to date 2,200 hectares of raised bog and 20,700 hectares of blanket bog with assistance from the EC.  The area under its control is increasing annually.  The Government has made a further £550,000 available in 1993 for land acquisition for parks and wildlife and provides matching funds to take full advantage of the relevant EC financial regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service also implements the Birds Directive and 20 special protection areas have been designated.  It is hoped to designate 12 more with a view to advancing Ireland's obligations under this Directive.  This will <Col N="1949" /> provide for the protection of the habitats of endangered bird species and for the prevention of excessive disturbance of the species in these areas.  From 1994 we will also be obliged to implement the Habitats Directive in addition to various conventions and international agreements to ensure that sites of international importance are protected.</P>
    <P>There is also a scheme underway to designate a million and a quarter acres of land, that is, about 7 per cent of the territory of the State as new natural heritage areas.  These are the most important areas for conservation of Ireland's native flora and fauna.  They will include raised bogs, blanket bogs, sand dune systems, wetlands, estuaries, important bird areas, woodlands and other areas of nature conservation interest.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the scheme is to safeguard the most important areas with regard to nature conservation of our countryside.  Farmers will be notified of where the areas are and why it is important to conserve them.  There will be consultation on boundaries and farmers will be able to benefit, through the extension of the environmentally sensitive areas scheme.  This is being dealt with by the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry.  It is also hoped to bring in legislation giving statutory protection to these natural heritage areas.</P>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service maintains close links with a wide variety of public and private organisations with a view to advancing conservation measures.  It also carries out an important role in furthering public awareness of the importance of our wildlife heritage and the need for protection of our wildlife habitats.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - GPA Group Takeover.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  Before the General Electric takeover of the GPA Group the <Col N="1950" /> Government decided on 20 March that it would directly take up Aer Lingus's rights and that the proposed $20 million investment would be channelled through Shannon Development.  I presume the gesture was designed to send out positive signals to the other shareholders at a time when GPA could not access any further funding from banks or from the bond markets until a feasible restructuring plan was put in place acceptable to the creditors.</P>
      <P>Whatever the wisdom of that decision &mdash; and my party shares the widespread concern at the decline in the fortunes of GPA &mdash; it must be re-examined in the aftermath of the GE takeover.  I am not merely concerned about GPA's future in Shannon but I am acutely concerned for the successful continuation of Shannon Aerospace owned in three equal shares by Swissair, Lufthansa and GPA.</P>
      <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke.  Does the Government decision to inject $20 million of taxpayers' money into GE-GPA still stand? Have the Minister and SFADCo carried out a due diligence study of the group? Is it the case that GPA's assets are between 58 per cent and 77 per cent of company debts?  Can the Minister assure the House that GE is not engaged in asset stripping the best assets to pay off bond holders?  Is it the case that while stripping the assets GE is taking no responsibility for the debts?  Does he agree that secured creditors and shareholders are getting the worst deal and only shareholders directly exposed will invest in the new arrangement? In particular, may I ask the Minister if her Department has a copy of the GPA submission of 13 May to the American Securities Commission?  May I also ask her if she has a copy of the M. J. Whitton analysis of 21 May?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that it is no more than prudent management on the Government's part to have answers to those questions before $20 million of taxpayers' money is put at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to say whether any discussions have taken place <Col N="1951" /> with the principals of Shannon Aerospace. Is it the case that Shannon Aerospace is dependent on GPA?  I think not. Although it was ostensibly set up to service the GPA short-haul fleet, less than 30 per cent of this fleet operates in Europe.  Much of the current order book is for maintenance of non-GPA aircraft. Swissair appears to be finding most of the business for Shannon Aerospace and contributing most in terms of management. The extent to which the future of Shannon Aerospace is inextricably linked to GPA must be examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>The retention of wealth-creating jobs at GPA and Shannon Aerospace is paramount. However, due diligence studies are necessary before we can establish whether an equity injection is the best way of achieving this objective.  I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to answer those specific questions.  If she is not in a position to answer them this evening they must be answered before a decision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has uniquely out-manoeuvred me with his last remark. This matter relates to the current status of the Government's proposal to invest approximately £13.7 million of public funds in GPA.  As the Deputy correctly said, I am not in a position to reply to all the Deputy's questions during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is in the public interest that he should do so.  This matter was raised in the House as recently as 13 May.  I understand previous questions were replied to by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Seamus Brennan and by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 13 May the newpapers referred to a reported agreement between GPA and General Electric Capital Corporation in <Col N="1952" /> respect of a £1.35 billion aircraft transaction and a related option to purchase an equity interest of between 65 per cent and 80 per cent in GPA under certain conditions.  It has been repeatedly stated since then that the Department, the Minister and the Government intend to await the outcome of discussions which Shannon Development hopes to have with GPA.  The outcome of those discussions will be relayed to the Government and decisions taken.</P>
    <P>There have been major changes in the circumstances surrounding this matter during the past number of weeks. Obviously Shannon Development is keeping in close contact with all of the relevant parties.  The Department has been kept informed of developments on a confidential basis.  I understand no imminent decision will be taken by Shannon Development on this matter.  That is the point of concern to Deputy Rabbitte and I am sure to other Members of the House.  On the one hand there is the legitimate recognition of the need to retain jobs and on the other the equally legitimate need to preserve and guard public funds.  Those are the two items on the agenda, so to speak.  I assure Deputy Rabbitte that no imminent decision will be taken and that there is very close contact between Shannon Development and the parties concerned and between Shannon Development and the Department. I cannot give the Deputy full answers to his specific questions across the floor of the House but I will obtain the answers for him and send them to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise a matter which has annoyed me for some considerable time, relating to a woman who suffered an occupational injury some years ago and was deemed to be disabled to a certain extent.  I have no great difficulty with that aspect of the matter but I am annoyed at the degree to which she can improve or disimprove, <Col N="1953" /> depending on the medical referee who carries out the examination.  It has been established by her medical consultant that she is permanently disabled to a certain extent.  I cannot understand why repeated medical examinations carried out by the Department of Social Welfare pronounced her as being 70 per cent disabled at one time and 30 per cent disabled at another time&mdash;I think she was deemed to be 40 per cent disabled at the time the parliamentary question was put down.</P>
      <P>A decision should be made in this case once and for all.  Another branch of the Department has deemed this woman to be sufficiently disabled to be eligible for invalidity pension.  Instead of all these contradictory examinations, it would be better if one examination was carried out by a person who has some common sense. Her consultant would verify the findings of such an examination.  This would eliminate the need for further examinations. Unfortunately this woman's condition has got progressively worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare who is unable to be present to reply to this matter.</P>
      <P>Disablement benefit is one of the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme and is designed to provide compensation for workers who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an occupational injury or disease.  The rate of benefit payable depends on the degree of the person's disablement as assessed by the chief medical adviser of the Department following medical examination of the claimant by a medical referee.  The legislation provides that provisional assessments of disablement may be made for appropriate periods in any case where it is considered that the medical condition of the person will possibly further change as a result of the occupational accident or disease concerned and where a final assessment is not, therefore, possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is given a provisional assessment initially, the position is reviewed periodically by way of further <Col N="1954" /> medical examinations by the medical referee until such time as a final assessment can be made.  If, as frequently happens, it takes a considerable period&mdash;sometimes many years &mdash; before a final assessment can be made, a person may have a number of provisional assessments. During the provisional period, the level of assessment can vary depending on the degree of change in the person's medical condition.  As the Deputy will be aware, a further feature of the legislation is that, for payment purposes, the level of assessment is rounded up or down to the nearest 10 per cent.  This provision effectively recognises that assessments are liable to variation.</P>
    <P>In the case in question, the person concerned is in receipt of disablement benefit since December 1985.  The degree of her disablement has been assessed at various levels since then.  It is not yet possible to make a final assessment in her case.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the appeals officer assessed her disablement at 35 per cent which, in accordance with the legislation, was rounded up to 40 per cent for payment purposes.  She was examined again by a medical referee on 30 April 1993, as a result of which the degree of disablement was assessed at 30 per cent.  She was accordingly notified that the rate of disablement benefit payable to her with effect from 28 May 1993 was being reduced.</P>
    <P>However, arising from the representations made by the Deputy on her behalf, her case was referred to the chief medical adviser to re-examine the position. The chief medical adviser concluded that, having regard to the previous findings in the case and to the relatively short period which had elapsed since the 35 per cent assessment had been made, that level of assessment could continue to apply pending further medical review. Accordingly the level of payment which applied up to 27 May 1993, that is £31.40, will continue to apply for the present.</P>
    <P>The Deputy had indicated that the person's condition was considerably worse than when she first claimed and that this was verifiable by her own doctor.  In <Col N="1955" /> accordance with normal practice, when the person was called for medical referee examination on 30 April 1993, the doctor was notified and invited to submit a report on the case.  However there is no trace in my Department of such a report being received.  The doctor was also invited to attend the medical referee examination if he so wished but did not do so.</P>
    <P>Medical evidence has been submitted on her behalf in the past.  The last such evidence was a report dated 8 December 1992 from her consultant orthopaedic surgeon which was submitted in connection with an appeal that was pending at the time.  This report was taken into consideration by the appeals officer.  It was also submitted to the chief medical officer with the other medical papers in this case when he was asked recently to review the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that this case was dealt with properly and fairly.  A problem which arose in her case was that a reduction from 35 to 30 per cent in the level of assessment would have resulted in a reduction of 10 per cent in the rate of benefit.  However, as I mentioned, this is in accordance with the legislation. And, of course, this provision can also work to the advantage of clients generally as it did in her case when the assessment of 35 per cent made by the appeals officer was increased for payment purposes to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision it is open to her to appeal against it by writing to the chief appeals officer indicating the grounds on which she bases her case and enclosing any medical evidence in support of the appeal.  I urge Deputy Durkan to inform that lady to appeal the case and to ensure that the doctor submits the report, which is missing from her first appeal.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht anseo tráthnóna agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire Stáit Ghaeltachta i láthair mar go mbaineann an cheist seo le scoil Ghaeltachta, agus le hoileán, an cineál faidhbe atá sé féin agus mé féin mar Theachtaí Dála ag plé leis chuile lá. An scoil atá i gceist anseo ná bunscoil Inis Meáin.  Bhí, de réir rialacha na Roinne, múinteoir amháin ón scoil sin le cur ar an bpainéal agus tuigtear dom gur déanadh amhlaidh nuair a thit líon na scoláirí faoin líon ina gcoinnítear beirt oide i scoil. Tuigtear dom go bhfuil méadú le teacht ar na huimhreacha sin agus go mbeidh 25 dhuine sa scoil an fómhar seo chugainn. Ar an ábhar sin bheinn ag súil go mbainfí an múinteoir den phainéal agus go bhfágfaí an dara hoide sa scoil.</P>
      <P>Ba cheart ceist líon múinteoirí i scoileanna dhá oide atá ag dul a chailliúint múinteoirí go mórmhór in áiteanna ar nós oileáin nach féidir cónascadh a dhéanamh a thógail go ginearálta.  De réir mar a thuigimse é ba thragóid é d'oileán, nó áit mar sin, dá gcaillfí an dara múinteoir.  Níl aon amhras ann ach gur fearr i bhfad níos mó ná dhá oiread an scoil le dhá oide ná aon oide amháin agus go bhfuil sé ag cur ualach dochreidte ar oide bheith ag múineadh mar oide aonarach.  Is é mo bharúil go ginearálta nach ceart go gcaillfeadh aon scoil dhá oide an dara hoide go dtí go mbeadh na lión na ndaltaí chomh híseal le 15 dhuine. Ceapaim go bhfuil sé mídhaonna, ó thaobh na ngasúr agus ó thaobh na múinteoirí de, go mbíonn ar mhúinteoirí múineadh i scoileanna gan aon tacaíocht, gan aon chomhluadar fásta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar atá ráite cheana, tá fadhbanna árachais ann agus fadhbanna freagrachta má éiríonn gasúr tinn.  Má éiríonn m úinteoir tinn, cén chaoi a bhfaighfí cúnamh mura bhfuil an dara duine fásta ann le haire a thabhairt do ghnóthaí na scoile? Sa chás seo tá an scoil lonnaithe i gceann de na Gaeltachtaí is saibhre agus is láidre sa tír.  Is oileán é Inis Meáin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh láidir ann is a bhí riamh agus gura fada buan mar sin é.  Má thosaítear ag baint an infrastruchtúir den <Col N="1957" /> oileán agus má bhaintear na múinteoirí as na scoileanna, titfidh an pobal sin as a chéile agus ní hé go n-iompóidh na daoine ar an mBéarla ach is éard a tharlóidh ag an deireadh nach mbeidh pobal ar bith ann, gur oileán tréigthe ar nós na mBlascoidí a bheidh ann agus go mbeimid ag tógáil iarsmalainne i gcuimhne an phobail.</P>
    <P>Ba thragóid dhúbailte i gcás Inis Meáin é sin mar tá éirithe leis an bpobal, agus go mórmhor le fear amháin atá tar éis monarcha a chur ar bun a bhfuil saothrú ann do os cionn 30 duine, tionscal a chur chun tosaigh ar an oileán agus, ar an gcaoi sin, tá todhchaí ag an oileán.  Is mór le rá ag an oileán sin, mar shampla, go bhfuil luach £1m de tháirgí-olann idir gheansaithe agus éadach á gcur thar sáile acu chomh fada as baile leis an tSeapáin agus go bhfuil siad ar cheann de na honnmhaireoirí is mó sa tír sna gnóthaí seo.  Is oileán é go bhfuil an oiread sin dul chun cinn taispeáinte acu gur thragóid bhreise é dá dtosófaí ag baint na dúshraithe de mar go ndeachthas faoi bhun uimhir dalta atá leagtha síos ag an gcóras maorlathach nach dtuigeann fíorfhadhbanna na ndaoine atá ina gcónaí sna ceantair seo. Ar an ábhar sin táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit breathnú go báúil ar an gcás seo, agus a dhéanamh cinnte ní amháin go bhfágfaí an múinteoir sa scoil seo i mbliana ach go bhféachfaí chuige go gcoinnneofaí an leanúnachas agus go n-athrófaí na rialacha sa chaoi is go mbeadh beirt oide ar a laghad i chuile scoil ar chuile oileán sa tír mar gan é sin, ní oileán le cónaí orthu a bheadh iontu ach oileáin tréigthe.  Tá fadhb ann in Inis Mór, maidir leis an gceist seo, agus is amhlaidh an scéal ar Inis Bó Finne.  Beidh fadhb ar an dul seo in Inis Oírr amach anseo agus, mar sin, ní fadhb é a bhaineann le hInis Meáin amháin, ach a bhaineann leis na hoileáin ar fad.  Bheinn ag súil go bhfaighfí réiteach gearrthéarmach air seo agus go dtabharfaí aghaidh ar an gcás speisialta seo ionas go ndéanfaí eisceacht speisialta de na hoileáin sna cúrsaí seo.</P>

        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): Ar dtús <Col N="1958" /> ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó Cuív as ucht an cheist phráinneach, thábhachtach seo a thógáil anseo tráthnóna.  Ar ndóigh, bhí an cheist seo faoi bhráid na Dála 5 Bealtaine mbliana agus, mar is eol don Teachta agus don Teach tá rialacha ann faoina leagtar síos cá mhéad oide is féidir a aithint i scoil náisiúnta nuair atá lion áir ithe daltaí ar na rollaí.  Ar ndóigh, nuair a chuirtear san áireamh go bhfuil breis agus 3,200 scoil náisiúnta ann tuigtear nár mhiste cloí go dlúth leis na rialacha sin.  Chun gur féidir an dara hoide a fhágáil ar fhoireann scoile náisiúnta is gá 25 dalta bheith ar na rollaí ar an 30ú lá de mhí Mheán Fómhair na bliana roimhe sin, ach i gcás scoile ar oileán laghdaítear an uimhir sin go dtí 20.  Dá bhrí sin, tá idirdhealú déanta idir na hoileáin agus an mhórthír-25 ar an mórthír agus 20 i gcás oileáin.  Ar an dáta cuí sin, is é sin 30 Meán Fómhair anuraidh, ní raibh ach 19 gcloigeann ar rollaí scoile Inis Meáin. Glacaim leis go mbeidh 25 dalta ag freastal ar an scoil sin ag tús Mheán Fomhair i mbliana.  Mar sin Féin, de réir na rialacha atá ann caithfear an líon daltaí a bhí ansin 30 Meán Fómhair anuraidh a chur san áireamh.</P>
      <P>Nuair a cuireadh cás na scoile sin faoi bhráid an Aire shocraigh sí, mar a mhínigh sí don Teach, go bhfaigheadh sí tuairisc iomlán faoin gcás seo ó chigire ceantair na Roinne.  Tá an tuairisc sin faighte aici idir an dá linn agus tá sí sásta go bhfuil deacracht ar leith ag baint le ceist na scoile seo sa mhéid go bhfanann daltaí ansin i ndiaidh na gnáthaoise le haistriú go dtí scoil iar-bhunoideachais os rud é nach bhfuil a leithéid de scoil ar Inis Meáin.  Dá thoradh sin, tá réimse aoiseanna i bhfad níos leithne le láimhseáil ag an oide.  Glacaim leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Ó Cuív maidir le láidreacht agus tábhacht na Gaeilge ar Inis Meáin.  Glacaim leis chomh maith go bhfuil todhchaí ag an oileán seo agus is gearr go dtabharfar aghaidh ar na riachtanais a bhaineann le múineadh na ndaltaí ar an oileán.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Idir an dá linn, tá an tAire sásta, mar réiteach an-eisceachtúil, go bhfanfadh an dara hoide ar fhoireann na scoile don <Col N="1959" /> scoilbhliain seo chugainn chun deis a thabhairt don Roinn an scéal sin a chíoradh níos géire agus tá treoir dá réir sin tugtha ag an Aire.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta Ó Cuív ag plé leis an <Col N="1960" /> cheist seo le fada an lá agus is cinnte gur cúis áthais dó an scéal sin a fháil tráthnóna.</P>

      <P>The child abuse guidelines, which were published by my Department in 1987, have been widely circulated in the health services and to other relevant agencies, such as the gardaí.  The operation of the guidelines is largely dependent on the skills and judgement of the professional staff dealing with allegations of child abuse. The provision of on the job training is a <Col N="1854" /> matter for each health board and would involve a range of elements, including ongoing supervision and support, one to one coaching, team meetings, information sessions, seminars and formal training courses.  Given the nature of such activities, I am sure the House will appreciate that it would not be practicable for my Department to provide details of all training provided by the health boards in this area.</P>
      <P>I might add that my Department was instrumental in the development of the Advanced Diploma in Child Protection at Trinity College.  The course provides advanced training for a range of health professionals and is also open to members of the Garda Síochána.  My Department has provided core funding for the course for the last three years and recently indicated its intention to continue to provide support for a further three years.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure that Ennis General Hospital operates within its financial allocation for 1993 the mid-Western Health Board has undertaken a detailed examination of the staffing and activities of several departments in the hospital and has compared these with staffing and practices in similar hospitals elsewhere around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this review, the Health Board has identified a number of areas of the hospital where there is scope for greater efficiency in the delivery of services and it is at present engaged in a series of discussions with staff interests <Col N="1855" /> about the implementation of new arrangements in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is confident that, provided the proposed measures are agreed upon by the interested parties, it will be possible to avoid any ward closure in Ennis General Hospital in 1993.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that Ennis General Hospital will continue to provide an integral and important part of the general hospital service in the Mid-Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The present FICI Agreement provides that if the cumulative cost of medicines in the GMS scheme from 1 August 1990 to 31 July 1993 computed at Irish Wholesale Price, exceeds the cumulative cost computed at currency adjusted, UK Wholesale Price, the cumulative excess will be repaid by manufacturers/importers, in accordance with arrangements to be agreed between the Federation and the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Payment of a clawback, accordingly, arises if the cumulative cost of drugs purchased over the entire period of the agreement at Irish prices is greater than the cost of the same drugs calculated at currency adjusted UK prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in co-operation with the GMS (Payments Board), has been monitoring the cumulative cost of medicines in the GMS scheme since the introduction of the Agreement.  Although the final position will not be known until after the end of the Agreement on 31 July 1993, it is estimated that based on a continuation of the current position to the <Col N="1856" /> end of July 1993 overall average Irish Prices were in line with currency adjusted UK Prices for the past three years and that the payment due from the Industry will be minimal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Two new clean air theatres have been installed by the Western Health Board in Merlin Park Hospital, Galway, at a capital cost of about £400,000 of which £300,000 has been contributed by my Department.  It is estimated that £300,000 will be required to equip the theatres and that the annual additional revenue cost will be about £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced an allocation of £2,192,600 to the Western Health Board as part of the major action programme on waiting lists in 1993 to reduce the time patients have to wait for operations for Orthopaedics, Ophthalmology, ENT, Cardiac Surgery, Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery.  The aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these specialties, and to set a maximum period of six months in the case of children waiting for ENT and Ophthalmology operations.  Included in this allocation is provision for equipping and commissioning the two clean air theatres <Col N="1858" /> to enable the Western Health Board to carry out agreed additional Orthopaedic procedures in 1993.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the health capital allocation for 1993 is £44 million.  The distribution of this total will be influenced to a considerable extent by the location of the major ongoing hospital developments. I am not in a position at this stage to give a definitive list of the capital projects that will be funded in 1993 in any health board area.</P>

      <P>The report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published in December 1984 recommended a shift in delivery of services for the mentally ill from an institutinal to a community based service.  The process of providing a comprehensive community based service has been ongoing for a number of years.  The Green Paper on Mental Health, which was published in June 1992, outlines what still needs to be done to complete the transition to a comprehensive, community oriented, sector based service which is integrated with other health services.</P>
      <P>The number of patients being cared for in public psychiatric hospitals continues to fall, from 11,613 patients in December 1984 to 7,050 at the end of March 1991. The fall in the numbers of patients in hospitals has been brought about by a reduction in admissions to psychiatric hospitals, and by the transfer of many patients from hospital to independent community living or to community residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of community residences and training hostels has increased from just over 121 in 1984 to 295 in 1990.  The number of places in these residences and hostels has also increased from just over <Col N="1859" /> 900 to 2,143 in the same period.  Day hospitals and day centres for the mentally ill have also been established to cater for patients living in the community and to prevent admissions to hospitals which might otherwise have taken place.  In 1984 there were 32 day hospitals and centres providing 800 places compared to 98 providing approximately 2,430 places at the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to the development of a fully integrated, community-based and comprehensive psychiatric service as recommended in the report, <i>Planning for the Future.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 121 together.  I am aware of the valuable work being carried out by the Simon Community in relation to homeless people, some of whom have a history of mental illness.  The Simon Community's report, <i>Still Waiting for the Future</i> was one of more than 100 submissions on the Green Paper on Mental Health received by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Simon Community report, I am not aware of any increase in the number of homeless people who were formerly cared for by the psychiatric services and who now live in hostels for the homeless.  Indeed a recent survey carried out by the Eastern Health Board established that of the 450 <Col N="1860" /> long-stay patients who have been discharged to community day and residential care from St. Brendan's Hospital over the past few years, all were satisfactorily accounted for.  This survey showed that none were homeless and that each patient was receiving appropriate care.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that before a patient is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, a thorough assessment is carried out by a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that the patient is able to cope with communty living.  Patients also participate in rehabilitation programmes to ensure that the transition to community living is successful.</P>
    <P>A day service programme for the homeless who have a mental health problem is currently being operated by the Eastern Health Board at St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin.  Homeless people attending this centre can avail of a range of day services which are provided by psychiatric nursing staff and resident at identifiable addresses in either hostel or lodging type accommodation.  The board are currently reviewing this programme to see how it can be adapted to meet the further needs of homeless people who have a mental health problem.</P>
    <P>Due to a heavy workload, I have been unable to meet with representatives of the Simon Community but I would like to inform the Deputy that officials of my Department met with the Simon Community yesterday to discuss a range of issues including the contents of the report <i>Still Waiting for the Future.</i></P>

The task of recruiting the key personnel, putting the required arrangements in place, providing training and the myriad of other tasks to be undertaken to implement the Act has already commenced.

      <P>The Ministers for Health held a wide ranging discussion at Council on 27 May.  The topics on the agenda were:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a draft resolution on future action in the field of public health;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a Commission report on the evaluation of the effectiveness of Community action undertaken in the context of the &ldquo;Europe Against Cancer&rdquo; Programme;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" />&mdash;The Reduction in smoking in the Community by means of a range of measures including the proposal for a Council Directive on advertising for tobacco products; the approximation at a high level of excise duty on cigarettes and other forms of manufactured tobacco products and the banning of smoking in places open to the public;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Council also considered initiatives with regard to the price of innovative medicines;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Registers of personal data used in medical research;</P>
    <P>&mdash;An assessment by the Commission of European Drugs Week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A Commission communication on adequate supplies of blood products.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and a German concern regarding Association agreements between the EC and Poland/Romania/ Bulgaria/Hungary/Czech Republic/ Slovakia and their impact on freedom of establishment for the medical professions.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion I stressed the importance of building on the new health provisions contained in the Maastricht Treaty in order to create a comprehensive EC public health action programme and welcomed, on behalf of Ireland, the proposal to draw up an overall strategy for future work in the health area which would be flexible and capable of change as need arises.  The Council agreed a Resolution in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also indicated Ireland's support for the &ldquo;Europe against Cancer&rdquo; programme and its innovative approach to cancer prevention, I particularly welcomed the decision to allocate an additional £4 million for the continuation of the current programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the discussions on tobacco advertising, I indicated Ireland's concern at the delay in agreeing a complete Community-wide ban.  I confirmed that Ireland, along with a majority of member states, fully supports the Commission's proposal to ban tobacco advertising <Col N="1870" /> and I pointed to the strong body of evidence confirming that advertising increases the consumption of tobacco products, particularly among the young, thereby contributing to serious health problems.  Tobacco advertising is already highly restricted in Ireland, but the wide circulation in Ireland of publications from other European countries makes it impractical for us to impose an outright ban on tobacco advertising in magazines and newspapers.  This makes it important from our point of view that an EC ban be enforced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In deciding whether to seek a court order committing a child to its care on a compulsory basis, a health board must have regard to the existing legislative and constitutional framework relating to the care and protection of children.  It is a matter for conjecture as to whether, if the law were different, health boards would have initiated more care proceedings than they actually did over the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the existing statutory provisions for taking children into care are inadequate.  The Child Care Act, 1991 contains important new provisions which will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection.  The District Court will have a range of new options available to it when dealing with applications for orders relating to such children.  In particular, <Col N="1872" /> the Court will be empowered to make a supervision order authorising a health board to have a child visited at home to ensure that the child is being cared for properly.  A I have already indicated to the House, the Government have agreed to my proposals to implement all the remaining sections of the Child Care Act and to give priority to those provisions which relate to the protection of children from abuse and neglect.</P>

      <P>Sudden infant death is an international problem and Irish steps taken against it must be seen in this context.  My Department is currently funding a three year register which will record all instances of sudden infant death in Ireland.  The register is being run by the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association (ISIDA) and it is hoped that it will supply useful data on the occurrence of sudden infant death in Ireland.  The register was notified of 59 sudden infant deaths in 1992; a drop of 32 per cent on the previous year's figure.</P>
      <P>The report stresses that interpretation of data for a single year must be treated with caution.  However, the awareness campaign highlighting the risk factors associated with sudden infant death, run by my Department's health promotion unit in association with the ISIDA may have been a significant factor in the overall reduction of the sudden infant death rate during 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The awareness campaign involved the circulation of leaflets and posters to maternity hospitals, general practitioners, obstetricians, gynaecologists and health boards so that as many mothers as possible and others dealing with young babies were made aware of <Col N="1873" /> the risk factors.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the anxiety of couples wishing to adopt a child abroad to have an assessment of their suitability carried out by the relevant health board, in accordance with the Adoption Act, 1991. I am satisfied that the health boards' social work services are responding as expeditiously as possible to requests for such assessments, bearing in mind the competing demands on those services particularly in relation to the investigation of allegations of child abuse which must take priority over all other work.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has set aside an additional £5 million for child care in the current year.  This will permit the creation of additional social worker and other community based child care specialist posts which in turn will improve the capacity of the services to respond to demands, including assessments for foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>In relation to future arrangements for the adoption of Romanian children by Irish residents, my Department has been examining a revised draft agreement received from the Romanian Committee for Adoptions.  An official of my Department recently met the chairman of that committee to clarify a number of points. The proposed agreement is receiving further consideration in the light of that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to outline some of the main points to emerge from the discussions with the <Col N="1874" /> Romanian authorities.  the categories of children most likely to be available for adoption from Romania include older children in institutional care and children with handicaps.  These children would be at least one year of age and the majority of them would be older than four years.</P>
    <P>For administrative reasons, the Romanian Committee for Adoptions will only process five applications at a time from a particular country.  This means that if Ireland enters into an adoption agreement with Romania, the first batch of five applications from Irish residents whose eligibility and suitability to adopt has been determined by the Adoption Board in accordance with the Adoption Act, 1991, must be dealt with by the committee before the next batch can be transmitted. Moreover, no couple will be allowed to travel to Romania to adopt unless they have been approved by the committee and it will be that committee which will select the children.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that, in accordance with the requirements of their internal law, the Romanian authorities are insisting that prospective adopters give an undertaking in writing that a total of five follow-up reports on the adopted child's progress in their care be sent to the Romanian Committee for Adoption over a period of 24 months following the adoption.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the proposed agreement is a complex matter which, of necessity, is taking some time to conclude.  I shall be seeking the approval of this House in due course to the State becoming a party to the agreement in accordance with Article 29 of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is interested in obtaining information on the general trends in each of the main programmes in the health services during the last four years.  If he wishes to obtain more detailed information on any particular aspect of the services, perhaps he would communicate further with me.</P>
      <P>In general, there has not been any curtailment of services during the past four years.  Indeed, there has been a significant development of services during that period, involving considerable capital investment and additional non-capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gross non-capital expenditure has increased from £1,425 million in 1989 to £2,088 million in the current year.  This represents an increase from 5.84 per cent to 6.85 per cent (estd.) in the proportion of GDP devoted to health services.  In the same period, the number of people employed in the services has increased <Col N="1876" /> from 58,438 whole time equivalent of 59,497 WTE in 1991.</P>
    <P>This increase in resources is reflected in the developments which have taken place in each of the three programmes referred to by the Deputy.  The principal developments in each of the programmes are summarised beneath.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Hospital Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government set the approved number of acute hospital beds at approximately 12,000 in 1990 and gave a commitment that, apart from normal seasonal closures, this level of bed availability would be maintained.  That commitment continues to be honoured.</P>
    <P>The level of activity on acute hospitals has risen significantly over the past number of years.  The number of admissions rose from 600,409 in 1987 to 665,092 in 1991.  Attendances at out-patient departments rose from 1.5 million to 1.75 million over the same period, and visits to casualty departments increased by 112,000 to over 1.12 million between 1988 and 1991.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a £20 million Action Programme to tackle hospital in-patient waiting lists.  This Action Programme is being specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship. These include orthopaedics, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat services, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.</P>
    <P>As agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, a new structure of eligibility was implemented with effect from 1 June 1991.  This has simplified the system greatly, abolishing the income limit for public consultant services and has extended eligibility for public consultant services to the whole population. A new system of designating public and private beds to improve equity of access has been approved and some 80 per cent of beds have been designated for public use.  Public patients will benefit in two ways from the new bed designations:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> (a)  the number of public beds has been increased,</P>
    <P>(b)  private non-emergency patients cease to occupy public beds, guaranteeing their availability for public patients.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Hospital Care</i>
    </P>
    <P>Admissions to public psychiatric hospitals and units is more or less static, with 24,299 admissions in 1988, whilst in 1990 the admissions were 23,576. Approximately one third of admissions are to psychiatric units attached to general hospitals.</P>
    <P>The number of patients being cared for in public psychiatric hospitals continues to fall, from 11,613 patients in December 1984 to 7,050 at the end of March, 1991. The fall in the numbers of patients in hospitals has been brought about by a reduction in admissions to psychiatric hospitals, and by the transfer of many patients from hospital to independent community living or to community residences.</P>
    <P>The number of community residences and training hostels has increased from just over 121 in 1984 to 295 in 1990.  The number of places in these residences and hostels has also increased from just over 900 to 2,143 in the same period.  Day hospitals and day centres for the mentally ill have also been established to cater for patients living in the community and to prevent admissions to hospitals which might otherwise have taken place.</P>
    <P>Additional funding for the development of services for people with mental handicap has been provided in each of the last four years as follows: 1990, £2 million; 1991, £1 million; 1992, £6 million; 1993, £8.5 million (including £2.5 million in capital expenditure).</P>
    <P>This funding has enabled an additional 413 residential, emergency and respite places and 859 day care places to be put in place and has facilitated the transfer of people with mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals.  A further 90 residential and 200 day care places will be provided in 1993.</P>
    <P>Early intervention and child education <Col N="1878" /> and development services have also been expanded.  In 1992 a home support service was initiated which was specifically targeted at those persons who have no services or an inadequate one.  This service provided support to over 1,000 families.</P>
    <P>A Review Group on <i>Physical and Sensory Disability</i> has been established to recommend on the expansion and improvement of services to people with physical handicap disabilities with the framework of the commitments of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Additional funding of £1.5 million (including £.5 million in capital expenditure) has again been made available in the current year for persons with physical handicap.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Community Care</i>
    </P>
    <P>Services for the elderly are being improved by the establishment of departments of medicine of the elderly in some major hospitals while more extended care places will be provided particularly in the Eastern Health Board area where the need is greatest.  During 1990 to 1992 an additional £9 million had been made available to health boards to extend home nursing, provide day centres and increase the number of nurses, speech therapists and physiotherapists in the community.</P>
    <P>In this year an extra £4 million will be provided in order to proceed with the implementation of the Nursing Home Act.</P>
    <P>As I have previously announced I have obtained the agreement of the Government to implement all the remaining sections of the Child Care Act and to provide the resources to put in place the necessary staff, services and facilities required to implement it.  The task of recruiting the key personnel, putting the required arrangements in place, providing training and the myriad of other tasks to be undertaken to implement the Act is commencing immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government has determined that this major task must be completed within three years commencing now and to this <Col N="1879" /> end has decided that in 1993 an additional £5 million will be provided, amounting to £10 million in a full year.  An investment of the same scale will be made in each of the next 3 years.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Child Care Act is the single biggest contribution which we can make towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.</P>
    <P>An advisory committee on Women's Health has been established within my Department and in addition, the Health Promotion Unit is co-operating closely with the Council for the Status of Women and other interested groups on matters relevant to women's health.</P>
    <P>In 1992 a sum of £3.3 million was allocated for the provision of services for drug misusers and persons who have HIV/AIDS.  An additional sum of £1.6 million was provided in 1993 to allow for the consolidation of services set up in 1992 and for some further service development.  These included the phased implementation of a comprehensive HIV Surveillance System, the development of a palliative care service for persons with advanced and terminal AIDS, the provision of funds to a number of voluntary agencies working in the field and the further development of primary care clinics for persons with HIV/AIDS in the Dublin area.  A feature of the extension of the services is the filling of the consultant post in Infectious Diseases in the Mater/Beaumont Hospitals to provide a Consultant-led Hospital service for persons with HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>The new contract with general practitioners which was introduced in 1989 provided for a range of features aimed at improving services for medical card patients.  These included a capitation based payment structure to encourage more comprehensive consultants, payment for out-of-hours visits, contributions towards the cost of practice nurses and secretaries, and payment for a range of special services which had not previously been the subject of special payment.</P>
    <P>Arising from the 1992 GMS Review, <Col N="1880" /> the Government made available a fund for the further development of general practice in 1993 and 1994.  Specific payments are being made out of this fund for improved rostering and out-of-hours arrangements within general practice, practice maintenance, equipment and development and additional contributions towards the employment of practice nurses and secretaries. Resources have also been earmarked for the establishment of new structures in each health board area which will facilitate the development of general practice at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 70 and 86, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the treatment of a patient is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should a patient be concerned about his or her condition, they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of their case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a £20 million Major Action Programme in relation to hospital in-patient waiting lists which was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  These areas include Orthopaedics (hip replacement and other procedures); Ophthalmology (cataracts and other procedures); Ear, Nose and Throat; Cardiac Surgery (by-pass operations); Vascular Surgery (varicose veins) and Plastic Surgery.  The aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these particular specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that I have allocated £2,192,600 to the Western Health Board under the Major Action Programme.  This money will be used to carry out an additional 524 ophthalmology procedures of which 250 will be cataracts.  These will make significant inroads in the waiting times for these procedures and in the case of children will eliminate all those waiting over six months.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the level of acute hospital services available for patients with traumatic head injuries.  In relation to rehabilitation and after-care support, the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability, which was established in July, 1992, will be considering the long term rehabilitation needs of brain-injured people.  Sixteen members were appointed to the Review Group, made up of representatives of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and representatives of various voluntary and statutory bodies dealing with people with physical or sensory disabilities.  It is expected that the final report of the Review Group will be available in the Spring of 1994.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of neuropsychological services at Beaumont Hospital, the position is that the epilepsy programme at Beaumont Hospital has, over the past number of years, been funded in part by the Richmond Brain Research Foundation.  This research programme includes the provision of a neuropsychological service which was funded by the Foundation.  However, the Foundation has now indicated that it is unable to continue to provide funding towards the cost of the programme.  My Department and Beaumont Hospital are involved in ongoing discussions regarding the arrangements for the future funding of the programme, with particular reference to the hospital's 1993 allocation, the many competing demands for resources and its priorities for new developments.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on Mental Health which was launched in June, 1992 discusses the challenge of promoting mental health and the prevention of suicide.  The Green Paper outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the causes of suicide are complex.  Changes in the cohesiveness of society, lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.  A proportion of suicides is associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable mental illness.</P>

    <P>The health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed and our psychiatric services are being continually developed to provide early intervention treatment programmes at local community level and to help people under psychological stress.

      <P>In relation to overcrowding, the Deputy may recall that, in my first week as Minister, I made special additional funds available to the Eastern Health Board to enable additional facilities for the elderly to be brought into use at that time.

    <P>My Department's anti-smoking programme is our most important single dimensional prevention programme and its success is evidenced by the reduction in the percentage of the population smoking. However I consider that there is no room for complacency on this important health issue and so we are continuing our efforts to reduce the prevalance of smoking.  The Deputy will be aware that earlier this year, I launched a major new &ldquo;I'm One less&rdquo; anti-smoking campaign, the first phase of which drew an unprecedented response from the public.  To coincide with World Anti-Tobacco Day on 31 May 1993 I launched the second phase of this new campaign last Monday.</P>

      <P>The number of temporary locum consultants at present in the State is 117.  This is approximately 10 per cent of the total complement of consultants.</P>
      <P>Temporary and locum consultant appointments require the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body with responsibility for determining the number and type of consultant appointments.  It is the policy of the Comhairle and my Department to keep the number of temporary and locum posts to a minimum.  The 10 per cent figure is regarded as the norm given the turnover pattern in consultant posts.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of the group referred to by the Deputy, I would like to emphasise the non-compulsory nature of the Stay Safe Child Abuse Prevention Programme. Before the programme is launched in a school the parents are consulted and their written permission to their children's participation in the project is sought.  If parents don't wish their child to be taught the safety skills covered in the programme, then their wishes are fully respected.</P>
      <P>Both my colleague, the Minister for Education, and myself are fully supportive of the Stay Safe Programme which is currently being implemented in all primary schools around the country with the active support of our Departments and the health boards.  It is expected that the implementation process will be successfully completed in all areas by the end of the school year 1993/94.</P>

    <P>I am concerned about the adequacy of services and supports, including emergency accommodation, currently available for the victims of domestic violence. I intend to improve the current provision in the context of the additional funding now being made available for the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.  I regard such refuges as a key component of the network of child care and <Col N="1889" /> family support services needed to underpin the Act.</P>

      <P>As a Western European Union observer, Ireland has the right to be represented at all meetings of the Western European Union Council at Ministerial level.  Because our observer status is linked to the relationship in the Maastricht Treaty between the European Union and the Western European Union, the Government have indicated that we do not intend fully to exercise our rights as a Western European Union observer until the Maastricht Treaty is ratified.  If, however, an occasion should arise before then which would warrant my attendance at a Western European Union Ministerial meeting, I will be able to do so.  I have already attended one such meeting &mdash; an extraordinary meeting of the Western European Union Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 5 April 1993 to discuss the crisis in the former Yugoslavia &mdash; and Ireland was represented at official level at the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Rome on 19 May 1993.</P>
      <P>After the Maastricht Treaty has been ratified, I would envisage attending future meetings of the Western European Union Ministerial Council as an observer, other commitments permitting.</P>

      <P>I indicated in the House on 18 May 1993 that the Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the steps that this Government is taking to improve employment and employment opportunities.  I also referred to the response of the Government to the Culliton report in &ldquo;Employment through Enterprise&rdquo; which is directed at introducing structural changes which will make it more efficient and more attractive for firms to do more business. It is only by doing more business and by doing it more successfully that firms can expand the numbers they employ.  The County Enterprise Partnership Boards when established will further facilitate small business development.</P>
      <P>However, it has to be recognised that it will take time for the measures being implemented by the Government to improve the competitive base of the Irish economy and to be translated into additional employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>In so far as the long term unemployed are concerned the main intervention is the Social Employment Scheme and the Community Employment Development Programme which will provide opportunities for an average of 15,500 long term unemployed persons during 1993 compared with 12,000 in 1992.</P>
      <P>It may be possible to increase participation levels still further next year subject to the Social Employment Scheme being eligible for European Community Funding under the Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 and to the general budgetary position.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Following his discharge from the Permanent Defence Force in 1973, the person in question was granted a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts based on a degree of disablement of 20 per cent.  The pension has been in payment since December, 1973.</P>
      <P>In late 1992, he applied to have his case reviewed in the light of medical evidence furnished by him.  He was re-examined on the 15 January, 1993, by the Army Pensions Board (which is the statutory body appointed under the Army Pensions Acts to adjudicate on such cases) and his degree of disablement was reassessed at 30 per cent.  In accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, his disability pension was duly increased to the level appropriate to the higher degree of disablement and the increase took effect from the date of his re-examination by the Board.  Payment of pension at the higher rate commenced in February, 1993, when arrears due were also paid.</P>

      <P>The protection of all fish stocks, including white fish stocks, in Irish waters is a top priority for the State's fishery control services both on land and on sea.  The sea fisheries officers of the Department of the Marine, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are continuously upgrading their monitoring and control programmes to ensure greater protection for the valuable fish resources in our waters.</P>
      <P>The European Community is making a sizeable contribution towards the provision of essential monitoring equipment. As I explained in response to similar questions from Deputies Harney and Barrett on 6 April 1993, a substantial five-year capital investment programme, designed to enhance the effectiveness of Ireland's fisheries surveillance services commenced in 1991.  The total package, at a cost of £34 million was approved for EC aid at a rate of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under this programme a range of new monitoring equipment, including fixedwing aircraft for the Air Corps and communications and data handling equipment for the Naval Service and the Department of the Marine is being acquired.  In addition there is provision for the acquisition of inshore surveillance boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also mention that in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review Ireland has sought an increased community contribution towards the costs, including operational costs, of Ireland's fishery control programme.  I discussed this matter at my recent meeting with Commissioner Paleokrassas on 1 June and made a very strong case for such a programme.  I will also be raising the matter with the President of the EC <Col N="1902" /> Council of Fisheries Ministers when I meet him on 9 June.  This matter will be discussed at the Fisheries Council on 24 June.  The Deputy may rest assured that I will continue to vigorously press Ireland's case for the additional funding sought.</P>

      <P>The current national AIDS prevention campaign was recently launched by me on Monday, 24 May to commemorate Irish AIDS Day which took place on Saturday, 29 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In arranging for mass media campaigns my Department asked for at least three public tenders from different agencies. In the case of the recently made AIDS commercials five companies were invited to make presentations for a campaign that would cost either £200,000 or £250,000 which would include production costs and buy sufficient air time to ensure impact.  The companies who competed were (1) ARKS Advertising Agency, who had been successful in winning the recent anti-tobacco campaign, for a similar budget, (2) Peter Owens Advertising, (3) Doherty Advertising, (4) Quinn, McDonnell and Pattison and (5) Quantum Communications Group.  Quinn McDonnell and Pattison were successful in winning this tender as it was they who were adjudged to have met the brief most adequately and developed a concept that was most likely to be the most effective <Col N="1910" /> and influential in reducing the spread of HIV infection and AIDS.</P>
    <P>To date £23,050 has been paid to QMP with respect to this campaign and final amount due will be paid on completion of the campaign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the patient in question is on the waiting list for cataract surgery but the Western Health Board is unable to provide an exact admission for her at the moment.  The Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital for treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel that her condition has deteriorated, she should return to her general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the £20 million major action programme which I recently launched in relation to hospital in-patient waiting lists which was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  These areas include ophthalmology, cataracts and other procedures, where the aim is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months.  The necessary funds are being made available to the Western Health Board to perform an additional 250 cataract operations under this programme in 1993.  This should impact significantly on the average waiting times for cataract operations.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that elderly people receive the highest quality of health care available.  The objectives of health policy, towards the elderly are set out in the report &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i> They are the support and care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when the elderly can no longer be cared for at home, that there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities for service development at present are to strengthen Community Care Services for elderly persons and their carers in the home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals, to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm, and to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations contained in <i>The Years Ahead.</i>  In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to expand home nursing and the home help services, to provide more respite places, day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine for the elderly in general hospitals, to strengthen rehabilitation services and to develop services for those with dementia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress achieved in developing health services for the elderly will be maintained by the new Government. Under the Programme for a Partnership Government we will be developing a health service of the highest quality, so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well looked <Col N="1915" /> after should they need medical care. Among the priority issues in health for the Government which are of direct benefit to the elderly are the expansion of facilities for hip replacement and cataract surgery as a result of the major action programme on hospital waiting lists and the implementation this year of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The action programme provides for an additional 1,117 hip replacement operations and 1,506 cataract operations.  I have already had discussions with nursing home interests and I have indicated my intention to proceed with the implementation of the Act at the earliest opportunity. A provision of £4 million has been made available this year for the phased implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>A particular problem arose in the Eastern Health Board area earlier this year in relation to elderly people in general hospitals who required long stay care.  My Department gave additional financial aid amounting to £0.5 million to the board to provide additional extended care beds for these patients.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the first phase of the development of Naas Hospital has been completed and commissioned.  The Naas Hospital Review Group, which is comprised of officials of the Eastern Health Board and officials of the Department of Health, is due to hold its first meeting shortly.  The review group's terms of reference are to examine the remaining stages of the development plan for Naas Hospital taking account of overall acute hospital requirements of the area and recent developments in the <Col N="1916" /> delivery of hospital services.  At this stage I am not in a position to indicate when the group is likely to report.</P>

      <P>I understand that there are now 53 pre-schools catering specifically for children of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the funding of these pre-schools rests with the Department of Education which meets 98 per cent of tuition and transport costs. In some cases, the local health boards contribute towards the balance of the costs.  The amounts involved would be small and the details are not available in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-schools are run by local voluntary groups and management structures are a matter for the groups themselves.

I understand, however, that these patients are currently being appropriately treated for their condition and are under constant medical supervision.</P>

They also provide guidance and counselling in schools, liaise with the health and social services in their school areas and advise on the provision of remedial education for pupils who require such a service.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need to help pupils to develop positive attitudes and behaviour and to make satisfying and fulfilling educational and career choices. While guidance counsellors have a central role to play in this process, it is important that the provision of guidance be seen as a school-wide responsibility, involving the collaboration of the school administration, the guidance counsellor and the other teachers.</P>

      <Col N="1925" /> All post-primary schools of 500 pupils or over qualify for the allocation of a post on an ex-quota basis for guidance.  In addition, in accordance with the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a phased programme, which started in 1992-93 and which is due to be completed in 1994-95, was introduced to provide for the recognition on an ex-quota basis of 0.5 of a wholetime post for guidance in secondary, community and comprehensive schools in the 350-499 enrolment category with a similar provision for vocational schools to be made on a vocational education scheme basis. It is open to school authorities to appoint career guidance teachers within quota if they wish.</P>
