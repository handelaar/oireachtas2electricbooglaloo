      <Quest>if he has received the Report of the Green 2000 Advisory Group, commissioned by his predecessor; if the report will be published and made available to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the public; if the Government accepts the recommendations of the report and intends to implement them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I received and launched the Report of the Green 2000 Advisory Group on Friday, 26 March.  I very much appreciate the commitment and hard work of the members of the group who so generously gave of their time and expertise to the consideration of the key issues facing our natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government has already made clear the commitment of the Government to the protection and enhancement of the environment.  The programme spells out how this will be achieved.  Action is already under way in the various areas identified in the programme. <Col N="382" /> In particular, as stated in the programme, the new EC Cohesion Fund will finance an accelerated programme of investment in environmental infrastructure, relating to water, sewage treatment and solid waste disposal.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that action, linked to the implementation of the Programme for Government, on the 15 general and 137 specific recommendations made by the Green 2000 Group will constitute a major contribution to the improvement of the environment in this country.  In recognition of this key contribution, I have asked the Minister for the Environment to agree on an agenda with the relevant Ministers to promote greater integration of environmental considerations into their policy areas.  I have asked the Minister to report back to the Government on the initiative later this year.</P>
    <P>I will take a specific personal interest in progressing the Green 2000 Group's recommendations, in particular those that relate to energy utilisation policy where I believe there are major advances to be gained through a positive integration of energy and environmental policies.  I have in mind in particular the development of more extensive use of peat for electricity generation and of environmentally friendly energy sources such as small hydro-electric stations, wave energy, and wind power.  In addition to their benefits to the environment these will generate much needed additional employment here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Copies of the Green 2000 Report were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 2 April.  Copies were available for sale to the public through the Government Publications Sales Office on Friday, 26 March.</P>

      <P>Can I take it that the Taoiseach is telling the House, presumably in an indirect way, that he is accepting the 137 recommendations of this report?  If that is the case, is he proposing to introduce legislation to provide statutory protection for areas of scientific interest, for the protection of national parks and requiring tourism-related <Col N="383" /> developments, such as interpretative centres, to go through the planning process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wandering somewhat.  Let me repeat what I have already said.  The 15 general and 137 specific recommendations will quite clearly make a major contribution to improving the environment.  Towards this purpose I have asked the Minister for the Environment to prepare an action programme in consultation with all other Departments to ensure that environmental policy forms part of the evaluation of every policy that comes forward and report back to the Government on that issue before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wander. I asked the Taoiseach specific questions about specific recommendations in this report, and I will ask him again.  Part of the recommendations is that various pieces of legislation be introduced.  Both public and private tourism-related developments should be made amenable to the planning laws, for example, interpretative centres.  Does the Taoiseach propose to introduce legislation in relation to that?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, presumably the purpose of Question Time is to elicit information and that is what I am trying to do.  Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation &mdash; specifically recommended in this report &mdash; for the protection of areas of scientific interest to give statutory protection to national parks?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear repetition. The Deputy is well aware that this matter is before the Supreme Court for decision and consequently no action will be taken in any area in that respect until the Supreme Court has adjudicated and the Government has had an opportunity to consider whatever decision they make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have no objection to having a debate on the environment and on the Green 2000 report. I will leave it to the Whips to have a discussion on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Taoiseach received a copy of this report last October and, if so, why did it take six months before it was published?  Does the Taoiseach still have an environment adviser and does he agree that asking the Minister for the Environment to liaise with his colleagues, despite the Minister's obvious commitment to the environment, is asking him to perform an impossible task and that it would be better if all Government plans and programmes were subjected to an environmental impact assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of the Deputy's question, I have already said that it is the intention of the Government that all environmental aspects of all new policy will be evaluated in that regard.  There were some distractions in October, November and December that probably did not lend themselves to consideration of a report of this size.  On the second part of the Deputy's question, the answer is yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>In the Taoiseach's reply he indicated that the recommendations of the report would lead to a major improvement in the environment. Will he agree that those recommendations will have an impact only if implemented?  On that basis will he assure the House that the legislative proposals contained in the report will be implemented by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This year the introduction of the Cohesion Funds will provide the largest ever investment, in the time of any Government, in the battle against coastal erosion and coastal and inland pollution and this investment will have a beneficial impact on the environment. Between now and the end of the decade the investment of Cohesion Funds will result in a major improvement in the whole environmental area, which is what the people want.  Other aspects of the environmental issue and of the report itself can give rise to a new policy direction in certain respects, which can lead to an opportunity for new job creation.  The Deputy can be sure that the Government will be very active in pursuing the objectives set out in the advisory report.</P>

      <P>The economic and social policy division of my Department provides me with advice on all appropriate aspects of economic and social policy.  A particular function of the division is that of acting as secretariat to the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In that context the division <Col N="386" /> interacts with all other Departments in relation to the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach reject the recommendation by the Culliton group that the task force proposed by that group should report directly to the Taoiseach?  The Culliton group considered that the more comprehensive approach to be taken to industrial policy required the central co-ordination of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That recommendation was made in the time of my predecessor. People have different approaches to policy matters.  Clearly, the new Government has evolved a different approach from that of the previous Government and the results of the direction taken will become evident very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the Taoiseach's reply.  What considerations led the Taoiseach to the decision that the proposed task force would not report directly to his own Department, given that the Culliton report argued that there would be an impetus for reform across a wide range of Departments in which action was considered necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House on many occasions, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  Policies and developments introduced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will make it clear that the Government has taken the correct decision in this regard. I did not feel it necessary to hold the chairmanship of the proposed task force in my Department and I delegated that responsibility to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The Deputy will be glad to know that the Cabinet has agreed to proceed with the recommendations of the Culliton and the Moriarty reports.  The Minister will very shortly make a substantive statement on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the implications <Col N="387" /> for the speedy implementation of the recommendations contained in the Culliton report of the better relations, referred to by the Taoiseach, between the economic division of the Taoiseach's Department and the new Department of Enterprise and Employment?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the past conflict between the former Department of Industry and Commerce and his Department was injurious to industrial development?  I could instance issues of industrial policy, such as the proposed reorganisation of the IDA and the county enterprise teams, in relation to which conflict between the former Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach meant that, in effect, nothing was done.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the new arrangements are likely to lead to the implementation of the overdue recommendations of the Culliton report, as no action has been taken on those recommedations in the last 12 months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For a considerable time now a meeting has been held every Wednesday morning, attended by all Ministers concerned with the implementation of the recommendations.  There was no need for arbitration on my part before Ministers found a solution to disputes in that regard.  The agreement reached will be for the better development of industrial policy.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Rabbitte in the House opposed any change to &mdash; or abolition of &mdash; the IDA.  There is no conflict between my Department and the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not. Developments have taken place through the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> My Department has responsibility for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The 12 area partnership companies developed under that umbrella. The concept of the management company was expanded.  That company comes under the umbrella of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which is the way it should be.  Despite the Deputy's insinuations, there is no conflict.  Acceleration of implementation of the recommendations contained in the Culliton report is taking place in a spirit of partnership, this will be demonstrated very shortly.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any proposals to meet the leaders of the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My door will continue to be open to leading representatives of the Unionist community.  Both the Tánaiste and I have made it clear on different occasions that we would be willing to meet the Unionist leaders without preconditions to discuss the future of this island.  However, as far as I am concerned, rather then repeating the invitation at this time, and recognising that high profile meetings with the head of the Irish Government has always presented difficulties to Unionist leaders over the past 19 years, my first priority is to get a <Col N="389" /> resumption of the Northern talks under way as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The arrangements which I made last year for the conduct of political dialogue, which consisted of appointing the then Tánaiste, Deputy Wilson, to lead the Government delegation to the talks, proved highly satisfactory and enabled much progress to be made.  For the first time a Unionist party delegation came to Dublin for meetings with the Government in Strand 2, in conjunction with meetings in Belfast and London.  I envisage similar arrangements, involving the present Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when talks resume.  In anticipation of that, the Tánaiste has himself invited Unionist leaders to come and talk with him, and I hope they will avail of that offer.</P>
      <P>In view of the way that my speech here last week has been misrepresented, I would like to make a few points relevant to the resumption of political dialogue with the Unionist parties, which is what I presume lies behind this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate the point that was well received in many quarters elsewhere, but largely ignored here, that we totally condemn and reject violence from whatever source in an evenhanded and totally responsible way.  I said that &ldquo;a Unionist life is just as sacred as a Nationalist life&rdquo;.  I also repeated that this State was not a safe haven for terrorists. In addition, both the Minister for Justice and myself confirmed that the extradition laws would be tidied up, as had previously been agreed.  Deputies will have noted that when an attempt was made in the House of Commons to criticise this aspect of my speech, the British Prime Minister told the Unionist Party &ldquo;not to confuse the actions of a minority with the views and instincts of the majority of the people.  I do not believe the majority of people in the Republic of Ireland support the activities of the IRA, and I believe that their response to recent events is a clear illustration that this is the case&rdquo;. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, Mr. Ivan Lawrence MP, stated on the BBC on 1 April that my speech was &ldquo;a welcome restatement&rdquo; of a previous undertaking.  I was glad to note <Col N="390" /> that the <i>Ulster News Letter</i> reported my speech under the headline, &ldquo;Reynolds rejects `safe-haven' slur&rdquo;, and mainly dealt with what I said on the subject of violence.  It was a pity that the print media down here paid little attention to this part of my speech or to the strong emphasis I placed on the yearning for peace.</P>
    <P>The same Unionist newspaper in an editorial referred to another passage in my speech in the following way:</P>
    <P>In the Dáil yesterday Taoiseach Albert Reynolds put into words what sensible people had known all along: Articles 2 and 3 of the Éire Constitution will remain in place until the nuts and bolts of a comprehensive and watertight agreement have been signed, sealed and delivered. </P>
    <P>The way I put the point last week was that &ldquo;constitutional change must be placed in the context of a broad-ranging agreement, that includes a balanced constitutional accommodation, one that not only recognises and respects the importance of the present wishes of a majority but also the validity and legitimacy of an agreed Ireland as a long term goal&rdquo;.  I also said that the Government proceed from the basis that both traditions have a permanent place and permanent rights on this island that must be firmly guaranteed in any settlement.</P>
    <P>Unionist MP, Mr. Ken Maginnis, strongly attacked my speech, and claimed that it represented a slamming of the door in the face of Unionists.  That is absolutely untrue.  It would help to put his reaction in context, if Deputies were aware that three days before I spoke, the same MP attacked me roundly in the columns of the <i>Ulster News Letter</i> of 29 March in effect for a softly softly approach, for Pontius Pilate posturing, for displays of hollow sentiment and so on.  I think it is a fair conclusion that in the present electoral context anything I could have said, was going to attract a strong attack from certain quarters. Deputies opposite should not be naive about this.  The Leader of the Alliance Party, Dr. John Alderdice, in an interview <Col N="391" /> on Radio Ulster on 3 April attibuted &ldquo;that kind of reaction&rdquo; as being:</P>
    <P>really to do with the fact that most politicians do not see full-blooded negotiations starting again certainly this side of the local government elections.</P>
    <P>Dr. Joe Hendron of the SDLP also as reported in the <i>Irish News</i> last Friday described my speech as &ldquo;very positive&rdquo;, and said that it had &ldquo;articulated the views of the Irish nation which included the Nationalists in the North&rdquo;.  Dr. Alderdice in the interview I have mentioned also accepted that not enough attention had been paid by the other community to the anxieties of Nationalists, for some of whom the Constitution &ldquo;stands as a sort of security, as a sort of guarantor of their Irishness, of their part of the Irish nation&rdquo;, a similar point to the one I was making here last week.  I understand very clearly the real anxieties of both communities.</P>
    <P>If Unionists want to join in helping to find a new formula for peace through the political process, if they want a new agreement to replace or transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement, if they want a new constitutional accommodation, then they must accept that this can only happen when they rejoin the other willing parties at the negotiating table.  I hope that the Opposition parties in this House will encourage them to do so, because that is a very clear priority for the people of the whole island.  Sectarian murders on both sides will solve nothing.</P>
    <P>But at the end of the day, as I pointed out in my speech and as is also set out in the agreed Programme for Government, we can proceed in two ways.  We can, through resumed political dialogue, seek a comprehensive new political settlement; that is clearly our preferred option. Indeed, as I made clear last week, the Government are deeply committed to the achievement of a lasting political settlement which will accommodate the two traditions in Ireland on equal terms and which will bring about a new beginning for relationships within Northern <Col N="392" /> Ireland, within the island of Ireland, and between the peoples of these islands.  We are not engaged in a process of dictation to or domination of the Unionist community. However, in the absence of new agreed arrangements, the two Governments will continue to operate fully and develop the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to pursue North-South co-operation vigorously.  The Unionist parties will have a vital role in determining the road that is to be followed by the two Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it now appears that the Taoiseach accepts that his speech last week was not helpful to the process of reconciliation.  Would he accept that, for the future &mdash; I say this as someone who genuinely wants to see talks resumed, who wants to see meetings with the Unionist leaders and wants to see a solution &mdash; it would be most helpful if there were to be no further speeches of the &ldquo;Articles 2 and 3 not for sale type&rdquo; which we had in the past?  Will the Taoiseach, in his future dealings with Northern Ireland, in particular in his comments addressed to the Unionist parties, adopt an open, generous approach, one showing at least an understanding of their position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject totally what Deputy O'Keeffe said.  From the day I assumed office as Taoiseach I made abundantly clear what was my position.  I said my approach would be even-handed, firm and fair, recognising the anxieties, concerns and fears of both communities.  I live 35 miles from the Border and have been travelling back and forward across it all my life.  My children spent holidays up there over many years.  I have many friends on both sides of the political divide.  I understand exactly and quite clearly what is the position.  I have never changed my stance one iota from the beginning, that we have to tackle this problem with an even-handed approach, recognising the fears, anxieties and concerns of both communities.  Otherwise, we will not reach a settlement.  If one considers one side and not the other one <Col N="393" /> will end up without any solution, instead another 23 years of violence, which is what we all want to avoid.  It is a serious misapprehension on the part of anybody to suggest that I do not understand the anxieties of both communities, having mixed with them and done business with them over my lifetime.</P>

      <P>It is amazing how, when extracts are read out of various people's reactions to it how people, writing editorials in a different part of this island, can take different views. However, that is a matter for others to interpret.  I have had plenty of contact with people in the North of Ireland from both communities since and know exactly what they are saying.  They all want to find a new formula for peace; peace is the priority.  It would be helpful in all circumstances if in the first instance we all left aside the parts that divide us and sat down and agreed the parts that unite us.  That would be a sensible and pragmatic approach.  If one wants to interpret what a Loyalist newspaper was saying, <Col N="394" /> then they were saying something like &ldquo;no settlements&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the quotations he gave from Northern newspapers were ones that paid tribute to him for his views on violence? I share the Taoiseach's view, that he is not ambivalent on the matter of violence. But would he agree that, in relation to political matters, his speech was very unhelpful and did not receive any praise either in Northern publications or from Northern Unionist politicians?  Would the Taoiseach say when we can expect the new Bill to tidy up &mdash; as he called it &mdash; our extradition laws?  I am sure he will agree that the Garda are doing an outstanding job in apprehending those who are wanted in connection with serious crimes here and in Britain but that we need to give them the legislative framework to ensure that nobody walks free on the basis of a technicality.  Can the Taoiseach inform the House when precisely that Bill will be introduced; for example, are we talking about April, May or June?</P>

      <P>The same Unionist newspaper in an editorial referred to another passage in my speech in the following way:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Dáil yesterday Taoiseach Albert Reynolds put into words <Col N="395" /> what sensible people had known all along: Articles 2 and 3 of the Éire Constitution will remain in place until the nuts and bolts of a comprehensive and watertight agreement have been signed, sealed and delivered&rdquo;.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of replying the Taoiseach indicated his understanding of how people feel in Northern Ireland.  He must be aware that the whole question of the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is fundamental to that understanding.  In that context, when he referred to achieving &ldquo;an agreed Ireland as a long term goal&rdquo; what precisely did he mean?  Is he proposing or hoping for a change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland &mdash; Joint sovereignty, continued sovereignty by Britain or sovereignty on the part of this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said from the beginning that all constitutional matters should be on the table.  I have not changed my position one iota.  &ldquo;An agreed Ireland&rdquo; is an agreed Ireland, which is that we would all like to see the communities on this island that have been divided for so long in the North of Ireland come together and work out a solution for the future of his island in a new accommodation. My experience is that there are many thousands of tolerant people who live ordinary lives and that there is a great community spirit in most communities in Northern Ireland.  A small number of people on both sides are committed to violence but what about the hundreds of thousands of people who live ordinary lives, who are tolerant in their approach and good neighbours?  There are inter-marriages and a great community spirit.  If we can bring violence to an end that society will develop in its own way.  Our priority should be to bring it to an end, to bring peace to that society from which many things can then evolve. People on both sides of the political divide yearn for peace.  Therefore, we should not set down preconditions when <Col N="396" /> our priority should be to get the talks going to find a peace formula.</P>

      <P>In view of the tone of injured innocence in which the Taoiseach delivered his first reply, will he agree that he was obviously stung by the question? Will he further agree, having regard to the fact that they had to trawl through so many editorials to find the odd favourable reference, that the consensus was that his speech was not helpful?  In view of this would he not like to tear up that speech and try again in a more measured way?  Finally, in view of what the Taoiseach said a few moments ago, will he in future resist the temptation, to which he has given in quite often, to use as a term of abuse the statement &ldquo;somebody elsewhere in this House understands the Unionist point of view&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The major decrease in prices for whitefish on European markets is due to many factors, including imports of cheap cod and haddock from third countries; the international recessionary situation which has reduced the demand for prime whitefish; the instability in the currency market which has led to large differentials in price between EC member states and the unseasonably good weather early in the year which, coupled with an increase in the total allowable catch of a number of whitefish species, resulted in increased landings.</P>
      <P>The difficulties on the whitefish market have been discussed on a number of occasions at European Community level. At the end of February, in response to pressure from a number of member states, including Ireland, the Community invoked a system of minimum prices at point-of-entry in respect of monk, hake, cod, haddock, saithe and Alaska pollack. This system will remain in force until the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disruption to the market was discussed at length at the 18 March meeting of the Council of Fisheries' Ministers in Brussels at which the Minister of State, Mr. Gerry O'Sullivan, attended.  The council decided on a range of actions, including: member states were requested to enhance national controls on minimum prices; the Commission was instructed to consider extending the minimum prices regime to include other species; member states are to accelerate the provision of data on prices, in particular import prices, to the Commission; the Commission <Col N="402" /> is to bring forward proposals for better control of direct landings from third countries in Community ports, and the Commission is to establish contact with the third countries involved to control and stabilise markets.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that there are signs that, in Ireland at least, prices have now begun to stabilise.</P>
    <P>As regards prices in the shops, there are indications that there has been some fall in prices recently: the consumer price index shows a fall of more than 9 per cent in the price of fresh fish generally since August 1992, and a 7 per cent fall in prices since last November.  This implies that the full benefit of the major fall in producer prices may not have been passed on immediately to the consumer. This would not be unusual in the short term pending stabilisation of market trends.</P>
    <P>Should fish prices remain low and should it become clear that the benefits of these low prices are not being adequately passed on to the consumer, I will, of course, be in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, with a view to taking whatever steps are necessary to rectify the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Minister is not <i>aú fait</i> with the situation.  It is evident from his reply that he is giving us details of the meeting attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan in Brussels on 18 March 1993.  It is a case of too little too late.  The fishing industry is in a state of collapse and has come almost to a standstill.</P>

Will the Minister insist the EC imposes stringent quotas on imports from third countries because such imports have a serious impact on fish prices and on our fishing industry?

      <P>I agree with the trend of the Deputy's questions.  However I do not necessarily agree that the fishing industry is in a state of collapse.  The organisations in control of the fishing industry are pretty much in control of the situation.  They are led by men who understand the fishing industry.  In the circumstances the Deputy can be assured that I will keep the point he made on quotas very much to the forefront at the June meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers.  The quotas under the Common Fisheries Policy which are of concern to me were also of concern to my predecessor.  The Deputy's points are reasonable although I do not necessarily agree with everything he said.  I have taken note of them.</P>

      <P>Over the past three years the Defence Forces have been actively implementing the terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  Since September 1990 a Defence Advisory Committee, comprising both military and civilian personnel, has monitored and directed a programme to ensure the comprehensive implementation of its provisions.</P>
      <P>Safety statements and safety representatives are now in place at unit level and 63 safety standards providing detailed technical safety guidelines on a wide range of general and specifically military activities have been completed and issued.</P>
      <P>In particular the resources which have been made available for safety training highlight the importance and seriousness with which the Department has approached this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department is funding an ongoing training programme for military personnel. To date three officers have obtained the safety diploma awarded by UCD, a further 12 will graduate in 1994 and one officer has obtained a Master's Degree in Ergonomic Design at the University of Limerick; 220 safety representatives have been trained; 26 instructors have been trained in the procedures for manual handling and have initiated training at local level; 50 military personnel have completed a safety officer foundation training course and the medical corps has trained 40 first-aid instructors and the engineer corps has trained 30 fire warden instructors who are now providing further training at unit level.</P>
      <P>In addition seminars on noise, manual handling and occupational diseases will be conducted during 1993.</P>
      <P>The Defence Advisory Committee will continue to provide ongoing guidance and advice on matters relating to safety, health and welfare in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but the action was taken by another Minister.  Do the regulations made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on 18 February last effectively deprive serving members of the Permanent Defence Forces of any protection under this Act?  Why was the proposal which PDFORRA negotiated with the health and safety authority and recommended to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment totally ignored and set aside?  I am not suggesting that the Minister present set it aside but the left side of the Government, in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, ignored this Minister's responsibilities. Why did officers in the Department of Defence fáil to hold discussions on this issue with PDFORRA before agreeing a totally unsatisfactory text with the Department of Enterprise and Employment?</P>

I cannot give the Deputy a specific or correct answer from the information I have but if the Deputy raises the matter later I will probably have a more detailed answer for him.</P>
      <P>I would be surprised if what the Deputy said is 100 per cent accurate; I am not suggesting that he is misrepresenting the situation but I would like to think that what has been done to date and what will be done in conjunction with RACO and PDFORRA will be complementary and, hopefully, to the advantage of both organisations.  The Deputy will agree that while there should be no difficulty with the hygiene and health regulations when the Defence Forces are operating at home when members are serving abroad, or in combat, we have to take a different view.</P>

I understand the Deputy believes there was not proper consultation with PDFORRA, or that as a result of consultations held the subsequent application of the regulations was unsatisfactory.  If that is the case I will certainly address the matter.  However, I cannot agree with the Deputy that the regulations are not operating properly.</P>

      <P>As I informed Deputy Brown in my reply of 24 February 1993, I have asked that the provisions in relation to confiscation of boats convicted of serious fishing offences be reviewed. The examination of the legal aspects of the matter in consultation with the Attorney General's Office is ongoing.  On completion of this examination I will consider whether the relevant legislation should be amended in order to increase the likelihood that vessels are confiscated on a second or subsequent offence.  Until the matter has been carefully assessed and all the legislative implications fully examined, it would be inappropriate to anticipate the conclusions which may be reached or the action which may be taken.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  When the news first came to light that boats with secret holds were trawling in our waters it caused much anxiety, not alone to people involved in the fishing industry but to the public in general.  It is unacceptable that boats with false holds are operating within a very short distance from our shores.  Will the Minister say how many boats were discovered with false holds and what is their country of origin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The largest number of boats discovered with false holds were Spanish boats.  During 1992, 32 vessels were convicted of illegal fishing and the owners were fined an average of £22,263. There is a problem in relation to the so-called secret holds, which is a mean manifestation of fishing and is not in the context of the true maritime tradition. What I would like to do &mdash; I have already been in touch with the Attorney General in this regard &mdash; is to seek the confiscation of boats for a first offence.  Under present legislation boats may be confiscated only for a second or subsequent offence.  The penalty imposed at present is confiscation of fish and gear and a fine of £100,000, but inevitably that fine is not administered. As the Deputy is aware, inevitably when a boat is discovered to be fishing illegally the owner is fined and convicted.  However, the boat may come back into the same waters under different ownership and if caught fishing illegally cannot be confiscated for a second offence.  That is a matter that needs to be seriously addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>Gross registered tonnage (GRT) is a measure of vessel size.  There are numerous different methods of measuring this tonnage depending on the parts of the vessel which come within the relevant definition.  The main methods used in the European Community are based on the London Convention and the Oslo Convention. Generally speaking the London Convention method gives for any particular vessel a higher tonnage than the Oslo Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am reading this reply slowly is that the definitions of vessel sizes as between one country and another <Col N="409" /> would put Alice in Wonderland to shame.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of other methods, specific in some cases to individual countries and drawing on their own maritime traditions.  There may also be specific methods of measurement of GRT in so far as smaller vessels are concerned. At the moment in this country three methods of measurement &mdash; the London Convention, the Oslo Convention and the so-called Part IV method, which draws from 1894 UK merchant shipping legislation &mdash; are used depending on the length etc of the vessel concerned.</P>
    <P>The position in Ireland is not dissimilar from the position in most other member states where a range of measurement methods apply.  There is clearly a need for standardisation in this regard so as to properly regulate and monitor the evolution of member states fleets and so as to ensure proper controls and transparency when vessels are being transferred from one member state's register to another.</P>
    <P>The questions of standardisation is being actively pursued at the moment at Community level.  Indeed, the European Commission, on the basis of a 1986 Council regulation, takes the view that all member states are required to remeasure their fishing fleets <i>in toto</i> according to the London Convention not later than July 1994.  The Commission interpretation is, however, in dispute.</P>
    <P>The possibility of having the matter concluded by 1994 is as remote as are the measurements which apply to ships in various countries.  In any event the remeasurement of all vessels could be a major undertaking requiring a lot of time and expense.  I undertake to keep the House fully informed of any developments in this regard.  It is optimistic to think that in the circumstances the matter will be resolved by 1994.</P>

I will be glad to keep the Deputy informed of any development in this regard.  It is a very serious problem.  I do not understand why there is not standardisation in 1993 between one country and another in the Twelve, which presumes to be the fount of most of our wisdom in many respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Maritime Transport Council on 15 March 1993 held a preliminary exchange of views on the Commission's Communication on &ldquo;A Common Policy on Safe Seas&rdquo;.  The Commission Communication presents a programme of action to improve maritime safety and prevention of marine pollution through the elimination of substandard operators, vessels and crews from Community waters irrespective of the flag of the ships. At the Council I welcomed the thrust of the Commission's proposals and urged the implementation of the action programme as quickly as possible.  I stressed that it is only through concerted action at Community level that substandard ships can effectively be eliminated from Community waters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that shipping is an international industry and under the Law of the Sea Convention all ships have the right of innocent passage through any state's territorial waters.  Given the global character of the shipping industry, most of the rules and standards for ships are negotiated in the International Maritime Organisation.  This international regulatory framework is of fundamental importance and it is in that context that performance standards for flag states must be enforced.</P>
      <P>There is a striking variation in the level of safety performance between world shipping fleets, largely due to the different levels at which flag states implement and enforce the internationally agreed standards &mdash; and this, is by no means confined to the so-called flags of convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's proposal, quite correctly, focuses on the need to ensure, that member states apply uniformly high standards to ships flying their flags and that member states take a co-ordinated uniform approach to enforcing the same <Col N="412" /> standards on ships of all flags operating in Community waters.</P>
    <P>In light of this I urged that priority be given to the following measures: promotion of and compliance with enhanced international rules and standards on construction, equipment, operation, maintenance and general safety of all ships; enhanced level of port state control inspection of foreign ships coming into ports; identification of ecologically sensitive coastal areas and the introduction of measures for their protection; the introduction of ship traffic reporting and monitoring systems; and early adoption of the Council Directive on reporting requirements for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting cargoes into and out of Community ports.  The directive should also be expanded to provide for comprehensive reporting systems for ships transiting along Community coasts.</P>
    <P>I hope that the intensive programme of work to advance these and other measures will proceed quickly.  It is vital that Ministers are presented with a number of concrete measures for approval at the next Council in June.  This will mark the critical first steps towards better implementation and enforcement of safety standards by all ships irrespective of the flag under which they operate.</P>

      <P>How soon does the Minister think action might be taken on the Commission's communication on action required following the accident on the Shetlands?  Was there any decision with regard to the possibility of a European coastguard service at the Council meeting which the Minister attended and were there any discussions on what steps might be taken to monitor and restrict the carrying of dangerous and polluting goods on ships in territorial waters, or at least in Community waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there was an awareness of the dangers of ships carrying certain cargos, there was no discussion about a European coastguard. There was an awareness of the need to have some type of control over ships <Col N="413" /> approaching from the west, in respect of which Ireland would be very vulnerable in accidents of this kind.  From that point of view I was happy with the response.  I hope the proposals put before the Commission in June will be satisfactory at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware, I am sure, that there is massive lobbying by the oil industry, who are resisting requirements to update oil tankers, which have posed the greatest risk to marine life in recent years.  Was that matter discussed and have any steps been taken to overcome the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was touched on briefly because there is an awareness now in the International Maritime Organisation that some oil companies are renting inferior ships and that there is a danger that these ships may not be seaworthy.  The IMO are the body who will be most effective in controlling that type of activity.  That will be taken on board at the next meeting in June.</P>

      <P>As a result of its examination of the superannuation arrangements for the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission concluded that the overall value of the benefits provided for the Defence Forces is considerably in excess of those available under other public service schemes.  Apart from one recommendation which involved reckoning military service allowance for pension purposes and which has been implemented, the Commission considered that changes in the superannuation arrangements should be introduced only in the context of a fundamental revision of the Defence Forces pension schemes.</P>
      <P>The Commission recognised that such a revision would be a task of considerable technical complexity.  Because of this the revision will be a long term project and the question of applying to the Defence Forces the limited occupational injuries cover which applies to members of the Garda Síochána will be considered in the context of this revision.</P>
      <P>The Garda Compensation Acts cover only injuries maliciously inflicted on a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of his duty.  Cover for accidental injuries sustained in the course of duty is provided under the Social Welfare occupational injuries scheme.  In contrast, the Army Pensions Acts make provision for all injuries sustained in the course of duty by members of the Defence Forces, whether sustained accidentally or maliciously inflicted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="417" /> Nos. 11 and 17 together.  No decision has been taken in regard to Irish participation in the United Nations mission which will replace the Unified Task Force to Somalia.  The matter will be considered by the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>In November 1992 the Government agreed to provide a transport contingent of approximately 60 personnel together with equipment for service with the United Nations Observer Mission in Somalia.  This decision was not implemented due to the deployment of the Unified Task Force in Somalia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not be prepared to do that but I would be prepared to have a look at the new distinction drawn by the recent United States resolution requesting troops from those countries who are engaging in a peacekeeping role as distinct from a peace making or enforcement role.  There is a distinction to be drawn there.  I would be strongly in favour of sending the 60 to 70 personnel of the transport unit to Somalia, as already proposed.  It may well be necessary for me, arising from whatever advice I may get from the Attorney General, to introduce amending legislation to the Defence Act, 1960, which does not define precisely the word &ldquo;policing&rdquo; but deals with it in a non-definitional fashion.  It may be necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to the UN Resolution setting up UNOSOM II. If that is required I will do so because I am determined to make the recommendation to the Government that a unit should go from this country reflecting the will of the Irish people, arising from their generosity to the people of Somalia since the plight of that country was brought to public attention last year.  The sending of a unit to Somalia would reflect the general goodwill of the Irish people towards the tragic people of Somalia.</P>

      <P>I understand most countries have no difficulty with peace enforcement roles.  There may be some countries that do have such difficulties. During the past few weeks I have been studying the magazine <i>Jane's Weekly Review</i> which deals with the military aspect.  It contains a very interesting essay on the change in emphasis from peace keeping to peace enforcement or peace making.  I shall get a copy for the Deputy's information so that he can examine it.  I understand there are a number of countries who have the same difficulties and that they will be addressing them in a similar fashion.  I will be making recommendations to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 38 together.  As I have previously indicated to the house I have put in place an expanded research, <Col N="420" /> conservation and management programme for 1993 following my consideration of the Sea Trout Working Group Report which was published some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that further research needed to be undertaken in 1993 into the causes of the sea trout problem and also recommended a number of conservation and management measures which should be taken, or enhanced, to halt the decline in sea trout numbers and to rebuild stocks.</P>
      <P>The 1993 programme is being undertaken in close consultation with all relevant interests including the fisheries boards, fishery owners and fishfarmers. It builds on measures taken in previous years.  I would like to take this opportunity to outline again for the House the key components of the programme.</P>
      <P>Research is continuing with additional emphasis on stock sampling data and sea lice biology and distribution.  The working group will remain in place to evaluate and report on research projects undertaken this year.  Conservation bye-laws to protect existing sea trout stocks are being renewed, and will possibly be extended, for 1993.  Rehabilitation of sea trout stocks will be developed under a national stock enhancement programme being formulated under the Department's direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management strategies for fish farms are being enhanced and formalised, with particular emphasis on the development of agreed fallowing guidelines, bay management strategies and fish husbandry practices aimed at minimising lice loads and disease incidence.  I have established a representative advisory group to examine and recommend on fallowing strategies. The group, which will hold its first meeting next week, includes representation from the central Fisheries Board, the Irish Salmon Growers Association and technical and scientific experts from the Department.  The group will also bring on board local and regional expertise from the fishery boards and fish farm operators when it comes to examine specific fallowing site proposals for particular areas. <Col N="421" /> The Department's sea lice monitoring programme for 1993 has been underway since February.  The organisation, frequency and co-ordination of this programme is being kept under close review to ensure that monitoring results and related follow up actions are communicated to the relevant interests in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>In my meetings with representatives of the fishery owners and fish farmers I have stressed the importance of a consensus approach to resolving the complex problem of sea trout declines.  I have also stressed that the best possible flow of information on progress on the various initiatives will be maintained to assist all our thinking.  I am confident that the action now being taken will have the full support and co-operation of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that we are not talking about a decline in sea trout but a collapse of the sea trout industry?  Will he agree that it is unusual for businesses directly affected by this collapse to take such action as they did in October to publicise by way of advertisement the tremendous difficulties they are experiencing?  Will he acknowledge the effect this collapse in sea trout numbers is having on what was traditionally a lucrative part of our tourist industry?  Does the Minister not feel that the response he has given is really more of the same?  The commitment to research and monitoring is welcome but there must be a far greater effort to reverse this collapse and to examine the question of alternatives in regard to salmon fishing as has been carried out in other countries where a land based salmon fishing industry is built up using tanks, which would eliminate the effects sea lice are having on sea trout?</P>

Both the Department and I are conscious of those difficulties <Col N="422" /> and all possible steps are being taken at present to alleviate them.  A meeting will take place this week on this matter and I hope that before long we will be able to put forward the necessary proposals to resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>I understood that item No. 4 was being withdrawn, because there was no agreement on this proposal in regard to the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Whips' meetings.  If that is not the case, I oppose the taking of No. 4 at this time. It would be far more fruitful if agreement could be reached on the terms of the motion before it is put before the House.

      <P>We too wish to oppose the taking of this matter.  We were informed a short time ago that it was being removed from the Order of Business today.  We oppose the taking of this motion because the terms of reference are far too restrictive.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be required to attend the committee only when it is considering a Bill or an Estimate.  There have been three Foreign Affairs Bills only in the last five <Col N="553" /> years; therefore, effectively the Minister would never be there.  We are opposed also to debates on Northern Ireland being held in private.  That is not appropriate. While it would be appropriate that the committee could decide from time to time to hold a debate in private, it should not be required to hold all debates on Northern Ireland in private.  The Progressive Democrats' Party is opposed to taking this motion for those reasons.  It is also opposed to agreeing to the establishment of this committee without a debate in the House when the terms of reference have not been agreed by all parties.'</P>

There may be objections by the Department of Foreign Affairs to discussing security and political matters in public, but we would prefer to see the committee up and running. I repeat that this is an expediency motion, a statement of intent to set up the committee; it is not an establishment motion.  Deputies who object to the motion at this stage will have an opportunity between the expediency motion and the establishment motion to discuss the matter further.</P>

Has the Taoiseach made any provision at this stage to prepare the necessary legislation <Col N="556" /> for that purpose and, if so, when will it be introduced?  What are the implications of the current legal limbo for the enforcement of existing regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoisseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy and the House that, as outlined in the Government's statement today, there is an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court on 1 April 1993 in the case of <i>Meagher v. the Minister for Agriculture and Food</i> whereby part of section 3 (2) of the European Communities Act, 1972, was declared to be unconstitutional.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry brought before the Government today a draft Bill dealing with the part of that decision relating to animal diseases. This Bill will be introduced in the House immediately after the Easter recess.  The other fundamental issues are being appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Attorney General and all the relevant Government Departments are analysing the position should the Supreme Court decision not be fully, or partly, in the Government's favour so that appropriate action can be taken when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the High Court judgment was to the effect that this House had not been doing its job, so to speak, since 1972? Even if the Government's appeal to the Supreme Court is successful we should take on board that finding with a view to ensuring that more of the regulations made by the Government are approved in some fashion by this House or a committee of this House rather than made simply by executive order.  We need to take this point into account in the overall reform of Dáil procedures so that we have a process which ensures that this sort of challenge cannot be made again.</P>

      <P>The original challenge related to regulations made on foot of Acts which were found by the judge concerned to be unconstitutional.  That aspect of doing business was unconstitutional. There are other aspects of the judgment which are not very clear as yet.  Be that <Col N="557" /> as it may, what I said last week still holds today, that is, the best way the House can approach its business in future in this regard is through the operation of the standing committees of this House. These committees will give us the opportunity to deal with European Directives in a better manner in future.  Of course, I am not prejudging the finding of the Supreme Court in relation to the overall position.</P>

    <P>I would point out that I have put down two amendments, Nos. 1 and 2.  I propose to delete paragraphs (10) and (11).  Paragraph <Col N="568" /> (10) provides the committee with the functions which should be more correctly the functions of a European Affairs Committee.  I am, therefore proposing the deletion of that paragraph so that this House may proceed at a later stage to set up a European Affairs Committee, which is essential if this House is to address itself to those issues.  I ask that paragraph (11) also be deleted.  It is my belief that it is not proper to oblige a committee to address issues relating to Northern Ireland in complete secrecy.  I also believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;24.  &mdash;(1)  The Authority and other road authorities shall, with the approval of the local authorities concerned, regulate the carrying out of road works in connection with the maintenance or provision of gas, water, electricity and telecommunications services (other than works undertaken by local authorities).</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to clarify most of what we want the National Roads Authority to do.  Our concern has <Col N="571" /> been voiced frequently in Dublin, and elsewhere, to ensure proper co-ordination of the different works in order to minimise the inconvenience to or interference with road users, also to minimise the amount and frequency of occasions on which road surfaces are disturbed by these works.</P>
      <P>We provide in the proposed section 24 (2) for regulations which I do not think would be upset in the context of the European Communities Act, 1972, to allow the Authority bring some order and control into these activities.</P>
      <P>I do not need to deal at great length with the disturbance and annoyance caused when after a new portion of road has been finished another agency digs it up to carry out one of its functions and then part repairs it.  Sometime later a second agency may carry out its operations, digs up the road again, half repairs it and leaves.  This means that, within no time a new portion of road looks as if it has been there for the past 50 years with lorries and so on trundling over it.</P>
      <P>The intention is to endeavour to find a means of giving the Authority power to put some order and sequence into all of these things so that, at the end of the day, we get better value for the money expended on road construction and road users receive a better service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, in particular the imposition of penalties for undue delays.  People are extremely concerned about the duration of roadworks leading to great inconvenience for the public.  In regard to building programmes, a penalty can be imposed if a contractor exceeds the agreed completion date.  It would not be unreasonable to have a similar provision in relation to roadworks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our proposed section 24 (2) (e) &mdash; the adequate re-instatement of roads &mdash; this is a constant bone of contention, particuarly at local authority level where councillors are inundated with representations by constituents in regard to road repairs.  There should be consultation with other authorities in <Col N="572" /> regard to the adequate re-instatement of roads and some agreement reached as to when such works should be undertaken. Very often we discover that the works undertaken to re-instate roads are inadequate, occasioning a continuing problem with regard to their maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, support the amendment and would like to make two points, the first is that the proliferation of roadworks carried out by other agencies in connection with the provision of services contributes significantly to the severe traffic problems in Dublin in particular. Many of the traffic jams are caused by roadworks during which very often the same stretch of road is repeatedly dug up and subsquently reinstated. In addition to saving the public purse money in road resurfacing and maintenance costs, a greater degree of co-ordination, which is what the amendment calls for, would help in addressing the traffic problem.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make is that a case can be made for the Minister for the Environment providing a greater degree of co-ordination with regard to services provided and works undertaken by local authorities funded by the Department of the Environment.  During the next few years much work, which I presume will be funded from the Cohesion Fund, will be undertaken by local authorities in connection with improvements to water supply schemes and the provision of sewerage systems. Inevitably, this will give rise to roadworks on non-national and county roads, many of which have deteriorated significantly in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case can be made for a programme of road resurfacing and improvement works in conjunction with water supply and sewerage schemes which are to be undertaken by the Department of the Environment. If a road is dug up so that a water main can be laid then, instead of reinstatement, which very often is inadequate, it would make much more sense, from the point of view of the public purse, to carry out road improvement works, which may be necessary in any event, <Col N="573" /> with that work.  Will the Minister of State consider the suggestion that we should attempt to carry out a programme of road improvement and resurfacing work in conjunction with water supply and sewerage schemes which will probably be undertaken in future years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we gave a promise that, following the enactment and implementation of this Bill, we would carry out a comprehensive review of the law governing road openings.  I would prefer at this stage not to pre-empt the outcome of that review.  Perhaps Deputy Flanagan, through Deputy Dukes, will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>We all realise that there is a serious problem.  Section 101 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, enables Dublin County Council and Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and Galway Corporations to exercise powers of control over the ESB, Telecom Éireann and Bord Gáis but it is obvious that these have not been effective; we need new legislation.  On Committee Stage the Minister gave a commitment to carry out a comprehensive review when this Bill passes through the Seanad.  Following the review new legislation will be enacted in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister of State and the Minister said on Committee Stage but I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment on that basis as I want it on the record that the Government had the opportunity to take action now but did not take it. Having said that, I hope the Minister, with his 37 seat majority ensures that this Bill will pass through the House.  We know what the problem is and how to deal with it and I cannot see the reason for making a federal case out of bringing the legislation forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> In page 25, line 37, after &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and grants under this section shall be made having particular regard to the maintenance requirements of national roads&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>We are trying to include a particular reference in this Bill to the maintenance requirements of national roads.  This matter was dealt with at some length on Committee Stage when the Minister said that he was reluctant to include this provision in the Bill because of a number of other considerations.  I find this argument underwhelming.  There is little sense in embarking on a substantial programme, as I hope we will, of upgrading the principal national routes and building new roads, where required, if it is not buttressed and supported by an explicit commitment, in the context of the fundamental Act which sets out the functions of the National Roads Authority, that it is also responsible for the maintenance of national roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say, as he did on Committee Stage, that we have to apply limited resources to the whole programme but one of the problems, and it arose indirectly on the last amendment, is that some of the functions which should be carried out after work on a particular phase of the road network has started are not being carried out adequately.  I do not think anyone would pretend that there is adequate maintenance of the principal national trunk routes.  Like many other Members of the House, I am well aware of this because I frequently use many of our principal trunk routes and I had a very upsetting experience recently while driving towards Roscrea.  Just outside the town I thought I had a puncture because it sounded as if one of my types had gone. I stopped my car and I am glad to say that all my tyres were perfectly in order, the road surface had given me the impression that I had a puncture.  I hesitate to claim that I was travelling at no more than the maximum legal speed limit &mdash; I may have been going a mile or two faster &mdash; but it was a very upsetting experience.  The problem is that there is <Col N="575" /> inadequate maintenance of that national route.</P>
    <P>In the past few days on another national trunk route on which I travel very often I came across a section which has recently been &ldquo;scarified&rdquo;&mdash; this is the term used.  When the road authority in question finds that the road surface is slippery at this point it uses a machine which has the effect of a metal cone being drawn along the surface of the road.  This is intended, apparently, on a temporary basis, to make the road less slippery in wet weather.  If one comes across one of these sections at night, not expecting a change in the surface, it can be offputting.</P>
    <P>These are only minor examples of a lack of maintenance of our national trunk routes and it is not desirable that this should be the case.  A provision in a Bill such as this which makes specific reference to the need for maintenance, which is what this amendment does, is not only desirable but should be supported. As I said at the outset, the Minister will argue that there are limited resources and that certain commitments must be fulfilled but it is not enough to say that other considerations have to be taken into account.  We are entitled to feel that a section of national road which has been raised to a particular standard should be reliably maintained at that standard.  I ask the Minister of State to be more adventurous than the Minister and to accept explicitly one of the things that the Minister implicitly accepts but does not want to include in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is cold comfort for road users when they find an inadequately maintained stretch of the national primary route to know the Minister in his heart implicitly accepts the need to maintain it properly. The amendment sets out the very minimum provision we can insert in the Bill to deal with the problem of maintenance. I suggest that it will not cost him anything in terms of either money or prestige to accept this amendment but it will give a great deal of comfort to road users and useful direction to the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I tabled a question to the Minister about the provision of adequate moneys for the maintenance of our national primary routes and to this end I support the amendment.  Whether the moneys come from the Community or, as suggested in this section &ldquo;such amounts as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;, at the end of the day we must maintain our network of primary roads.  I do not think it is acceptable to invest time, effort and money on our national roads and yet allow them to disintegrate due to a lack of maintenance, like spoiling the ship for a hap'worth of tar.  For instance, very serious remedial action had to be taken on the Tallaght by-pass.  We do not want to see this happen.  We want to see the necessary maintenance carried out in an efficient manner on a regular basis.  The moneys should be provided for our roads so that they will be maintained to a sufficiently high standard.  Deputy Dukes is right in seeking to ensure that it is built into the Bill that moneys be provided for maintenance of our national roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 80:</P>
      <P>In page 27, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;and shall appoint one of the members to be Chairman of the Authority.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" />&ldquo;and shall include in his appointments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  one representative of the professional and technical staff of roads authorities, elected in an election to be conducted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions;</P>
    <P>(ii)  one representative of the road workers of roads authorities, elected in an election to be conducted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a representative of road safety offices to be elected by the Roads Safety Association;</P>
    <P>(iv)  two representatives of the General Council of County Councils;</P>
    <P>(v)  two representatives of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland;</P>
    <P>(vi)  two representatives of the National Road Users Association;</P>
    <P>(vii)  a representative of CIE; and</P>
    <P>(viii)  a representative of An Taisce.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>These amendments deal with the composition of the National Roads Authority. At present the Minister has discretion to appoint whomever he or she likes as a member of the National Roads Authority.  As we are dealing with a number of amendments I will refer now to the Minister's own amendment, as I believe it does not improve the situation substantially.  Amendment No. 84 states:</P>
    <P>(d)  Each member of the Authority shall be a person who in the opinion of the Minister has wide experience and competence in relation to roads,...</P>
    <P>That statement could apply to any driver of a motor vehicle or even somebody on a bicycle.  It continues:</P>
    <P>... transport, industrial, commercial, financial or environmental matters, local government, the organisation of workers or administration...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> It is not clear from this amendment if each member of the Authority would have to have experience in all of these spheres.  If they were to have such experience it is not membership of the National Roads Authority they should qualify for but we might have somebody who is qualified to run Aer Lingus, or even the country, or even deal with some of the emergencies we have at present.  If, as I suspect, the intention is to make general provision, like in the Vocational Education Act, 1930, where in theory members of vocational education committees are supposed to have &ldquo;knowledge of and experience in educational matters&rdquo; or the manner in which people qualify for nomination to the various panels for election to Seanad Éireann where they are required to have &ldquo;knowledge of or inexperience in&rdquo; different areas, the practice can be quite different.  It stretches credibility on some occasions to see the level of knowledge of or experience in the field which qualifies someone for nomination to the Seanad or indeed in some cases for appointment as a member of a vocational education committee and bodies of that kind.  A Minister who is determined to make a political appointment &mdash; and even Ministers of this Government, I suggest, have been tempted to make appointments of that kind from time to time &mdash; can very easily find ways around it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to define the categories of persons and organisations who should be represented on the National Roads Authority.  The amendments proposed by myself, Deputy Dukes, Deputy Keogh and Deputy Flanagan are similar in that regard.  In my amendment I seek to ensure that the Minister shall include in his appointments representatives of the professional and technical staffs of roads authorities and of road workers &mdash; I deliberately choose that formulation &mdash; and that they be elected in procedures established by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is important that we ensure that people who are directly involved, for example, a local authority roads engineer or road worker, because of their knowledge and experience of <Col N="579" /> roads, be appointed.  It is much better that we get somebody like that than a professional trade union leader as he or she may not necessarily have the degree of expertise &mdash; even though they represent workers in this field &mdash; knowledge or, indeed, time to commit themselves to membership of the National Roads Authority.  Similarly I think it is important that a representative of the Roads Safety Association would be included.  I have spoken before on the necessity to heighten awareness of road safety.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths on our roads varies from between 400 to 600 per annum, depending on the year one takes. This is of the order of magnitude of the crisis in Northern Ireland, yet it is very often passed over.  I also make provision for representatives of the bodies representing local authorities, the National Road Users Association, the public transport authority and An Taisce, in view of the obvious environmental consideration that has to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am not offering this as the absolute be all and end all of membership of the National Roads Authority but it is desirable that a formula of this kind is built into the legislation to provide a basis for appointments to the National Roads Authority rather than leaving it entirely at the discretion of the Minister, albeit qualified by the amendment which he himself proposes.  He has before him a number of options and I appeal to him to accept one of the options as they are all in the same general vein.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's sentiments.  We should look at what we are doing in this Bill: we are proposing to delegate a very important function to a new national authority.  We are doing that for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the concern with efficiency in having the programme carried out and because there is a number of areas where, by its structure, this House cannot make effective decisions on a day-to-day basis &mdash; nor should it <Col N="580" /> be involved in that detail.  We will be delegating a very important function to this Authority which will be spending substantial sums of money, including Irish taxpayers' money, money from the European Community and money borrowed from banks all over the world.  The Bill as it stands proposes to allow this new Authority to have borrowings at any given time of up to £500 million for which ultimately the State will be responsible. Therefore, we are not talking in terms of small potatoes; we are talking about very important functions.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage when a number of options were presented.  The Minister gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to consider a Report Stage amendment.  He stated in the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I am prepared to consider a Report Stage amendment which would provide that members of the National Roads Authority should be persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have wide experience in areas relevant to the functions of the Authority.</P>
      <P>Considering the range of amendments before us, the Minister has put forward a tame amendment, amendment No. 84. I was speaking about small potatoes a moment ago.  The Minister's approach on this issue puts me in mind of a person brought into a high class restaurant with an extensive <i>a la carte</i> menu who, on looking through the menu, decides to do the safe thing &mdash; people in Wexford are not always adventurous &mdash; and have a small mixed grill.  This is the most timorous, conservative and least imaginative option the Minister could have chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That feeling is reinforced when one considers the range of options put before the Minister.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment refers to representatives of such bodies as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Road Safety Association, the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the National Road Users Association, CIE and An Taisce.  A series of considerations is also put forward relating to transport policy, traffic manments&mdash;&mdash;<Col N="581" /> agement, town planning, environmental sensitivity, road construction, road maintenance, bus and rail operation, transportation geography and transportation economics.  Other bodies are mentioned such as the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland, the Automobile Association, the Transport Committee of the Confederation of Irish Industry &mdash; now IVEC &mdash; the Irish Planning Institute, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Road Hauliers Association, Iarnród Éireann and the Irish Ports Association. All of these bodies have a legitimate interest in this matter, have expertise to offer and could usefully reinforce a board of this kind.</P>
    <P>There has been a great fashion &mdash; I do not normally follow these fashions but I recognise they are there &mdash; to criticise members of the boards of State and semi-State organisations.  On occasion many of these criticisms have been justified &mdash; although some very curious decisions have been made recently, with people being put in charge of semi-State operations who only a few months ago appeared to be anathema to the people now appointing them.  However, I will leave that matter aside because I do not want to make personal remarks about anybody.  It is evident that there have been cases &mdash; I will not be specific but Members of the House will know perfectly well what I am talking about &mdash; where people have been appointed to boards who have not had a great deal of specific expertise to bring to bear on matters they have had to deal with.  In common with most other Members of this House who have been in Government, I have had experience of being approached by people who would like to be a member of a State board, who were not particular as to which board they wished to be appointed and who had no qualfication for that job.  I am glad to say that in most such cases those people got from me what is colloquially known as the bum's rush, and quite properly so.</P>
    <P>In this case the interests and areas of expertise can be identified and there are people available who could make a very valuable contribution to the work of the <Col N="582" /> Roads Authority.  Even in the formulation of his amendment the Minister has made it clear he agrees that people with expertise are needed, but he simply has not had the courage or self-confidence to make up his mind as to which of these areas he favours.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that some of the other fashions that are evident these days will come into play.  I bet my bottom dollar that on the day the Minister makes up his mind about this board a number of considerations will be brought to bear on him.  There will be pressure on the Minister to make sure the board is representative of this group and that group and of this gender and that gender.  He may find that there is a less than optimal combination of people on the board because he cannot find in the various areas the appropriate gofors or tofors, as they have become known.  Some of the ideas of having quotas of various kinds will probably produce as bad a result as the idea of having no quota at all. However that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to say he is not going to confine himself to the terms of his amendment No. 84 and to tell us which dishes he will take from the extensive menu before him in the other amendments. I would be quite happy if the Minister, when he brings this Bill to the Seanad, would be more specific in his proposal in relation to this section of the Bill than he is in amendment No. 84.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies put forward related amendments on this matter, the principle behind which relates to accountability.  I object to the selection of people who look for appointment to State boards, who have no expertise in any particular area but who believe that if they were a member of a State board it would look good on their CV.  We are asking that the Minister go further than the proposal in his amendment. We are nominating bodies that should put forward representatives for the Roads Authority and this is a matter that should be considered by the Minister. It is not good enough for him to say that each member of the Authority shall <Col N="583" /> be a person who, in his opinion, has wide experience and competence in relation to roads.  He must be more specific.  It might be the opinion of the Minister that somebody has a particular competence in this area, but that opinion may not be widely shared.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the specifics in each of these amendments.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in relation to the bodies I have nominated.  I took as objective a view as possible so that a wide range of bodies would be represented who would have a direct interest in roads, who would have expertise and experience in this area and who would make an impact at the boardroom table, which is extremely important.  I would remind the Minister that in setting up the Environmental Protection Agency distinct bodies were selected in relation to the nomination of the director of that board.  It is important to nominate fairly and, in terms of accountability, democracy and so on, it is important that it be seen to be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is too vague.  Perhaps I do not agree with Deputy Dukes but I remind the Minister that we expect a 40 per cent representation by women on any authority appointed by him.  That would not lower the standard, in fact it would probably raise it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the special committee report.

I suspect that political party appointees or party hacks are not necessarily the best people to appoint to any State board.  We must look at the competence of individuals.  I am sure the Minister is concerned about this but we need to be more specific as to the type of people we appoint to represent us.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> During the special committee a number of amendments was tabled suggesting that representatives of a range of organisations should be members of the national authority. The Minister was opposed to the idea of members representing various interest groups and indicated that he would consider an amendment requiring appointees to have experience or expertise. I am now proposing an amendment which will ensure that members of the National Roads Authority will be persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have a wide experience of and have shown capacity in relation to roads, transport, industry, commerce, finance and other environmental matters, local government, the organisation of workers or administration.  I am opposing the amendments tabled by Deputies Gilmore and Flanagan because I want an authority which acts as a cohesive executive in a single-minded way.  I do not want a collection of people whose first loyalty is the organisation they represent.  However, I will listen carefully to any suggestions put forward by the organisations listed in the amendment or to other suggestions in relation to suitable persons for appointment to the Authority.  The Government amendment represents the best approach.  It guarantees the independence of the members and the relevance of their expertise and experience.</P>
      <P>On foot of a suggestion by Deputy Yates and an amendment by Deputy Flanagan I am proposing an amendment specifying a maximum term of office of five years for members of the Authority. It will be open to the Minister of the day to reappoint all or some of the Authority when the term expires.</P>
      <P>It is part and parcel of the Programme for Government that we should have 40 per cent representation by women on State bodies.  That policy will be adhered to.  I hope we will not end up with a board comprising party hacks.  I have always maintained that the best people should be put on the board regardless of political affiliations and I hope that will apply in regard to this Authority.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has proposed a limit of five years on the tenure of membership of the National Roads Authority, although it is open to the Minister to reappoint the Authority.  I welcome the Minister's statement that it is intended to comply with the commitment to have a minimum of 40 per cent representation by women on the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not clarify whether each member of the National Roads Authority will have to fulfil all the requirements listed here or simply one of them.  On reading the list I came to the conclusion that I must be one of the few people who fulfils all these requirements, although under another provision of the Bill I am probably ineligible for membership of the National Roads Authority. The amendment does not meet what we are setting out to achieve in relation to membership of the National Roads Authority being drawn from defined constituencies representing different interests, and ensuring that that mix is provided for.  I ask the Chair to formally put the amendment in my name.</P>

      <P>In page 29, line 5 after &ldquo;grading&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and where such staff are drawn from the Department of the Environment or local authorities, each appointment shall be subject to the consent of the individual concerned&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that when staff are transferred from local authorities or the Department of the Environment to the National Roads Authority the transfers contemplated in the Bill should be on a voluntary basis.  This matter has been discussed in the context of other legislation debated in the House and we have always tried to provide that transfers of that kind would be on a voluntary basis as it would be undesirable to have any element of compulsion.  Since we set up An Post, Telecom Éireann and other companies, there is certainly enough experience in moving staff from one form of public authority to another to enable us to handle the question of staff transfers of this kind sensitively without causing undue friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to make that point here because the Minister knows there are other areas of legislation within his <Col N="587" /> Department where similar questions arise.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency Act provides for the transfer of staff from local authorities to another agency.  In that area also we went to some lengths, both in this House and in the Seanad, to ensure we got as far as possible, a system that could be operated satisfactorily in the sense of putting the right staff in the right place without causing friction, that is, without compulsion. I am not sure it can be said that staff transfers in all areas of the public service have worked entirely to our satisfaction, but it is fair to say that successive Governments and the public service unions have gone to a great deal of trouble to try to ensure that the moves judged to be essential by the Houses of the Oireachtas could take place without causing problems. For that reason we put forward this amendment so as to ensure that transfers can be carried out without causing undue friction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i> Before proceeding to deal with the substantial point in the amendment I should like to clarify the purpose of sections 30 and 31.  The purpose of section 31 is to provide for the transfer of staff from public authorities such as my own Department to the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 30 is to enable the National Roads Authority to employ its own staff.  Section 30 will apply where, for example, the National Roads Authority advertises a particular job and will have nothing to do with the staff transfers envisaged in section 31.  If the National Roads Authority advertises a job and a civil servant or local authority official applies for it and is offered an appointment, the terms and conditions will be determined under section 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated, both in my Second Reading reply and to the Special Committee, that I did not think it appropriate to give individuals a veto under section 31.  The realities are that the functions to be carried out by the National Roads Authority are to a significant extent already performed by officials of my own <Col N="588" /> Department reporting to an interim non-statutory authority.  If the statutory National Roads Authority is to be effective it is essential that those officials continue to work for the new body.  They have the expertise, they would provide continuity and they would have built up an excellent working relationship with local authorities.  It would be unreasonable and unacceptable to deprive the National Roads Authority of this talent bank and expect it to recruit its own staff from day one.</P>
    <P>At this point I should stress that I have not decided what mechanism to use to provide for the continuity of staffing to the National Roads Authority.  As I have mentioned, departmental staff will be transferred under section 30, but another option could be for my Department to provide staffing services to the National Roads Authority under section 32. Section 31 provides an enabling power for the transfer to the National Roads Authority of staff not only from the Department of the Environment but from local authorities or other public bodies where their principal duties relate to functions being taken over by the National Roads Authority.  It is not intended that there would be a wholesale transfer of staff from local authorities or other public bodies though the option of selective transfer or provision of services is being provided for.</P>
    <P>While I cannot accept the Opposition amendments, I did, however, on Committee Stage move an amendment to section 31 which provides for prior notification of and consultation with employees and their trade unions where transfers are proposed.  It is my intention that there would be full consultation with staff interests before any final decisions are taken in this area.</P>

      <P>This subject was the matter of some little debate during Committee Stage.  What was at issue here was the question of disclosure of interests where a conflict of interest may arise.  I would be tempted to draw the Minister out on this because I suspect he may have something in mind in this regard that would be a little different from provisions which a colleague of his, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, may have in mind. Although I would be out of order if I were to go into that, I find it amusing that the Government is proposing the provisions in this Bill on the one hand and that another Minister of State intends to propose much more draconian provisions in a different context, &ldquo;Marcosian&rdquo; provisions, if that word exists.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make clear what the provision means and to make clearer the limits or the boundaries of the disclosures contemplated.  On Committee Stage the Minister said the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; included all the persons, including the specification in the proposed amendment.  He said also that between Committee and Report Stage he would take advice from the parliamentary draftsman and revert to the House on it.  Can the Minister of State give us any indication of what advice has been given and whether it confirms the Minister's view then?  If the Minister of State wishes to expand further on his views of the intentions of Minister of State Fitzgerald we would all be fascinated to hear what he might have to say about that.</P>

    <P>I will be guided by you, Sir.  This is a very simple amendment which would require a road authority to publish a proposed scheme in two or more newspapers circulating in the area where the proposed motorway is to be located.  Section 49 of the Bill requires the Road Authority to publish details of its scheme in one or more newspapers circulating in the area. It is reasonable to request publication of such schemes on a wider basis.  In this case the Authority would get away with publishing such information in one newspaper circulating in the area.  I do not wish to impute bad motives to anybody or to give publicity to a particular newspaper, but in regard to the Kildare bypass it would be open to a road Authority to publish the details of its scheme in a newspaper circulating locally which would be the <i>Kildare Nationalist,</i> which the Minister probably reads from time to time.  The Authority would not be required to publish it, for example, in the <i>Leinster Leader</i> or the <i>Leinster Express.</i> That scheme will affect people who read the <i>Kildare Nationalist,</i> but it will also affect people who read the <i>Leinster Leader</i> and the <i>Leinster Express.</i> In the case of a major project such as this &mdash; and in the interests of full public information and giving people adequate time to express their opinions &mdash; we should <Col N="593" /> require a wider publication than the provision in the Bill.  This would not put an onerous burden on road authorities.  In fact, I would go so far as to recommend that details of such schemes should be published not only in local newspapers, but in the four national daily papers.  It would not involve a substantial cost and would be useful information.  In that way, members of the public would at least know what is taking place and could express their views.</P>
    <P>Members who listen to the traffic reports on RTE in the mornings will be aware of the roadworks near Newcastle on the Naas dual carriageway where a new bridge is being built across the road. Most people who travel that road do not know why the bridge is being built.  It may be argued that such information would not add much to their health, happiness or wisdom, but, in general, people suspect it is part of a new motorway, which is not the case.  Most people do not know that the objective of the project is to link an industrial estate with the west link road around Dublin.  Such information should be published in the national newspapers, that is an option open to a road Authority.  However, this amendment is concerned with the minimum publicity a road Authority must give and it is reasonable to require that details of any schemes should be published in two or more newspapers instead of one or more which is the case under the provisions of the Bill.  This provision would not entail a substantial extra charge on the Exchequer; if that was the case it would have been ruled out of order.  In the interest of the public, the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>There should be the widest possible circulation of information in this regard.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that information should be published in two or more newspapers instead of one or more as stated in the Bill.  We should seek to reach as wide an audience as possible.  I do not believe the Minister is deliberately trying to curtail the supply of information to the public but if the wording of the Bill was not so <Col N="594" /> constrictive it would imply a more open-minded attitude and indicate that the public have a right to be informed.  That was the principle which led me to table my later amendment.  Even with the best will in the world, we know that in certain areas people will read only one newspaper and, perhaps, political affiliations have something to do with that.  We should endeavour to address the widest possible audience.  Therefore, the announcement of schemes should not be confined to publication in one newspaper.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The present requirement to place an advertisement relating to a motorway or toll scheme in one or more newspapers is the statutory minimum requirement.  However, I sympathise with the views expressed by Deputies opposite.  The Minister has powers to make regulations setting down more specific provisions for publicity, where appropriate.  In some cases it might be appropriate to provide for notices in local papers, as Deputy Dukes has pointed out, but I am not sure if this should be included in the legislation.  It would be better if this matter was dealt with by way of regulation.  I will look again at the issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being very unadventurous in regard to this matter. He should think about another point. Why should the poor, misfortunate Minister for the Environment have to consider this issue in the case of every scheme? Any future Minister for the Environment will have plenty to occupy his or her mind without being required, every time a scheme is proposed, to make a decision on whether a notification should be placed in one or more or two or more newspapers.  As the Minister basically accepts the need for more information &mdash; he is very sympathetic on this point &mdash; he should marginally, infinitesimally, reduce the future workload of the Department of the Environment, and the Minister for the Environment, by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 43, line 39, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, within eighteen months of its being submitted to him&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is somewhat more important than amendment No. 105.  It proposes to give the Minister a reasonable time to react to certain proposals which come before him.  I know the difficulties involved in this area.  One of the problems which arises in regard to major road projects is that they appear to almost literally disappear off the map &mdash; nothing happens or nothing is seen to happen &mdash; during a certain period.  The people who have an interest in a project, and those who will be affected by it either in their local environment or in terms of the convenience it offers to them, do not know what is happening.  I know difficulties can arise and the Minister, and his advisers, will require time to make a response, but it is reasonable to provide for a reaction by the Minister within a period of 18 months which, in all conscience, seems to be long enough to allow all the various considerations to be gone into thoroughly by the Minister and the <Col N="596" /> Department of the Environment.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>There may be room for agreement on this issue.  The debate on it on Committee Stage covered a variety of deadlines which ranged between six months and 18 months.  The Minister made the point, probably fairly, that six months would be an impossibly short time.  It is fair to make the counter argument than anything more than 18 months would be an unreasonably long time.  I hope the Minister can agree to the time limit of 18 months proposed in this amendment, which would also have the effect of putting a little more pressure on the official side to come up with its assessments and advices rather more quickly than at present.  I will not go into a long rant about the delays which arise in many areas of planning &mdash; Deputies are familiar enough with these delays without repeating them.  We should, where possible, impose a reasonable time constraint for reactions to proposals of this nature so as to ensure that projects are not merely put on the long finger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> It would be somewhat unfair to tie the hands of the Minister in this way.  I know from debates on environmental issues which took place in my county, and other counties that some can go on for longer than 18 months.  Some schemes can be very large and complex and difficulties and unforeseen hitches can arise.  For example, a public local inquiry may have to be adjourned to seek further information or allow time to review certain issues.  All proposals in regard to motorway schemes must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.  The environmental impacts of the proposed project must also be assessed by the Minister who must allow time for submissions on its contents to be made.  To restrict this process would not allow sufficient time for consideration of all the issues involved in schemes of this magnitude and would be a grave injustice to all the people affected by a scheme who may wish to object to it or make recommendations to the Minister.  I cannot <Col N="597" /> accept the amendment for that reason.  It would be unfair to tie the hands of the Minister, regardless of what party is in Government, in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  This amendment proposes that before approving a scheme under section 47 the Minister shall, within 18 months, either cause a public inquiry to be held, consider objections which have been made and not withdrawn or consider any report and recommendation of person conducting an inquiry.  I do not think it is unreasonable to require this to be done within 18 months.  I do not think it is at all unreasonable to require, after a scheme has been submitted to the Minister, that a public inquiry should be held within 18 months.  This does not require a final decision to be made on a scheme within 18 months; rather it proposes to give the public an opportunity to make their views known within 18 months.</P>
      <P>It is incorrect for the Minister of State to say that this amendment would unreasonably tie the Minister's hands.  I wish to point out &mdash; I do not say this to be disobliging to the Minister of State but rather because I believe it to be true &mdash; that if it is being pretended that a period of 18 months would tie the Minister's hands unduly then that is the very best reason for including this provision in the Bill.  If a period of 18 months is regarded as &ldquo;undue haste&rdquo; then there is a totally unwarranted laxity in the Minister's approach to this issue which we should deal with in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 107 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 108:</P>
      <P>In page 48, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where the Minister approves a scheme under this section, his approval shall be subject also to the approval of a majority of <Col N="598" /> the membership of the local authority concerned.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The proposal in this amendment has been discussed at some length both on Committee Stage and on Report Stage. It provides that the Minister's approval of a scheme shall also be subject to the approval of a majority of the membership of the local authority concerned in the scheme.  I know it is probably a vain hope to expect the Minister to accept this amendment, but if there is to be any degree of reality in terms of the role of local authorities in the physical planning and management of our landscape, and the facilities at our disposal, then some real effort should be made to involve them in making decisions of this kind.  If a project is worth while, and the Minister believes it should be properly approved, he should then be required to get the assent of a majority of the members of the local authority concerned.  That is the only way we can be sure there will be the necessary commitment, acceptance and understanding of the project at local level.  It may be inconvenient, it may impose a new burden on the Minister and on the Department but, in the interests of the reality of local government, it is worth doing.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a vain hope that the Minister would accept the amendment but I would point out to him that he represents a Government that has been talking for quite some time.  I should not say that the Government has been talking, the two parties involved have been talking for some time about the necessity and the desirability of local authority reform.  Every time a Bill with implications for the operations of local authorities is introduced we find that they are not being given any real role but the Minister is being given, either explicitly or residually, substantial powers to take decisions over their heads.  It is time to start reversing that process by this simple, straightforward and democratic provision.  It is not by any means the be-all and end-all of reform.  It is a measure in one very restricted area to give local <Col N="599" /> authorities real power and to have consultation with them and their members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if that is the section which needs to be amended to achieve the objective in mind.  However, the principle outlined by Deputy Dukes has been debated throughout this Bill from Second Stage.  It concerns the transfer from local authorities to the National Roads Authority of functions relating to the introduction of a motorway scheme, road schemes, the decision in relation to the line of roads design and so on.  In my capacity as a member of a local authority, of which Deputy Keogh is also a member, I have practical experience of this at present.  The question of the proposed line of the south eastern motorway is currently under consideration by the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area committee of Dublin County Council.  For some months we have been in discussion with local interests, including the many conflicting interests that inevitably arise in an issue of this kind; conflicting opinions have been expressed by different communities and interests and so on as to where the motorway line should go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities &mdash; it is fair to say that I am expressing the opinion of the vast majority of members &mdash; are happy and quite prepared to make the decision in relation to the line of the motorway and in relation to the scheme.  However, in view of the Bill we do not know where we stand.  We are in the process of talking to local communities about alternative routes for the motorway when legislation is going through this House that will transfer the function for making that decision from the local authority to the National Roads Authority.  We are at a loss in talking to people who have an interest in this issue and to the local authorities' own professional staff because by the time this Bill is enacted, and the <Col N="600" /> decision will have to be made, the body which will have the power to make it may be the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>This legislation, without the amendment proposed by Deputy Dukes and, indeed, the various attempts by other Members at various times in the course of this debate to achieve the same objective, will result in local authorities, and particularly their elected members, being no more than lobbyists making recommendations but not having any real power in the area.  It is taking a very important area of local democracy from elected members of local authorities and putting it in the hands of an appointed body.  This is a matter of great regret because no matter how difficult a decision may be it is much better to leave it in the hands of local authority members.  I attended a meeting in my constituency in Stepaside recently; it was a very healthy meeting with an exchange of views from different perspectives on the same issue. The general view coming across at that meeting in regard to the line of this motorway was that such decisions should be made by the elected members of local authorities.  The public should be confident that the people democratically and directly accountable to them will make the decisions and weigh their various aspects in the best interests of the public and the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment which relates to many points raised during the course of the debate on Report Stage and earlier Stages regarding accountability and democracy.  In relation to Deputy Gilmore's example of the motorway, local authority members are not mere lobbyists, to a certain extent they could be called consultants because that will be their role unless they have an input to the decision-making process.  I do not know what answers the Minister would give my constituents who are genuinely concerned about the line of the motorway.  They have gone to great lengths and expense, held public meetings, included many people in the area in the decision-making process and proposed an alternative siting for the motorway. <Col N="601" /> That decision-making process may be lost unless we decide that local authorities have some role in relation to the roads authority.  Throughout this debate I have argued, as a member of a local authority, that I am being left out, cast aside and ignored, which I do not like. Instead of being consultants, which may sound very well, I would like the local authorities to be part of a decision-making process.  However, we have argued about the membership of a roads Authority and said that they should have an objective view in regard to decisions, but local authority members should have a greater input than mere consultation. It should involve, as stated in this amendment, the approval of a simple majority, which would not be a material contravention. The amendment has not gone that far.  The local authority members have a great fear of being excluded and I would like the Minister to consider this amendment in the spirit of local democracy being included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> By the time the Minister approves the scheme under section 49, a lengthy process will have been gone through.  The scheme will have been introduced by the local authority and the general public will have been notified through the newspapers; landowners will have been notified individually. A local public inquiry will have been held into all the issues involved.  In all cases involving motorways an environmental impact statement will have been prepared and the impact of the proposed project on the environment will have been assessed.  If local authority members had a veto at this stage it would necessitate starting off the process again or abandoning the project completely.  As I have made clear during the debate on previous amendments, while I am prepared to give local authorities a substantial say on national roads development, I am not prepared to give them a veto.  For this reason we cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the debate, in order to allay fears that were expressed that the National Roads Authority would ride roughshod over local authorities, particularly <Col N="602" /> in regard to the alignment of a proposed road, I introduced an amendment to section 22 which will allow the elected members of a local authority to make representations to the National Roads Authority where they object to a proposed road alignment.  The National Roads Authority will be obliged to consider representations and if, having responded to the local authority the latter is still aggrieved, it can make written representations to the Minister.  I would not accept Deputy Keogh's statement that the local authorities are being ignored completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am not a member of a local authority I can speak with some objectivity on this.  I do not think, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that members of local authorities will be thrilled or delighted or over the moon at the idea that because of the amendment to section 22 they will be able to make representations to the National Roads Authority about these issues.  The Minister is right to point out that by the time we get to the procedure set out in section 52 of the Bill, a whole range of things will have been gone through &mdash;&ldquo;a lengthy process&rdquo;, as the Minister says &mdash; a public inquiry, an environmental impact statement and so on.  I would just invite the Minister to reflect on what involvement the local authorities will have had all through that.  The answer is that they will have been given the inestimable privilege under the provisions of section 22 to make representations about the alignment of the proposed project.  That is the limit of their involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, section 52 is the one that allows the local authorities to go ahead and compulsorily acquire land.  This section is the trigger.  Up to now the weapon has been armed, it has been cocked; but this section is the trigger that sets the whole procedure off.  That is why &mdash; I say this to Deputy Gilmore &mdash; the amendment has been put in here rather than anywhere else, especially since the level of involvement by the local authorities up to then has been, as so generously <Col N="603" /> described by the Minister, the ability to make representations about the alignment of the proposed scheme.  If one reads the rest of this section one finds that this is the section where all these things come together and begin to happen.  At this stage we have had the environment impact statement, we have had the public inquiry, we have had the report of the inspector appointed by the Minister and we have had the decision of the Minister on the inquiry.  A Minister who has been busy making all the orders and taking all these things into account now finally lays the egg.  All I am asking at this stage is that the local authority, which has not really been involved in any determining sense up to then, would at this point, when all the pieces are being put together, be allowed to have an input into it.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister should come in here and say that he does not want to give the local authorities a veto at this point.  It is another expression of the old, excessively bureaucratic defensiveness which says that if we give these people any possibility of participation in this they will muck up a grand scheme that the Department and the Minister have put together between them.  If the Minister has done his job properly he will be able to so blind them with eloquence and wisdom that they will have no hesitation in saying that they agree with him, that they agree with the Minister's view of the environmental impact statement, that they agree with the Minister's recommendations as to the alignment, that they agree with all the Minister's inspector has said to him about his view of the representations made to him by the local authority itself, among other things, and the view that he has taken of all the cases that have been put during the course of the local inquiry as a necessity for the compulsory acquisition of the lands that are there.  Why should the Minister assume that if he allows these jumped-up little Johnnies who are members of local authorities any function in the matter they are going to screw the whole thing up on him &mdash; pardon my language, Sir. <Col N="604" /> That is really excessively defensive and it shows very little confidence on the part of a Minister who is now equipped with a huge panoply of all kinds of powers to come along and convince the simple members of the local authority that it is a good idea.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 109:</P>
      <P>In page 50, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The responsibilities, including the responsibilities to maintain roads and to take out adequate policies of insurance in relation thereto, which would normally attach to the relevant local authority, shall, for the duration of any works under this section, attach to the contractor (if any) involved.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make clear the responsibilities for the insurance for the duration of any works. In this regard I am not sure whether the Minister is able to impart to the House any more wisdom than was given on Committee Stage, but it should be made clear that while any works are being carried out the responsibility that would normally <Col N="607" /> rest on the local authority once the works had been completed would lie with the contractor.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i> This section relates exclusively to works on motorways, busways and protected roads.  It is the practice and the intention that public utilities do not interfere with these high capacity roads at all if it can be avoided. Any services provided by them will usually be laid down away from the roads in question or at the side of these roads, where they can be accessed without interfering with traffic.  The provisions in this section relate only to cases where it is absolutely necessary to interfere with a motorway, protected road or busway to carry out works on pipes, cables and so on.</P>
      <P>On the specific point of responsibility and liability during road works, it has always been the case that if damage or injury is caused through negligence during such works, the body carrying out the works is liable.  Telecom Éireann, Bord Gáis and the ESB, for instance, are all responsible for the work carried out by them on public roads.  The position on reinstatement can vary from local authority to local authority.  Some road authorities may themselves carry out the reinstatement on behalf of the public utility on payment of a fee.  Alternatively, the statutory undertaker may carry out the work itself and arrangements are made for the transfer of responsibility to the local authority once it is satisfied that the reinstatement has been satisfactorily carried out.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I note, with a little regret, that the latter part of the Minister's comment demonstrated how desirable it would have been for him to accept amendment No. 76, which dealt with the carrying out of various works of interference with the roads and with the reinstatement of the roads.  In time to come the Minister may very well, in the quiteness of his own soul on some dark night, wish that he had accepted amendment <Col N="608" /> No. 76.  Having made that point, I find the rest of the Minister's explanation satisfactory and I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 109.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 110:</P>
      <P>In page 52, to delete lines 11 and 12, and substitute &ldquo;in the case of National Regional and local roads the elected members of the local authority in whose administrating area, the road is located;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is probably one of the most critical amendments.  Amendment No. 110 and the group of amendments related to it, all of which are being discussed, relate to the provisions for the tolling of roads.  Until now the power to make a decision to toll a road of any kind was vested in the elected members of a local authority.  Toll schemes have been made in several instances.  The East Link Bridge is a classic example, as is the West Link Bridge, that being a toll scheme that I myself, as a member of Dublin County Council, supported.  I am not opposed in principle to the concept of tolling.  I am opposed to the provision in this Bill that will for national roads remove from local authorities the power to make a tolling scheme and will give that power to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an immediate reason for expressing concern about this matter. Before the Bill was introduced, a backdoor, surreptitious attempt to toll the &ldquo;C&rdquo; ring around Dublin was made by one of the Minister's predecessors.  About two years ago an arrangement was made with an American company to make a toll scheme on the Western Parkway, <Col N="609" /> part of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; ring around Dublin.  The absurd position obtained wherein, with the authority of the Minister's predecessor, toll plinths were erected on the section of the motorway then being built at Clondalkin and those toll plinths subsequently had to be removed at the direction of Dublin County Council.  The total cost, between putting up the plinths and then taking them down, amounted to about £50,000.  That was an utter waste of public money in an attempt made by the Minister's predecessor to toll a road that was being built with public money. Having failed to introduce that measure through the backdoor, it would appear that the Government is now attempting to achieve the tolling of that road by way of making a provision in this Bill that will shift the power for the making of a toll scheme from the local authority to the National Roads Authority.  The &ldquo;C&rdquo; ring around Dublin is presently under construction. As I said earlier, the Northern Cross, the Southern Cross and the South-Eastern motorway are completed.</P>
    <P>I want a specific statement from the Minister on whether it is still his intention and that of his Department to toll that road. Of course, the effect of tolling that road would defeat its whole purpose, which was to take heavy concentrations of traffic out of residential areas.  If it is tolled the Minister would end up with the kind of problem at present obtaining in areas such as Ringsend where traffic trying to avoid the toll on the East Link Bridge winds its way through residential areas.  The Minister might well end up with the same position if he were to toll the motorway now being constructed around Dublin.</P>
    <P>This amendment has been tabled against the background of an unsuccessful attempt by the Minister's predecessor to place toll booths and require motorists using the motorway now being built around Dublin to pay a toll &mdash; toll plinths were erected and subsequently demolished.  The local authority concerned has already made it clear that it does not intend to impose a toll scheme for that motorway for a whole variety or reasons.  But the views of the local <Col N="610" /> authority will be neither here nor there if this section is passed unamended.  It will take from elected members of local authorities the power to impose a toll and place it in the hands of the people appointed by the Minister to be members of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with the sentiments just expressed by Deputy Gilmore.  I am sure he will not be annoyed with me when I say I find his amendment technically somewhat deficient.  Since it is obviously based on the circumstances of someone dealing with a potential toll project within the area of one local authority only.  I contend there are cases where we should go somewhat further than his amendment, because a project in question may well affect several local authorities or road authorities.  I do not believe that the National Roads Authority should be put in a position where it can take a decision to impose a toll without any reference to the local authorities through whose areas of competence and responsibility the proposed motorway is being built.</P>
      <P>If we learned anything from the limited experience we have of tolling and from examination of what happens in other countries, we should be very careful about approaching the idea of tolling roads here at all.  It should be remembered that the only two projects nationwide that because of their nature are properly subject to tolling are already subject to tolling &mdash; the East Link and West Link bridges.  In almost every other case where there are substantial works on stretches of new road or new bypasses, it is virtually impossible, because of the layout of this country and the density of other roads, to devise a practical and feasible proposition for tolling.  There are so many alternative options available within a high density of road networks that it is very difficult to toll most of our major roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might illustrate that more explicitly by saying that I would find it very difficult to envisage that one could successfully toll projects undertaken so far such as the Naas bypass, the Athlone bypass or <Col N="611" /> any of the other bypasses about to be built because we build them all in discrete sections.  On the other hand, had we ever reached the point, to give one example only, that we had built a motorway standard road from, say, Newlands Cross to Portlaoise, it would certainly have been worthwhile to have considered tolling that, because by building such a road one could reduce the numbers of access and exit points to a level that would render it a worthwhile proposition for tolling.  If one examines successful tolling projects in all of the places where they have been implemented one discovers they have been long distance roads where there are very substantial gaps between the access and exist points.  But the nature of this country being what it is, I do not think such circumstances prevail here.</P>
    <P>The reason I am worried about the provisions of this Bill and support the sense of Deputy Gilmore's amendment is that I believe the National Roads Authority may be tempted to examine the imposition of tolls for reasons that do not include a proper examination of these factors, that do not include a proper examination of either the spatial or traffic-flow factors that should be properly considered, but rather would be tempted to do this simply in order to raise revenue either for the construction of new sections of road or for the maintenance of sections of road already built.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the gentlemanly discussion we had a few moments ago about local authorities, I contend there is nothing in this Bill that makes a substantial case for removing a power from our local authorities and granting such power to this new supra local authority body in the way proposed there.  I contend that would constitute a totally inadequate and partial way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure I agreed in total with Deputy Gilmore's amendment. Since we have spoken so much about local democracy, fear has been expressed in relation to retrospective tolling of roads, something that should not <Col N="612" /> be allowed in any circumstance.  On the question of tolls, if there is a private input into the building of roads, bridges or whatever, like the East Link Bridge, obviously a case will be advanced for the tolling of such routes.  That is a reasonable way to fund such schemes.  But, as Deputy Dukes pointed out, the scope for such endeavours here is rather limited. We must take that into account.  The views of local authorities on tolling must be taken into account, particularly in regard to minor or shorter roads which do not lend themselves to tolling.  It comes back again to the whole issue of local democracy.  I wonder whether we have thought through sufficiently the whole aspect of tolling.  Perhaps we will have an M 99 running from Belfast to Cork which could be tolled.  Certainly, I would be delighted if I could reach Cork in one-and-a-half hours flat or whatever. There is a case to be made for a tolling system where there are alternative routes such as obtains in France; but we need to re-examine our circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a brief comment in relation to toll roads.  The East Link was the first toll road around Dublin and cost the taxpayer nothing.  It will be handed over to Dublin Corporation after, I think, 20 years when they will reap the benefit of the toll receipts.  The toll roads themselves provide extra access to new roads.  It is not as though they were substituting existing roads.  These are new roads created with private money which are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The West Link Bridge is a huge boon to people travelling north west from Tallaght, right from Firhouse through almost to Blanchardstown, and it will eventually continue to the Airport.  If one crosses the bridge en route to the aiport, which I do frequently, it costs 70p.  But if I want to travel to the airport through the city centre I can do so at any time without paying a charge.  Apparently when toll booths were erected at Clondalkin to cater for traffic travelling southwards and subsequently demolished, this was done without the consent of the relevant local authority.  I am also aware, as a member <Col N="613" /> of a local authority, that when it is proposed to build a major road objections raised by people living in a small area &mdash; indeed, local councillors can be intimidated &mdash; can delay the process and hold it to ransom.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in the Bill for appeals by a local authority to the Minister if it feels that charges are unfair or too high or should not be charged at all.  Having said this, I would welcome private investment in road building in order to relieve congestion on our roads and remove the burden on the taxpayer. While, ultimately, it is the motorist who will pay the toll I have yet to meet any driver who begrudges paying 70p to gain access to a road.  Certainly, the East Link Bridge, the Roche Bridge, has proved to be a boon for many people; it saves them much time and has led to a reduction in pollution levels on the little streets that surround it.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned that people try to avoid the East Link Road and that this has led to &ldquo;rat running&rdquo; in other areas.  This was a far greater problem before the East Link Bridge was built.  That is my experience of driving in the city and, as someone who drives 400 miles a week, I know what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> As I stated on Committee Stage, it is my intention to ensure that the National Roads Authority will be given the power to toll national roads, subject to ministerial approval.  I am introducing an amendment which will provide for a formal statutory consultation process with elected members of the relevant local authority, that is, the county council or the county borough corporation, before the National Roads Authority make a <Col N="614" /> toll scheme in respect of a national road. A draft of the toll scheme will be sent to the local authority, together with a formal notice giving it an opportunity to make written representations to the National Roads Authority.  The National Roads Authority will be obliged to consider any submissions made to it by the local authority.</P>
      <P>If the National Roads Authority decides to proceed with the toll scheme and submit it to the Minister for his approval and the local authority is still dissatisfied it can then submit its objections to the Minister under section 58 and have them considered at the ensuing public inquiry.  The Minister will be obliged to consider them before making the decision on the toll scheme.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Dublin Ring Road it will be up to the National Roads Authority to consider whether it should be tolled.  If it does decide to proceed it will be obliged under my amendment to consult with the local authority and the proposal will be subject to a public inquiry and ministerial approval.  The National Roads Authority will also be guided by any recommendations which the final report of the Dublin Transport Initiative may make in this area.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Dukes is also relevant, that the scope to toll roads is limited and any revenue obtained by the National Roads Authority will be ploughed back into this area.  Other factors, other than revenue, will have to be considered in deciding whether a road should be tolled.  The National Roads Authority will have to take into account whether it is likely that traffic will be diverted and consider the impact on local areas of traffic diversions and possible additional costs of improvements in these areas.  The use of tolls to manage traffic will also have to be considered in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply is not satisfactory.  He has said that local authorities will be consulted and will be able to write a letter to the National Roads Authority.  If not satisfied with the reply, it will be able to write another <Col N="615" /> letter to the Minister for the Environment to see if he will change his mind. This is no substitute for the power, which local authorities have at present, to make the decision in the first place.  The Minister of State knows this very well.</P>
      <P>It is also quite clear from the Minister of State's reply that it is still his intention to toll the Dublin Ring Road.  This would be disastrous.  One already has to pay a toll at the West Link Bridge and it would be a disastrous decision if the remainder of the road, which is relatively short, were tolled.  This would lead to traffic pouring back into residential areas.  The road was designed to take traffic out of these areas.</P>
      <P>If we were not so close to the final moments of this debate I would push this amendment to a division.  When we have a division at 6.45 p.m. it will be worth remembering that Members will be dividing on a Bill which contains within it a provision which will allow the National Roads Authority to toll any national road, specifically the Dublin Ring Road. If in a few years' time we find that the Minister or the National Roads Authority intend to go ahead and toll the ring road we will refer back to the record of this House to see which parties and which Members went through each lobby.  We are now making the effective decision as to whether the Dublin Ring Road will be tolled eventually and whether the motorists of Dublin, in addition to paying a toll on the West Link, will have to pay a toll on the remainder of the road.</P>

    <P>This amendment, which deals with the same problem we have just been talking about, would restrict the roads to which the National Roads Authority could apply a toll.

I do not expect to see any case for a long time where we have a <Col N="617" /> seriously operational project which is funded by private investment but since the effect of this amendment is simply to restrict the scope of what the Minister has succeeded in maintaining in the Bill, I will not discuss it interminably and I will therefore withdraw it.</P>

We seek to make it quite clear that even though the National Roads Authority may impose tolls on national roads without democratic consultation or proper involvement, the intention of this amendment is to make sure that this could not happen in relation to regional or local roads.  It may be argued that this is not needed, that the National Roads Authority has no competence in this area. If that is what the Minister says to me, I am inclined to believe it, but I take leave to doubt whether he can honestly and convincingly say to me that the National Roads Authority will never ever think of doing it.  To avoid doubt I would like to hear what he has to say about the potential scope of this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> While it is envisaged that most potential toll schemes would apply to national roads this might not always be the case.  For example, a local road in an urban area may well carry heavier traffic than a national primary road running through a rural area.  If a restriction of this kind had been contained in the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, it would have <Col N="618" /> precluded the construction of the successful East Link bridge, which is not on a national road.  Local authorities or private investors from time to time may identify gaps in the network or other suitable opportunities which would not be fully funded, if at all, from the public purse.  In my view the local authorities should have the discretion to pursue the possibility of funding those developments through tolls either on their own or in partnership with private investors or operators.</P>

      <P>5. &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>&mdash;recognising the strategic importance of Aer Lingus for the Irish economy, its role as a provider of substantial employment and the necessity for a viable national airline,</P>
      <P>&mdash;concerned at the implications of the recent senior appointments and resignations in the company and at the Government's continued failure to announce a coherent air transport policy and to provide Aer Lingus with the equity capital which it needs,</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to</P>
      <P>(1) immediately publish its air transport policy,</P>
      <P>(2) provide Aer Lingus with adequate equity capital to enable it to develop as a viable national airline, and to state without further delay the amount and form of the equity, and</P>
      <P>(3) reject the privatisation of any part of the Aer Lingus group.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the third time within the past six months that this House has had a major debate on Aer Lingus.  That is a reflection of the central importance of the national airline to our economy, and of our concern for the 7,600 Aer Lingus jobs based in Ireland and the 13,600 worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a repeated debate is also a product of the Government's continuing failure to provide the equity which Aer Lingus needs, the Government's reluctance to state in clear terms its air transport <Col N="623" /> policy and to dispel the continuing indications that Aer Lingus, or at least a significant portion of the group is to be privatised.  These are not new issues, on which an unreasonable Opposition is seeking to extract a premature decision from Government.  Aer Lingus has been seeking State equity since 1991.  We are now on the eve of the 1993 Easter Dáil recess, and there is still no announced decision about the amount or the form of that equity.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government declares that the commercial future of our national airline will be ensured &ldquo;as part of our overall air transport policy&rdquo;, but we are still in the dark as to what that air transport policy is.  There have been declarations from some on the Government side that Aer Lingus will remain in public ownership and that the jobs will be protected, but all the recent indications are that the pieces are being put in place for massive job shedding and, ultimately, for privatisation.</P>
    <P>Despite all the talk about Aer Lingus, the uncertainty is continuing, hanging over the talented and committed workforce and gnawing at the company's confidence and performance.  If all the promises and declarations of intent which have been made about Aer Lingus could be converted into cash, the company's problems would be well solved.  But promises and declarations are all that the Aer Lingus workers have been hearing for the past six months.  There was no shortage of promises, very specific promises, during the general election.  These promises have yet to be fulfilled.  In the Dáil on 12 March the Minister declared, &ldquo;decision time is now&rdquo;.  Over three weeks later, we are still waiting for him, and his Government, to make, or at least announce their decision.  Last Saturday, in Waterford, the Tánaiste, and author of the most specific election promise, declared, &ldquo;Aer Lingus will not be abandoned by the Labour Party or by this Government&rdquo;.  The following day, the General President of SIPTU, Mr. Bill Attley, wisely took the precaution of warning that the handling of the Aer <Col N="624" /> Lingus issue would be the litmus test for this Government.  Here tonight, when we hear the Minister's reply to this motion, and tomorrow night when the House decides the fate of this motion, we will see what the litmus test indicates.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity since the general election for this House to vote on the Aer Lingus issue.  It is the opportunity for each party, and for each TD, to convert their election promises and their declarations of intent into a firm decision by Dáil Éireann.  It is a final opportunity, before the Easter recess, for the Minister to clarify and quantify the rather vague commitments which he has made to date.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about providing adequate equity for Aer Lingus, about promoting an air transport policy which is in Ireland's interest and about retaining Aer Lingus in public ownership, then they will have no difficulty in accepting this motion and in spelling out the detail of their intentions for the company.  I invite the Minister to accept this Democratic Left motion and in doing so, to provide the staff of Aer Lingus with the re-assurance and confidence which they desperately crave.  If, however, the Government do not accept this motion, then it will expose the shallow and cynical nature of the promises which have been made to date, and when it is put to the vote tomorrow night it will give every party, and every TD, the opportunity of declaring with their vote their commitment to Aer Lingus.  The litmus test is underway and by tomorrow night, we will all know whether Aer Lingus is to be supported or to be let down.</P>
    <P>The conflict between promise and practice over Aer Lingus, is not just a political matter.  It impacts very directly on the operation and future of the company. To date, the debate over Aer Lingus has featured much political promise and declaration.  Not only has this not been matched by decision, policy and money, but it is being denied by what is taking place in practice.</P>
    <P>Three inter-related responses are needed from the Government to address this crisis in Aer Lingus.  First, the provision <Col N="625" /> of sufficient equity to guarantee the commercial future of the company. Second, a coherent aviation policy to address the position of our national airline in the deregulated and so called liberated environment of today's air transport industry and to address the EC's policy on air transport.  Third, the maintenance of Aer Lingus, and its associated companies, in public ownership to ensure the security of the national airline and the jobs which it provides. On each of these requirements, all the indications are that while in public the Government is saying one thing, in private, and in practice, it is doing the opposite.</P>
    <P>Let us first take the question of equity. The case for Aer Lingus has been argued repeatedly in this House, and superficially at least, appears to have been accepted in principle.  But where is it; how much and in what form?</P>
    <P>On 12 March the Minister spoke about the need for a spirit of partnership in tackling the company's problems.  Unfortunately, since then, the Government has behaved more as a spirit or phantom than as a partner.  Mr. Bernie Cahill has been directed to produce a rescue plan and he, in turn, has told the trade unions that such a plan must be produced within a matter of weeks.  The only policy given him, is not, to violate the sanctity of the politically sensitive Shannon stopover.  In effect he has been told to do anything he likes provided it does not upset the political equilibrium in the mid-west. When he eventually produces his plan, we are told that the Government will give it as yet unspecified backing.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of approach one expects from a partner, particularly when, as in this case, the partner is the sole shareholder, is the body responsible for determining overall aviation policy for the country and the body responsible for the handling of the set of EC relationships which impact on the whole issue.</P>
    <P>How are the unions and Mr. Cahill to devise a plan, when they do not know the extent or form of the Government's financial backing?  It is not possible for any union/management talks on the company's <Col N="626" /> future to be meaningful unless they know how much equity will be available and what is the Government's perspective on the future of the airline and the industry.  All of the items on the union/management agenda, including pay, conditions and staffing levels, require a knowledge of how much money will be available.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell the House tonight how much is available and in what form.  He should tell us if the Government have yet made a decision on the amount and form of equity.  If they have not made that decision, then what was the basis for the Tánaiste's assertion at the Labour Party Conference on Saturday night that he would never let Aer Lingus down?</P>
    <P>If the decision has been made, then to whom, if anybody, has it been communicated, and why are the staff and unions in the company being kept in the dark as they enter their negotiations?  It is hard to believe that Mr. Cahill who has been charged with producing the plan, and who apparently dictated his own terms for taking on the job, has not been taken into the Minister's confidence about the Government's specific intentions on equity.  If Mr. Cahill, at least knows, the ballpark figure for the amount to be made available and he is not disclosing that to the unions then the staff of the company are being invited to play blind man's bluff with their own jobs and futures.</P>
    <P>It is also hard to accept, especially in the light of the recent resignations and appointments at the company that the fundamental direction of policy on the company's future has not already been determined, and that it is pointing clearly to massive jobs losses, to the sale of parts of the group's non-core activities and, indeed, ultimately to privatisation.</P>
    <P>During the debate on 12 March, many Deputies, including the Minister, referred to the resignation of Mr. Cathal Mullen and to his life-long contribution to the company.  Reference was also made to the nature and choice of Mr. Cahill's appointment as executive chairman, especially in view of Deputy <Col N="627" /> Spring's previous comments about his role as chairman of Greencore.  On 12 March the Minister appeared to be rowing back somewhat on the dictatorial scope of Mr. Cahill's terms of reference, but any such apparent retreat has since been roundly reversed by the subsequent resignation of Mr. Kyrl Acton and his replacement by Mr. Peter Owen.</P>
    <P>Mr. Acton now joins Mr. Mullen as the second &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo; for the company's problem.  Mr. Acton resigned on Friday and Mr. Owen was appointed on the following Monday, which must be a record for the replacement of a top executive, even for an executive chairman who has earned himself a reputation for doing business at weekends.  The question which hardly needs to be asked is: was Mr. Owen head-hunted and lined up before Mr. Acton resigned and did it, indeed, lead ultimately to Mr. Acton's course of action?</P>
    <P>Mr. Owen's appointment is extraordinary. How can the Government convince us of their sincerity regarding the protection of jobs at Aer Lingus, or even its retention in State ownership, when the executive appointed to head up its operations is the man who led the assault on jobs and on the unions in British Airways and who prepared that company for privatisation?  If you are serious about the Aer Lingus jobs and about public ownership, you do not put somebody in charge who is a specialist in job shedding and union bashing.  Mr. Owen had a very stormy stay at British Airways and by all accounts a very stormy exit, in the wake of a week long strike over the dismissal of a cabin crew staff member which subsequently led to a successful libel suit by the worker involved.</P>

      <P>His contribution to the settlement of the industrial dispute to which I am referring was to attempt to require staff to sign the kind of &ldquo;back to work, no strike agreement&rdquo;, which has made the name of William Martin Murphy a by-word for bad industrial relations in this country for almost a century. It is probably no wonder the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4 April 1993, true to its pedigree, carried an article which was ecstatic about the appointment describing him as:</P>
      <P>A paratrooper in pinstripes,...the toughest boss that any group of trade unionists might have to face, with the reputation of a proverbial &ldquo;hatchetman&rdquo; ... It seems likely that the man head hunted by Bernie Cahill to bring the semi-State company out of its tailspin will lose no time in coming to a showdown with the unions.</P>
      <P>This Government's password is partnership, partnership with management and with the unions.  It is certainly a unique understanding of the concept of partnership which would lead any Government to ask trade unions to negotiate in the dark, and to simultaneously saddle them with a boss, whose hostility to trade unions and public ownership is legendary.  In the absence of any stated policy by the Government one can only draw the most disturbing conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's policy vacuum is not just confined to the formulation of a survival plan for Aer Lingus.  It includes also the unforgivable lack of any aviation policy at a time when the global air industry <Col N="629" /> is still undergoing a transformation resulting from deregulation and at a time when the EC is promoting an air transport policy which is antipathetic to the interests of our national airline.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>We attach a high priority to the future development of modern efficient transport links with Britain, Europe and further a field, and will suitably upgrade ports and airports. We will investigate the posssibility of further development which could use Shannon as a fast freight facility.  We will ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy.</P>
    <P>Who could argue with that?  But what or where is the &ldquo;overall air transport policy&rdquo; referred to in the Programme for Government?</P>
    <P>We all know that the problem of Aer Lingus can ultimately only be resolved in the context of an aviation policy for this country.  How in the context of the Single Market and European Union are we, the only air and sea dependent member state of the Community to get our goods and services on and off this island, especially as the Transport Commissioner is telling us that there will be no EC funding for mobile assets?  What is the place for Aer Lingus, a small national airline, in the deregulated world of modern aviation, where increasingly the control of routes, markets and even airports is being concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of powerful private airline companies? This is a situation which is now being called into question by reputable economists like Professor Kenneth Galbraith.</P>
    <P>These, of course are questions which should have been addressed long ago. Not only did successive Governments and Ministers fail to develop an air transport policy to take account of the rapidly changing air industry, but they have acted in a manner which was positively hostile to Aer Lingus and which has now given rise to the crisis in the company.</P>
    <P>When deregulation was the order of <Col N="630" /> the day throughout the air industry, and Aer Lingus needed the support of its Government shareholder, former Ministers for Tourism, Transport and Communications Deputies Séamus Brennan and Geoghegan-Quinn were ironically regulating the Irish industry in a way which was hostile to the national airline.  The crisis in Aer Lingus today is the fault not of individual managers who are being scapegoated, but of Government with its two airline policy and with the restrictions imposed on the company's airline operations.  Aer Lingus was told it could not fly to London Stansted, could not fly to Liverpool, could not fly to Munich, could not fly from Waterford, from Kerry or from Knock and had to stop at Shannon on all its transatlantic flights, whether the passengers wanted to or not.  At a time of deregulation and in the name of competition, Aer Lingus was fettered with anti-competitive regulations by successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>No other Government in Europe has behaved in such a discriminatory way against its own national airline.  While the rest of the EC was limbering up for the liberalisation of air transport in Europe, our Government was pursuing a &ldquo;leprechaun&rdquo; policy, encouraging the growth of five little airlines, all engaged in a little peripheral competition for the smallest share of the European air market and ending up with one of the best national airlines in the world being badly undermined. Even while Aer Lingus sought to fight back by, for example, seeking to develop fifth freedom services, it was being betrayed by the fifth column activities of the Minister responsible whose policies were furthering the interests of a privately owned rival.</P>
    <P>When Aer Lingus complained, or sent out a message that all this would lead to trouble ahead, they were silenced.  When the board of Aer Lingus complained about the preferential treatment being given to Ryanair, they were threatened with dismissal by the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan. When, in 1991, Aer Lingus looked for financial assistance, they were given a <Col N="631" /> gagging order by the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on the grounds that they might say something politically incorrect about Shannon. When the 1991-92 annual report of Aer Lingus, published in July 1992, told the public what the Government already knew, that there was an urgent need for equity, they were first hammered by a threat from the Taoiseach that 49 per cent of the company should be sold to a foreign airline and then three days later, the board of the company was subjected to a patronising lecture by the Minister whose policies had helped cause the problem in the first place.  That was last October, when the first tranche of equity should have been put into Aer Lingus. Six months and a change of Government later, not a penny has been invested by the Government in Aer Lingus and there is still no sign of the air transport policy.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, being put about that it is all under control, that Mr. Cahill will in due course produce his plan, that the Government will honour the promise and that it will be happy ever after at Collinstown.</P>
    <P>The provision of equity for this ailing company is long overdue and each day's delay is adding to the company's debt servicing and debt repayment problems.</P>
    <P>We are being told that not only will the EC not provide assistance for Aer Lingus, but that it will set the terms under which the Irish Government may do so. The Transport Commissioner came here last week and announced that there would be no money for mobile assets. Has our Government not yet convinced our EC partners and the Commission of the simple truth, that the only way of getting on or off this island is by plane or by boat and that if our goods and passengers are ever to get onto the modern, EC subsidised motorways, fast trains and chunnels which integrate the rest of the Community, there must be investment in ships and planes?  The Kinnegad bypass will not do a great deal to combat our peripheral and regional disadvantage if we do not have a reliable <Col N="632" /> air and sea transport service to get us on and off the island.</P>
    <P>Are we now wedged between an EC policy on funding which limits our ability to assist Aer Lingus and an EC air transport policy which is contributing to the problem in the first place?  Where do we stand on the EC's air liberalisation policy?  Does our Government slavishly accept this EC policy which is weighted in favour of mega carriers and which will operate to the disadvantage of our national airline?  This is a policy matter which must be answered if, irrespective of whatever financial assistance is eventually provided, Aer Lingus is to survive into the next century.  The Minister has an opportunity tonight to answer those policy questions and to tell this House once and for all how much equity is to be given to Aer Lingus, when it will be given, and what is this Government's air transport policy.</P>

      <P>Three Members of this House have held ministerial responsibility for Aer Lingus over the past 18 months.  Deputies Brennan, Geoghegan-Quinn, and the current Minister, Deputy Cowen, have all been made well aware of the difficulties facing Aer Lingus and the acute need for an injection of equity.  Each of them has dallied and equivocated.  Their failure to make the decisions required have simply allowed the scale of the problem to increase month by month and there can be no doubt that the company is now facing the greatest crisis in the more than 50 years of its existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four weeks ago tonight, Minister Cowen announced the forced resignation <Col N="633" /> of the chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Cathal Mullan, and the extraordinary appointment of Mr. Bernie Cahill as executive chairman.  It was understood that Mr. Cahill, as a matter of extreme urgency, would produce a recovery plan, that it would be submitted to the Government within a matter of weeks and that a rapid response would be forthcoming from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Four weeks on, the only apparent developments of any significance have been the resignation of another senior executive, Mr. Kyrl Acton, and the appointment of the former director of operations with British Airways, Mr. Peter Owen, as chief executive of passenger services.  This appointment and the manner in which it was made has simply added to the sense of apprehension among Aer Lingus staff and the public about the future of the airline.  The two personnel now in the Aer Lingus cockpit and with their hands on the flight controls are Mr. Cahill who prepared the Irish Sugar Company for privatisation and Mr. Owen, who held a crucial position in British Airways at a time when it was being prepared for privatisation with the loss of 17,500 jobs.  Is it any wonder, in the light of these appointments, that Aer Lingus workers are so secptical about assurances that the airline will not be privatised?</P>
    <P>There must also be concern about the manner of Mr. Owen's appointment.  The position was not advertised and the appointment was apparently made personally by Mr. Cahill without any reference to the board.  It also appears that Mr. Owen's position will not be full time, that he will continue to pursue his interests in the private sector simultaneously with occupying such a pivotal position in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>There is also a belief among many Aer Lingus workers that Mr. Cahill's proposals were withheld until the Labour Party conference was over, and that they are likely to be submitted to the Government over the next two-and-a-half weeks when the Dáil is not in session.  It is important, therefore, before the Dáil breaks for the Easter recess that the <Col N="634" /> House should speak with one voice in rejecting any proposal to privatise any part of the Aer Lingus group and in calling on the Government to provide the equity needed to re-establish the company on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>Unlike the case with Digital or many of the other multinationals who have pulled out of Ireland or substantially reduced employment levels in recent years, the crucial decisions about the future of Aer Lingus will not be made in some far off boardroom in Boston or in Bonn, but around the Cabinet table in Merrion Street.  The future of the Aer Lingus workers depends, not on some shareholders who could not be expected to have a commitment to this country, but on the members of our own Government. The two parties in Government must now live up to the commitments given to the public and to Aer Lingus workers during the course of the election campaign.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that despite the difficulties it now faces, the record of Aer Lingus over more than five decades has been one of achievement and success.  It has grown from modest beginnings to a position where it now has more than 14,000 employees &mdash; more than major private enterprise companies like Smurfit and Cement Roadstone.</P>
    <P>It played a crucial role in the development of Irish tourism, in 1991-92 bringing more than one million visitors to Ireland. Two-thirds of all air passengers in and out of Ireland are carried by the company.  It serves 45 routes in more than 11 countries and services eight regional airports within this country.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Aer Lingus, or the impact of a substantially scaled down level of operation, would reverberate throughout the Irish economy.  It would be a far worse scenario than Digital. Apart from direct job losses, there would be countless casualties in supplier companies. At a time when unemployment remains hovering in or around the 300,000 level, the consequences of not providing Aer Lingus with the financial support it needs are too awful to contemplate.</P>
    <P>While the problems faced by Aer <Col N="635" /> Lingus are extremely serious, they are by no means unique.  The same factors which have plunged Aer Lingus into crisis have shot down many other airlines.  One of the giants of international air transport, Pan AM is dead and gone.  The combined losses among all airlines worldwide over the past three years is estimated to be in the region of $10 billion.  The three big US carriers, Delta, American and United all had losses in 1992 ranging from $475 million ot $565 million.  Our own GPA, the jewel in the crown of Irish private enterprise, is fighting for survival.</P>
    <P>There is a number of myths about Aer Lingus which needs to be demolished. One, popularised by right wing economists and hostile politicians, is that Aer Lingus was the recipient of huge amounts of taxpayers' money.  Minister Cowen was recently quoted as saying that &ldquo;there will be no blank cheques&rdquo; for Aer Lingus.  The reality is that there were few cheques &mdash; blank or otherwise.  Total investment from the shareholder in more than 50 years has been around £73 million and no money of any sort has been forthcoming since the mid-eighties.</P>
    <P>In many respects Aer Lingus management have been operating in a &ldquo;no-win&rdquo; situation.  They are expected on the one hand to run an airline which will compete successfully with private companies, but on the other hand they are subjected to various Government-imposed restrictions.  Four weeks ago the Minister announced to the Dáil that he had given Mr. Cahill &ldquo;executive responsibility to take whatever action is necessary with immediate effect to restore the company to commercial viability&rdquo;.  However in the same paragraph he went on to say: &ldquo;I have also indicated that Aer Lingus is to maintain a significant presence on the transatlantic routes in the context of the existing policy on the Shannon stopover&rdquo;. When he came to address the Dáil on the following Friday, this had been firmed up to &ldquo;I have instructed the Chairman that Aer Lingus is to maintain a significant presence....&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the most unsavoury aspects of the Aer Lingus affair has been the way <Col N="636" /> in which those charged with political supervision of the company have evaded their responsibilities and attempted to blame management and workers for the current difficulties.  The management has been criticised for failing to make decisions, yet successive Government Ministers had the question of the Shannon stopover on their desks for years before the previous Minister Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, made her announcement on the matter last October.  The long indecision on the matter was most unhelpful to Aer Lingus at a time when its problems were mounting and, no matter what politicians think about the Shannon stopover, the company management sees it as a factor which is contributing to its difficulties.  Aer Lingus management says it needs access to Stanstead, but the Government says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, this privilege is to be retained for Ryanair.</P>
    <P>Clearly as chief executive, Mr. Cathal Mullan, has to take a share of the responsibility for the company's problems, but the attempts to make him a scapegoat have been particularly out-rageous. Unfortunately this dishonest approach does not appear to have been restricted to Fianna Fáil members of the Government.  In an article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 14 March Gerry Byrne wrote:</P>
    <P>He (Cathal Mullan) had watched the knives being sharpened over the previous weekend after Labour leader, Dick Spring, ordered a series of leaks to Dublin newsrooms.  Spring knew that his acquiesence at Cabinet level in a restructuring package for Aer Lingus which resulted in serious jobs losses and no large equity injection into the company could backfire on him. Labour had promised equity for the airline and the protection of jobs in its election campaign. </P>
    <P>He goes on at some length to outline what he believes to be the Labour Party leader's duplicitous position on Aer Lingus.  If these allegations are true &mdash; I have not seen any refutation of them &mdash; then they represent a totally unprincipled and dishonest attempt to mislead both the public and the Aer Lingus workers. <Col N="637" /> Such an approach could only have the effect of demoralising the workforce, and was presumably an attempt to soften up opinion, both inside and outside Aer Lingus, on the cutbacks which Mr. Cahill will propose.</P>
    <P>The Government clearly has no policy and no new ideas.  It has failed to produce any national aviation policy and seems content to leave it to Mr. Cahill.  It seems that what is happening, virtually by default, is that the company is being prepared for privatisation in full or in part, possibly to British Airways or to some other major player.  How else can one explain the appointment of Mr. Owen? What agreements, written or otherwise, exist between Mr. Cahill and Mr. Owen? What commitments has Mr. Cahill given to Mr. Owen?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why Mr. Owen would settle for his role in a relatively small peripheral airline, unless he sees it as subsequently being sold off to a larger airline with him on board.</P>
    <P>A strong national air carrier is essential for a variety of strategic economic reasons.  It is particularly necessary to protect our tourism industry.  Unless urgent action is taken by the Government it is hard to see Aer Lingus surviving other than as a small airline serving mainly regional needs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore has pointed out, if Aer Lingus is to survive as a national carrier a number of interrelated steps must be taken.  There has to be a substantial injection of Government equity. There is no point in pretending that Aer Lingus can survive without it.  It will be an expensive business, but the cost in economic terms of failing to save the company will be considerably greater. Unless there is a clear commitment to provide substantial equity we must presume that all that is on the Government's agenda is a plan to sell the company.</P>
    <P>Equity on its own will not guarantee the long term future of Aer Lingus.  As I said here on 12 March, we need to fight hard at European level for the development and operation of a European aviation policy which preserves diversity and ensures that peripheral regions retain <Col N="638" /> viable airlines which are so vital to their economic development and to the Community objective of economic and social cohesion.  There must be provision for national airlines like Aer Lingus to assist restructuring.</P>
    <P>We also have to accept that with current trends Aer Lingus will find it more and more difficult to compete with the giants of air transport if it stands alone. It needs to establish a relationship with other medium-sized European airlines to help reduce costs.  The trend is clear from the proposed merger of KLM, SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines which is planned for 1 January 1997.  All of these airlines are owned, in part at least, by their respective Governments.  Aer Lingus should, with the support of the Government, be considering either participating in this merger or at least some sort of link up with it.  Such a move would clearly require total support by the Government at European level.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am particularly disappointed with the amendment to our motion tabled by the Government.  I would have thought our motion would have been acceptable to the Government, certainly if the pledges of the Labour Party Ministers and TDs were to be taken seriously.  The Government amendment has nice things to say about the Aer Lingus workers, but kind words come cheap.  I am sure that the workers would prefer an assurance that Mr. Cahill and Mr. Owen are not going to be allowed to chop up the company and sell it off in little parcels.  The Government amendment has nothing new to offer.  If anything should set the alarm bells ringing among Aer Lingus workers and any Labour backbenchers with even an ounce of cop on, it should be the reference in the amendment to an unspecified amount of finance being made available &ldquo;subject to the constraints on the national finances&rdquo;.  This is clearly an attempt to provide an excuse to get both parties off their electoral hooks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, TD for Dublin North, I am keenly interested in and aware <Col N="639" /> of the vital importance of Aer Lingus for employment in my constituency.  I strongly support the terms of the Democratic Left motion.  Having spoken to the staff of Aer Lingus on many occasions, the most recent of which was last Friday afternoon, I know that the calls to Government for adequate equity, the publication of an air transport policy and a rejection of privatisation are critical.</P>
      <P>Last weekend the Labour Party promised to stand by Aer Lingus and inject significant equity into the company.  The word &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is significant in this respect.  Will equity for Aer Lingus be <i>pro rata</i> to that announced for GPA?  If it is, Aer Lingus is set to receive approximately £300 million.  Is employment in GPA any more valued than employment in Aer Lingus?  Of course not, because that would not be fair.  Therefore, can I assume that a minimum of £300 million will be given in equity to Aer Lingus?</P>
      <P>It is time for some honest explanations of the Government's precise intentions in regard to Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus has an obligation to its passengers and the Government has an obligation to Aer Lingus.  Part of the Government's obligation is the publication of a comprehensive transport policy and, in this case, a detailed air transport policy.  The lack of a comprehensive transport policy is costing our national airline business and revenue, as are the two Boeing 767 aircraft stranded at Dublin Airport in expectation of a policy which never was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind saying that Aer Lingus staff were apprehensive when they saw Mr. Cahill, Mr. Owen and Mr. Buckley joining the management staff of our national airline.  I wish to refer to the press release on Mr. Peter Owen's appointment as chief executive of passenger services, which defines his key task as being part of a &ldquo;robust senior management team&rdquo;.  The sentiments expressed remind me of the words used to describe a particularly rough county football team which I will not name as I still have friends living in the area.  Mr. Owen is quoted as saying that he is looking forward to working with the executive <Col N="640" /> chairman on this &ldquo;onerous task&rdquo;, this makes me wonder if the sense of co-operation which ought to exist between management and staff is to be sacrificed in the same way as it was in British Airways, Mr. Owen's old company.</P>
    <P>These are not just my opinions; these opinions are voiced and considered every day by the staff in every department of Aer Lingus.  In the normal course of events such uncertainty would demoralise a lesser company and the effects of this would be seen in a lower standard of customer service.  However, Aer Lingus has a priceless irreplaceable quality.  As ambassadors abroad Aer Lingus gives far more in value than it has ever received from this or previous Governments.  Privatisation would not only cost this country dearly because of the loss of a presence abroad, where so many Irish people live, but the cost of maintaining the staff who are made redundant makes no sense from an economic point of view. Coincidentally, a letter from an Aer Lingus passenger in today's <i>Irish Times</i> illustrates the need for the Government to stand by Aer Lingus, as proposed in the motion.  The passenger refers to a flight from Canada he was on, and I quote:</P>
    <P>While current economics of the airline business may have caused some business uncertainty, it has had no apparent effect on customer service, which is clearly the mark of quality employees, in a quality company, doing a quality job.</P>
    <P>With regard to the entire crew ... I'm sure the other 272 people on board as well as the other employees who wear the Aer Lingus uniform would be happy to join me in congratulating them for a job well done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledging the contribution which Aer Lingus and its staff have <Col N="641" /> made to the Irish economy since the company's establishment, particularly in the development of Ireland's trade and tourism;</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to ensure the commercial future of Aer Lingus as part of overall air transport policy,</P>
    <P>endorses the Government's policy as being in the best interests of the Irish economy and supports the Government's decision to provide, subject to constraints on the national finances, sufficient support for Aer Lingus when a viable and convincing strategy for the future of the company has been put in place.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there is a widespread concern about the problems which must be addressed in Aer Lingus.  The national airline has always enjoyed a high profile and it is, therefore, equally understandable that many voices should be raised in both expressing legitimate concern and suggesting solutions, or at least approaches to solutions to the company's problems.  At the end of the day, however, the political initiative and responsibility rests with me as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Given the national dimensions to the dilemma faced by Aer Lingus I will, of course, be sharing both my analysis of the problem and my proposed solutions with my colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>Since assuming responsibility for the company on my appointment as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications I believe that both the approach I have taken with the company and my public statements have been consistent at all times.  This consistency predates my appointment.  The basic policy line adopted by my party prior to the formation of the Government was set out very clearly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech at the launch of the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the general election last November said, &ldquo;We cannot and will not allow Aer Lingus to flounder&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach <Col N="642" /> at the same time went on to say that &ldquo;We must have a viable programme that we can back&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear at the outset that I am totally committed to implementing the policies of the national partnership Government in the transport field.  One of these commitments set out in the Programme for Government is, &ldquo;to ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy&rdquo;.  This commitment will be honoured in full.</P>
    <P>One myth that irks me as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is that Ireland has no aviation policy. Some people have tried to portray us as working in a policy vacuum.  That simply is not true.  We have now, and have had for some time, a consistent and coherent framework within which we have developed the Irish aviation sector, with considerable success.</P>
    <P>Let me start by placing on the record of this House what the objectives of this policy are.  I will do so under seven broad headings: (1) to improve competitiveness and thereby facilitate job and wealth creation in Ireland by providing a wide range of reliable and regular commercial air services for Irish tourism, trade and industry, at the lowest economic cost; (2) to promote direct job and wealth creation in the Irish airline and aviation industry through opening up new markets for Irish operators (e.g. Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, GPA) either in bilateral or multilateral negotiations; (3) to have at least one domestically based and financially viable national airline to ensure continuity of air services between Ireland and all our main export markets.  In effect, this means a strong Aer Lingus, not because it is Government-owned but because it is the one Irish airline which has the critical mass, expertise and best range of products to achieve this aim; (4) to ensure, in so far as possible, an equitable distribution of airline traffic to Shannon, Cork and the regional airports to support the Government's policy of promoting balanced regional growth within Ireland; (5) to ensure that all Irish airports are cost competitive and have infrastructure <Col N="643" /> of the highest international standards to meet the needs of the international airline industry; (6) to ensure the maximum utilisation of our national airspace asset; (7) to ensure that the standards, safety and security of aviation inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure by air carriers.</P>
    <P>These objectives have been formulated against the background of: (1) the international economic regulatory environment which has become more deregulated and liberalised; (2) Ireland's peripheral geographical location within Europe; and (3) national agreements with the social partners where the emphasis has been on expanding existing air services, introducing new services and ensuring access costs are competitive in the interest of both tourism and business travellers alike.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in the air transport industry worldwide has accelerated significantly in recent years.  Over the past decade the world air travel market grew by 7 per cent annually as a result of increased demand arising from higher incomes in industrialised countries, declining air fares in real terms, regulatory change that enhanced competition and Government policies to stimulate tourism.  This rate of growth was faster than the general growth in the world economy over the same period.</P>
    <P>While initially we lagged behind this upsurge in world activity, we have, since the mid-eighties, outperformed other countries in terms of wealth and employment creation, as a result of the very innovative policies implemented by Government.  I will give a few statistics to prove this: visitor numbers to Ireland rose to almost 3 million per annum in 1991, an increase of over 50 per cent on 1987; over 23,500 jobs have been created in tourism between 1987 and 1991; increased income generated in both the tourism and air transport sectors has amounted to over £500 million since 1987; travel by business travellers has increased by almost 50 per cent since 1985, which undoubtedly has helped our merchandise export drive and at least <Col N="644" /> 3,000 direct jobs have been created by all participants in the air transport and related industries since 1987.  Aggregate turnover today in the air transport sector in Ireland is now in excess of £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Airlines, internationally, including those serving or wishing to serve the Irish market, now have much greater commercial freedom in their operations and the consumer has greater choice.  Effectively, an open skies regime operates in Europe, though in a more balanced way than in the United States.  The policy of the United States administration is for an open skies regime internationally and it is seeking to renegotiate its bilateral agreements to this end.  It has already done so with some countries, notably Japan and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The trends of recent years have opened up new opportunities for Irish aviation. However, there are also costs involved for Irish airlines.  The aviation industry in Ireland is now broadly in the same position as any other traded goods sector. Irish operators now have to compete in the domestic and international markets both with other Irish and foreign competitors. Moreover, market conditions have changed from high cost/low volume to low cost/high volume.</P>
    <P>The situation today is that most traffic to/from Ireland originates from or is destined for Britain or continental Europe. Since 1 January 1993, there is almost complete liberalisation of air services between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe.  That is a fact of life which, whether we like it or not, we cannot change.</P>
    <P>Under current EC regulations any EC national can set up an airline in Ireland or elsewhere in the EC on meeting certain financial and safety criteria; any EC airline can fly on any route within the EC into any Irish or EC airport and without any restriction on frequency provided slots are available; Community carriers can now set their own fares, without Government control; safeguards have been put in place to eliminate unfair competition in the market, for example, abuse of a dominant position, excessively high fares or predatory pricing; the rights <Col N="645" /> to operate internal services (cabotage) in another member state, is being phased in over the four years to 1997 and EFTA countries, apart from Switzerland, will be given similar rights in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, on 12 March 1993, Deputy De Rossa said:</P>
    <P>As far as Democratic Left is concerned, a national aviation policy should be based on one Irish national airline, Aer Lingus.  There is no basis for more and any other policy will almost certainly lead to us having none at all.  With deregulation in Europe almost complete, anybody who argues that we need another Irish airline to provide competition either wishes to sabotage Aer Lingus or is out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's comments ignore the reality of the EC Single Market under which, as I have said, any European airline, be it Irish or not, can service the Irish market provided it meets certain conditions, I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Governments, including the Irish Government, no longer have the authority to regulate air transport in favour of their own carriers.  Governments cannot stop a carrier setting up services on any route it wishes or charging any fare it likes, provided it is not a predatory price from a dominant carrier.</P>
    <P>The role of Governments is no longer one of regulation or control but to ensure that competition in the market place operates in a fair and open manner.  I can, however, assure this House that I will be vigilant in ensuring that the competitive conditions in which Irish carriers operate are fair and equal to all.  I will vigorously pursue any abuse in the market and use my powers to have the EC Commission fully investigate any complaints.</P>
    <P>These Single Market conditions were not introduced overnight.  In Europe, the most significant initiative in the liberalisation of air transport came in 1984 when the EC Commission produced wide-ranging proposals for changes in the regulatory system.  These proposals covered areas such as air fares, capacity sharing <Col N="646" /> and market access to limit the effect of commercial and price agreements between airlines, with the long term objective of creating a common air transport market.</P>
    <P>Following these developments, the EC Council of Transport Ministers, under the Irish Presidency in 1984, adopted a set of guidelines for the first steps in the liberalisation of air transport in the EC. These guidelines resulted in the adoption in 1987 of the first set of measures to liberalise European air transport on a gradual scale and led finally to the introduction of a Single Market in Europe from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>Recognising that change was on the way, successive Irish Governments took a number of initiatives in the late 1980s to: (1) prepare the Irish industry for increased competition from foreign carriers; (2) seek out new opportunities for Irish airlines to expand in a more open and competitive system; (3) enable the industry to respond to growing demands for travel at lower cost, and (4) to create a more competitive environment reflecting world trends.</P>
    <P>I should say that all sectors of the industry, as well as trade unions, have been consulted on these developments. In 1988, Aer Lingus used the fifth freedom opportunities won for them by the Government in negotiations on EC liberalisation measures to route many services to Continental Europe via Manchester in an attempt to make Manchester a secondary hub for the airline. In addition, as a result of concessions won in EC and bilateral negotiations with EC partners, frequencies on existing Aer Lingus services to Britain and Continental Europe were greatly expanded over this period.  Over this period, also, Ryanair were licensed as a second Irish carrier to operate air services to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years we have been consistently seeking new markets and opportunities for Irish aviation.  These have not been confined simply to rights to operate air services.  We are also consistently seeking training, maintenance and leasing business for Aer Lingus.  In <Col N="647" /> addition we are also actively pursuing new business opportunities across the whole spectrum of Aer Rianta's activities.</P>
    <P>Let me give a specific example.  Last week I signed an air agreement with the Russian Federation and with the Republic of Belarus.  I used the occasion of my visits to Moscow and Minsk to identify new areas of business opportunities for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. The Minister for Transport of the Russian Federation and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus, accepted a proposal from me to establish high level official working groups with both countries to identify specific projects which can be undertaken to our mutual benefit.  I expect the first meetings of these groups to take place in Ireland within the next month.  These recent talks are but one example of our efforts to develop opportunities for Irish aviation. The Government will continue to support the commercial development of Irish aviation and aviation-related activities which can make a substantive contribution to increased employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The task force report on the aerospace industry in Ireland has already pointed the course for future development in this area.  This task force was established in June 1990 to investigate the future potential of the industry in Ireland, to identify new business opportunities and to draw up an action plan for the development of any such opportunities while removing obstacles to growth.  The task force was widely based with its membership selected from major firms in the core maintenance and repair segments, smaller manufacturing and software companies and the various State agencies dealing with the sector.  The task force reported in July 1992 and estimated that over 6,000 extra jobs could be created mainly through expansion of existing maintenance, overhaul and repair activities along with new spin-off projects from these.  The Government is pursuing the implementation of the report's recommendations <Col N="648" /> through the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>As I said in this House quite recently, and I reiterate it today, I believe that it is in Ireland's strategic interest to have Aer Lingus as a substantial airline to serve Irish trade, tourism and overall national needs.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in some quarters and promulgated in others that members of this Government individually or collectively are anti-Aer Lingus, that they are indifferent about the future prospects of the employees of the company.  Successive Fianna Fáil led Governments, since the establishment of Aer Lingus, have nurtured the company, firstly as the sole and later as the major national carrier and supported its expansion into ancillary areas outside the core activity. As the problems of this company are to be confronted I have placed on the record, as has my predecessor, our acknowledgement of the contributions of the staff of Aer Lingus and of the sacrifices they have made over the years. One of the Government's main concerns is its consideration of the financial difficulties facing Aer Lingus has always been to ensure the commercial future of the company.  This is the only way we can sustain long term employment in the company.</P>
    <P>The financial difficulties facing Aer Lingus are not insurmountable.  Nevertheless, they are very significant.  The core business, air transport, excluding once-off items, will show a loss of over £40 million for the financial year just ended.  That is the fourth consecutive year in which air transport, has made a loss.  In addition to the ongoing losses, the group currently has debt in excess of £500 million, with an annual interest bill of around £50 million.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus' ancillary activities have in the past been able to cross-subsidise the air transport operations.  However, these, too, have been hard hit by increased competition and the international economic recession.  Companies like TEAM Aer Lingus and Airmotive must operate in what is now an increasingly competitive international environment. <Col N="649" /> In addition, the hotels are pro-cyclical with the airline business.</P>
    <P>Any strategy for recovery must focus on the core business of Aer Lingus: in other words, the airline.  Because of our island status on the periphery of Europe, access transport in general and air transport in particular are crucially important. Aer Lingus is the predominant carrier serving Ireland.  It has made a significant contribution to the Irish economy in terms of employment, tourism development and in aviation related industries. There is no doubt that Aer Lingus has a sound national and international track record.  However, if this is to continue its present problems must be addressed.  Aer Lingus can maintain its primary position at the centre of Irish aviation.  To ensure this, the airline must be commercially viable and must operate to standards which are comparable with its competitors. Otherwise, it will not have a sustainable future.</P>
    <P>As I, and previous Ministers, have consistently pointed out, the primary responsibility for ensuring the commercial viability of Aer Lingus rests with the management and board of the company. The Government has asked them to ensure that, in keeping with the spirit of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> there should be the fullest possible consultation with staff before major policy proposals in relation to the future of the company are formulated.</P>
    <P>The Government's role, as shareholder, is to assess strategies adopted by the board.  This assessment, including a decision on the appropriate level of equity injection to which we are committed, must be in conformity with EC guidelines and also take account of the constraints on the public finances and our wider responsibilities to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Given that their main competitors have transformed, or are in the process of transforming their organisations into cost effective operations, it is imperative that Aer Lingus pursue the same strategy. Otherwise a permanent uncompetitive structure will remain and the airline will not survive in its present format.  The <Col N="650" /> future development of the company will be determined by its ability to compete in an increasingly competitive world.</P>
    <P>When appointing the executive chairman, I indicated to him that the Government wishes Aer Lingus to maintain a significant presence on the transatlantic routes and to do so in the context of the existing policy on the Shannon stopover.</P>
    <P>The Government has made it clear that, subject to the constraints on the national finances, it is prepared to provide sufficient support for Aer Lingus, provided a viable and convincing strategy for the future of the company has been put in place.  I will insist that this be done because, as I stated in the Seanad, I am not prepared to contemplate the elimination or disappearance of this company.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, any investment of equity by the Government in Aer Lingus must be approved by the EC Commission.  I have already had a meeting with Commissioner Van Miert in Brussels to discuss EC competition policy issues as they apply to State investment in Aer Lingus.  Commissioner Van Miert reconfirmed that any State aid could be considered by the Commission only in limited and exceptional circumstances and in the context of a comprehensive restructuring of the company.  It was also confirmed that any such investment could be made only on the firm and clear understanding that it would be for a necessary once-off restructuring by the company to ensure the early return of its airline business to full commercial viability.</P>
    <P>The original motion before us refers to the implications of the most recent senior appointments and resignations in the company.  I must point out that management appointments are a matter for the board of Aer Lingus.  I have no function in such appointments.</P>
    <P>In announcing the appointment of the executive chairman and in other statements since then, I have emphasised that a partnership approach is essential if Aer Lingus is to overcome its present difficulties. Everybody in the company must be prepared to shoulder their responsibilities. <Col N="651" /> The Government, too, will face up to its responsibilities as shareholder. In this connection, let me say that the degree of consensus and commitment emanating from discussions between the management and the unions will greatly influence the Government's attitude towards the degree of support it can provide for Aer Lingus.  There is a need for imagination and flexibility by all concerned. No options should be ruled out for consideration.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has always been assured that any proposals such as service contracts, joint venture agreements and marketing alliances would be carefully considered by the Government in the context of the recovery of the company to sustained viability.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, with the good will and determination of all the parties, Aer Lingus can overcome its current difficulties. The company must come forward with realistic proposals which will ensure it has a commercially viable long term future.  Aer Lingus employees want this.  The Irish people want this.  This Government will ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus did it before.  With the necessary commitment of all concerned, it can do it again.</P>
    <P>My giving a specific figure in the absence of a viability strategy being put in place simply would not be accepted by the European Commission, and Commissioner Van Miert made that very clear.  It was also made clear that any equity injection would be made in the context of such a viability proposal being put in place and its being evident that the proposal was sufficient for the making of a once-off equity injection that would ensure the commercial viability of the company.  The Government is committed to that position, but the viability proposal and the viability strategies must be put in place.</P>
    <P>Since the House last discussed the matter fora have been established, consultations are taking place and there is a management commitment to consult the unions and the representatives of the workforce at all stages before the formulation <Col N="652" /> of major policy proposals, so that everybody has a say in the future of the company and those who have a stake in the company have their say.  That is something that I, as a former Minister for Labour, would insist upon, quite apart from the fact that it is an obligation under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That obligation will be honoured.</P>
    <P>The time for putting the viability proposal in place is now.  The discussions are taking place and will continue to take place.  The company must be allowed to deliberate on those options and come forward with every possible positive, imaginative proposal to ensure that the maximum number of staff cosistent with the viability of Aer Lingus is kept working in that company.  That is what is wanted by everybody who has an interest in Aer Lingus &mdash; and I accept that everybody has a genuine interest in the future of the company, given its strategic importance to the Irish economy.  Steps cannot be taken in isolation.  We must be sure that the necessary viability proposal is put in place.</P>
    <P>The Government stands prepared to support Aer Lingus, subject to the constraints on the public finances which are there &mdash; and which are there for anybody, no matter what service is provided or what company it is wished to support.  I cannot give an indication any more clear than that, given that State aid can be directed only in the context of viability proposals being put in place and being agreed and the viability of the company being assured by the undertaking of the new proposals that will be agreed between the workforce and the management and approved by the board of Aer Lingus.  That is what we all want.</P>
    <P>The company should be allowed to get down to the business of coming forward with those proposals, and it is now doing so.  I am confident &mdash; not for one moment underestimating the difficult decisions that have to be taken for the future of the company &mdash; that, with a positive effort being made by everybody, an atmosphere has been created within the company that will ensure that everybody <Col N="653" /> will do whatever they can to come forward with the decisions necessary to ensure that the company has a future. That is my hope and I, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, await advice of these decisions.  I have asked that the decisions come forward as quickly as possible.  I do not believe that there should be any prevarications but I also understand that the magnitude of the problem is such that time spent in consultation with the workforce will be time well spent in the process of making the necessary proposals that will result in the company having a viable future.  Both parties in Government are committed to the viable future of Aer Lingus.  Once the Government has before it the necessary viability proposals it will be in a position, as shareholder, to assess prudently what is available on behalf of the shareholder as part of the Government's contribution towards the future development of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a major carrier in Ireland and it is of strategic importance. Decisions have to be taken.  There are no easy solutions.  I am glad that the decision-making process is now under way within the company.  There is full consultation at all levels of the company. When I last came to the House on this matter I was seeking full consultation. That has been achieved.  I now await the necessary viability proposals and I have great expectation that the company will provide imaginative solutions to the serious problems &mdash; which problem will not go away, however much we would like to wish it away.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has to operate in the environment in which all international airlines now have to operate.  The present economic circumstances make it very difficult for the aviation business generally. However, Aer Lingus can chart a future. I believe that the company has a future. The Government will stand with the company in providing whatever equity it can prudently provide in all circumstances, but the viability of the company must in the first instance be assured.  The process of ensuring the company's viability has begun, the consultation is ongoing and, <Col N="654" /> as I have said, I await the deliberations of the company so that I can advise the Government on the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a woeful amount of hypocrisy on the side of the Government parties in this debate.  The Government behaves as though the problems evident in Aer Lingus are none of the Government's making.  That is not the case.  The Minister and his Deputies quote the new mantra that airlines must compete in an open market in which the Government can no longer intervene. That seems to be the cover for the Government's standing back entirely from Aer Lingus.  There is apparently no Government recognition that it was the Government that insisted on pressing fares down below economic levels, which contributed to the present losses.  When Aer Lingus appeared before the Oireachtas joint committee the company made it clear that the Government's pursuit of tourism growth and the pressing down of fares was a major factor in the company's present losses.  Equally, it was the Government that insisted on the Shannon stopover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus has detailed in great numbers of submissions made to this House the effects that the stopover policy is having on the company's ability to make progress on the transatlantic route.  It is known that Aer Lingus has had to shelve plans for developing part of that route specifically because of the company's inability to service the Los Angeles route if a stopover is insisted upon.  Today and in the past month or so Aer Lingus has been told that it must continue to operate the Shannon stopover and must continue on the transatlantic route.  There is no Government recognition whatsoever that Aer Lingus is currently losing £20 million on the transatlantic routes and, if it is <Col N="655" /> to continue &mdash; as the Government indicates it is &mdash; it will have to find £400 millions in fleet replacement costs.  The Government is dwelling in unreality.  I see many Government Deputies, particularly from Fianna Fáil, pointing the finger at the management of Aer Lingus, saying what mistakes they have made. But the reality known by everyone in this House is that every investment decision on the part of Aer Lingus costing more than £5 million must be approved by Government.  That has been the convention in all of these State companies and was throughout the years when decisions were taken that many on that side of the House, particularly within Fianna Fáil now find consolation in criticising.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing now is the Government seeking to ignore the entire history of Aer Lingus and how its problem grew, sitting back smugly with its arms folded, proclaiming the new market economics era.  That is just not acceptable.  It is not acceptable to the workers in Aer Lingus and is not consistent with what was said to them before the general election by the two parties now comprising the Government.  It is not an acceptable approach to dealing with what is a major problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution this evening said he would deal with the fact that many people have criticised the lack of an aviation policy.  I searched high and low throughout the Minister's remarks to ascertain what were the new strategic directions of aviation policy that were to be adopted.  There was not one.  The Minister appears to mistake the stating of objectives with having a policy, probably the oldest mistake in the book on the part of Ministers here, who think that having a glossy list numbered one to seven of laudable objectives constitutes a policy. It just does not.  The Minister, having stated those objectives, happily ran to cover on the attitude: &ldquo;Do not blame me; I am only holding the reins to make sure that everyone out there behaves fairly&rdquo;. That is not acceptable.  The Minister has responsibility for critical strategic issues <Col N="656" /> without which the management and workers of Aer Lingus cannot hope to formulate a proper response to their present crisis.</P>
    <P>We have already heard about the issue of equity.  Obviously the Minister is not expected to name a figure before sitting down and talking it over with the unions and management.  But we have been told until we are blue in the face by this Government that this is a Government founded on partnership.  Aer Lingus workers rightly expect that the concept of partnership means that the Government provides the forum whereby the three parties involved &mdash; Government, management and workers &mdash; sit down, examine these issues and come up with a strategic response.  That is what they have asked.  That is what they were told would happen, by the Labour Party in particular. That is what is being spectacularly denied them and reiterated in the Minister's remarks today in which he sees his role as simply waiting until all the painful decisions are taken when he will decide in his wisdom whether some money might be made available.</P>
    <P>There are many other strategic issues that have a critical bearing on the decisions facing Aer Lingus workers.  For example, can support for mobile investment be secured?  Is that now gone?  Has the Government entirely sold the pass on that issue?  Can tourism growth continue in an environment in which henceforth the fare policy is to be maximised revenue? We have traditionally had a fares policy, promoted strongly by Government, that we should keep fares down to promote tourism.  We know that Aer Lingus is a short-haul carrier, has high seasonality on its routes and a very bad mix of passengers between tourists and the high revenue business client.  Apparently Aer Lingus will be forced by Government to shed its ancillaries, which seemed to be reiterated by the Minister today when he described these ancillaries as pro-cyclical, which I take as a code for saying they must be sold off.</P>
    <P>Can a short-haul carrier of this type survive as an national airline, which is the objective the Minister claims?  Can <Col N="657" /> that be done?  How can it be done?  These are the issues on which we expect answers.  We expect to hear from the Government what is the strategy for airport charges.  We expect to hear from the Government how in a deregulated environment a company like Aer Lingus can secure the joint ventures or the strategic link-ups that will allow it survive in a world that is being ever more dominated by mega carriers.  We want to hear from Government how it envisages those alliances being forged at a time when many airlines are in very deep difficulty, when there is no great outlook or queue of companies seeking to participate with Aer Lingus in the future.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says he has a policy of securing the commercial future of Aer Lingus we expect to hear from him how that can be done, not to hear that he is now handing that over to the workers and management of Aer Lingus, led by a chief executive who has an absolute open brief to do anything about disposal of assets, about fares and that the Minister has washed his hands of them.  That is why people feel frustrated.  Indeed, it rings very hollow to hear Labour Party Deputies go to their conference and bleat on about the problems, when they are in Government and sitting around the Cabinet table.  After all, they were the people who told us here, in a motion tabled in this House, that there should be no decisions taken on employment in Aer Lingus until a national aviation policy was laid before us so that we could study the strategic direction this industry was to take and how Aer Lingus, as a critical national airline, was to survive in that context.  It was the Labour Party who told us that that could be done in four weeks.  We are now at a juncture at which that must be done within a very short period.  But I have heard nothing from the Minister to indicate that that is being done.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I must repeat that partnership is a two-way street.  The Minister cannot expect the workers and management of Aer Lingus to sit down and solve these problems without knowing what will be the <Col N="658" /> Government input in so many critical areas.  The Minister and Government are expecting Aer Lingus to continue to provide a social service, such as the trans-atlantic route on which they are losing money, and the social service entailed in stopping at Shannon on which they are also losing money.  The Minister cannot then just step back and say &ldquo;You have to run the thing now.  It is now a free market. I have just to ensure that there is fair play between all of those out there competing in the field&rdquo;.  That is not sufficient and the workers in Aer Lingus will not accept it.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to hear the slightly threatening tone of the Minister's remarks on the level of consensus emerging from discussions between the unions and management.  The Minister and I know that the unions and management alone cannot resolve these issues.  Therefore, for the Minister to introduce that sort of veiled threat in the context in which he will play his part is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I am very disturbed.  This Government rejected a plan in which there were to be 850 man years lost through restructuring this company.  The inescapable conclusion is that this Government expects there to be substantially greater job losses.  I read what we have heard here today from the Government as an effort by the Government to pull back, hide behind the coat tails and dresses of the EC as the people telling us &ldquo;We cannot intervene.  Our hands are tied.  This will happen beyond our control&rdquo;.  That is not the position.  There are many issues that a Government can address.  The Minister should let us know what is his strategy and then sit down with the parties involved and work out a survival plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth successive occasion on which the Minister has had an opportunity to come into this House and reveal a little more of what is his strategy <i>vis-à-vis</i> Aer Lingus.  Once again he is hiding behind historic accounts of the company, various platitudes, statements of support, interest, the necessity for viable plans and so on. <Col N="659" /> Nothing in the Minister's remarks this evening will help the staff of Aer Lingus understand precisely where the Government is going.  The Government continues to leave the workers of Aer Lingus in the dark about its real intentions for the future of the company.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Richard Bruton has said, at the Labour Party Conference last weekend we heard Labour Party Deputies and delegates, such as Mr. Bill Attley, voice demands for equity for Aer Lingus.  To my mind that begs the question: why do they need to continue to make such demands?  Is it because their own Ministers have not managed to convince them that the Government is firm in its resolve to give equity to Aer Lingus?  For example, why do people like Deputy Seán Ryan have to continue to place a question mark after any statement they make about Aer Lingus such as: will the Government agree?  Will the Government say?  Will the Government commit and so on?  Surely Deputy Seán Ryan can approach his Fianna Fáil and Labour colleagues in Cabinet and obtain a firm commitment so that he will not have to continue to place question marks after such statements.  The Government knows that equity will be required.  A valid question put to me by the unions representing the workers was: why can they not say how much they are prepared to put into the company so that the viability plan can be based on knowing the proposed bald equity figure?  Is the Government hoping that the Bernie Cahill master plan will advocate harsh measures such as the loss of hundreds of jobs and the sale of the company's assets at a bad time and at prices below their true value?  The Government could then step back and say that the viability plan saves everything it wants to save in Aer Lingus and bow out in relation to any commitment to provide equity.  The Minister may be hoping that Mr. Cahill and Mr. Owen will be able to present him with such a plan so that the Government will not have to provide any equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the primary responsibility for ensuring the commercial <Col N="660" /> viability of Aer Lingus rests with the management and board of the company. If this is so, it begs the question why did the Minister not adopt any of the plans presented to him and to his predecessors by the board and management? The chairman is the same man who agreed to those plans and put them to the Government as viable plans for Aer Lingus and if it is its responsibility to make commercial decisions one wonders why the Government turned those plans down.  The reason is, as Deputy Bruton has said, that the Government feels there is a need to take harsher measures in Aer Lingus, such as further job losses in addition to the loss of more man-hours.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is so certain that the primary responsibility for ensuring the commercial viability of Aer Lingus rests with management why have both he and successive Fianna Fáil Ministers tied the hands of management?  Many of the problems confronting Aer Lingus can be attributed to what has been described to me as the &ldquo;dialogue of the deaf&rdquo; which Aer Lingus has had to participate in with the chief shareholder that is, the Government, for the past five years or so.  Successive Governments, led by Fianna Fáil Ministers, have been deaf to the demands of Aer Lingus.  While things were going reasonably well for Aer Lingus and it was making profits the Government did not have to listen to the warnings given by the management of Aer Lingus that if there was a downturn in the aviation industry, which they foresaw, and if it had to meet the cost of new aircraft the effects would be disastrous.  The international recession has impacted heavily on Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Party was in Opposition its members would be present in the House tonight calling for an air transport policy to be introduced.  They called for such a policy to be introduced before the last election but now it seems to have vanished like the snows in spring.  It has decided that one can work in a vacuum. In the absence of an air transport policy &mdash; not just seven pious platitudes &mdash; any decisions which the Minister will have to make on the Bernie Cahill master plan <Col N="661" /> will be made in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and may not take into account the long term interests of the company.  If the Minister does not know what air transport policy should be how will he be able to make a good balanced decision on any viability plan presented to him?</P>
    <P>For example, can the Government tell us if we will continue to have two Irish airlines?  The Minister has already told us that the primary responsibility for ensuring the commercial viability of Aer Lingus rests with the management of the company but the Government has been dictating some of the policies that Aer Lingus should follow, such as which airports it can fly into, which routes it can develop and then hand over to another airline.  These decisions are taken by the Government.  The management of Aer Lingus have told us that they have had their hands tied behind their backs when they have tried to do what successive Governments wanted them to do, which is to operate commercially, but they cannot do this if certain decisions are made for them.  That is what has been happening and that is what the Minister has done to Mr. Cahill.  He has said to him that Aer Lingus must continue operating transatlantic flights and it is not allowed to change policy on the Shannon stop-over.</P>
    <P>For how long does the Government intend to ignore the effects the Shannon stop-over policy has had in terms of the viability of the transatlantic route for Shannon Airport if he does not want to consider the question of allowing direct flights into Dublin and for how long will the Government continue to ignore the realistic question as to the reason Dublin and the east coast are not allowed their share of transatlantic passengers who wish to fly directly to our capital city?  For how long more does this divisive debate have to continue?  The Government has said that even if one aircraft is allowed to fly directly to Dublin, Shannon airport will collapse.  However, the Minister knows that this is not true but the Government has decided for political reasons not to grasp the nettle and to examine it.  Any viability plan which does <Col N="662" /> not consider this question is only a half plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the strongest advocates of the Shannon stop-over policy recognise that if there are no transatlantic flights there will be no need for such a policy.  I ask the Minister and the House does it not indicate a lack of confidence in Aer Lingus and in the Shannon stop-over policy that in recent times both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn &mdash; who flew out to Boston on a Saturday &mdash; did not fly to America on scheduled transatlantic flights via Shannon?  Can one imagine the message that was given? I am not making the argument that we should not have a Government jet but rather suggesting that both the Minister and the Taoiseach could have taken an Aer Lingus flight to America via Shannon. Can one imagine the confidence that would have been given if a photograph had appeared in the newspapers of the Taoiseach standing beside the Aer Lingus Jumbo before leaving on a scheduled flight?  However, he did not do this and I have to suggest that there is a big question mark hanging over the Taoiseach's respect for the Shannon stop-over policy.  As we are aware, shortly after he became Taoiseach he said in an interview in the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> that this policy would be phased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am questioning the Government's commitment to the continuation of trans-atlantic flights as I do not believe that such a commitment exists.  Any viability plan devised for the national airline would have to encompass a comprehensive examination of all aspects &mdash; one cannot dine <i>à la carte</i> while preparing a viability plan for the company.  As I said, everything will have to be examined: Government action <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ryanair, the Shannon stop-over, the retention or sale of hotels and other ancillary activities of the airline.  We cannot tie Mr. Cahill's hands but this is what the Government has done.  The Minister <Col N="663" /> stated that no options should be ruled out for consideration.  That is an all-encompassing statement.  Do the Labour Party Ministers agree with it?</P>

I call on the Government again to go beyond the pious platitudes expressed by the Minister in his last three contributions and again tonight and to come clean and outline the real proposals and policies to ensure the future of our national airline and the jobs of its many thousands of workers.</P>

So far as I am concerned, Shannon Airport is a major asset to the mid-west region and the west coast.  The low number of Aer Lingus trans-Atlantic flights that fly into Shannon Airport make it viable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I raised this matter during the debate on the Social Welfare Bills in 1991 and 1992 and the Minister told me in 1991, in particular, that he had every sympathy for the case I made.  I hope that sympathy bears fruit tonight and that his promise will be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The very survival of the self-employed, especially tradesmen like carpenters and painters, with a wife and family, is called into question by the way the Department of Social Welfare treat them.  These are ordinary workers, not like those on £100,000 a year who can stack away savings and draw from them the following year.  These ordinary people go out to work every day and try to earn sufficient income to keep their families.  When work dries up they apply for unemployment assistance and they are then assessed by the social welfare officers. Out of date rules are applied which do not deal with the problem.  The deciding officer tells the applicant that although he is not earning a wage he will be assessed on the income earned when working.  This is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present I have three cases in hand. The first involves a person in his early sixties who never before had to go to the employment exchange.  He cannot get work but he is told he has an income of £155 per week.  If he had, he would not be going to the employment exchange, the second case is that of a painter who could not even get a door to paint at present after all his years in the trade. <Col N="665" /> He is told he has an income of £135 per week because he earned that last year. In the third case a man was told he has an income of £85 per week because he had an income of that level last year.  This man and his wife are paid the lordly sum of £1.30 at the employment exchange, because he is told he has an income of £85 per week.  Like the other two I mentioned he would not need to apply for social welfare if he had this income.</P>
    <P>Even those who earn a very high wage would not have enough money left over to carry them through the following year if they did not have an income.  The Minister should review the situation so that people who are genuinely out of work and have no income are not expected to live on imaginary earnings.  It is difficult enough to live on real earnings, but it is impossible to live on imaginary earnings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the assessment of income of the self-employed is always a matter of some difficulty.  Legislation governing entitlement to unemployment assistance provides that all cash income which an applicant or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the coming year, other than specific payments &mdash; allowances excluded by the Act, must be assessed as means.</P>
      <P>Income from self-employment as a tradesman or a small farmer is assessable under this heading.  The assessment of means is based on the income which the applicant is likely to earn during the succeeding year.  Obviously, this is where the difficulty arises in determining what a person is likely to earn in the coming year in the case of the self-employed.  In the case of smallholders or other self-employed people, the income in the year preceding the year of claim is taken as a reference or starting point for the assessment. In general, this approach is to the advantage of people, but where fewer opportunities for self-employment and income are likely to be available over the year ahead, an adjustment will be made to relfect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Means for self-employed people are <Col N="666" /> assessed on an income and expenditure basis, that is, gross income less expenses incurred in earning that income.  The net figure is then divided by 52 to calculate weekly means.  The appropriate rate of unemployment assistance for the claimant and his or her family is then reduced by the weekly means as assessed.</P>
    <P>If a person is dissatisfied with an assessment, he or she can have the case reviewed by the independent social welfare appeals office.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that it is also open to a claimant to apply for a review of the case if at any point his or her circumstances change.</P>
    <P>I have directed my Department to ensure that the method of assessment of means used for self-employed people should have the flexibility to respond to variations in the circumstances of claimants.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will know, the deciding officers make these decisions.  That is the way the system works.  Deciding officers are statutorily appointed under the legislation and they operate the legislation as set down by this House in the first instance.  Generally speaking it works quite well, but if there are cases where it is not working there is the appeals system.  If, as the Deputy suggests, he has a number of cases, I would be happy if he would supply the details of the three cases involved and I will look into the matter, particularly if there are not any doors to paint for the next year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for <Col N="667" /> giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to clarify one point.  I was led to understand that the site was acquired over 30 years ago but in fact the site was purchased 20 years ago, which is not quite as bad.</P>
      <P>The gardaí are in the present rented bungalow since about 1966.  This two-bedroomed bungalow may have been all right in 1966 but now with 16 to 17 gardaí and three sergeants based in it, it is totally unacceptable as a Garda station and does not meet the requirements under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her written reply on 12 February where she points out the problems the Office of Public Works has with the site it bought in the mid-seventies.  These discussions or lack of them have gone on for far too long. The lease on the present station is, I understand, nearly up.  The premises may then be re-leased or bought, or better sites may be available.  What is the cost to date of the site investigations of the past 18 to 20 years?  The Minister should remember that this station provides Garda cover for a difficult Border region in which almost all roads are closed, which, in turn, creates security problems. Gardaí in this station who are on duty in all weathers do not have proper washing or drying facilities for their clothes.  There is no private room in which to interview people and radio communications and telephone calls are made in one public office.</P>
      <P>Deputies Leonard, O'Hanlon and I met Garda representatives at Scotstown station on 16 January last.  From what we saw that day there is an urgent need to update the accommodation there &mdash; I know the other Deputies support me in this matter.  If we are serious about law and order in this area we should ensure that gardaí have reasonable accommodation with proper interviewing rooms and a possible holding room. Above all there should be proper accommodation for gardaí to clean themselves and dry their clothes and a room in which to relax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that money is scarce but this is an urgent matter.  The Minister should <Col N="668" /> do his best to provide the necessary Garda station for Scotstown.  It is a coincidence that after I received permission to raise this matter tonight I was advised of an article in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i> which outlines the difficulties facing gardaí in this area. I would point out to the Minister that as a result of the bad state of repair of roads in the area, £6,000 had to be spent last year on servicing one Garda car.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister is fully aware of the conditions at Scotstown Garda station. The situation, however, is not as black as it has been painted.  The chief source of the problem relates to overcrowding in that the building was never designed to accommodate the present complement of 19 members and has become run-down as a result.  While saying this, the Minister hastens to add that most of these members are on out-door duty and use the station only as a base.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to rectify the situation by building a new station at Scotstown. However, the site which was acquired in 1976 is not suitable for the erection of a septic tank and access is required to the public sewerage system.  The Minister understands that the Office of Public Works is investigating this problem in an effort to find a solution.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of this problem, the Deputy will appreciate that, given available resources, each project must be addressed within the context of overall priorities thoughout the country.  A considerable investment has been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years.  Last year alone over £3.8 million was spent on new works and more than £2.5 million on maintenance projects. In 1986, only six miles from Scotstown, a new divisional headquarters was provided at Monaghan at a cost of £1.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the many demands on available resources, no commitment can be given on the replacement of this station in the short term.  However, the Garda <Col N="669" /> authorities have a certain amount of delegated responsibility in relation to maintaining stations and the Minister is advised by them that an application for improvement works has been sanctioned to go ahead later this year.  The station will be painted and decorated internally, toilet facilities will be upgraded and a shower unit will be installed.  In addition, kitchen facilities will be upgraded and new kitchen units will be provided.  These works should make accommodation at Scotstown more comfortable until it is possible to commence work on a new station.  This is the ultimate objective and will be achieved within the shortest possible time-scale.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, for taking this matter this evening.  What is at stake here is of the utmost importance not alone to the future of the shellfish industry but to the fishing and food industries.  I will confine my remarks this evening to the specific item under discussion.  There is an important niche in the French market for Irish oysters, which are regarded as prestigious in French restaurants, highly rated and priced.  The oyster export industry to France is a very important part of our overall export industry.  It is an industry that should be jealously guarded as it has has potential for further development and expansion.  Chief among our assets is the clean, clear water along our coastline.  When something happens to put that asset in jeopardy we must sit up and take notice and action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that proper precautions are taken to guarantee that the movement of stock between EC member states is disease and pest free.  Moreover when it emerges, as it has quite recently, that stocks are infected all due steps must be taken, not alone to halt further imports from suspect infected sources but also, and equally important, to remove from Irish waters all traces of infected specimens.  This is of critical <Col N="670" /> importance if we are to retain our reputation, protect our shellfish industry and maintain and expand our markets.  The problem that gives rise to the issue in question stems from the discovery of a parasite, mysticola orientalis, and toxic cysts in recent consignments of part-grown Pacific oysters from France.  This parasite seriously affects the growth of species.</P>
    <P>If the French shellfish industry wishes to continue with its plans in relation to part-grown oysters in the clear waters of the Irish coastline, this matter must be fully investigated and cleared up.  I ask the Minister to address the following questions which are of grave concern to me.  Will he fully clarify the reason importation of partly-grown oysters from France is currently suspended?  What are the implications for the Irish oyster industry arising from these imports?  What steps are being taken to remove the offending oysters and other such species from Irish waters?  It is fundamentally important to suspend imports until the matter is resolved but it is equally important to ensure that all traces of diseased or infected specimen is removed from our waters for the obvious reasons that the disease can spread and do untold, indeed irreparable, damage.  I am asking the Minister to point out the procedures to be put in place to protect the industry from the importation of diseased species. What is the policy in relation to the payment of grant aid to persons who breach these procedures?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for raising this important matter. The Department recognise that it is a matter of urgency.  Under the terms of EC Directive 91/67, barriers to trade in live aquaculture animals are to be eliminated while ensuring that infectious fish diseases are not spread to areas of the Community previously free of such diseases. The Directive applies to all fish and shellfish, whether farmed or wild, intended for ongrowing or for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importation of Pacific oysters, technically known as gigas, from France to Ireland was not permitted prior to the introduction of the Single Market.  This <Col N="671" /> longstanding ban had been imposed to minimise the risk of spreading the oyster disease bonamia in native Irish oysters. The disease has occurred in certain areas in the past.</P>
    <P>European Community scientific experts have concluded that bonamia is not carried by Pacific oysters but is carried by native oysters.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Directive, therefore, the free movement of Pacific oysters between member states is now permitted if approved from a fish health point of view.  Consignments must be certified as meeting the necessary health requirements.  In addition, consignments must be certified as having been checked at the place of dispatch to ensure that they do not contain species other than gigas.  This is to ensure that native oysters or other shellfish species are not being carried in the consignment.  A copy of this movement document must be forwarded to the Department of the Marine, prior to importation.  The movement document must accompany the consignment at all times.  IFREMER is the French Government research body responsible for checking and certifying the French consignments.</P>
    <P>Consignments of Pacifics imported from France to Ireland since 1 January last have been sampled by officials of the Department and the samples extensively tested at the Department's fisheries research centre.  The results of this sampling programme have given rise to some concern.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Aquaculture Directive and the EC Veterinary Checks Directive 90/425, the Department formally notified the EC Commission, the French authorities and other national authorities on 22 March that checks on consignments of Pacifics from France had disclosed irregularities.</P>
    <P>Specifically, native oysters and slipper limpets have been detected during checks carried out by Department inspectors and validated by the Department's fisheries research centre.  A comprehensive schedule setting out our findings to date has been sent to the French authorities and the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The French authorities have been <Col N="672" /> urgently requested to take all necessary measures to ensure consignment compatibility with certification; to notify Ireland of the measures taken; to explain these irregularities, and to elaborate on the checking procedures at dispatch points and the basis upon which certification was issued.</P>
    <P>Pending resolution of these concerns, the Department has advised operators temporarily to postpone further importations from France to Ireland.  The Irish Shellfish Association has been advised of this decision.  The Commission and other member states are being kept closely informed of all developments.  If the outcome of bilateral negotiations with the French authorities does not satisfy our concerns, we have requested the Commission to take the necessary next steps under the terms of the Directive.  These will include on site investigations by Commission veterinary experts.</P>
    <P>The question of the removal from farm sites of recently imported Pacific oysters is being considered in light of the outcome of ongoing sampling by the Department's technical staff, bilateral contacts with the French authorities, discussion with the EC Commission and the other member states within the framework of the relevant Directives.</P>
    <P>The valuable contribution of shellfish production to employment in coastal regions and to the export trade goes hand in hand with the need to protect the Irish shellfish industry from potential disease risks.  We have, therefore, taken a strongly precautionary approach to Pacific imports from France.  What is needed now is a breathing space to evaluate fully, in conjunction with the French authorities and the EC Commission, the findings of sampling carried out to date and the implications in both the medium and long term for the oyster-growing sector of the Irish aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>Decisions will be taken in the light of the outcome of current discussions within the EC and on the basis of the best technical advice available to me.  I will try to answer directly the Deputy's other questions on funding and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  The law regarding occupiers' liability is archaic. There is an immediate need to reform and update the law.  The present law is more in favour of the trespasser than the occupier, so the balance needs to be addressed.  Landowners are at present in a legal limbo.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty which this law creates has an negative effect on tourism.  There is a genuine fear among landowners with regard to personal injuries claims. Notices of &ldquo;no tresspassing&rdquo; are appearing on sites of historical ruins, some of which have been excluded from commercial insurance.  Other tourist attractions on lands which have been advertised in brochures as being available to tourists are now not so because of farmers' fear of liability.  Some tour operators have said that this has already led to cancellations.  Immediate interim measures are needed to deal with the 1993 season.</P>
      <P>The matter of insurance may have to be dealt with before legislative change. Indemnifying the landowner would give due recognition to his contribution to tourism in the interim.  I am told that the Law Reform Commission is to report by the end of April.  I am also aware of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Programme for Government on this issue.  However, immediate action by the Minister is now imperative.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue and I appreciate the <Col N="674" /> attendance of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, to hear our concerns on this matter.</P>
      <P>This question of occupiers' liability is a very serious one.  I understand that the previous Government set about remedying the legal deficiencies by referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission, with a mandate to report on possible legal changes.  I would urge the Minister and the Government to seek the completion of this report as a matter of urgency and to draft and have implemented the necessary legislation to remedy the defects in the present out-dated law.</P>
      <P>Practically everybody is affected by the present unsatisfactory system and I need only instance landowners, the State and sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>I come from a county which has always given a very warm welcome to visitors. I am particularly concerned about our tourist angling industry which has been built up over the years by the diligence and attention of the people in the industry and the full co-operation of landowners. The landowners, on whose land access is gained to waterways, have outlined to me in detail their concern about possible litigation and they are very anxious that the necessary legislation should be replaced on the Statute Book without delay.</P>
      <P>This issue came home to me very forcefully over the weekend when I learned that a number of angling projects, for which substantial financial provision had been made, are not proceeding at the speed we would wish because of the concerns of landowners on whose property the developments would be sited.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to fulfil the commitment given in the Programme for Government with an early and comprehensive law reform package.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I thank the two Deputies for drawing our attention to this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law of occupiers' liability concerns the duty of care owned by occupiers of land or premises, towards all entrants <Col N="675" /> onto property, including those who suffer personal injury or property damage during the course of their visits.  As Deputy de Valera said, the <i>Programme for Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> indicates the Government's intention to reform and update the law on occupiers' liability in line with the commitment given in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> I am also aware of the concerns which farmers experience in relation to their possible liability in law for personal injuries which may be sustained by entrants on to their property and that they feel particularly vulnerable to claims for injury, due to the ever increasing use of their land for sporting and recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>However, the law on occupiers' liability is complex and involves a wide range of interests, some of them conflicting. Indeed, efforts in this area will have to be directed towards a resolution of this difficult problem.  There are many types of occupiers &mdash; farmers obviously, but also householders, industry and business interests, local authorities, even the State itself.  There are also different legal categories of entrants, invitees, licensees and trespassers in respect of which different legal duties are owed.</P>
    <P>A further complicating factor is that the law on occupiers' liability which, by and large, is contained in the body of common law rather than in statute is currently in a state of transition.  There are many issues which relate to the safety standards which those in control of land or buildings should observe in order to safeguard those who come on to their property.  There is also the question of the balance which should be struck between the liability which it is reasonable to impose on a landowner and the legitimate interests, among others, of an ever increasing number of individuals <Col N="676" /> who are anxious to participate in the wide range of outdoor pursuits now available.</P>
    <P>All land outside the major centres of population is coming under increasing pressure from people using it for social and recreational purposes and, inevitably, those pursuits which contain an active element carry with them the risk of injury.  There is also the tourism potential implicit in these leisure activities, to which Deputy Brendan Smith referred.</P>
    <P>There is a need for action in this area. However, because of the wide-ranging implications of any changes in this area of the law, it is essential that any action be considered carefully.  Hasty and ill considered solutions to complex questions can, in the long run, give rise to even greater difficulties than those which they were designed to address.  Because of the need for considered action and the underlying complexity of the legal issues involved this whole question was referred, as Deputy de Valera said, to the Law Reform Commission for examination and report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, is hopeful that the Commission will publish a consultation document on the subject of occupiers' liability at a very early date. Legislative proposals to reform and update the law in this matter will be brought forward in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. I should say too, in relation to the point made by both Deputies, that I share their sense of urgency.  The Minister to whom these matters are addressed is responsible for law reform and there will be no delay in bringing forward legislative change when the Commission has reported.  I will convey their anxiety for such other short term immediate measures as may be appropriate to the Minister responsible.  I am grateful to the Deputies for drawing attention to these issues.</P>

      <P>Applications by military personnel from time to time for special leave, for example for domestic or educational reasons, for service with voluntary aid organisations or the United Nations Field Service, have been granted on an exceptional basis.</P>
      <P>The Gleeson Commission, which examined conditions of service in the Defence Forces, took the view that essentially a career break scheme would be incompatible with fixed-term engagements in the case of non-commissioned personnel and would also be inappropriate for officers in the context of their current superannuation arrangements under which pensions may be payable after only 12 years' service. However, the feasibility of introducing a career break scheme subject to certain restrictions relevant to service in the Permanent Defence Force is being examined. Any proposals brought forward in the matter will be the subject of discussion with the representative associations at the Conciliation Council for the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I fully share the concern of Deputies that our coastline and marine environment be protected from accidental pollution from laden tankers and other ships carrying hazardous cargoes.  The recent incidents involving oil tankers in Community waters have focused attention on the high risks to which our islands and coastlines can be exposed.  The low safety record of ageing tankers and other vessels highlights the need for improved compliance with and enforcement of construction, operation and maintenance standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case, of course, that the country, and European Community as a whole, is to a large extent dependent on reliable cost effective and safe shipping services.  We must, however, ensure that <Col N="427" /> such services are operated at a minimum level of risk for all concerned and for the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has called for co-ordinated action at Community and international level (through the International Maritime Organisation) to put in place specific measures.  These include enhanced ship traffic reporting and monitoring systems and the identification of ecologically sensitive coastal areas where traffic restrictions, including areas to be avoided, should apply.</P>
    <P>At the Council meeting on 15 March I welcomed the thrust of the Commission's &ldquo;Common Policy on Safe Seas&rdquo; proposals and underlined our commitment to work with other member states to give effect to the proposed action plan without delay.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, a particularly strong emphasis is being put on the identification of zones of ecological importance with a view to adoption, through the IMO, of necessary traffic restrictions including routeing measures and areas to be avoided.  The Commission has convened an expert working group later this month to identify such areas and to prepare proposals for routeing measures and zoning for submission to the International Maritime Organisation. The Department is currently finalising specific proposals in consultation with the Department of the Environment and the Wildlife Service on areas to be avoided around the Irish coast.  These will be transmitted to the Commission for consideration by the working group and will also be submitted to the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures now being developed at Community and international level, I am reviewing the scope for additional natural measures including the introduction of enhanced advisory and reporting arrangements for tankers and other vessels transiting our coastline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a copy of the report of the National Coastal Erosion Committee, &ldquo;Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action&rdquo;.  This is a valuable report in that it indicates the extent of the coastal erosion problem affecting the Irish coastline. The report is particularly welcome in that it should help raise the awareness generally about coastal and marine problems. The report also contains recommendations regarding the institutional and legal framework which might be adopted to implement a comprehensive coast protection programme.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection rests with local coastal authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves.  The role of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to formulate a programme of coast protection works for the next few years, the Department of the Marine wrote to all maritime local autorities in 1991 requesting them to submit a list of priorities for coastal protection projects which they consider would be warranted and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.  Drawing, <i>inter alia,</i> on the submissions received from local authorities, plans for a comprehensive coast protection programme <Col N="430" /> have been drawn up in the context of the allocation of the next round of Structural Funds.  Decisions have yet to be made by the Government on the priority and funding to be attached to this programme.</P>
    <P>As regards a coastal protection scheme for the South Dublin coastline from Killiney to Bray, the only proposals I have received from the local authorities concerned relate to Bray and Killiney.  The position in relation to Bray, County Wicklow is that the Department has received in 1992 the results of a model study of the coastal protection needs at Bray.  This report will form the basis of any coastal protection work undertaken there.  In regard to Killiney, a proposal was received from Dún Laoghaire Corporation for a coast protection scheme at Killiney and this, as well as the Bray study, will be taken into account by the Department in drawing up detailed proposals for the implementation of any coast protection programme which may be approved under the Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I have <Col N="432" /> noted the recommendation in the Green 2000 advisory group report, which was launched on 26 March, that the sea based salmon farms should be located as far off shore as technically feasible.  The report's recommendation is in line with overall policy objectives for the future development of the finfish farming industry and accords with the industry's own preferred operational strategy.  Although a relative latecomer to the industry, Ireland has been a technical innovator in this regard. The Irish aquaculture industry pioneered the development of offshore fishfarming technology using larger and more robust high seas cages.  The experience has been very positive, with the more demanding operating conditions of offshore sites being more than offset by the better husbandry conditions, higher growth rates and environmental impact.  Open water offshore cages now account for the bulk of Irish salmon production.</P>

      <P>While the value of fish exports has increased by more than 40 per cent since 1987 and domestic consumption by about 30 per cent over the same period, there are marketing difficulties in the fishing sector generally.  Some of these difficulties arise from changing market conditions on our main markets, reflecting high supplies of pelagic species, weakening market demand and increased supplies of white fish from Third Countries. However, difficulties also arise from the fragmented and dispersed nature of the Irish fish processing and marketing sector.  Only a relatively few large firms have a strong marketing capability. These structural weaknesses can only be tackled by a longer term programme, which would bring greater scale and improve market organisation generally. These are the medium-term aims of the programme for processing and marketing.</P>
      <P>The State, via BIM, does provide assistance for such Irish fish exporters including assistance for: market research and investigation; participation in international trade shows; market visits and inward buyer visits; promotional activities, including in-store promotions and tastings, publicity and promotional material; quality assurance schemes; product testing and development.  On the home market initiatives include the BIM schools' seafood cookery competition and participation in national healthy eating week.</P>
      <P>However, in the light of growing pressures on the Exchequer, the funds available to support these programmes have been falling in recent years.  The whole question of the future funding and organisation of State support, including the question of an appropriate industry contribution, for fish marketing will fall for a thorough review in light of the findings of the forthcoming report of the expert group on the food industry.</P>

In the case of Dublin Port, Limerick Harbour and Waterford Harbour special bye-laws relating to the loading, unloading, handling, storage and distribution of dangerous goods at the harbour are in force.  These bye-laws provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for advance written notification of not less than 48 hours to the harbour master prior to the entry of vessels having such goods on board. Similar bye-laws for Cork Harbour are in course of preparation.  It is intended to pursue the desirability of introducing bye-laws in this area with other harbours.</P>

    <P>The Irish ratio compares favourably with some member states and is higher than the figure for either France, 100:33, or Spain, 100:17, which, despite having the largest number of fishermen in the EC, has the lowest level of related processing employment.  It is important to realise that these ratios are based on national totals which are averged out over the entire year.  In Ireland, certain areas of the country regularly display higher ratios, as for example in Killybegs, where during the winter mackerel season the ratio may be as high as 1:4.</P>
    <P>There is, nevertheless, considerable scope for further development of the processing sector where at the moment less than 20 per cent of the fish is being processed to a secondary level.  The current Community Support Framework covering the development of the Irish processing sector over the period 1991 to 1993 is expected to generate a total investment of £24 million and an additional 420 new jobs which will come on stream over the next few years.  It is intended to maintain this momentum over the medium term with a view to increasing value added production, developing scale and specialisation and the marketing of shellfish and non-quota species.</P>

      <P>The Department is currently considering changes to fisheries legislation in order to comply with the terms of certain judgments of the European Court of Justice in relation to nationality requirements in the context of the licensing and registration of fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>As currently framed, legislation in these areas limits the holding of a licence in respect of a fishing vessel and of its registration under the Irish flag, to nationals or bodies corporate based within the State and subject to the laws of the State.  In the light of the court ruling it will be necessary to extend this privilege to nationals of all member states of the European Community and bodies corporate established in a member state.</P>
      <P>The court judgments, however, support the general principle that member states have the right to set requirements which underpin the concept of real economic linkage.  The Department are currently examining the practical requirements which may be imposed in this context.</P>
      <P>It is the intention when bringing forward this legislation to avail of the opportunity to tidy up a number of other provisions in existing legislation.  This may include licensing procedures and certain technical provisions relating to inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the major role which Ireland plays in the policing of Community waters, which amount approximately to 132,000 square miles of sea area or approximately 16 per cent of total EC waters, the EC approved a five year investment programme to cover the period from 1991 to 1995 at a total cost of £34 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Financial assistance is provided at a <Col N="440" /> rate of 50 per cent towards the capital cost of equipment designed to strengthen Ireland's fishery protection capability.  In 1991 the total aid package amounted to £8.8 million of which £4.4 million was provided by the EC, while last year expenditure amounting to £8.6 million was approved at a rate of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>This aid will significantly enhance Ireland's surveillance capability through the purchase of fixed-wing aircraft for the Air Corps, communications and data handling equipment for the Naval Service and the Department of the Marine.  In addition, there is provision for the acquisition of inshore surveillance boats.</P>
    <P>While up to now, operational costs have not been eligible for Community aid, it was agreed at last December's Fisheries Council on foot of a strong case made by Ireland for extending assistance in conjunction with the Commission's proposal on the new control regulation. It is expected that the matter will be considered at the Fisheries Council in June.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a natural mussel bed fishery was identified in Carlingford Lough in January 1993.  Shortly thereafter, three vessels, all of which were registered in Northern Ireland, began to exploit this fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On investigation the Department of the Marine found that the most productive mussel beds were located on the southern side of the Lough.  Following discussions with the Northern authorities it was agreed that the fishery be regulated for the time being, under the Voisinage Agreement between the two Administrations which accords reciprocal access to fishing vessels from both Northern and <Col N="441" /> Southern Ireland to their respective territorial waters.</P>
    <P>In the course of these discussions it was agreed that two of the three dredgers fishing had no economic link with Northern Ireland and, accordingly, were asked to leave the fishery.  It is understood that they have since done so leaving one dredger &mdash; the <i>Atlantis Bell</i>&mdash; working in tandem with a number of smaller Carlingford-based vessels.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's role is concerned primarily with the development of significant fishery centres and commercial ports.

      <P>The Department of the Marine is currently implementing the final year of its fishery harbour development programme for the period 1989 to 1993.  No provision was made under this programme for development works at Kinsale Harbour.  In view of this, it will not be possible to carry out any works at the harbour during 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently drawing up a new fishery harbour development plan covering the period 1994 to 1997.  To this end the various maritime local authorities and harbour authorities, including Kinsale Harbour Commissioners, were invited to make formal proposals for development works in the fisheries interests and for which they would be prepared to make funds available.  Kinsale Harbour Commissioners submitted their proposal in July 1992.  The commissioners proposed two possible development options for the harbour.  These were (a) to extend the existing quay or (b) to construct a new <Col N="445" /> quay.  Both options were estimated to cost approximately £800,000.  The commissioners also indicated their wish to provide an ice plant on the fish-landing quay, the construction of an auction hall and the provision of washing and showering facilities.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have recently written to the Department of the Marine outlining proposals to construct a new fishery quay at Adam's Quay, Kinsale, at an estimated cost of £400,000.  The commissioners have also indicated a willingness to make a contribution to the costs of the work.  The Department of the Marine, which is conscious of the limited facilities at this harbour and the conflict between commercial and fishing activities, is examining the proposal with a view to its possible inclusion in the new development plan.  However, pending finalisation of the plan and clarification of its funding, I am not in a position, at this stage, to say if it will be possible to undertake the work in question.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the recreational use of lakes and other waterways should be a safe and pleasurable activity for all concerned.  I am glad to be able to advise the Deputy that the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boats) Regulations, 1992 came into force on 1 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations allow local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to make proposals to me for the designation of areas within their jurisdiction as unsuitable for the operation of jet skis and fast power boats.  In considering these proposals I will also take account of the outcome of consultations <Col N="446" /> with various local interest groups.</P>
    <P>Three such proposals are currently being considered by the Department.  I hope to receive a number of additional proposals over the next few weeks.  The various authorities have been asked to finalise their consultations and to bring forward their proposals as quickly as possible in order that designations can be put in place in time for the holiday season.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the designation procedure will operate to protect and enhance the enjoyment of boating enthusiasts, swimmers, anglers and of all users of the resource.</P>

      <P>Discussions have taken place at various levels with the UK authorities concerning the upgrading of the port of Holyhead.  As recently as last month I met the Earl of Caithness, Under-Secretary of State at the UK Department of Transport.  We both agreed that transport links on the Irish Sea, in particular the development of the &ldquo;central corridor&rdquo; would be the subject of joint review by both our Departments.  These links will be strengthened over the coming months. There will be continued liaison with the UK authorities on matters relating to Holyhead.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine is also discussing various Holyhead issues with the shipping operators and port authorities concerned as well as with the European Commission with the aim of developing the range, quality and competitiveness of services on the central corridor.</P>

      <P>The Embassy in Baghdad has been closed since the outbreak of hostilities in January 1991 and contacts with Iraq since then have been infrequent.</P>
      <P>There is no accurate means of knowing how many Irish nationals might be working in Iraq but the numbers are likely to be very small.</P>
      <P>Sanctions imposed on Iraq by the UN Security Council will remain in force until Iraq complies with its obligations.  These obligations in the main require Iraq to abide fully by the ceasefire established in 1991, to respect fully its border with Kuwait and to make full disclosure of its programmes for the development of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>The sanctions prevent imports from, and exports to, Iraq but exceptions are made in the case of foodstuffs, medicines and materials and supplies for other essential needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iraq's capacity to meet these needs and to purchase food and medicine is assisted <Col N="450" /> by the Security Council's provision that Iraq may sell petroleum products to the value of 1.6 billion dollars, a sum which would be paid into a UN account and which would serve principally to meet the costs of those essential purchases. Regrettably Iraq has refused to avail itself of that option and the opportunity thereby provided to ease the situation of its civilian population.</P>
    <P>The Security Council held informal consultations on 29 March in order to review sanctions against Iraq.  It reaffirmed them without modification.  The Government fully supports the implementation of sanctions against Iraq until it complies with its obligations pursuant to the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 77 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan which will form the basis for the negotiation of the Community Support Framework for EC Structural Funds and the Cohesion <Col N="451" /> Fund for the period 1994-1999 is currently in preparation.  The central priority of the plan will be the creation of sustainable employment and growth.  The plan will reflect the priorities of the Partnership Government as laid out in the Programme for Government.  The priority areas for investment, the best mix of programmes and measures and the optimal sectoral balance are crucial issues which will be considered carefully by the Government in drawing up the plan.</P>
    <P>While the European Council at its Edinburgh meeting agreed the overall budget for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, the allocation by Member State/region has not been decided as yet.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the administrative arrangements for submission of the National Development Plan to the EC Commission, including the deadline, have not been agreed at EC level as yet. It is hoped to finalise the plan around end May or early June.  This should allow sufficient time for negotiations with the Commission to be completed and the new programmes to be in place at the start of 1994.  At an early stage of planning last year my officials were working towards a target date for finalisation of the plan of end-March 1993.  There is no particular reason for the change in target date.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan will be approved by the Government before submission to the EC Commission.  Information on its contents will be widely available for discussion at that stage.</P>

      <P>Section 25 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, allows payments, contracts etc. to be expressed in foreign currency, including ECUs, if the parties involved agree.  Payments to the Exchequer from Brussels, for example, are denominated in ECUs.</P>
      <P>However the ECU is not legal tender at present.  The Treaty on European Union does provide for the introduction of the ECU as a single European currency, but the earliest that this can be introduced, under the terms of the Treaty, is 1997.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of one of the conclusions drawn on his economic background to the budget documents that the recognition that a labour market with one in five of the workforce unemployed cannot be working properly, he ran counter to this in the budget by putting a 1 per cent levy on income, thereby creating another major disincentive to work; his views on whether Government policy is consistent in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's point that the temporary income levy introduced in the budget is a major disincentive to work or that its introduction runs counter to <Col N="453" /> the conclusions set out in the Economic Background to the Budget.</P>
      <P>The new levy has a specific income exemption in order to protect the lower paid.  In addition all medical card holders, including those whose income is above £9,000 per annum, will be exempt from the levy.  Welfare payments will also be exempt from the new levy and such payments will not be taken into account in determining whether an individual qualifies for an income exemption from the levy.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new levy has to be seen against the background of the income increases and tax improvements of recent years, which have produced a significant increase in real take-home pay and incomes generally.  I would again emphasise that the new levy is temporary and the Government are satisfied that all taxpayers, having benefited in recent years, would be prepared to make a small sacrifice now to help the maintenance both of a sound budgetary policy as an essential element in employment strategy and of adequate social services and programmes.</P>

      <P>While I am keenly aware of the difficult economic conditions that prevail at present, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the exercise by the Revenue Commissioners of their statutory function of securing prompt payment of all taxes due for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I am nevertheless informed by the commissioners that while the majority of taxpayers now lodge their returns and pay over moneys due on time, some latitude is extended to those taxpayers who may experience temporary difficulty in complying with their statutory obligations and who make their situation known at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In extending any such latitude, the commissioners must distinguish between those taxpayers who are in genuine difficulty and those who simply refuse to comply with their obligations.  It must be evident that the commissioners are not seen to allow the non-complying public <Col N="456" /> an unfair commercial advantage over their complying competitors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the commissioners' charging of interest for late payment of amounts due, it is normal practice before interest is demanded, to have cases examined carefully to ensure that no factors are present which cast doubt on the legitimacy of the interest charge.  Interest, no more than tax on which it is based, is not a discretionary imposition.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the three visitor centre projects at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley.  The present position is that as a result of the conflicting High Court judgments in the Mullaghmore and Luggala actions the Government approved an appeal against the High Court judgment in the case of the Mullaghmore centre to the Supreme Court in order to clarify the application of the planning Acts to developments by State Authorities, including the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Government also approved the suspension of work on these three visitor centre projects pending the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing.</P>
      <P>The hearing took place on 14 March and the court reserved judgment.  The court has asked for further argument to be made at a combined hearing on 20 April.  It is hoped that the court will deliver its judgment soon afterwards.  A decision on the future of these projects will be taken when the Supreme Court's judgment is available.</P>

    <P>2.  interpretations of the Local Government Planning and Development Act 1963 as it relates to State authorities. </P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the issue of the legal authority of the Commissioners has been resolved beyond doubt through the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act 1993, which was signed into law by the President on 18 February 1993.</P>
    <P>With regard to the planning issue the Government decided, on the advice of the Attorney General, to appeal the finding of Mr. Justice Costello to the Supreme Court.  This appeal was heard by the Supreme Court on 15 March and judgment was reserved.  The appeal was heard in tandem with an appeal against the decision of Mr. Justice Lynch in the Luggala case.  The Supreme Court has now requested further submissions from both parties to the appeal.  These will be heard on 20 April.  I do not propose to make any further comment on this matter until the Supreme Court's decision is available.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office receives approximately 18,000 appeals every year.</P>
      <P>At present there are 214 current appeals from the Mayo region at varying stages.  These range from those recently received to those which have been the subject of any necessary additional inquiries and are now ready for oral hearing.</P>
      <P>When an appeal is received from a person dissatisfied with the initial decision of the Department of Social Welfare, the grounds upon which the appeal is based are examined.  This may involve a second medical referee examination in the case of a sickness benefit payment or a further investigation by a local officer of the Department in other cases.  In some cases it will be possible to revise the initial decision at that stage and resolve the appeal speedily.  In other cases, however, any contention may be resolved only by way of an oral hearing of the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 32 cases listed for oral hearing in County Mayo.  In 24 of these the appeal was lodged more than 6 months ago.  It is the policy in the Social Welfare Appeals Office, so far as it is possible, to afford priority to appeals where the person has no other social welfare entitlement.  Amongst the 24 there are, for example, cases where executors are contesting the recovery from a deceased pensionser's estate of pension overpaid, cases where appellants are being paid but are seeking some decrease in the amount of means assessed against them and cases where the person has been found to be concurrently working <Col N="465" /> and claiming benfit and is contesting the amount of the overpayment.  Indeed, in three of the cases, oral hearings had already been arranged and adjourned at the request of the appellant or his legal representative.</P>
    <P>It has been arranged that an Appeals Officer will visit the County Mayo area in the week commencing 26 April when it is expected that a significant number of these appeals will be disposed of.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) (No. 2) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 448/92) provided that a part-time worker who claims unemployment benefit must suffer a substantial loss of employment before he can qualify for benefit.  These regulations came into effect on 4 January, 1993.  In practice this meant that a part-time worker whose normal working week was four days or more would have to lose two days of insurable employment in order to qualify. In the case of a working week consisting of less than four days, the loss required was one day of insurable employment.  These arrangements were improved by amending regulations which I made on 23 March 1993 reducing the &ldquo;2-day&rdquo; rule to 1 day.  I will keep the situation under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most part-time workers have only recently become eligible for benefit as a result of my decision to extend insurance to all employees earning £25 or more per week, as and from April 1991.  Any part-time worker who takes up employment at £25 or more per week is now entitled <Col N="466" /> to the full range of benefits, including pensions.  I am satisfied that, as a result, most part-time workers now have a greater incentive to take up work.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is an inequity in the situation whereby part-time workers earning £60 or more per week pay a Class A contribution, but yet must have an average earning of £70 per week to qualify for the full benefits deriving from a Class A contribution; the proposals, if any, he has to redress the situation for such persons earning between £60 per week and £70 per week; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees earning £25 or more per week are generally covered by Class A social insurance, and can qualify for the full range of benefits, including pensions. In the case of people earning less than £70 per week some benefits are paid at reduced rates.  Such reduced rates are necessary because the income threshold for social insurance is at a relatively low level.  It would not make sense to pay the full rate of short term benefits, currently £53 per week for a single person, to someone whose earnings are as low as £25 per week; such a person would have a strong incentive to give up work and claim benefit instead.  The threshold of £70 was chosen to ensure that a single person would have an entitlement to the full rate of £53 per week only in circumstances where the incentive to work is maintained.</P>
      <P>The PRSI exemption for low-paid workers is a separate feature of the social insurance system.  People whose earnings in a particular week are under £60 do not have to pay the employee's social insurance contribution.  However, the employer still has to pay the full employer's share, and the employee retains entitlement to social insurance benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two thresholds are therefore very different in nature, and the existence of two separate thresholds for different purposes <Col N="467" /> is not, in itself, inequitable.  Of course, any change in either threshold would have financial consequences in terms of either loss of contributions or additional expenditure on benefits.  Such changes could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of lone parent's allowance is that the claimant must have the main care and charge of a child.  This is consistent with the underlying objective of the scheme which is to meet the needs of people who have the resposibility of <Col N="468" /> rearing children without the support of a spouse or partner.</P>
      <P>My Department has given full consideration to the application of the person concerned.  He has informed my Department that he and his wife have joint equal custody of the children of the marriage, under the terms of a judicial Joint Custody Order.  However, as he does not have the main care and charge of any of the children, I regret that he cannot qualify for lone parent's allowance.  In view of the circumstances, his application for the allowance has been rejected.  My Department has written to the person concerned informing him of this decision.</P>
      <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  In the meantime, if he is suffering financial hardship, he should contact the community welfare officer at his nearest health board where may qualify for support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The IDA and Shannon Development operate a range of schemes aimed at small firms in the manufacturing and international services areas.  For the majority of small firms, IDA/Shannon Development assistance is provided mainly in the form of employment grants.  These grants are directly related and conditional on new jobs being created.  Assistance is also provided, where appropriate, towards the development of management skills.  For those firms with significant growth potential more extensive support &mdash; including advisory support, capital grants and assistance towards new product development &mdash; is available.</P>
      <P>Also, FÁS operates an employment subsidy scheme.  This scheme &mdash; the employment incentive scheme &mdash; applies to profit making and non profit making enterprises in all sectors with the exception of the public sector, banking, insurance, building societies and similar financial institutions.  The scheme is aimed at encouraging the recruitment of long term unemployed persons, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons.  Subject to the conditions of the scheme a subsidy of £60 and £45 per week, depending on the category of the employee recruited, is paid for 39 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schemes, as with all other schemes, are kept under review so as to ensure that they remain relevant and <Col N="478" /> contribute to the objectives for which they were developed.</P>

      <P>There is a general obligation on drivers to drive safely and with due consideration for other road users.  Drivers, therefore, need to apply adequate concentration to their driving and to avoid any action which might unduly interfere with such concentration.  It is in this context that the new edition of the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; advises drivers to avoid using car phones while driving.  Similar considerations would apply to the use of walkmans and the question of cautioning drivers against their use will be considered when the next edition of the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; is being published. The National Safety Council will also consider the matter.  I have no proposals at present to ban the use of walkmans by drivers.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 167 of 11 March 1993, the provision for the amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme is to enable payments to be made on foot of grants which were allocated in 1990 and 1991.

      <P>A proposal has been submitted to the EC Commission to amend the Architects Directive in order to bring under its protection persons whose established right to practice, and consequently their right to the protection of the Directive, was overlooked when the Directive was being negotiated.  The proposed amendment would allow for the issue of a certificate by the Minister for the Environment that the person concerned had, over a period of at least five years immediately prior to the date of coming into force of the Directive, pursued architectural activities the nature and importance of which, in the opinion of the Minister, gave that person an established right to pursue those activities.  The number of persons involved would be relatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending amendment of the Directive, and in order to protect their position in the meantime, a list will now be prepared of those persons who would have the requisite experience to qualify for certification under the proposed amendment. To this end, I have already decided that persons with the requisite length of experience who, on the date of coming into force of the Directive, were members of the Irish Architects' Society or were corporate architect members of the Irish Branch of the Architects and Surveyors Institute or of the Irish Branch of the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, by virtue of such membership, would have been included in the Directive had their position not been overlooked accordingly, would qualify for certification.  The claims of others to have the necessary experience <Col N="484" /> to qualify for certification under the amended Directive will be reviewed on an individual basis.

      <P>I visited Irish troops serving in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus during the period 14-24 March 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Lebanon I had discussions with the Force Commander, General Trond Furuhovde, and met Irish personnel stationed <Col N="494" /> at the Force Headquarters in Naqoura and with members of the 72nd Infantry Battalion serving in the battalion area in the vicinity of Tibnin.  I saw at first hand the role played by Irish soldiers.  Everywhere I went I was enormously impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work which they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
    <P>The presence of UNIFIL is clearly vital to the stability of South Lebanon and to the safety and welfare of the local population.  I met a number of community leaders including the Muktars of the villages in the Irish battalion area. Local people deeply appreciate the Irish presence and I was impressed by the close rapport which has evolved between the battalion and the community.</P>
    <P>While in Beirut, I met the Lebanese Prime Minister and the Lebanese Minister for Defence.  In Damascus I met the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, and had discussions with the Cypriot Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Marine and Defence in Nicosia. I also met the UN Force Commander in Cyprus, Major-General Michael Minehane &mdash; an Irish officer &mdash; and Irish personnel serving with UNFICYP in Cyprus and with UNTSO in Syria.  All of the Ministers to whom I spoke emphasised their support for the peacekeeping role of the United Nations and expressed their appreciation of the work of Irish military personnel.</P>
    <P>Our military personnel approach the task of peacekeeping with confidence and dedication.  Combining the highest professional military standards with common sense and diplomacy, they have earned the respect and gratitude of local communities and Governments alike. Through their success the international reputation of Ireland has been greatly enhanced.</P>

    <P> * Staffing in the Central Fisheries Board for 1981 included development staff for all the regional boards.  These were subsequently transferred to each region. </P>
    <P>As regards remaining vacancies a significant number of priority posts within the central and regional fisheries boards have been identified and as I indicated in <Col N="499" /> reply to Question No. 2 on 24 February 1993 I am examining all possible avenues to have these filled.  Not all vacancies occurring in the fisheries boards are fillable due to the staff concerned having taken advantage of various early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes implemented by Government over the years, one of the terms of which was that persons availing of them would not be replaced.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am pursuing this matter against the background of a very difficult budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>The company in question has been approved by BIM for grant aid totalling £33,602 under the board's resource development grant scheme.  The scheme, which forms part of the board's pilot aquaculture grants scheme, provides for grant aid towards novel aquaculture projects. Under the scheme grant aid is available at a rate of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure.  The scheme aims to finance feasibility studies and rearing projects involving the cultivation of novel aquaculture species and/or rearing methods. Results are made known to the industry. Grant aid under this scheme would not be available to a second operator in respect of a similar proposal.  However, any such application would be eligible for assistance under the board's aquaculture grants scheme.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal protection rests with local coastal authorities.  It is the policy of the Department of the Marine to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  Of course, owners of private property have the major role in protecting their own property.</P>
      <P>In formulating the coast protection programme for Structural Funds all local coastal authorities were contacted and requested to identify priorities for coast protection projects which they considered would be warranted and feasible and for which they would be prepared to make funds available.  Donegal County Council in their submission in respect of this programme have listed Lower Cairn, Ramelton among their priorities where works will be undertaken should sufficient funds become available.  Pending finalisation of this programme and clarification of funding it is difficult for me to say at this stage whether or not funds from central sources will be made available to assist the undertaking of repairs at the location mentioned.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the European Community's fish withdrawals scheme is to support the market for fish when demand is low.  Each year the Commission, in consultation with the member states, fixes withdrawal prices for the species covered by the scheme.  Once the market price for a species falls to be the level of the withdrawal price fish is <Col N="502" /> withdrawn and compensation is paid to fishermen.  A feature of the withdrawals scheme is the requirement that withdrawn fish must be disposed of in such a way that it does not interfere with the normal marketing of the species in question. One of the ways in which withdrawn fish may be disposed of is by distributing it free of charge for charitable purposes. Nevertheless, because of the unpredictable nature of withdrawals and the requirement that such fish should be distributed in its natural state, it has not proved practical to dispose of withdrawn fish in this way.  In these circumstances withdrawn fish is either used as fishmeal, animal feed or is dumped.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warrented, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  However, primary responsibility for coastal erosion rests with local coastal authorities.</P>
      <P>There are limited funds available to the Department of the Marine to deal with the huge problem of coastal erosion. An amount of £200,000 was allocated in 1993.  These funds are earmarked for advancing existing schemes such as the one at Rosslare and maintenance of former Office of Public Works schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been successful in securing funding for coastal protection measures under NORSPA and LIFE Council Regulations.  The funding has been obtained by way of a joint project involving the Department of the Marine, EOLAS and the local authorities for Wexford, Waterford, Kerry and Clare. The project title is Environmentally <Col N="503" /> Friendly Coast Protection (ECOPRO). A total of 900,000 ECU in grant aid is provided for over a two and a half year period.  The objectives of the project are, (i)  to assess the vulnerability of the coast to changes (including erosion), (ii) to consider needs for protection (both now and in the near future), (iii) to examine the performance and environmental impact of existing coastal protection works including a demonstration project.</P>
    <P>In order to formulate a programme of coastal protection works for the next few years, the Department of the Marine wrote to all maritime local authorities in 1991 requesting them to submit a list of priorities for coastal protection projects which they consider would be warranted and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.</P>
    <P>Drawing, <i>inter alia</i>, on the submissions received from the various coastal authorities, plans for a comprehensive coastal protection programme have been drawn up in the context of the allocation of the next round of Sructural Funds.  Decisions have yet to be made by the Government on the priority and funding to be attached to this programme.</P>

      <P>The company in question was set up and registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies in 1950 to develop and co-ordinate the exportation of seed potatoes.  Its rules provided for two members of the management committee to be nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>In order to comply with EC rules on competition, the export monopoly which the company had since its formation in 1950 was terminated in 1986.  This enabled other exporters to compete with the company, and the Minister severed his connection with it.  Accordingly, the rules of the company were amended in 1987.  At that time the company had an interest in one other company and was accountable to its own shareholders.  The position is that the Minister has had no function in the affairs of the company since 1987.</P>

      <P>Due to the exceptionally high demand for funds under the scheme, the original allocation of £4.1 million was increased to £5.95 million in September 1992.  All of the funds have now been fully committed. To date about £3 million has been paid in grant aid.</P>

      <P>Ireland's trade with Iran grew steadily from 1985 to 1989 with trade surpluses in Ireland's favour in each year.  The surplus for 1989, which amounted to almost £105 million, was chiefly due to our exports of meat and meat preparations.</P>
      <P>While Irish exports to Iran have been dramatically reduced since 1989 due to the fall off in meat exports, the trade balance has remained in Ireland's favour. The provisional figures for 1992 show total trade at £12.6 million with exports making up £11.9 million of this figure. Every effort is being made to ensure that trade in meat resumes quickly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>On 1 March 1993, the most recent date for which figures are available, Ireland's oil stocks, as reported to the EC, were 104 days petrol, 95 days gasoil, also known as diesel, and 147 days heavy fuel oil. This includes 205,000 tonnes of crude which is held at the oil storage terminal at Whiddy Island.</P>
      <P>Ireland is currently in excess of EC and IEA oil stockholding obligations which require the maintenance of oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of the previous year's consumption in the case of the EC, and 90 days of the previous year's imports in the case of the IEA, across a range of product categories.  It is my intention that we should continue to meet these obligations. There are no current world oil market developments which give cause for concern with regard to oil stockholding. Therefore, I have no plans for action to increase stocks at present.</P>

      <P>The duration and level of assurance associated with a gas supply are functions of the contract or contracts under which it is purchased.  Regard must also be had to the reliability of the supplier and of the supply system, and also to the back-up measures provided for in the contract.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann will have regard to these considerations in the negotiation and conclusion of any long term gas contract to which it becomes a party.  I understand that, although large volumes will not need to be imported prior to 1995, the board is now in discussion with prospective suppliers in the international markets.</P>
      <P>For the short term, Bord Gáis has concluded a back-up gas supply agreement which would entitle it to sufficient gas supplies in the event that any interruption occurred in the supply of gas from Kinsale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the possibility of interruption in the event of an emergency in international <Col N="517" /> markets, the agreement recently concluded between Ireland and the UK in respect of the interconnector pipeline includes an important provision to ensure that the two Governments will consult immediately to establish a framework for co-operation should the gas supply be threatened in either jurisdiction.  I hope to have this agreement laid before the House for its approval shortly.  It would be my intention in the event of future international agreements with other States about gas supplies, that a similar assurance would be sought.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might add that an EC Directive of 31 May 1991, on transit of natural gas through grids, ensures that Bord Gáis will be able to transport gas bought from utilities in the Community through intervening high pressure grids on fair commercial terms.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 219 and 228 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland already has a voluntary code, which deals with smoking control policies in the workplace.  It was drawn up by a Consultative Committee and is contained <Col N="527" /> in the booklet &ldquo;Clean Air at Work&rdquo;, a copy of which I will arrange to have forwarded to the Deputy.  The code which was launched in October 1992 has been widely circulated.  The Consultative Committee was representative of employers, workers and other interested parties and the code was endorsed by each group.  It will obviously be some time before the effectiveness or otherwise of the code becomes apparent.  In the meantime I am considering the need to review the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1990 with a view to increasing their effectiveness and scope.  The regulations deal with smoking in designated places such as public offices, cinemas, health premises, aircraft, trains etc.  I will, of course, bear in mind all pertinent factors, including recent legal cases, in this regard.  My primary concern is the protection of public health and the Deputy can be assured of my determination to ensure that the measures which have been introduced to reduce tobacco consumption through prohibitions/restrictions on areas in which it is permitted to smoke; the curtailment of content in advertising and restrictions on sponsorship as well as the capping of advertising and sponsorship budgets, and other measures implemented over many years will be augmented by whatever new developments I consider necessary in the interest of promoting and protecting the public health.</P>

      <P>Provisional estimates from the Revenue Commissioners suggest that tobacco yielded £529 million in Government revenue in 1992.</P>
      <P>My Department has in place a comprehensive anti-smoking strategy which includes legislative, educational and fiscal measures.  Smoking is the largest single dimensional issue on which my Department's Health Promotion Unit organises public education and health programmes.  A wide range of initiatives are currently under way.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware I recently launched a major multi-media anti-smoking campaign, targeted specifically at young people but which is designed to appeal to all age groups.  A feature of the campaign was a stop-smoking free-phone which drew an unprecedented response from the public.  This multi-media campaign will cost approximately £300,000 during 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> This media campaign is supported by a variety of more in-depth educational projects for specific target groups.  The Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Department of Education and the Irish Cancer Society, is currently pilot testing a peer-led approach to anti-smoking education among young people. Leaders chosen by young people themselves are being trained to address the issue among their peers.  This is an approach which has been showing promising results elsewhere and, if the results of the evaluation of the pilot project prove favourable, it is my intention to make the programme available nationwide. This programme will cost approximately £70,000 in 1993.</P>
    <P>In addition to these two projects, the Health Promotion Unit will also spend approximately £45,000 on the production and dissemination of anti-smoking materials during 1993.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other initiatives in which the unit is involved but, because smoking is only one of the substances of abuse dealt with, it could be very difficult to cost the anti-tobacco element in each of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>Smoking is one of the issues being addressed in a general substance abuse prevention pilot project being undertaken by the Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the Department of Education and Mater Dei Institute.  It has also been one of the themes for the annual poster competition run by the Health Promotion Unit in first and second level schools.  I am also aware that school health education programmes in several health board areas address the issue.</P>
    <P>The structure of the community-based health education programme for adults &mdash; Lifewise &mdash; makes provision for the inclusion of smoking as a topic, subject to the demands of course participants.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the very important role that health professionals such as doctors, nurses and dentists can play in encouraging people to refrain from smoking and supporting them in their efforts to do so. For that reason my Department's Health <Col N="532" /> Promotion Unit, with the support of the Europe against Cancer Programme, developed a manual and associated materials to assist health professionals in this task.  These materials have been very widely disseminated among GPs and dentists and, on a pilot basis, among groups of public health nurses.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that parents' attitudes and behaviour are among the important influences on young people's smoking. For this reason my Department's Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Southern Health Board, has initiated a substance abuse education programme for parents in the Cork area which, <i>inter alia,</i> addresses the issue of tobacco use.</P>
    <P>While information and education constitute an integral component of an anti-tobacco strategy, I consider that such efforts must be supplemented by an environment that discourages smoking. My Department has an extensive body of anti-tobacco legislation in place &mdash; some of which has been used as a model by the European Commission in framing its anti-tobacco directives.  The most recent piece of legislation &mdash; the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection Act) 1988 &mdash; prohibits and restricts smoking in designated public places.  Last year my Department sought to extend protection against smoking to workers generally by means of a Voluntary Code of Practice against Smoking in the Workplace. This code has been widely disseminated by the Health Promotion Unit in a booklet entitled &ldquo;Clean Air at Work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My Department has also pursued with the Department of Finance a strategy of ensuring, through budgetary measures, that the real price of cigarettes is at least maintained.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can rest assured that it is my intention that, subject to the competing demands for health education on other important health issues, every opportunity will be taken to discourage smoking in our community.</P>

      <P>According to the World Health Organisation, current trends in smoking-related deaths in women suggest that at least one in four women who smoke, will die from smoking-related diseases.  Recent estimates suggest that over 2,500 women die in Ireland annually from smoking-related diseases.</P>
      <P>My Department has had in place for some time now a comprehensive anti-smoking strategy which includes legislative, educational and fiscal measures aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking. The percentage of those over fifteen years who smoke has decreased from 43 per cent in the early 1970s to 30 per cent now. This represents a decrease from 49 per cent to 30 per cent among men and from 37 per cent to 30 per cent among women. The fact that the rate of decrease has been slower among women &mdash; a phenomenon not peculiar to Ireland &mdash; has led us in recent years to place particular emphasis in our information/educational campaigns on smoking among women. In conjunction with the Council for the Status of Women my Department's Health Promotion Unit developed materials to highlight the unaesthetic effects of smoking.  This message was targeted at young women in particular.  The Health Promotion Unit also developed materials to draw attention to the fact that, if a pregnant woman smokes, her unborn baby smokes too.  The Unit also provided support to the Council for the Status of Women to organise a seminar on the theme of young women and smoking.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also that I recently launched a major multi-media anti-smoking campaign targeted at young people, particularly young women.</P>

      <P>The present position in this country is that the advertising of tobacco products is confined to printed publications intended primarily for persons over 18 years of age and within sales outlets.  There are strict restrictions of advertising content and alternating health warnings on cigarette packets are compulsory.</P>
      <P>The European Commission proposed a total ban on advertising of tobacco products, except within specialist tobacco sales outlets, in May 1991.</P>
      <P>In discussions which have taken place at the Health Council my predecessors have consistently supported the principle of a Community ban.  I am fully in agreement with this approach and will be speaking in support of the Commission's proposal at the next Health Council in May.</P>
      <P>Ireland is particularly vulnerable to overspill advertising and I consider that a European Community ban is necessary to achieve the effective removal of tobacco advertisements here.  I am not convinced that a total national ban would in itself be sufficient.  Therefore I have no immediate plans to introduce further measures in this country.</P>

      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> is the first official report to recommend comprehensive measures relating to the provision of respite places for the elderly.  The report emphasised the importance of additional day care places and respite facilities to offer carers a break from caring during the day or for short and regular periods of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>The Years Ahead</i> has been accepted by the Government as policy towards the elderly.  During the last three years the Government has made an additional £9 million available to implement the recommendations of the report dealing with the expansion of home nursing and home help services and of facilities for the elderly in the community.  The funds have enabled health boards to recruit additional public health nurses, general nurses working in the community, home helps and home care attendants.  They have been able to provide additional day care centres, respite places and extended care beds.  Each health board provides respite services and my Department will continue to encourage boards to extend <Col N="536" /> these facilities.  At present the North-Eastern Health Board provides 16 respite beds for the elderly in County Meath in the County Infirmary, Navan.</P>
    <P>Respite services for people with mental handicap in the Meath area are provided by the Sisters of Jesus and Mary, Delvin, County Westmeath and by the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, Drumcar, County Louth.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, funding was made available in the budget to improve services for people with mental handicap. The North-Eastern Health Board region has been allocated £552,000 for the development of services for people with mental handicap, including respite services. The manner in which these services are to be provided will be agreed by the North-Eastern Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee which is representative of the health board, voluntary agencies and parents.</P>
    <P>Funding is also being made available for the development of services for people with physical or sensory disability. This will facilitate the expansion of community-based services including respite care facilities.  The actual services to be provided will be a matter for the NEHB.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>The State incurs expenditure on drugs through allocations to hospitals, expenditure on the community drug schemes and the provision of drugs on the general medical services scheme.  The varied nature of this expenditure means that detailed information down to individual drug level is not available in respect of all areas of the State's activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> Information to this level of detail is available, however, in relation to the general medical services scheme which accounts for approximately two thirds of total State expenditure on drugs and medicines.  In 1992, expenditure on branded drugs in the scheme amounted to £95.5 million and expenditure on generic drugs in the scheme amounted to £9.8 million.</P>
    <P>An analysis of all GMS prescribing during 1991 which was carried out by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board indicated that, if on all possible occasions the cheapest available generic product had been prescribed and dispensed, savings of £6.3 million would have been realised in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The present agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation envisages that a saving of £12.5 million on drugs expenditure will be achieved in the current year by doctors prescribing more economically.</P>

      <P>No proposals have been received by my Department for the provision of an athletic track and regional athletic centre for County Sligo.</P>
      <P>Under a scheme approved by Government, grants have been allocated from the proceeds of the national lottery for the provision of regional and local sports centres at specified locations throughout the country, including £1.2 million for the Sligo swimming pool project.
