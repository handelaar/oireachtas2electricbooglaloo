      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton.  I call on Deputy Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it is expendient that the Dáil adjourn under Standing Order 30 to debate a motion regretting the Tánaiste's failure to answer questions posed in the Dáil last night as to the exact extent of circulation of the leaked Department of Foreign Affairs document and as to whether this circulation was confined to persons who had signed the Official Secrets Act, recalling that the Tánaiste, other Ministers and other informal advisers who may not have signed the Official Secrets Act are not subject to any sanctions under it, and resolving that the Garda Commissioner be requested formally to investigate this matter by the Cabinet with absolute independence and a requirement to report directly to the Taoiseach on his findings.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9 and 1.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1), business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today; (2) the proceedings on the resumed debate on the Second Stage of No. 9, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.15 a.m.; (3) on the conclusion of the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 9, the sitting shall be suspended until 2.30 p.m.; (4) the Select Committee on Legislation and Security shall meet in the Dáil Chamber at 11.30 a.m. to consider the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Equality and Law Reform and shall adjourn not later than 2.20 p.m.</P>

      <P>It is apparent from today's Order of Business that the Government has no business to transact in the Dáil even though I have a book full of promised legislation on matters such as the confiscation of the assets of criminals, the dealing in laundering of illegal gains by criminal elements and so forth.  The Dáil will effectively adjourn at 11.15 a.m. because this Government cannot produce legislation for us to deal with in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, business before the Dáil.  We said we would comply in so far as possible to have Bills with the Opposition two weeks in advance.  If Deputy Bruton is serious about Dáil business, he knows there is business that can be and will be taken but he does not want to give us the cooperations we require in the House.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate, of the 32 Bills promised, 24 of which still have to be published, how many he expects will be published, this side of the recess?  Will we be faced in the next two to three weeks with the Government trying to ram through many Bills which they have not yet brought forward to this House by way of guillotine?  Can we have an assurance that today is not a prelude to exceptionally late sittings and guillotines being used to ram through Bills which have not been given adequate thought?</P>

The latest information I have is that at least 27 Bills will be published and that there are areas in the other Bills about which there is uncertainty.  Full details of this will be given to the party Whips today which will show that more Bills have been produced and published <Col N="573" /> in this session than in any other session in the history of this State.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that we do not have any serious business in terms of new legislation with which to deal today.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill is more or less finished as the Minister is concluding his Second Stage speech and the Dáil, for convenience, is adjourning to allow the committee to look at other legislation.  We are dragging in an amendment from the Seanad to fill in the latter half of the day after Question Time which is not a serious way of doing business.  Of the 27 Bills the Taoiseach expects to be published by the end of the year, how many does he expect will be dealt with by this House before the end of the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The contributions of Deputies yesterday were wide-ranging and apposite and it was particularly interesting that so many of the Deputies who spoke represented coastal areas.  It showed deep involvement by the Deputies with constituents in the fishing industry throughout the country.  There was a genuine desire to deal with this problem which has proved so intractable. I am happy that the Government has agreed to a special scheme to deal with the problems of share fishermen and I will try to answer all the points raised in the limited time available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> Deputy Coughlan raised the issue of the 12 months disability benefit and what would happen after that.  If people in that position do not have any other contributions they can apply for supplementary welfare allowance until they requalify for disability benefit.  The 13 week limit for unemployment benefit will assist fishermen as the cost of the benefits will exceed considerably the income likely to arise from them.  Nevertheless, in the interest of solidarity, to which a number of Deputies referred, the Government agreed to make those provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan and others were concerned about accidents on boats.  I will consider that matter although to make provision in that regard would involve considerable cost.  Deputy Doyle suggested a roll-over arrangement into the following year in respect of the 13 week limit for entitlement to benefit and I will consider that possibility.  In some years boats are not tied up as long as in others and we will consider the possibility of making provision over a three year period in that regard.  The matter can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan also raised the question of reducing the time span from now until 1 January 1996, when share fishermen will receive benefit.  Some of those fishermen may have paid up contributions which will allow them to receive benefit earlier.  Deputies Doyle, Allen and others wanted the date brought forward but, again, that would involve considerable costs.  However, I will examine the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an exceptional case, we are talking about only 2,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an exceptional case, but the money might not be available.  It would also set a precedent and that is a major problem for my Department in respect of social welfare matters.  Some Deputies raised the matter of the precedent for back payment in respect of some contributions and that can also be considered in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the Court <Col N="579" /> cases since 1986 and that she has been endeavouring to come up with a solution to the problem for the past four years.  I will consider the roll-over concept which she suggested.  She made comparisons with the UK, but such comparisons always pose problems for us because there is a large number of contributions in the UK which provides them with more scope and resources for introducing special schemes.  Our scheme relates to our system and is workable.  I had discussions with fishermen and they would be happy to accept a scheme along those lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell is concerned about the method of assessment for unemployment assistance.  He has taken a great interest in social welfare matters for many years and usually deals with the finer points. From time to time assessment for unemployment assistance poses problems for people classified as self-employed.  We will examine that matter in future but, again, it would involve modifying and controlling the system.  Improvement in the management and control of the system puts an onus on the Minister and his officials to use more flexible arrangements to provide a better service.  There is always a danger that improving the management and control of the system will allow people to sit back and relax because the finances are under better control and one can be sure of what is happening.  Such improved technology and management puts an onus on us to consider the needs of our customers and serve them in a better way.  I will reconsider the method of assessment for unemployment assistance to the self-employed to see if it can be done in a more meaningful way for people who barely make ends meet in self-employment.  In many cases self-employed people are under-employed. We are inclined to believe that they are well off and earn high incomes but the majority of them earn very low incomes.  Deputies Doyle and Coughlan made that point yesterday in respect of share fishermen whose average incomes are between £6,000 and £8,000.  That is why I am anxious to provide benefits for <Col N="580" /> the self-employed, the majority of them need the support we have provided by way of pensions, especially the windows' and orphans' pension.  I am conscious of the needs of the self-employed and will examine them.  Deputy Bell referred to the difficulty in making payments and suggested a fixed monthly premium and a simple and workable method of payment. I will bear those comments in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan, who has a well known interest in ports and fishermen, welcomed the Bill and made many comments on it.  He highlighted the fact that the first day for payment of benefits will be 1 January 1996, the day when the Spanish and Portuguese will be allowed greater access to our waters.  He is correct in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our fishermen will be claiming unemployment benefit then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for the Marine will consider the matter before then.  Deputy Bell stated that fishermen have been in limbo since the court cases but that he is happy with the arrangements.  However, he finds it difficult to understand why a skipper of a boat cannot be boss, but that matter was covered in the court decision within which we must work.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out that this was the third social welfare Bill this year.  The first of these was introduced after the budget which, in addition to the budgetary provisions, also dealt with many other issues.  This was followed by the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act and now by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the officials in my Department who do the bulk of the work with the support of the parliamentary draftsman's office and the Attorney General's office.  As ordinary civil servants, if there is such a thing, who specialise in this area, they have set high standards when it comes to the preparation of legislation.  This means that in conjunction with the parliamentary <Col N="581" /> draftman's office we are efficient in the preparation of legislation.  I assure the House that the parliamentary draftsman's office is particularly pleased with the service provided by my Department because this allows it in turn to offer advice and do its work effectively and quickly making few errors in the process. As this legislation is complex it is easy to make errors.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue also raised the issue of appeals.  In this regard he mentioned in particular clothing manufacturers and highlighted the difficulties caused by the increase in VAT.  He welcomed the fact that consideration was being given to the possibility of restructuring the PRSI system.  However, he was concerned about the delays in dealing with appeals.  In this regard I recently appointed two extra staff to the appeals office &mdash; the figures show that the position has improved &mdash; and established a decisions advisory office which is headed by a senior appeals officer to try to improve the quality of decisions.  We have delegated authority to officers to make decisions &mdash; deciding officers &mdash; and it is their decisions that are appealed. Through this office we hope to improve the quality of decision and, consequently, reduce the number of appeals.  In certain instances it is difficult for officials to make decisions as the position may not be clear. Very often this is not clarified until a decision is appealed.  With better information and advice it should be possible to clarify the position sooner and thereby reduce the number of appeals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen said that the position in the fishing industry was unpredictable and sought the introduction of regular payments to facilitate those engaged in share fishing to make it worth their while to work.  He also felt much progress had been made in dealing with the issues of fraud and abuse and welcomed the moved being made in relation to PRSI to encourage people to take up employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk raised the issues of importance to fishermen on the east coast, particularly in the Drogheda area while Deputy McGinley, who is well aware of the position in the fishing industry <Col N="582" /> in County Donegal, expressed concern about the difficulties facing fishermen there.  He asked me to meet with the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation. I recognise the contribution made by that organisation and I am anxious to meet with them.  We had hoped to meet at the beginning of this week but this proved inconvenient for the fishermen because they had business to attend to in Europe.  We are due to meet on Wednesday next, 1 December. The Deputy also expressed concern at the fact that disability benefit will be payable for a limited period only and would like to see it paid sooner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally pointed out that, so far as he was aware, there were no millionaire fishermen in County Waterford. Indeed, Deputies pointed out that there were no millionaire fishermen in any of the coastal districts.  Like Deputies McGinley, McCormack, Byrne and Doyle, the Deputy sought support for the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne expressed concern about the figures of 13 weeks and 12 months and wondered what would happen once the period of 12 months expired.  In particular he raised the issues of accidents and occupational injuries. Deputy Ó Cuív also raised these issues.</P>
    <P>It can be seen therefore that one of the main themes running through the contributions of Deputies is the need to make provision for occupational injuries. Again, we are talking about money. However, I will give this matter some attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen spoke about those who occasionally work and run into difficulties with my Department when they fail to declare the income earned.  At my clinic yesterday &mdash; as Deputies are aware, I have a clinic each morning &mdash; I met one such gentleman who is a plumber by profession and managed to get some work.  He found himself in the position described by Deputy Allen.  We have to find a better way of dealing with these people given that they are under-employed and can get some work.  In addition, they are not aware of all the opportunities available.  Given that they <Col N="583" /> are self-employed they could avail of the back to work allowance for a period of up to two years during which rates of 75 per cent and 50 per cent would be payable. They would be allowed to retain their benefits.  That scheme would present them with a good opportunity to make a start.  Deputy De Rossa also touched on this issue.</P>
    <P>The point is that there is a mechanism in place under which unemployed people can do occasional work and continue to claim their unemployment benefit.  I introduced this provision in this year's Social Welfare Bill.  I took regulatory powers in the 1993 Act under which unemployed people who do occasional work can earn the equivalent of their daily rate of unemployment assistance plus £15 in respect of each day worked and still qualify for the full rate of assistance for the remaining days of the week on which they are unemployed.  For example, an unemployed person with a dependent spouse and three children can earn up to £37 for each day worked without affecting his or her entitlement to unemployment assistance for other days of unemployment in that week.</P>
    <P>In recent years I made every effort to make information available.  I sat down with officials of my Department around the country and told them that people are not aware of the schemes available. When we introduce new provisions we forward fact sheets to Deputies and Senators but it takes effort to get this information to the people who need it. We are putting job facilitators into the main offices so that people may discuss their problems, just as is done in TDs' clinics.  Generally people in social welfare offices are under too much pressure and there is always somebody else waiting. People need time to short out their problems. This new system is functioning now and much effort is being put into getting information to people individually.</P>
    <P>There are probably other ways of treating people who are really under-employed rather than unemployed. Recently a councillor from my party complained to me about people working and <Col N="584" /> drawing the dole.  I had the cases investigated, about 20 in all, and what was going on in every case was legitimate but, because people see a person working one day and drawing the dole another day, they think something crooked is going on.  That is not the case and people in lofty positions, such as the Governor of the Central Bank, should understand that.  They look for flexibility and as we become flexible things will look different. It is necessary to tackle the problem of the under-employed and that was emphasised by Deputy Allen, Deputy De Rossa and others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is complicated because when a person goes on disability benefit, having been on unemployment assistance, the whole household income changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often it is not.  If the other person in the household is earning, the person in receipt of benefit gets it at a lower rate.  However, I noted the point made by the Deputy and I will look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishermen sometimes get into debt to moneylenders because of their situation.  The Minister has introduced pilot schemes, but when will we see the Credit Control Bill?  This is important in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Like Deputy Allen, I am conscious of the problems. The different elements, banks, credit unions and community welfare officers etc., must be brought together.  This has been done in Cork in a very sophisticated way and great credit is due to the people involved.  That system now operates in a number of areas.  It is particularly important that people get support at Christmas time.  The Credit Control Bill is complex <Col N="585" /> and includes many elements.  It will probably be published before Christmas.</P>
      <P>I want to reply to a point raised by Deputy De Rossa.  As part of the normal Government procedures for the award of public sector contracts the contractor is required to obtain a tax clearance certificate from time the Revenue Commissioners. To obtain this certificate all payments due by the contractor in respect of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and corporate taxes must be up to date.  These procedures will continue to be strictly enforced.  This is particularly important in view of the substantial number of contracts to be awarded over the next few years as part of the very significant investments under the <i>National Development Plan.</i> This will ensure that contracts are only given to bona fide and legitimate contractors whose tax and PRSI affairs are in order.</P>
      <P>Having a tax clearance certificate means that the contractor's tax and PRSI affairs are in order at the stage at which the contract is awarded.  However, it is important to ensure that the contractor continues to meet his obligations under tax and social welfare codes.  My inspectors will be particularly vigilant in this area.  I assure the House that all public sector contracts will be inspected on an ongoing basis for the duration of the contract. Any employers who fail to meet their obligations will be strictly dealt with under the income tax and social welfare Acts.  In this context arrangements are being made to have my Department notified of all sizeable contracts awarded, particularly in the case of investments under the <i>National Development Plan.</i></P>
      <P>I am issuing a clear warning at this stage because the Government is about to issue huge contracts over the next few years under the Structural Funds.  We will crack down very hard on public sector contracts and others to ensure that they comply with the wishes of this House.</P>

      <P>The company referred to by the Deputy was registered in Ireland on 13 September 1993.  An occasional trading licence for the sale of furniture was issued to the company by the Department of <Col N="587" /> Enterprise and Employment.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they are not aware of any alleged criminal activity by this company.  If the Deputy or any other person has information relating to any such activity, it should be brought to the attention of the Garda so that the matter can be investigated.</P>
      <P>I would add that as I entered the House I became aware of a story which, as Deputy Mitchell probably knows, made front page headlines in one of this evening's papers in which the information is different from that which I have given.  Lest Deputy Mitchell or somebody else accuse me of misleading the House, I wish to state that the information I have given is based on Garda information given to me at 4.25 p.m. yesterday.  That information has not been corrected or changed in any way in the meantime despite the fact that inquiries were made by my office.  Before I left my office I ordered an immediate inquiry with the Garda Commissioner's office to ascertain the true and factual position.</P>

      <Quest>the present strength of the Garda Síochána; the way in which the present membership compares with the figures for 1986 and 1989; and the estimated strength of the force at the end of 1994, allowing for retirements and new recruits.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 45 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to deal with the very serious issues raised by the seven Deputies who have tabled these questions, by way of a brief response.  Therefore, I hope that the House will bear with me while I make some observations which I believe are highly relevant in looking at the question of Garda numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is that it is a mistake to <Col N="590" /> believe that the only figure to be considered in comparing Garda capacity to deal with crime, at one period in time as against another, is the total strength of the force at the relevant times.  What is at least as important as the overall strength figure is how the force is actually deployed and used.  I am sure Deputies will have no difficulty in agreeing with this.  The improvement of actual operational capacity, which is the issue that concerns the public, is an ongoing priority for Garda management and there have been some quite significant developments on this front in recent times.  I might mention, by way of example, the release of gardaí for operational duties by means of greatly increased use of civilian employees and the establishment of various specialist units within the force to tackle serious crime &mdash; the highly successful Cobra unit to deal with bank raids is a case in point.</P>
    <P>The second point, which is I suppose the other side of the same coin, is that it does not follow that improved operational capacity is guaranteed by increasing Garda numbers.  There is simply no basis for suggesting that the kidnapping to which Deputy Mitchell refers and the shootings that have taken place might have been prevented if the force happened to be at its authorised strength when these crimes took place.  I know that Deputy Mitchell and others means well but, on the basis of the best professional advice available to me, I cannot pretend that the answer to these problems lies simply in throwing resources in the form of more and more manpower at the problem.  I have already expressed my abhorrence over the recent kidnapping.  I have been in constant contact with the Garda authorities about it.  I am informed that no stone is being left unturned to find the culprits and that there are no resource problems getting in the way of progress.  The same is true of the other serious crimes mentioned.</P>
    <P>I fully accept, of course, that while crime fighting capacity is not necessarily increased by adding more and more manpower resources, it is not right either to suggest that the maintenance of overall <Col N="591" /> Garda numbers is an issue of secondary importance.  The maintenance of manpower levels is of course a matter of great importance and I want to talk now about the actual position in relation to total Garda strength.</P>
    <P>Before the new training procedure came into force, after 1989, the practice was to include all garda trainees in the numbers.  Now, with a two year training period, the view is that it might be misleading to include all garda trainees in the overall figures of Garda strength.  On that basis, therefore, the present strength of the force is 10,878 which figure does not include 453 recruits who have not yet been attested to the force and are still in phases I to III of the training programme. The strength of the force in December 1986 was 11,382, which figure included 144 recruits in training.  It is worth mentioning that the number of gardaí in December 1989 was 10,472, with 340 further recruits in phases I to III of the training programme.</P>
    <P>The projected figure for Garda strength at the end of 1994 is 10,908, with around 400 further non-attested gardaí in training.  That figure is based on the continuation of recruitment at present levels and current projections of wastage. However, I shall return to the subject of recruitment levels and my plans in that regard.</P>
    <P>First, I wish to deal with two specific points, the supposed postponement of Garda recruiting and the number of community gardaí.  I want to refute the suggestion that the intake of recruits has been postponed.  As Deputies will be aware, 1,000 gardaí are in the process of being recruited over the four years 1992 to 1995.  A total of 324 recruits have been taken on this year as compared with 269 in 1992.  The fourth and final intake of 30 recruits took place on 15 November last.</P>
    <P>The number of community gardaí has been increasing at a steady rate.  There are now 214 members employed on these duties as compared with 200 at the beginning of the year in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The Garda Commissioner and I agree totally on the <Col N="592" /> need to increase these numbers further and the necessary steps will be taken to achieve this key objective of modern policing policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, and I believe most importantly, I want to make it known to the House that in view of the priority which both I and the Government attach to the problem of crime in our society, allied to the law and order situation generally, I am in the process of submitting detailed proposals to the Government for a package of measures ranging right across my Department's areas of responsibility aimed at dealing with the general crime situation.  The measures are in the Garda, prisons and courts areas and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement on the matter within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>In drawing up my proposals, I have paid particular attention to the commitments in the Programme for Government in all of these areas, as well as proposals in the Garda Commissioner's corporate strategy document submitted to me earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Specifically, with regard to the subject matter of these questions, the important elements are those dealing with accelerated recruitment of gardaí, as well as increased civilisation to release more members of the force for operational law enforcement duties.  My proposals for Garda recruitment will be contained in this comprehensive package.</P>

      <P>How many times are we to be told about the Minister's plans and proposals?  When will we see action? Is it not a fact that during the week the family of a businessman was kidnapped the Minister postponed an intake of Garda recruits from 15 November until February next year?  The Garda force is approximately 500 less than its authorised strength.  The Minister's priority should be to increase the Garda force to its authorised strength so that people can at least see the necessary manpower on the streets to deal with the rampant crime problem.</P>

      <P>I regret that <Col N="593" /> Deputy Mitchell did not listen carefully to my reply.  With regard to the recruitment programme for this year, the fourth and final intake was for 30 recruits.  The recruitment was due to take place on 15 November and it took place on that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the number of gardaí retiring and leaving the force is now greater than the number of recruits?  Will she confirm that the number of gardaí who left the force this year was approximately 450, which is considerably in excess of the number recruited for training?  Will the Minister comment on the prediction in the current issue of <i>Garda News</i> that if the present recruitment policy is continued the strength of the force will be as low as 10,600 by 1996, its lowest level for a very long time?  It is unacceptable that there should be such a reduction in the strength of the Garda at a time when the crime rate is rising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have figures on the number of gardaí who have retired but I have no reason to doubt the figures given by Deputy Gilmore.  The present level of Garda recruitment has been a source of concern to the Garda authorities and the Garda representative associations.  When I met representatives of these associations after I became Minister for Justice I referred them to a commitment in the Programme for Government, a commitment to which I am totally committed.  I will be announcing proposals in this regard before the end of this year.  As the Deputy correctly stated, it would be most unsatisfactory if the level of recruitment was maintained at its present level.  I am not prepared to continue with this level of recruitment; I want to accelerate recruitment.  The Deputy will have my proposals in this regard before the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that a serious kidnapping took place recently in Dublin, a man was murdered at a Hallowe'en bonfire, people are being shot in the legs and knee-capped, drugs are being sold openly on the streets and the <Col N="594" /> provision of ramps and the installation of car alarms have become the order of the day, can the Minister say why the Garda strength is 500 below the authorised level?  I am not talking about the additional gardaí who might be necessary in the circumstances; I am asking why the strength of the Garda has not been brought up to its authorised level.  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the Garda strength will be brought up to its authorised level and will not be let fall below that level again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to again assure the House that the Garda strength will be brought up to the level recommended by the Garda Commissioner, Garda authorities and Garda associations.  People are making a mistake when they say that the number of gardaí is much lower than it was some years ago.  One has to look at the deployment of gardaí and take into account the fact that 700 gardaí who were previously employed on office duties in stations are now deployed on the streets in maintaining law and order.  It is not correct to make a comparison between past and present figures.  If one is to be rational about this matter, one has to look at the way in which members of the force are now deployed.  Both the Commissioner and I &mdash; this point has been repeatedly stressed by Deputies in the House &mdash; want to ensure that gardaí are available at times of greatest need. In tandem with this policy, I am announcing an accelerated recruitment programme which will bring the strength of the Garda force back up to the level which both the Commissioner and I believe is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the comprehensive list of figures read out by the Minister, I find it extraordinary that she does not have any figures on the levels of wastage and retirement within the Garda.  With regard to the recruitment programme, will the Minister agree that if that programme was to proceed apace for 1995 the advertisements for Garda recruits should have been placed in the <Col N="595" /> newspapers?  The accelerated recruitment campaign to which she referred should have commenced and the recruitment process should have started.  Is it not the case that that recruitment process has been delayed on instructions from the Department of Finance and there has been an about turn by the Government on the recruitment programme about which we heard so much over the past few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No direction has been issued by the Department of Finance to stop, reduce or decelerate the recruitment programme.  One does not have to place advertisements in newspapers for an accelerated recruitment programme.  As I tried to explain in my initial reply &mdash; perhaps I failed to do so &mdash; the programme begun a few years ago, and for which examinations were held, was for the recruitment of 1,000 gardaí up to the end of 1995.  I said I proposed, with the support of the Government, which I have got, to telescope that recruitment up to the end of 1994, thus bringing the date forward one year.  No new recruitment programme is needed to do this.  However, a new recruitment programme will be required next year for the following years, and that programme will be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 22 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of public comment on the subject of sex offending.  The concern which gives rise to this debate is understandable.  Some themes which keep coming through in relation to the treatment of sex offenders, however, are, I believe, based on error and I want to comment particularly on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we must obviously do everything possible to encourage sex offenders in custody to mend their ways, it would be quite wrong to give the impression that treatment programmes represent some sort of panacea.  All experience and the best professional advice indicate that the <Col N="598" /> following propositions are true: first, sex treatment programmes must be voluntary &mdash; a compulsory treatment programme is a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>Second, the international experience in this respect is that only a small percentage of sex offenders, perhaps as low as 20 per cent have a prospect of benefiting from treatment programmes.  No treatments that are known and acceptable are likely to succeed in changing the behaviour of a great many of these offenders.  This has important policy implications in terms of education, custodial provision, and so on.  It is clearly necessary to bear in mind that the whole question of sex offending and of treatment raises issues well outside the prisons context.  The law and order system intervenes when the tragedy has already occurred.  We need to know more about causative factors and about preventative possibilities.  The very positive developments in the education field in this regard are of great importance.  It is especially important that people who are rightly concerned about the problem should understand that treatment for offenders inevitably comes late in the day and that it has substantial limitations.</P>
    <P>The third point is that there is no advantage in rushing a treatment programme for sex offenders into operation and sacrificing quality for speed.  It is worth taking the time necessary to study the options because no single approach is guaranteed to provide sure fire results.</P>
    <P>As to the specific issues raised by the Deputies, there are approximately 200 offenders serving sentences for sex-related offences &mdash; in other words, the figure now amounts to about 10 per cent of the prison population.</P>
    <P>Sex offenders have access to a wide range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services in the prisons.  One of the primary objectives of the prison system is to provide prisoners, including sex offenders, with such help, guidance, counselling, education and training as will enable them to live a constructive law abiding life in the community on release.  This rehabilitative objective is extremely difficult to realise <Col N="599" /> in practice, but I believe that we should never cease trying to achieve it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of a more specific treatment programme for sex offenders, I have endorsed the work of a special group in my Department which carried out a detailed study of possibilities.  The group was asked to advise whether there may be available a programme or programmes of treatment which will be practicable, deliverable, sustainable and susceptible to proper evaluation at all stages and which will be effective and cost efficient.  The group published its report last July.  I have accepted its recommended approach and commenced the process of putting it in place.</P>
    <P>I have appointed a special steering group within the Department to direct the delivery of the programme.  Two programme leaders have been appointed &mdash; one senior clinical psychologist and one senior probation and welfare officer.  An extra psychologist has been recruited to my Department to facilitate this arrangement. Arbour Hill Prison, in which the programme will operate, must be fully supportive and all staff there will be given a special course to prepare them for the programme.  An information leaflet for offenders has been prepared and given to prisoners in Arbour Hill to make them aware of what is proposed and this will be followed up with a series of explanatory talks.</P>
    <P>The research and groundwork have commenced, the resources have been allocated and it is the intention to commence delivery of the therapy next spring when the support systems and training are in place.</P>
    <P>What is proposed has the best prospects of achieving optimum results with sex offenders.  A great deal will depend on the commitment put into it and on the determination to devote sufficient resources, including adequate research facilities, to it.  I am confident that it will be at least as successful as any equivalent programme being pursued elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="600" /> her comprehensive and positive response to a very important question.  In relation to the Minister's comment that approximately 20 per cent of paedophiles in particular respond to treatment which, of necessity, must be voluntary, is it not important when a judge is deciding a sentence for a sex offender that psychiatric evidence is given as to the likelihood of that rapist or paedophile reoffending? This is taken into account by judges when deciding whether to impose a determinate or life sentence.  Is psychiatric evidence provided in relation to whether the particular sex offender will reoffend?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no written rule or regulation that the judge is obliged to request such evidence but my understanding is that in a great number of cases the presiding judge requests it.  That practice should be encouraged and, in answer to a further question tabled to me, I may be able to indicate certain changes in relation to the Judiciary generally in this whole area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the Arbour Hill pilot scheme abolished in 1991?  Why was that scheme, which was very successful and which worked quite well, not developed further?  Will the Minister confirm that in regard to any representations she receives for the release of sex offenders, she will take the advice of the probation and welfare service within her Department before she authorises such releases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is yes.  In relation to the first part of the question, the pilot programme in Arbour Hill was just that, a pilot programme.  It worked on the basis of the ideas of people in the probation and welfare service and in the psychology and psychiatry services attached to the prisons.  It worked successfully for a period of time and then came up for evaluation.  As a result, having consulted a number of groups who had concerns in this area and taking cognisance of the views of Members of this House, I set up a group who subsequently <Col N="601" /> made recommendations which I accepted.</P>
      <P>We now have the steering group which is responsible for the delivery of the proposed service and it is important to ensure we do not sacrifice quality for speed.  It would be easy to put a programme in place tomorrow morning but there would be no guarantee it would be the correct programme.  The level of training necessary for the prison staff, the level of necessary support from prisoners and the appointment and training of additional staff is very important if we are to put in place a programme that will be at least as good as programmes available in institutions such as Arbour Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Minister.  First, if the Minister is saying that only 20 per cent of sex offenders are likely to benefit from therapy, is she saying 80 per cent are beyond rehabilitation and likely to commit the same or similar offences again, given the same circumstances, when released? Second, in relation to the programme which, thankfully, will begin in the spring of 1994, what is the assumption about participation in that programme?  For example, is it assumed that a particular percentage of sex offenders will participate in that programme, or that all of them will participate, and on what basis has the level of resourcing for that programme been struck?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of resourcing will be based on the maximum number of sex offenders, in other words, that all of them would participate. However, as I said at the beginning &mdash; and I think Deputy O'Donnell in particular accepted &mdash; it would have to be a voluntary treatment programme, anything else would be a contradiction in terms.  Therefore, there is no way in which we can say to each sex offender that he must participate in the programme. Leaflets have been prepared and given to each sex offender in custody. In addition, that will be followed up by a <Col N="602" /> number of preparatory talks with prisoners to explain to them what would be involved in the kind of treatment programme we intend putting in place.  With the special training of staff in prisons we hope they will be able to positively advise prisoners-offenders to participate in the programme &mdash; on a voluntary basis.  I should say that the figure of 20 per cent has been taken from statistics available worldwide.  That appears to be the level of success of programmes such as the one we are putting in place in Arbour Hill. Of course, that does not mean the remaining 80 per cent will reoffend immediately, or in the future, but neither can we say that the 80 per cent will not do that.  What we are saying simply is that a treatment programme, such as that we are putting in place in Arbour Hill, has already been in operation in a number of countries worldwide.  Most particularly the pioneering work on this is undertaken in Vermont in the United States and in a number of custodial places in Canada, in particular, where the experience has been as I explained. Apart from that I hope &mdash; as I am sure most Members do &mdash; that all sex offenders will take part in that treatment programme and that it will be highly successful. Perhaps the percentages here will be better at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there is such a high propensity among sex abusers and paedophiles to reoffend, will she agree that a life sentence would be more appropriate rather than a determinate sentence in that, in cases where a life sentence is imposed, the State will have control over that offender for a longer period rather than a determined one, ensuring that a prisoner would be released only when the Minister or his or her advisers considered they were no longer a danger to society?</P>

      <P>It may well be that a life sentence might be more appropriate in certain cases than a determined one for a set number of years but, as Deputy O'Donnell knows, it is a matter for the judge of the court to take a decision.  The Law Reform Commission <Col N="603" /> will incorporate in its report a number of suggestions in relation to changes in the law in regard to sentencing policy.  I very much look forward to receipt of that report because the recommendations will need to be incorporated in our laws as soon as possible.  Certainly I am determined to do so.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is appropriate at this stage to say that quite an amount of focus and public attention has been devoted to the question of judicial training in recent months, particularly arising from a number of high profile cases which raised issues of concern in the public mind. While it is not appropriate for me to comment on any specific case I should say that, as a result of that public comment, I sought and received funding from the Department of Finance for the specific purpose of judicial training.  I have made that funding available to the Chief Justice, who responded in a very positive way.  I understand that he, with all the judges, will be taking certain initiatives in the not too distant future in relation to that overall area, which I welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 7, 68 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the decision to move the Louth/Meath Divisional Headquarters from Drogheda to Dundalk in May 1989 was taken for Garda operational reasons and was not connected in any way with an agreement at the Anglo-Irish Conference as suggested by the Deputy.  The decision to transfer the Divisional Headquarters to Dundalk involved the relocation of one chief superintendent and three other members who were engaged in administrative duties at Drogheda.  This has not led to a reduction in operational policing services provided in the Drogheda area.</P>
      <P>In fact a number of sections which would normally be attached to a Divisional Headquarters continue to be based at Drogheda station, including the special traffic corps, PSV section, crime prevention unit and the radio technicians.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are aware that there has been an increase in the crime level in the Drogheda area in recent years but they do not consider that this is related to the location of the Divisional Headquarters and have no plans to move the Divisional Headquarters back to Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are taking a number of steps to deal with the crime problem in Drogheda and throughout the division.  This includes the deployment of <Col N="605" /> more gardaí in the division to the areas which have the greatest need.  A special unit of one sergeant and three gardaí has been established which operates as a mobile unit throughout the division, setting up checkpoints and carrying our crime prevention patrols.  These are in addition to the normal patrols carried out by the uniformed and plain clothes gardaí throughout the division.</P>
    <P>A special drugs unit was recently established within the division to combat drug related offences in the area.  This unit consists of one sergeant and seven gardaí, three of whom are based in Drogheda. The Superintendent at Drogheda has established special community projects in the Drogheda area which are concerned with the needs of the elderly, women's groups, young people and neighbourhood watch groups.  The divisional officer has also initiated a &ldquo;Crime-Time&rdquo; programme on LM/FM radio, which will be broadcast on a weekly basis.  This will increased public awareness of the fight against crime in the division and will encourage the public to assist the Garda by using the Garda confidential telephone number.</P>
    <P>Finally, an operational planning office has been established under the control of the divisional officer.  Its purpose is to monitor trends in crime throughout the division, to ensure that the most effective strategies are being used to combat crime and to ensure that the available manpower and resources are used to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>The current manpower of Drogheda Garda station is 70.  I am informed that three members were transferred from the Drogheda sub-district on promotion and that the Garda authorities intend to replace them as soon as possible in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities believe that the actions they are taking will lead to a decrease in crime in the Drogheda area and the Louth-Meath Division.  I am glad that provisional data show there has been a reduction in the overall level of crime in the Louth-Meath Division in the current year.  The Garda authorities will continue to monitor the situation closely <Col N="606" /> and will make adjustments, where necessary, in their strategies to fight crime in the Drogheda area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 8 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, despite stringent precautions, some drug abuse is taking place in Mountjoy and other prisons.  The only way to avoid such drug abuse is to prevent illegal drugs coming into the prisons. Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
      <P>In this administration we operate a fairly liberal regime for prisoners, including free association between prisoners and free and open contact on visits with families and friends.  In that situation there is a real risk that some prisoners and visitors will abuse the freedom by passing illegal drugs on visits and that, later, prisoners will abuse free association by passing drugs to one another.</P>
      <P>Where there is a real suspicion that an indentifiable prisoner or visitor is passing drugs on visits, personal contact is not permitted and they can only communicate through a special glass barrier. However, even then there remains the possibility of the prisoner receiving drugs acquired by another prisoner whose visit is not restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> Of course, it would, be possible to modify the regime for prisoners in such a way as to virtually eliminate the problem. The revised regime would have to include severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners, including strip-searches, the searching of all visitors to prisons, the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more instrusive technology.  While I accept that the drugs problem is a serious one and demands that all reasonable steps should be taken to solve it, I am not satisfied I would be justified in introducing so restrictive and inhuman a regime which would punish the innocent as well as the guilty and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families including children.  However, I have asked that the whole matter be kept under continuous review with a view to taking whatever steps are needed, short of the retrictions I mentioned, to contain the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Department of Justice know any word other than &ldquo;review&rdquo;&mdash; everything is under review? I do not want a restrictive and inhumane regime rather I want a regime that works. Is the Minister aware that there are parents who are asking that their sons be transferred from Mountjoy?  They are concerned that their sons who went into prison without a drug problem will learn their drug habit while in prison, such is the prevalence of drugs in our prisons. How are the prisons so insecure that people can abuse drugs to this extent? There are good grounds to suspect that some people learn their drugs habit while in custody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had given an indication in my reply to Deputy Mitchell of the kind of regime we would have to operate if we were to achieve what he wants in Mountjoy and other prisons.  One way of stopping it would be to restrict the freedom of access of prisoners and free association of prisoners <Col N="608" /> within the prison.  Another means of stopping it would be to strip search all prisoners after visits, including strip searching visitors because, as Deputy Mitchell is aware, there are many ways of concealing drugs on the body that would not be easily accessible without strip searching.  Also we could have far more intrusive technological surveillance. The regime we operate here should be sufficient to ensure that the level of drug abuse in our prisons could be kept under control.  In our prisons whenever the prison officers and the governor are aware that somebody is involved in the drug scene that person does not have the same free access to their visitors as other prisoners.  The type of regime that would eliminate or almost eliminate the drugs problem in our prisons would not be acceptable to anybody and would be a gross intrusion into the privacy of prisoners' and visitors' lives because it would punish the innocent as well as the guilty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be detrimental to human rights to introduce strip searching, particularly of young children, as they go to see their mothers in Mountjoy. That level of surveillance and intrusion would be necessary were such stringent measures to be introduced.  Would the Minister agree, given that when we visited the women's prison there were 27 inmates, 15 of whom were drug addicts, that it would be desirable to segregate those women who are self-confessed drug addicts, and well known to the governor of the prison, from those on remand for petty offences and who have no previous history of drugs activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the governor in Mountjoy that no efforts are spared and that prison staff, the probation and welfare service, psychology services, medical care and so on are being made available to the women prisoners who are drug dependent when they go into prison.  The purpose is to wean them off the drugs.  The difficulty &mdash; as Deputy O'Donnell will have realised <Col N="609" /> from her visit &mdash; is that most of our women prisoners, of whom we have only a small number, are in prison only for short periods.  The time necessary to put in place a rehabilitative programme with each of them is not necessarily fulfilled by the time they leave prison but no effort is spared in that regard.  It may be possible to provide the type of segregation, to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, when we build a prison unit to cater specifically for women prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that some people who do not have a drugs problem before they go to prison are introduced to drugs there?  Will the Minister indicate the extent of the monitoring of that problem?  Will she pursue the question of segregation, which is fairly common in our prison system?  There are sex offenders in Arbour Hill, terrorist offenders in Portlaoise and so on.  Will the Minister consider introducing a regime under which drug offenders or offenders who are known to have a drug problem at the time of going to prison can be segregated, or put in one prison away or in a particular wing of a prison away from those prisoners who do not have a drug problem?  Does she accept there is a need for that type of segregation in relation to drugs as has happened in the case of sex offenders and those convicted for terrorist activities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be an answer to the problem.  However, as Deputy Gilmore is aware, the policy in most prisons, as well as in Mountjoy is one of desegregation particularly of HIV positive prisoners.  The advisory group on communicable diseases made a number of recommendations in regard to drugs in prisons.  They recommended an increase in video surveillance.  That recommendation is being implemented. They also recommended prosecution of those who attempt to bring drugs into prison, in other words, visitors who supply drugs to prisoners, and disciplinary <Col N="610" /> action within the prison system against those found to be in possession of drugs. Those recommendations are being pursued vigorously by the prisons division of my Department and by prison staff. Certainly, the point put forward by Deputy Gilmore is something I can have examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Minister's civil servants write a report defending the <i>status quo</i> and she comes to the House and reads it out.  Is she aware that no Member suggested strip searching of babies or anything of the kind?  The Minister did not mention, for example, the possibility of using sniffer dogs, mental detectors, the provision of regular training for prison staff or adequate resources for the prison system. What type of strip searches would be needed to find rollers which are used to make cigarettes; burners which are used for melting down heroin, needles which are used for injecting heroin and suringes? Surely, metal detectors and so on would find those items.  When will the Minister take this problem seriously and direct that something be done about it given that there are clear indications that far from being rehabilitated some people come out of prison with a drugs problem? There is no point in trying to make me out to be a bogeyman.  What is the Minister doing to solve this problem?  She is in the driving seat.  I would thank the Minister not to come in here and read out those Civil Service replies.  This is a problem and it should be addressed by the Minister who is in charge of her Department and is accountable to this House.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy were to speak with some of my civil servants he would learn whether I am a Civil Service person.  If the Deputy is being painted as a bogeyman he is contributing to it himself.  I am certainly not on any kind of a witch hunt against Deputy Mitchell &mdash; far be it from me to go on a witch hunt against any Member.  In relation to regular training and the searching of prisoners for needles, rollers and so on, I am not well up on the equipment used <Col N="611" /> except what I am shown when I visit a prison or Garda stations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is being very unfair to the prison staff.  The prison staff are trained to look out for various signs whether equipment, such as that referred to by him, certain behaviour by the prisoners either before or immediately after a visit or during free association with other prisoners.  One would imagine from the debate between Deputy Mitchell and I that there was no searching of prisoners during their time in prison or immediately after a prison visit or that visitors were not searched.  I said in my reply that regular searches take place and that any equipment found is confiscated.  When prison staff become aware of a prisoner's involvement in drugs they do not allow free association with their visitors.</P>
      <P>Short of adopting the regime I outlined I do not think any Minister for Justice can say that tomorrow morning, or in two months time, we can have a prison system that is totally free of drugs.  If we were to achieve that we would have to put in place the regime to which I referred.  As Deputies Gilmore and O'Donnell said, that would not be acceptable in human rights or privacy terms.  Every procedure short of that regime has been put in place already and is continuously monitored by the prison staff.  There are searches of all visitors to the prison and of prisoners before and after visits.  We must continue the vigorous regime already in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the high cost of maintaining a prisoner &mdash; estimated at £36,000 per annuam &mdash; and the problems associated with drug addict prisoners, is it not time to question whether prison is the correct place to treat drug addicts and whether we should consider providing <Col N="612" /> therapeutic residential centres where a convicted offender could serve his sentence in a strictly monitored drug rehabilitation unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the policy that the prison regime for drug dependent offenders reflects the public health policy in relation to drug addicts generally.  We do not think that drug addicts in prison should be treated differently from drug addicts in the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department chairs a group that has looked at the area of the misuse of drugs and, as a result of recommendations, the Misuse of Drugs Bill is being implemented.  The group has been attempting to put in place a health and education policy for drug offenders.  The question of whether drug dependent prisoners should not be in jail would have far reaching consequences. If we were to go down that road perhaps the better way to approach it would be to take on board Deputy Gilmore's suggestion of segregating prisoners similar to the way we segragate sex offenders and terrorists.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Gilmore</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if, arising from her statement to Dáil Éireann on 11 May 1993, concerning the sale of the Mespil Flats, she has given any further consideration to amending the Landlord and Tenant Law; and if she will establish a working group consisting of representatives of her Department, the Department of the Environment and Thereshold who have suggested such a working group.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I replied to the Private Notice Questions on 11 May about Mespil Estate my Department has been engaged in an assessment of what amendments might be desirable and possible in the relevant areas of our landlord and tenant law.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the key issue which needs to be addressed is the nature of the legislative arrangements in place dealing with security of tenure. While the rights of the tenant in the first place fall to be dealt with by reference to the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the property is held, certain statutory rights exist in relation to security of tenure.  For example, the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Acts, 1982 and 1983, which are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, provide a measure of protection to tenants but are confined largely to tenants of dwellings which were formerly controlled under the rent restrictions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1980, however, apply to a wider range of tenancies and, in particular, give to residential tenancies of <Col N="617" /> 20 years' standing a right of renewal of tenancy for up to 35 years.  I should mention that, where a new tenancy is availed of under these provisions, there is a procedure, in the absence of agreement, whereby the rent falls to be determined by a court and the court has to set a rent which, essentially, would in its view represent an open-market rent for the property in question.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will appreciate that any changes to the law in this area would have to be approached with considerable caution.  There is clearly a very difficult balance to be drawn between, on the one hand, the level of protection which can be reasonably afforded to tenants and, on the other, the position of the owners of such property.  I should emphasise that what we are dealing with here is the private rented sector and that changes in the law which might be considered desirable in the context of the rights of tenants cannot be considered in isolation from their likely effect on the willingness of people to make available their property for rental in this sector.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made to me about possible changes in the law in this area such as through reducing the period of 20 years before a right to a new tenancy arises and giving existing tenants first refusal where a property is to be relet for residential purposes.  These and other issues have been under consideration as part of the assessment under way in my Department to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Given the stage the assessment which has been under way in my Department has reached, the clearly complex issues which arise, the involvement of the Department of the Environment in related areas and the broad nature of the considerations which have to be taken into account, it would now be appropriate to put in place a structure which would most effectively be able to advance this matter.  Some form of working group along the lines suggested by Thereshold would be appropriate and, accordingly, I propose to consult the Minister for the Environment about the early establishment of such a group.  In deciding on <Col N="618" /> its membership and terms of reference I will, of course, take into account the views of interested parties such as Threshold. In that context I hope to arrange a meeting between representatives of Threshold and officials of my Department shortly to discuss this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that she intends to establish a working group along the lines suggested by Threshold.  Does she share my concern that, since the Mespil Flats affair, there have been other cases involving landlords and tenants which have shown the degree to which tenants are vulnerable, in particular the sale of the Ashurst Flats in Mount Merrion?  Indeed, only yesterday in a case involving Temple Buildings the Circuit Court issued three eviction notices, in one case against an 83 year-old widow.  Is the Minister concerned that at present landlords are driving a coach-and-four through the 1980 Act and are not allowing any tenant to have 20-year tenancy in order to qualify for protection under that Act by terminating tenancies and shifting tenants around between one flat and another within the same building or complex of buildings?  Does she accept that there is a necessity to amend the 1980 Act in order to give tenants better protection than is afforded at present and to prevent landlords from abusing the provisions of the 1980 Act as some landlords are doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional implications, and how far an amendment to the 1980 Act should go, have been assessed in my Department. Involving the Department of the Environment, which has a crucial role to play, and organisations such as Threshold is the proper way to go.  Amending legislation may be necessary but, as the Deputy appreciates, it will be difficult to come up with an amendment within the constitutional provisions for property and property owners which at the same time affords the necessary protection to tenants.  The establishment of the working group is a positive step forward and I appreciate Deputy Gilmore's welcome <Col N="619" /> for it.  I will be specifying a time by which the group must report to me because time is of the essence.  I am aware of the cases to which Deputy Gilmore referred since the Mespil Flats affair and I have been concerned about them as have the people making the assessment within the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that what they are experiencing at present is continuing evictions by landlords who find that their property is worth more on the open market or because they want to rid the building of tenants in order to move up market in the private rented sector and that the constitutional rights of tenants are being overridden in these circumstances?  What timescale does the Minister envisage for the completion of the study and the implementation of amending legislation, since it is now several months since the Mespil Flats controversy?</P>

      <P>I am making arrangements for officials of my Department to meet representatives of Threshold within the next couple of days so that they can nominate a member of the committee.  Then it will be a matter for the Department of the Environment to nominate a member.  The official from my Department is already working within the appropriate section.  While I would not like Deputy Gilmore to tie me to a specific date, I envisage the committee being in place before the end of this year and their report being completed by early 1994.  This is not something that can be <Col N="620" /> put on the long finger and the group cannot be given an indefinite period within which to report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's statement on the establishment of a working group.  Does she accept that so far the problem has been put on the long finger?  It is a number of months since the Mespil Flats case got a great deal of publicity and much concern was expressed, but so far it seems that nothing effective has been done.  I feel strongly about this and I attended court yesterday with tenants of Temple Buildings in Dominick Street which is in my constituency. Those tenants had no protection, were not even in a position to make statements in court and they were served with eviction notices.  It is very difficult to represent elderly people who have lived in an area for a long time when a new owner decides to redevelop the building purely for profit by removing all the tenants.  Although this is very late for the tenants of Temple Buildings, will the Minister deal urgently with this matter and ensure that the working group reports as quickly as possible so that the experience of tenants, such as those in Temple Buildings, will not be repeated elsewhere in this city?  It is a absolutely disgraceful that this should happen to any citizen of this State and it is foisted on them by people whose sole motivation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I share the concern of the vulnerability of tenants. The purpose of the assessment which is being done as a result of the Mespil Flats episode is to tighten up the law in so far as it is possible to ensure that tenants are given the protection they need.  The setting up of the working group is an important step forward.  This is something which I do not want to put on the long finger.  I want to give the group a <Col N="621" /> definite date by which they must report back to me because whatever amendments are made to the legislation will be based on their recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the review group.  Will the Minister ensure that tenants know their rights?  In one case this week a landlord notified a young woman with a family to get out of the house next week.  It is unsatisfactory that landlords are using illegal methods to evict people.  Perhaps the review committee will recommend some regulations under existing law so as to ensure that tenants and landlords are made aware of their duties and obligations.  Some of the cases which have come to light are tragic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the advantages of involving Threshold in the working group is to ensure that tenants' rights under the legislation would be made known immediately to tenants.  The involvement of Threshold with vulnerable tenants shows that Threshold has the capability to advise the members of the working group on what action is necessary to ensure that we do what Deputy Wallace suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not undertake to indicate, by way of reply to a parliamentary question, what specific legislative proposals, <Col N="622" /> if any, I have in mind.  Any proposals I might have in relation to the subject matter of these questions would be brought before the Government for approval before being announced in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted was introduced in 1974.  The effective date of the scheme was 1 October 1972.</P>
    <P>The scheme is operated on a non-statutory basis and <i>ex-gratia</i> payments of compensation are made in respect of personal injuries criminally inflicted.  Since its inception to the end of 1992, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal has made awards totalling in excess of £40 million.  In the five year period 1988 to 1992, 2,362 awards amounting to approximately £16.8 million have been paid.</P>
    <P>The scheme was amended by a previous Government with effect from 1 April 1986 because of the escalating cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.  As I stated previously, I would wish to be in a position to increase the provision for payment of compensation to victims of crime.  We are concerned about it and Deputies can rest assured that we will do all we can about it in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>As in the case of all public services, funding for criminal injuries compensation has to be allocated on the basis of requirement, competing demands for other services, the limited financial resources available and the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the State's response to the victims of crime is seriously deficient?  There is no compensation for pain and suffering and the present scheme only allows for out-of-pocket and medical expenses for which there is a two year wait once the award is made.  The only significant social response to victims of crime, of which there are many, is a voluntary organisation called the Irish Association for Victim Support.  In the absence of a commitment from the Minister to restore compensation for pain and suffering and place the Criminal Injuries Tribunal on a <Col N="623" /> statutory basis, will he not at least commit himself to giving the Irish Association for Victim Support significant funding this year?  It has requested budgetary support as it needs a significant injection of funds to allow it continue its excellent work. The organisation provides the only social response available to victims of crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated already that, because of the escalating cost, the question of pain and suffering was taken out of the criminal injuries compensation provisions by a previous Government as and from 1 April 1986.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cost approximately an extra £8 million to £10 million per annum to restore compensation for pain and suffering to our criminal justice system.  Deputy O'Donnell must be aware, too, that to do so would require the introduction of legislation, and I am not in a position to make any such commitment at Question Time; it is a matter for the Government.</P>
      <P>I understand that when a person applies for an award it takes a year for a decision to be made following which there is a waiting period of 20 months for payment.  We can obtain only a certain amount of money from the Estimates each year for the scheme.  The Minister will seek funding for the tribunal in this year's Estimates and if we can secure an improvement in our allocation the waiting period will not be as long.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a commitment to increase funding for the victims support group this year and because of budgetary constraints securing those funds involved a great deal of bargaining with the Department of Finance.  Great credit is due to the Minister for securing the increased funding because we all know the difficulties that involves in the current budgetary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider setting up a special fund under the <Col N="624" /> National Management Treasury Agency in which the Government could invest a sum of money each year from which the Criminal Injuries Tribunal could draw down money rather than depends totally on yearly Estimate provision.  Will the Minister agree that it would be worthwhile to build up such a fund which could be used solely by the Criminal Injuries Tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting suggestion and I will bear it in mind.  The type of fund to which the Deputy referred could be used in many ways, it might not necessarily be used to fund the expenditure to which we are referring. However, I would prefer to obtain the funding from the Estimates over the next few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent victims from consulting their lawyers for advice.  Obviously, Deputy Mitchell is referring to some type of mechanism provided by the State.  I cannot make a commitment in that regard today but I will bear the suggestion in mind.</P>
      <P>In relation to compensation for pain and suffering, the UK proposes to abolish such compensation and replace it with a scheme which I understand will be more restrictive than our scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a problem in respect of funding in this area. Nevertheless, will the Minister agree that only a tiny fraction of unpaid parking fines are processed and that this involves a great deal of money?  The collection of fines needs to be carried out in a much more state of the art and scientific manner.  For example, it is ridiculous to have gardaí issuing summonses in the flatlands of our cities.  We need to introduce <Col N="625" /> a system whereby that money can be collected to provide funds for the provision of compensation for the victims of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is an accountant as well as a lawyer, will he consider carrying out a value-for-money audit of the criminal justice system as approximately £500 million per annum is spent on the system?  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General satisfied that efficiency, effectiveness and economy applies in the system?  Savings from such an audit could be applied to areas such as the victims support group and other needy areas in the criminal justice system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of victims support is only one areas in the Department to which we need to allocate extra funding.  In regard to an independent audit, we are getting good value for the money we spend on the criminal justice system, but I wish we had much more money to spend.  It is a question of a shortage of money rather than value for money, but there is no area of public expenditure in which we could not get more value for money.  I will bear in mind the Deputy's suggestion, but it is a question of more money rather than more value for the money we have already.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together. The House will be aware that the partnership programme for Government includes a commitment that policy towards the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and non-nationals will meet the highest international standards and that procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearing, appeals, access to legal advice and access to the courts.</P>
      <P>I have appointed an interdepartmental committee comprising representatives of the Departments of Justice, Enterprise and Employment and Foreign Affairs to examine policy and practices with regard to non-Irish persons who are resident in the State and in the area of persons who apply for refugee status.  The terms of reference of the committee are extensive but, due to the Government's particular concern that our procedures and practices in relation to applications for refugee status and refugees should be reformed, the committee decided to prepare an interim report as a matter of urgency dealing specifically with that area.  I expect to have this report very shortly.</P>
      <P>However, as I am determined to introduce legislative proposals as soon as possible and, to avoid any delay, I instructed my Department to commence work on a Bill parallel to the work of the committee. A draft general scheme of a Bill has now been prepared but no final decision as to the contents of the proposed legislation will be made by the Government until I have studied the report of the committee in detail.  I am confident, nevertheless, that the general scheme of a Bill can be finalised quickly and published before Christmas.</P>

      <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have been anxious to ensure that the Immigration and Nationality Division of the Department, formerly known as the Aliens Division, becomes more user friendly.  From my own observations and from what <Col N="628" /> other Members of the House have said to me it appears that people are concerned that this division is not perceived as user friendly.  However, people have to appreciate that the officials in that division have a heavy workload to cope with and a difficult job to do.  A number of measures have been taken within the Department and the division to make it more user friendly.  In addition, a number of other measures will be taken between now and the end of the first quarter of next year.  In making the Department more user friendly the appointment of retired Judge O'Malley was important.  While I have not had an opportunity to study the interim report of the interdepartmental committee in detail, one of its recommendations is that people be told the reason for their applications being refused and that an appeals procedure be put in place so that we would have some indication of which decisions made by the Minister might be overturned.  I am very much in favour of such procedure as it should lead to greater openness.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether people should be told the reason they were refused, as Deputy Shatter may be aware, there may be certain instances, in relation to security matters, where it may not be appropriate to provide such information. Indeed, it might not be helpful to the individual concerned to do so.  Making the division more user friendly as well as publishing the Bill should lead to greater openness.  The officials of that division have been looking for that for quite some time.</P>

    <Title>Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993: From the Seanad (Resumed).</Title>

      <P>Section 1: In page 10, subsection 2 (c), line 43, after &ldquo;acted&rdquo;&ldquo;and, in relation to persons contemplating marriage, 'spouse' and 'other spouse' include whichever of those persons is appropriate in the context&rdquo; added.</P>
      <P>This amendment to section 7 (2) (c) of the Bill is designed to ensure that, in addition to spouses, persons, contemplating marriage must also obtain independent legal advice before opting out of joint ownership of a future matrimonial home.  The House has already indicated its support for the principle underlying this amendment.  It puts spouses and couples contemplating marriage on an equal footing so far as this matter is concerned and for that reason should find favour on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no row with the Minister on this amendment it is symptomatic of what has happened to this Bill which is on an unprecedented legislative merry-go-round.  In all my years in this House it is the first time I have seen a Bill debated in the Dáil on Second Stage, in special committee, on Report Stage, sent to the Seanad, returned to the Dáil, sent to the Seanad again and returned to the Dáil.  This Bill could have been enacted much sooner if the Minister had taken seriously some of the proposals made by the Fine Gael Party on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to an amendment I moved at the Select Committee on Social Affairs on 9 September 1993 and which read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A declaration made under this section shall not be valid unless the <Col N="680" /> party making such declaration has first obtained independent legal advice.</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister made the case that there was no need to ensure that someone who intended marriage or who was a spouse obtained independent legal advice before signing away rights.  He made something of a meal of opposing the proposal both in this House and on the national airwaves.  The Opposition parties voted in favour and the Government parties voted against.  On Report Stage the Minister introduced his own amendment saying he had taken Deputies' views into account.  I am not criticising the Minister for that; I welcome the fact that he has been flexible but to and behold, despite having the backup of a Department and a programme manager, he incorporated a defective amendment in the Bill which was discovered when the Bill was debated in the Seanad.  That should not have happened and it is not the only occasion changes were made.  This Bill has been radically changed as it has gone through the legislative process.  I am not criticising the Minister for accepting amendments. If he did not we would be wasting our time and I specifically praise him for doing so.  However, the level of reconstruction required to make this Bill workable went beyond what should be necessary.  We would not be dealing with this amendment today if the Minister had taken on board the amendment he and his collegues voted against on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Inserting the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; addresses what the Minister is seeking to resolve.  I support the Minister's proposal.  It addresses the matter in a semantically different way from the way we proposed, but it is important that if someone is allowed to waive their entitlement to a statutory joint tenancy of the matrimonial home they get legal advice whether they waive their right prior to or after marriage.  There is concern that someone caught up in the romance of an engagement could be fooled into signing documentation.  If this <Col N="681" /> matter had been better thought out on Committee Stage we would not be dealing with this amendment, nor would we have had to deal with some of the other amendments introduced by the Minister in the Seanad.  On Report Stage we understood, because of assurances given by the Minister, that his amendment was adequate.  It was discovered later that that was not the case.  However, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally welcome this amendment although it is a pity it was not accepted on Committee Stage. Perhaps it was a little ungenerous of the Minister to accept it in the Seanad and not in this House when it was well argued by the Opposition.  In the heel of the hunt the Minister has seen sense and he is right to admit he was wrong.   Many women go into marriage not realising they are entering into a contract which has a range of implications.  If a woman, or a man, decides to waive the statutory right of joint ownership of the family home, legal advice is necessary given that there are inequalities in relationships, some based on economics and some just on self-confidence. The Bill is much better for this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for their contributions.  I had grave reservations about the propriety of making it compulsory to obtain legal advice before waiving statutory rights.  Even now I have some doubt about the matter. However, having deliberated over a period on the comments and correspondence I had with some Deputies, I am prepared to agree to the thrust of the amendment.  A further adjustment was necessary because of the technical omission from the Seanad amendment of people contemplating marriage rather than being spouses.  That point has been rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the point on board but Deputy Shatter is complaining; he is not an easy person to please.  He would complain even more if I did not accept the amendment.  The important point is to produce the best possible Bill before it <Col N="682" /> leaves the Oireachtas.  I have been extraordinarily open-minded in dealing with a very technical Bill.  I thank the Deputies for their help.  It is now a better legislative measure.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Section 8: In page 11, lines 32 to 48, subsection (1) deleted and the following subsection substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where an interest in a materimonial home has vested in both spouses by virtue of section 4&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  in the case of registered land, if one only of the spouses is registered in a register maintained under the Act of 1964 as owner of the interest, both spouses or (in case the spouse so registered has died) the surviving spouse shall be entitled, on application in the prescribed form by either of the spouses or by the surviving spouse, to be registered as owners or owner thereof, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of unregistered land, if one only of the spouses appear from a deed or deeds registered in the Registry of Deeds or otherwise to be the sole owner of the interest, a declaration in writing that the interest has so vested may be made by either of the spouses or, as the case may be, by the surviving spouse and a copy of the declaration, certified by that spouse to be true copy, may be registered in that Registry, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and, upon such registration, any legal interest in the home vested, or becoming vested, in the spouse who is so registered or who appears from the <Col N="683" /> deed or deeds to be such owner shall, subject and without prejudice to the rights of any other person, vest in both spouses as joint tenants or, as the case may be, in the surviving spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments are largely technical in character and deal mainly with matters relating to the Land Registry.  Two matters are being provided for.  It is now made clear that where one spouse is registered as the sole owner of land which includes a matrimonial home, the other spouse has a clear entitlement to apply in his or her own right to be registered as co-owner of that home.  Ideally this registration should take place during the lifetime of both spouses but, where the owning spouse has died without such registration having taken place, the surviving spouse is entitled to apply for registration.</P>
    <P>To facilitate registration by a surviving spouse, the provision of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, whereby the Registrar of Titles is compelled to recognise the personal representative alone as having any rights in respect of the land of the deceased, is being set aside in the specific incidence of the matrimonial home.  In addition, no assent by the personal representative will be necessary to vest the outstanding legal interest in the surviving spouse.  The assent is a means by which the actual transfer of the assets of the deceased to the persons entitled under the will or intestacy is usually carried out. Any legal interest of the deceased in the matrimonial home will remain with the personal representative until it vests in the surviving spouse on registration, but the personal representative is precluded from executing any assent in relation to that specific interest or from transferring it to another person.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a purely technical one because the equitable interest, that is, the real beneficial interest of the deceased has already passed to the surviving spouse by a survivorship, and any legal interest remaining is of a nominal character.  Provision is also made to cater for the situation where the surviving <Col N="684" /> spouse may have died before he or she had time to register their ownership interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no problem with what the Minister is proposing, but there are some aspects I would like him to clarify.  Am I right in saying that, when the joint tenancy is triggered under section 4, there is joint ownership regardless of whether it is registered, that the registration is just in the context of vesting the legal title and, if a spouse does not register, the beneficial joint ownership is extant?</P>
      <P>What happens if there is a joint tenancy arising under section 4 and then the spouse who is acquiring the joint tenancy by virtue of the provisions of this Bill uses the partition Acts to create a tenancy in common?  As I understand it in certain circumstances a tenancy in common can be created unilaterally.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position in that regard and whether it is affected by these provisions in relation to registration.  Alternatively, if the original owner of the family home, who had the home registered in his or her sole name, realises that the Bill is being triggered to give the other spouse a joint tenancy can they unilaterally and arbitrarily create a tenancy in common and by so doing deprive the spouse who believes he or she is benefiting under this legislation from automatically getting the entire ownership of the property in the event of the first spouse's death?  When a tenancy in common is created out of a joint tenancy each spouse effectively has a beneficial ownership in one half of the property and can dispose of it.  The Minister might indicate to what extent those provisions affect that position.  Will he clarify further the effects of the removal of section 9 (4)?  To what extent has the Minister addressed those issues and how they will be affected by his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is correct in saying that whether or not registration takes place the coming into operation of section 4 immediately triggers beneficially a joint interest between the two spouses.  In so far as the equitable beneficial <Col N="685" /> interest is concerned that applies whether or not registration takes place. In ideal circumstances it is desirable that the legal interest would be vested also by the execution of the declaration in a simple format which will be prescribed by regulations that will cover both the registered and unregistered land.  The legal and beneficial interest would be completed by the simple procedure of filing a document in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry.  That would be the desirable procedure but if this procedure is not followed, the beneficial joint vesting takes place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of whether a unilateral declaration can transfer joint tenancy into a tenancy in common.  I understand it is not possible for one person alone by a simple unilateral declaration to effect such a transfer. It is questionable whether ideally that should be the position.  On one occasion when the Law Reform Commission considered that point I made representations to it suggesting that that power and position should be considered for adoption. It referred to my representations in one of its reports but, having considered the matter carefully, it decided not to alter the position as it did not consider it necessary to allow a unilateral declaration by one party to a joint tenancy.  It would probably be open to a joint tenant to bring an application to court under the partition Acts to apply for a partition and the court, I think, has certain discretions in that regard.  If the joint tenancy which applies to the matrimonial home was partitioned or changed into the status of a tenancy in common, the registration provisions would apply in a similar context to that which applies to any tenancy in common although the position in those circumstances would be different.</P>

      <Col N="688" /> Deputies will recall that on Report Stage in this House I introduced an amendment to ensure that a judgement mortgage could not be registered in respect of debts incurred prior to a section 4 vesting.  This amendment is somewhat analogous.  As the Bill stands if a benefiting spouse is bankrupt at the time the section 4 interest would have vested the joint ownership provisions of the Bill would not apply.</P>
    <P>However, where the benefiting spouse is adjudicated bankrupt after that interest has vested in respect of debts which arose prior to that vesting his or her share in the matrimonial home would be available for distribution by the official assignee in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 1988.  This amendment is designed to prevent this happening since clearly it would be anomalous to have the benefiting spouse's interest realised for the benefit of creditors in respect of debts incurred prior to the section 4 vesting when the Bill provides elsewhere that a judgement mortgage cannot be registered against that spouse's interest in respect of any such debts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Minister's amendment but I would like clarification on one point.  It occurs to me that it would be possible for a spouse to benefit from section 4.  A spouse may incur debts subsequent to the enactment of the legislation which may not be known to the original homeowning spouse; they may be incurred in the running of a business, from the impecunious use of money, drinking excessively or for a variety of reasons.  A spouse who puts all of his or her money into the acquisition of a home could find himself or herself at the wrong end of either a judgment mortgage or a petition for bankruptcy which could affect an interest in the home.  As I understand it in such circumstances if it could be established that the spouse behaved in a manner in which he or she intended their conduct to result in a loss of the family home section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act might be invoked with a view to getting a court order to have the home transferred back into the name of the <Col N="689" /> original house-owning spouse.  However, the problem with that section is that it appears from the decided cases that it requires a degree of intent; it must be established that there was an intention to behave in a manner that would lead to the loss of the family home or that the spouse was so reckless that objectively a court could assume that the spouse so intended.</P>
      <P>In the absence of proof of such intent will the Minister clarify whether it is his intention that in those circumstances section 6 of the Bill would also be invoked?  Under section 6 (5) (a) the courts are empowered, in determining whether to allow someone to retain an interest under section 4, to have regard to their conduct.  Will the Minister confirm that the conduct referred to here is not essentially what is regarded as marital misconduct in terms of adultery or cruelty but that it extends to ill-advised and foolish financial conduct which places at risk the security of the family?  If that is the Minister's intention, is there any danger that by confining this amendment to debts incurred before the Bill is implemented it may be interpreted that debts incurred subsequent to implementation of the Bill should not be included within the type of conduct to which the court should have regard under section 6?</P>
      <P>I am sorry if this matter is a little complex but I am sure the Minister will understand the difficulty I am describing.  It seems there is a possibility that within the next two to three years some spouses who acquire interests under this Bill might impose on their families financial difficulties which would not otherwise arise. As well as considering the benefits of the Bill, which are substantial for many people, we must also consider the difficulties and do what we can to ensure they do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify the reference to any debts, obligations or other liabilities arising out of acts or omissions occurring before the application of the sections.  Is it envisaged that, for example, the debts in full must have been incurred before application of the relevant <Col N="690" /> section?  For example, if a person entered into a business contract that was not implemented until the sections were enacted and it was only at that stage they suffered a loss, what would be the timeframe that would apply?  Would it be the date of the contract or the date when the loss was suffered?  That is a relevant matter that needs to be clarified in the context of incorporating this provision into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related to whether, at the date the vesting took place, a debt was owing by the spouse to a third party.  An existing contract that might after vesting took place, lead to a debt would not be applicable.  The test would be whether moneys is owed by the spouse at that point.  If the money is owed, it is a pre-vesting debt of a category that could not be taken into account on subsequent bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>The intent of the section is to provide protection in respect of debts incurred by one of the spouses before vesting took place.  It is not intended to deal with debts that would arise from whatever source after vesting took place.  By and large, the position of joint tenancies in the matrimonial home would be the same as that for joint tenancies arising where the house was initially purchased in the names of both spouses.  Just as that hazard applies in the case where the home was acquired by purchase in both names, it will also apply to post-purchase debts incurred by one party, whether through mortgage or bankruptcy.  If a debt or a series of debts were incurred before vesting it would be clearly unfair to render it possible to bankrupt the person and for the assignee to have access to the joint vested interest in the matrimonial home.  We are putting the position in relation to bankruptcy on a par with that relating to judgment mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter asked whether section 6 could be invoked.  It could be invoked, but it would have to be recognised that even if that was done and the application succeeded the revesting that would take place would be subject to other people's rights which had come into play in the <Col N="691" /> meantime.  Just as in the case of judgment mortgages and bankruptcy, if a series of legal events occurred after vesting, they would have priority over vesting.  That is provided for in section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with this amendment.  This is legislation about which it could be said that if you are not confused, you are not concentrating.  As the Minister responded to Deputy Shatter's questions I became more confused. A question which occurred to me in relation to bankruptcy and judgment mortgages is whether the time is fast coming when to proffer a matrimonial home to a bank as security on any risky business venture will be at least politically incorrect.  The whole thrust of this Bill relates to protection of the family home and to giving equal rights to the woman. Cases have come to my attention of constituents who found themselves left with a half share in the family home but the house had to be sold to pay off debts to a bank on foot of a judgement mortgage. Surely it is unwise of the bank to act as guarantor for a risky business venture. Perhaps banks and institutions should review their practices in terms of accepting matrimonial homes as security in the future.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether Deputy O'Donnell is suggesting that there should be a law to the effect that a husband or wife would be prohibited from raising money on their matrimonial home.  Many spouses would take grave exception to such a provision.  A husband or wife might find it essential to raise money on the security of their home to enable them go into business and secure a livelihood for themselves.  Such persons would not welcome a law that prohibited them from using their property in that way.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was passed by this House a number of matters had not been properly addressed.  I welcome the opportunity afforded to us today to address these matters by way of amendments from the Seanad.  As a result, the Bill has been improved.</P>
      <P>I was very anxious that the House would properly address the position &mdash; it may be an exceptional instance but I am sure it will arise in practice &mdash; of husbands or wives who murder their spouses. Under the Bill, as amended, a person convicted in a criminal trial of murdering their spouse will not benefit and there will not be any onus on either the personal representatives of the deceased spouse or the surviving children to go to court to disentitle such a person from benefiting.</P>
      <P>I am glad, too, that we have finally sorted out the provisions which ensure that, under the legislation, a person must first get independent legal advice before waiving their rights.  Whatever advice is necessary should be available to people who are under pressure to waive their rights and who do not have the wherewithal to hire a lawyer though I cannot imagine that it would cost a huge sum of money to get advice on such an issue.  It is a simple matter and a lawyer should be able to give advice in a simple and easy way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that a spouse who requires legal advice will gain access to the Government <Col N="694" /> law centres where they will get such advice.</P>
      <P>I regret that wives who were deserted or abandoned by their husbands prior to 25 June 1993 and who still reside in the family home which is owned by their husbands will not benefit under this legislation. I do not understand why the legislation could not have been framed in such a manner as to provide the same protection for those wives as it will provide for wives who were living with their spouses as and from 25 June 1993.  In the context of enacting a major piece of legislation which falls under the bailiwick of equality and law reform, it is regrettable that we have created a class of wives who are less equal than others.  The Supreme Court may address that issue at some stage.  We do not know whether the President will refer this legislation to the Supreme Court for determination as to its constitutionality.  I am not suggesting that the legislation should be deemed unconstitutional &mdash; I am concerned about the constitutional impact of the different treatment of wives in different families based on the creation of an artificial cut off date.  If there is a constitutional difficulty with the legisation it may derive more from the artificial cut off date than from any interference with private property rights, the old reason given as to why this type of legislation could not be enacted.</P>
      <P>It is probable that at some stage in the future some husband or wife will challenge the constitutionality of the legislation. Even though a group of wives will be excluded from the provisions of the Bill, I would not be happy if as a result of ordinary litigation this Bill was put into cold storage for anything up to 18 months while the court case wound its way through the High Court and the Supreme Court.  If the President has any doubts as to the constitutionality of the legislation I would much prefer that matter to be addressed by the referral to the Supreme Court than to leave it to be litigated through the courts, thus taking a much longer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having criticised the Minister during the debate for different reasons, I should <Col N="695" /> say that he has been flexible in taking on board amendments from the Opposition. Of course members of the Opposition always wish Ministers to take on board all their amendments.  I believe the Minister has taken on board more amendments than some of his colleagues would have done in similar circumstances.  The debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas have ensured that we have a better Bill than the Bill originally published.  I think the Minister will acknowledge that we have all made a contribution to improving the Bill.  Similar difficulties are experienced in regard to other legislation emanating from the Minister's Department. It will take much longer to put in place all of the badly needed legislation which should be put in place to enable the Government to keep its promise to hold the divorce referendum next autumn.</P>

      <P>There have been further huge drug seizures off Kinsale during the past 24 hours.  The value of the seizure is estimated at £3 million, and is rising.  This confirms that the seas off our shores are now a highway for drug smugglers and that the south west coast is a drugs gateway for Europe.  The hundreds of miles of rugged coastline in south west Cork and Kerry have become a honey pot for the racketeers in the drugs industry.  In recent times well known tourist resorts such as Schull, Court-macsherry, Roscarbery, Fenit and Kinsale have attracted notoriety as locations for substantial landings of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> The latest finds bring to well over £30 million the value of the drugs seized this year.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. It is now clear that vast quantities of drugs are getting through to their illegal markets.  An emergency drugs plan has to be formulated by the Government to stem the tide, so to speak, in this area. Such a plan must be backed by an adequate legal framework, sufficient resources and adequate manpower to monitor movements off our coastline.  If one takes into account all the rugged coves and inlets which provide so much pleasure for tourists and local communities, our existing State services, the Garda, customs and excise officers and the Navy, are attempting to police a coastline of 1,970 miles.  These coves and inlets provide a huge number of landing places for unwelcome visitors bringing illegal drugs to this country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a full and comprehensive report on the circumstances relating to the latest drugs finds off Kinsale and the immediate follow up action which needs to be taken. I want an assurance that an emergency plan will be put in place without delay.  I wish to put a number of proposals to the Minister for urgent consideration and action.  First, an auxiliary coast watch service should be established to support the efforts of the Garda Síochána, customs and excise officers and the Navy. These coastguards would be able to monitor the situation on the ground and pass on vital information in good time to allow not only drugs to be seized but drug pushers to be captured.</P>
    <P>Second, the resources and equipment of the Garda Síochána, customs and excise officers and the Navy must be strengthened and improved.  It is relevant to point out that over the past six to seven years Garda Síochána numbers dropped by almost 1,000.  Top class modern equipment, as good as, if not better than, that used by drug smugglers, must be made available to the Garda, to customs and excise officers and the Navy.  I am talking about equipment such as high powered binoculars, infra-red cameras, scrambler radios, etc.  Such equipment is not available <Col N="697" /> to the extent necessary at present but money must be found to make it available.</P>
    <P>Third, a year ago we discussed a proposal to provide high powered seagoing vessels and surveillance equipment at a cost of £13 million.  Why have these not been provided?  Clearly there is a case for support from the European Union to pay towards the cost of cutting off the access point for drugs destined for the European continent.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a further important aspect must be considered.  There has been virtually no recruitment in the Defence Forces over the past number of years. The strength of the Navy is now at a critically low level and it is essential to provide the manpower to enable the existing fleet to be fully operational and, of course, to provide personnel for the new vessels if and when they arrive.</P>
    <P>Finally I understand that a Bill will be introduced later this week to permit the confiscation of illegal assets.  I welcome this long overdue move but further legal measures will be necessary in this area because I assume there must be convictions before assets can be confiscated. We must not forget that some of the main European racketeers have been living openly in Ireland and it has not been possible to bring them to trial because of lack of evidence and other reasons.  I accept that substantial sums of money are needed to fund my proposals but the Government has a compelling case with which to approach our European colleagues for the moneys required.</P>
    <P>It is time we declared war on drug smugglers.  Whatever is necessary to ensure that these drugs are seized before they reach the streets must be done.  We must capture the godfathers of crime and put them behind bars.</P>
    <P>In regard to the enormous value of the drugs involved, the Government has a great responsibility.  I am now demanding that this responsibility be discharged and, in particular, that adequate resources be made available to pursue the war on drug smugglers.</P>

      <P>I am grateful <Col N="698" /> to the Deputy for raising this important matter which enables me to reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>At 11.30 p.m. on 2 November 1993, the French fishing vessel <i>Marie Catherine</i> discovered two bales of suspected cannabis resin in her nets whilst fishing outside Irish territorial waters.  She subsequently contacted the French customs authorities and was informed to proceed to Cork Harbour and present the find to the Irish customs authorities. The head office of the Customs National Drugs Team was informed by the customs attaché at the French Embassy in London of the impending arrival of a fishing vessel with a quantity of suspected cannabis.  As the fishing vessel did not possess maritime charts of Cork Harbour, arrangements were made for the vessel to put into Kinsale.  On arrival in Kinsale, 41 packages containing approximately 45 kilos of cannabis resin were produced to members of the local Customs National Drugs Team.</P>
      <P>The Customs National Drugs Team immediately mounted an operation to search the location of this particular find. The <i>Marie Catherine</i> was contracted by customs to continue its trawl of the search location.  The Irish naval service is working conjointly with customs in this operation and three customs officers were taken on board the <i>LE Deirdre</i> to direct the operation from the search location. One of these officers has since gone on board the French fishing trawler.  So far, the trawl has recovered a further 11 bales which have been taken on board the naval vessel bringing the total find to approximately 315 kilos of cannibis resin with an estimated street value of IR£3.15 million.  The search is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the abolition of systematic checks at internal Community frontiers since 1 January last, the Irish customs service has greater responsibility for protecting not only Ireland, but the European Union as a whole &mdash; and in this matter I agree with the Deputy &mdash; against drugs smuggling from third countries.  It is vital, in these circumstances, to ensure <Col N="699" /> that Ireland is not used as a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; for smuggling drugs from outside the European Union into this country or into other members states.</P>
    <P>Customs services are the first line of defence against the illegal importation of controlled drugs.  Customs staff are strategically placed at ports, airports and in the vicinity of land and sea borders to intercept illicit imports of drugs.  In the import/export area, customs has the necessary expertise, trade and international contacts and legal powers to make a significant impact in the fight against drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, there has been a reorganisation of our customs service for this purpose, including the setting up in November 1992 of a new National Customs Drugs Team comprising 74 staff, and consisting of intelligence, operational maritime and dog units, strategically based at coastal locations throughout the country. The team's main functions are to collect, analyse and disseminate information on sensitive goods, primarily in the drugs area, to operational teams and to examine suspect baggage and freight and search vehicles, ships, yachts, private aircraft, etc. to prevent drug smuggling.  The team is fully trained and equipped, employing the most modern means of communications as well as having access to aerial and sea surveillance.</P>
    <P>The team has already had some notable success.  The street value of Customs drugs seizures exceeded £11 million in 1992.  Since the Single Market was completed on 1 January 1993, over 665 kilos of illegal drugs valued at some £6.85 million were seized by Irish customs in a total of 69 seizures.  Significant seizures of cannabis resin so far this year have included 65 kilos at Rosslare Harbour, County Wexford in January and 27 kilos at the same location in March; 150 kilos at Roscarbery, County Cork in May; 110 kilos a Skibbereen, County Cork in June and the large Garda seizure made with the assistance of Customs intelligence of two tonnes at Fenit, County Kerry in July.</P>
    <P>To this impressive list can now be <Col N="700" /> added the current cannabis seizure of 315 kilos at Kinsale.  In regard to co-operation between the various Government agencies in the fight against drug smuggling, there continues to be close co-operation between Customs, the Garda, the Naval Service and the Air Corps and various Government Departments concerned, as the huge seizure in Fenit that I just mentioned bears witness to.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the dedicated people involved from the various Government agencies who work diligently, and sometimes at considerable physical risk, to keep our shores free of the drugs smuggling menace.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market has underlined the importance of maintaining and intensifying co-operation both within and outside the European Union to ensure a constant flow of intelligence about suspect movements.  There is already a high degree of co-operation between the customs services of the European Union member states to combat drug smuggling.  Such co-operation has proved very effective and, indeed, played an important role in many drug detections, including one of the largest seizures of drugs by customs in this country &mdash; over 700 kilos of cannabis resin in Cork in 1991 &mdash; as well as the current seizure.  Customs co-operation with other member states in the field of drugs falls within the area of intergovernmental co-operation which has, up to now, been dealt with outside Community structures.  Under the new arrangements governed by the Treaty on European Union, this co-operation will, for the most part, be brought formally within the ambit of the European Council which will have general responsibility for ensuring the highest degree of co-operation on a Community-wide basis in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>Heads of EC customs services have undertaken a number of initiatives to improve co-operation between the member states and build up the necessary resources both in terms of technical equipment and personnel, to combat the drug traffickers.  In this regard, a new <Col N="701" /> EC Customs Information System &mdash; a computerised communications system designed to disseminate information rapidly between all European Union customs services &mdash; is in place which allows customs officers throughout the European Union to communicate quickly and effectively in identifying and controlling suspect movements of persons and freight consignments, etc.  This communications system should make a significant contribution towards combating drugs smuggling and improving the effectiveness of customs controls.</P>
    <P>I have noted the points made by the Deputy and share his concern.  All reasonable proposals for the extension of the service will be considered by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I wish to inform the House that two additional rigid inflatable boats will be introduced to the service before Christmas and the crews are currently being trained.  This has been made possible by the use of European Community funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to raise this issue on the Adjournment because I believe it raises fundamental questions about the Minister's role, that of his Department and the future development of environmental policy here.  I want to know in particular whether the Minister accepts collective Cabinet responsibility. There is great confusion in the minds of the public about the Minister's role in this respect.</P>
      <P>The recent decisions on the three interpretative centres represent a significant change from what the Minister had previously stated his beliefs to be.  It constitutes a significant move away from that for which the Minister stood in terms of participation, consultation, and listening to environmental groups.  What are the Minister's views on the future development of interpretative centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the decision of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, this evening <Col N="702" /> because many of our citizens who have been following this debate, and whom I believe the Minister endeavoured to convince of his views when he travelled around the country with the said Minister, want to know the position.  The people are following this debate with great interest.  They deserve to be informed by the Minister, as the policy maker in this area, how these decisions were arrived at.  For example, how was the democratic process of decision-making, as interpreted by Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government, arrived at? What were the factors that influenced that decision?  Did the Minister agree with the decision which appears to be in direct conflict with much of what he has said?  The Minister has spoken about transparency in Government and the Taoiseach spoke of open Government. Can the Minister say how this has been reflected in these decisions?  It is clear that a Fianna Fáil Minister of State took this decision which appears to be very different from and at variance with what the Minister said previously.</P>
    <P>At a critical moment, perhaps the most critical opportunity for the Minister to put his mark on policy in relation to the development of our environment, why did the Minister not influence this policy in the direction he outlined?  I am concerned about future policy in this respect because, as the Minister said, it is his area of responsibility.  There is a link between this policy and future developmental policy.  Clearly in future such policies will be pursued in relation to interpretative centres here.  The Minister must say whether they are his policies. Indeed in the case of the interpretative centres about which I speak &mdash; those at Luggala, Mullaghmore and the Boyne Valley &mdash; new development is envisaged. Will such development fall within the area of responsibility of the Minister?</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister not comment on policy at present?  Why is he washing his hands of this issue maintaining that it is a matter for the planning process? Some of the failure to which I have referred relates to a decision taken on the formation of this Government when <Col N="703" /> we witnessed the separate views of the Minister and the Minister of State, the Minister contending he was responsible for future policy.  Surely there is a link between the two and that is what I would like the Minister to clarify this evening.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the cost to the taxpayer, the loss of public money to the Exchequer and from Europe.  There are serious lessons to be learned in this respect vis-a-vis the National Development Plan given that some of the decisions taken in it were driven by the availability of European Union Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>There has been a fudge between responsibility for future policy on these three interpretative centres.  Indeed, the manner in which the decision was taken, will have implications for future development here.  Clearly, the Minister of State has taken one route and I should be glad if the Minister outlined the route he intends taking.  The Minister has been sidelined and his capacity to devise policy in this area should be seriously undermined.</P>

      <P>When Cabinet last discussed these visitor centres on 2 June 1993 it was clear, arising from that discussion, that it would be necessary for the Office of Public Works to apply for planning permission as a result of the Supreme Court decision of 26 May 1993.  The Office of Public Works was instructed to engage in the widest possible consultations with all interested parties, which process continued for two months.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has announced that it will now apply through the planning process.  As other parties have indicated that they will be involved in that process and possibly it would appear, in a legal process it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Future policy in regard to our heritage is now a matter for me.  I will be looking at any further proposals for the provision of visitor centres in an entirely new light.</P>
      <P>One point I have been stressing throughout the controversy surrounding these interpretative centres has been the need for wider consultation with all interested parties, the need to actively seek consensus and to avoid damaging relationships in communities.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey &mdash; to whom she referred &mdash; and the Office of Public Works now accept this view.  In his recent statements the Minister of State said the consultative process had taught all at the Office of Public Works the value of consultation and open Government.  I am completely at one with him when he states that, in future, the policy will be to involve local communities in all decisions about major developments in their areas. This public consultation will be in addition to the requirement now resting on all public authorities to go through the planning process in the same way as individual citizens and bodies in the private sector.  I respect that process and the legal process.  That is why I made the statement I did since the decision to apply for planning permission was announced. Therefore, in those two respects, that is acceptance of the need for wide public consultation and the requirement to obtain planning permission, perhaps the present controversy will have a positive impact on future policy.</P>
      <P>However, the decision in relation to Luggala, Mullaghmore and the Boyne Valley will not in any sense constitute a precedent which would constrain or lean on future policy formulation.</P>
      <P>I sought at once to respect processes independent of this House, but rendered possible by legislative action and, at the same time, to indicate as clearly as possible, the direction of future policy for which I have responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Research undertaken by the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee produced disturbing figures in relation to suicides here.  We were shocked by the figures, not merely by the high level of suicides but by the fact that so many men, in particular young men, were taking their lives.  The research showed that the vast majority of suicides here are male.</P>
      <P>For example, in the first quarter of this year there were 75 suicides, the initial statistic which focused our attention on this issue.  Of 75 suicides in the first quarter of this year seven were women and 68 men.  For 1992 there were 354 suicides reported here of whom 58 were women and 296 men.  These stark figures speak for themselves.  They clearly demonstrate that, in crises, men are not coping and that measures are urgently needed to address that problem.</P>
      <P>Following our research the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee released a statement drawing attention to the matter.  I am chairperson of that committee and since that statement was released on Tuesday I have received a huge response.  All day long my telephone has not ceased ringing.  I received inquiries from the media and from people whose lives have been affected, who have had to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of a suicide.  I have also been contacted by professional people with a special interest in this area, all of whom contend that more needs to be done, particularly at Government level, specificially by the Department of Health and perhaps, also by the Department of Education to educate our young people, in particular, on how to cope with modern day stresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should draw to the Minister's attention that not only does the majority of suicides involve male persons but also that most suicides occur within ten to 15 years of the victims leaving school.  We <Col N="706" /> have been in touch with the Samaritans who have most first hand contact with people contemplating suicide.  The statistics are startling.  Last year alone 74,000 calls were made to the Samaritans in Dublin, which is only one of ten centres throughout the country, and 17,000 of those calls were classified coming from persons who were suicidal.</P>
    <P>I queried the Samaritans in relation to the problems of suicide.  They say it is not necessarily the problems people encounter that lead them to contemplate suicide but rather a feeling of hopelessness.  We must seek a solution to this escalating problem and the only hope of success in that regard is by way of a proper research programme.  We are making the specific request that the necessary resources be provided for the establishment of such programme.</P>
    <P>The State can help in these areas: first, in regard to preventive measures; second, in the provision of accurate statistics and, third, by providing back up and counselling services.  In order to take effective preventive measures we need comprehensive research on the phenomena of suicide in Ireland.  For this reason the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee, following the conclusion of their research, have called for the establishment of such a programme.  The figures alone vindicate that call.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure also that the statistics on suicide are accurate.  We suggest a review of the current system of statistical collection and coding with a view to achieving the most accurate picture possible. The provision of back-up and counselling services is vitally important, not only for people who may feel suicidal but for the families of the victims of suicide. People from many such families have been in contact with me during the past few days.  Because of the attention the subject has received this week alone I am convinced that this is an area the Government will have to examine.  While the counselling service provided by the Samaritans is of much value, the health boards have a pivotal role to play in providing the professional counselling service <Col N="707" /> necessary.  That is the form in which action is needed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge the Minister to give the proposals of the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee the most serious consideration but, in particular, I am concerned about the three areas to which the statistics draw attention; the importance of national research into the subject, preventive measures and, most important, support for families in the aftermath of a suicide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea, who has asked me to reply to this debate on his behalf.  I thank Deputy Wallace for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to explain to the House the position in regard to this sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>By way of background I would like to say that it is a common feature of suicides in western European countries that more men than women commit suicide but more women attempt suicide.  Both suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland conform to this pattern.</P>
      <P>In relation to suicide, information on all causes of death &mdash; including suicide &mdash; is published in the Annual Reports on Vital Statistics.  The most recent report in this series is for 1990.</P>
      <P>An analysis of suicides over the period 1981 to 1990 shows that male suicides ranged from a low of 70.7 per cent of all suicides in 1984 to a high of 78.3 per cent in 1985.  Provisional figures for 1991 and 1992 show that male suicides have increased to 81.8 per cent and 83.7 per cent of the totals for the respective years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important to note that the figures included in the annual reports are compiled on a basis that is different from the basis for the provisional figures. The main difference relates to the classification of events to the year of occurrence in the case of the annual reports and to the year of registration in the case of the provisional figures.  Discrepancies <Col N="708" /> can arise as a result of the two different approaches.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to attempted suicide is less certain but it appears that female attempted suicides account for about 58 per cent of total attempted suicides. Despite the difficulties which can arise in regard to the interpretation of the available statistics, it does appear that there is an increase in male suicides as a percentage of the total but the reason for this is unclear.</P>
    <P>The causes of suicide are complex. Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.  In response to the problem of suicide the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of suicides is associated with a recognisable mental disorder, most commonly a treatable mental illness. Health boards are involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, pre-school playgroups, life-skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>In responding to the problem of suicide, the primary role for the Department of Health lies, in conjunction with the health boards, in the organisation and delivery of psychiatric and other support services.  There is also a role for health promotion.  In this regard, one chapter in the Green Paper on Mental Health promotion.  In this regard, one chapter in the Green Paper on Mental Health launched in June 1992 deals with the promotion of mental health and the prevention of suicide.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper outlines the role mental health personnel can play in the prevention of suicide and emphasises the important contribution of voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Minister's concern regarding the incidence of suicide, he has agreed that the Department of Health will contribute towards the cost of a pilot project on attempted self poisonings in Cork and which is to be carried out by staff of the Southern <Col N="709" /> Health Board.  The aim of this pilot project is to reduce the recurrence of attempted self poisonings and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in other areas.  The Minister also agreed to provide financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning, which will take place in University College Cork from 31 August to 3 September 1994.</P>
    <P>This important symposium will be attended by between 200 and 300 distinguished researchers from all over Europe who are working in the area of better understanding and the prevention of suicide and suicidal behavour.  The expert pool of knowlege and understanding of the factors contributing to suicide and attempted suicide thereby made available will, I am confident, assist our understanding of this very difficult problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I had put down a Special Notice Question to the Minister concerning the inordinate delay in sanctioning the contract for Ballybrohan national school, Ogonelloe, County Clare and the closure of a temporary school due to rat infestation.  Ballybrohan national school serves the children of the parish of Ogonelloe which is south of Scarriff on the banks of Lough Derg.  On 17 December 1992 a storm blew the roof of the prefabricated classrooms.  Special temporary classrooms were set up by the local community in the local hall as an emergency measure.  Since then difficulties have arisen in the school, one of which is rat infestation and which forced the parents, two weeks ago, to withdraw their 25 children from the school.</P>
      <P>Much of the frustration, which began in 1990, is caused by promises made by successive Ministers regarding the sanctioning of the contract for the new school. On 22 February 1993 I received a letter from the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> Dear Donal,</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that, on the basis of the increased provision of £18.7 million allocated this year for the national schools capital programme, I have authorised that the major building project sanctioned for Ogonelloe/Ballybrohan national school should proceed to contract during 1993.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Planning and Bilding Unit of my Department will be making the necessary arrangements in consultation with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to bring you such good news.</P>
    <P>I conveyed that in good faith to the people who asked me to make representations on their behalf.  I was aghast to learn about this latest incident and that no commencement date has yet been set for the project.  The chairperson of the parents' association is correct to say that they cannot believe politicians any more. The Minister sent me a letter &mdash; which I forwarded in good faith &mdash; outlining in simple language that the project sanctioned for Ogonelloe-Ballybrohan national school should proceed to contract during 1993 yet the Department has gone back on its word.  Why did the Minister renege on her responsibilities? Surely it is her responsibility to ensure that children are not taught in rat infested temporary buildings in Ogonelloe?</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity to set a date for the commencement of the project.  The children have had to recover from the traumatic event of having the roof taken off but they are being disturbed by further problems.  Will the Minister state the date on which it is intended to authorise the commencement of this project?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It gives me an opportunity to place on record the plans of the Department of Education for Ballybrohan national school, County Clare.  I cannot disagree with what the Deputy <Col N="711" /> said.  However, the Department's commitment remains the same and he received his commitment in writing.</P>
      <P>In 1990 approval was granted to the chairman of the school to erect a three classroom school with ancillaries at Ballybrohan, County Clare.  The new school was to replace a permanent two classroom and two prefabricated classroom school which were in urgent need of replacement.  At that stage a general purposes room was to be included in the plans.  The agreement then reached was that the full cost of the general purposes room was to be a local liability.</P>
      <P>General purpose rooms have not been grant-aided for some years by the Department as the available money is, of necessity, expended on essential classroom accommodation.  Discussions took place between officials of my Department and the chairman of the board of management and an agreement was reached that, to reduce local expenditure, if numbers increased in the school to justify a fourth classroom then that classroom should be increased in size to allow its use on occasion as a general purposes room.  The excess size of the classroom was to be a local liability.  Let me emphasise that this agreement was made.</P>
      <P>Plans for a four classroom school progressed on this basis &mdash; one of the classrooms to be of enlarged proportions.</P>
      <P>Working drawings and tender documentation were completed in February 1992.</P>
      <P>Because of falling enrolments the chairman sought a meeting with officers of my Department in December 1992 to discuss the additional general purposes area and the payment by local contribution for the extra area in question.  It was then decided that future enrolments should be confirmed before allowing the project to progress to tender to ensure that there would not be overprovision of facilities at the school.  The enrolment figures confirmed that the numbers would decrease to 86 pupils and that by 1994 the number would justify three teachers only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> The Department then decided to adjust the existing plans and informed the chairman accordingly.  The plans are now available for a three classroom school, a teachers' room and a library cum medical room together with the usual ancillaries.  A new ball-court is also planned as is the norm for new schools.</P>
    <P>The new plans for the school are being forwarded to the chairman to allow him seek the requisite full planning permission for the revised scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the two prefabricated buildings were damaged by storm in December 1992 and my Department grant-aided the development of the local hall to make it suitable as far as possible as a temporary measure for school use pending the building of the new school. Grant-aid to the value of £6,900 was expended on this temporary measure to tide the school over until such time as the new school replaced the existing facilities.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's question in relation to rat infestation, this is a matter for the board of management of the school, whose responsibility is to look after the day-to-day running of the school.  The Department allocates capitation grants for the upkeep and maintenance of the school on an annual basis and matters of cleanliness, heating and general hygiene come into this category.</P>
    <P>However, as I indicated, the revised plans are being forwarded to the chairman and the provision of the replacement school is a matter of top priority.  I rarely say on the Adjournment that I can guarantee funds for a project but on this occasion I can say the funds are available for the progression of this project and I will ensure that everything possible is done to expedite it.</P>

      <P>A full investigation was carried out by the Garda authorities, as a result of a letter received by my predecessor in August, 1992, into the matter referred to by the Deputy.  The result of this investigation was that there was no evidence to suggest that members of the Garda Síochána had made any unofficial disclosure in relation to the statement.  The <Col N="634" /> facts disclosed in the investigation did not warrant that any disciplinary action should be taken against any member of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to deal with the level of unsolved crime.  The Garda Commissioner's annual report on crime for 1992 indicates that there was an overall detection rate for indictable crime of 34 per cent in 1992.  This represents a slight increase on the 1991 detection rate and would be on a par with detection rates for previous years.  In examining crime detection rates it is also very important to consider the category of crime to which the rate refers.  For instance, in Category I of the Garda Commissioner's report, the detection rate is in excess of 77 per cent while the detection rates for very serious offences such as murder and rape are considerably higher.  In highlighting these figures, it is also worth mentioning that the crime detection rates for an Garda Síochána compare very favourably with those of other European police forces and, in most instances, are higher than European rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> It is not possible to distinguish the Garda resources that are devoted to unsolved crime alone.  Many investigations of serious crime are ongoing at any one time.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to enlist the help of the public in helping to solve serious crime.</P>
    <P>Initiatives such as the RTE &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; television programme, which commenced in 1992 have helped to improve public awareness of crime issues generally and have led, in many cases, to the detection of serious crime through the viewer response to specific cases featured in the programme.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Garda response to the problems of crime is proving successful and that Garda resources will continue to be deployed to best advantage. The crime situation is being kept under close review and I can assure the House that the Garda authorities will have my full backing in implementing whatever measures they consider necessary to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>I stated on 6 April 1993 that certain improvement works would be carried out to this station before the end of the year.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these works are presently being carried out and should be completed within the next two weeks.  These include painting and decorating of the station internally; upgrading of the toilet facilities; installation of a shower unit; <Col N="640" /> upgrading of kitchen facilities and replacement of kitchen units.</P>
      <P>As regards the long term situation, the Office of Public Works has been asked to investigate the possibility of purchasing the existing Garda station building.  If it is successful it is envisaged that a small extension will be built and any additional repairs necessary will be carried out to the existing building.</P>
      <P>The timescale of this project is dependent on whether this option is pursued or if it is decided to build a new station on the site purchased.  However, in any event money will not be spent on this project in 1994.  The Deputy can be assured that the project is being advanced as quickly as possible and that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions recently, I am currently engaged in a comprehensive review of prisons strategy and requirements, which involves an examination of the need for an expansion of custodial accommodation, and also for an expansion of the options for dealing with offenders outside the prison environment.  While the review has not been completed &mdash; and I have no wish to prejudice the outcome of the review &mdash; the indications are that a requirement for 150 to 200 additional cell places is involved.  No decision has yet been taken as regards location.</P>

      <P>Women offenders are at present <Col N="644" /> accommodated temporarily in the refurbished &ldquo;D&rdquo; Wing of St. Patrick's Institution. This accommodation has been refurbished to a high standard, including the provision of sanitation facilities in each cell.

      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks. It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised public displays conducted by professional operators.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>It is clear that, despite the restriction that applies on the legal importation of fireworks, supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the country. I do not believe that a total ban on importation would change that position.</P>
    <P>As regards enforcement of the law, the Garda authorities have assured me that in the months preceding Halloween, to the extent that was possible having regard to the many other demands on their services, they paid special attention to particular areas where unlicensed fireworks were being made available to the public.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted by the Garda included:</P>

    <P>Ratification will require legislation. Unless certain reservations are entered, however, at the time of ratification, serious difficulties for our prisons could be created given that the number of Irish nationals serving sentences abroad far <Col N="648" /> exceeds the number of foreign nationals serving their sentences in this country.

      <P>Recruitment to the Civil Service is governed by very specific legislative provisions, as provided for by the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  In general, all recruitment is by way of open competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Accordingly, the only avenue of re-entry to the service open to former civil servants is by competing in and being successful at an open competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The raising of the upper age limits for these competitions &mdash; the maximum age for most competitions is now 50 &mdash; has facilitated the return of married women to the Civil Service by this means.  The career break scheme, which was introduced in 1984, allows staff to take special leave without pay for <Col N="649" /> periods from six months to five years for a number of purposes, including family responsibilities.</P>
      <P>An exceptional arrangement was provided for in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.  Under these provisions women who left the Civil Service for the purposes of, on or following marriage, could in certain circumstances seek reinstatement to their former positions if they fulfilled specific criteria.  The Labour Court has determined that this practice is discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment.  It has recommended that the relevant statutory provisions be repealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by pointing out that the introduction of the probate tax must be viewed in the context of the relatively low yield from inheritance tax and the need to broaden the inheritance tax base. It is fair to say that inheritances generally increase the wealth and taxable capacity of those receiving them and the majority of inheritances should be able to bear a relatively small charge in recognition of this fact, especially at a time when overall economic circumstances have necessitated the raising of additional revenues from other tax heads.  However, prior to the introduction of probate tax, the yield from inheritance tax, at about £30 million a year, represented roughly 3 per cent of the total value of estates passing on inheritance and less than a half per cent of total tax revenues.  This is due to the very generous exemption thresholds for inheritance tax under the capital acquisitions tax code; assets valued at up to £171,750 may pass free of inheritance tax from parent to child, for example, while inheritances between spouses are exempt altogether from inheritance tax.  The purpose of the probate tax is to increase the yield from capital taxation to a more realistic level on a basis that does not impose an undue burden on any taxpayer. It does so by applying a relatively modest charge of 2 per cent on a wide base of estates passing on inheritance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government fully appreciates that the occasion on which inheritance tax arises has always been untimely and unwelcome.  For this reason, the Government has been careful <Col N="651" /> to ensure that the family of the deceased is safeguarded against undue hardship. To this end, the Government has provided a full exemption for the family home, including normal house contents, where the deceased is survived by a spouse.  This exemption applies even where the house is not left to the spouse. Where there is no surviving spouse, the share of the home that passes to dependent children or dependent relatives is exempt.  For most families, the home will represent the major asset in the estate. Therefore, this relief should go a long way to ease the probate tax liability of bereaved families.  I should add that this exemption applies irrespective of the value of the home or of the scale of other assets.  The Government has also ensured that pension benefits will be exempt from probate tax, which will benefit the financial security of a surviving spouse.</P>
    <P>The Government has also provided that the probate tax takes account of certain tragic cases where both spouses die in quick succession.  Thus, where both spouses die within five years of one another, leaving a dependent child, the property will not be subject to a double charge to probate tax.  Indeed, where both spouses die within one year of each other, this exemption applies even if there is no dependent child.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific reliefs designed to ease the probate tax liability of bereaved families, it should be borne in mind that the general provisions of the probate tax are such that undue financial hardship should not be encountered by any taxpayer.  In this regard, I should emphasise that estates with a net taxable value of £10,000 or less are exempt from probate tax altogether.  It is fair to say that small estates are generally received by less well-off families, and so this exemption is targeted at those who are most in need of relief.</P>
    <P>The Government has included special provisions to facilitate payment of the probate tax.  There is no question of the deceased's family being hit with a probate tax demand in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement.  On the contrary, I <Col N="652" /> have been careful to ensure that the person faced with the task of administering the deceased's estate will have fully nine months from the time of death to arrange payment of probate tax. During that nine month period, no interest will accrue on the probate tax liability.  Furthermore, where payment is made before the nine months have elapsed, a discount on the tax will be allowed, amounting to 1.5 per cent per month or part of a month.  This innovative feature of the probate tax will adequately compensate for the small interest cost of any bridging finance that may be needed to pay the tax, as well as provide an incentive to early settlement.</P>
    <P>In framing the provisions of the probate tax, the Government has been particularly careful, notwithstanding the modest charge involved, to ensure that due account is taken of ability to pay. The Government recognises that there may be some cases where it may not be possible to discharge the probate tax liability in full before nine months have passed from the date of death, for reasons of illiquidity or hardship.  To deal with this problem, I have granted the Revenue Commissioners considerable discretion to arrange appropriate terms for deferred payment in such cases, having regard to the circumstances of each estate passing on inheritance, and the size of the probate tax liability.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, having regard to the modest rate of tax, the generous reliefs and exemptions and the special provisions designed to avoid difficulties with payment, I am satisfied that the probate tax does not cause financial hardship for families.  While, as with all new taxes, the operation of the probate tax is being monitored on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to remove the probate tax in the 1994 budget.</P>

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, as a general rule, is not payable to people in full time education.  However, I have introduced a number of &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; education schemes on a pilot basis, both at second level and at third level, which give long term unemployed people and lone parents the opportunity to improve their academic qualifications and thereby enhance their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Participants in those schemes who are unemployed receive a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments as well as social welfare secondary benefits, including rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I introduced the third level allowance in July 1990 and participation levels have increased every year.  More than 500 are expected to participate in the current 1993-94 academic year.  The allowance is not available, however, to people pursuing post-graduate studies.  In the context of the ongoing review of the schemes I am having the situation of people who require a post-graduate qualification in order to take up employment examined.</P>

      <P>This matter was considered by the Fair Trade Commission in its report into restrictive practices in the legal profession published in 1990.  The commission was of the view that simply fusing the profession would not be a means of eliminating the present restrictive practices in the profession, although it might affect some of them, and a fused profession <Col N="655" /> would not guarantee the delivery of more efficient and less costly legal services.  The commission concluded that any harm caused, or contributed to, by the divided profession was certainly not so great as to warrant a recommendation by the commission that the two branches of the profession should be compulsorily fused.</P>
      <P>However, the commission did not consider that it would be unfair or contrary to the common good if there were to be a single fused profession and stated that a fused profession might, without being a cause of concern, evolve gradually over time.  It recommended that nothing should be done to frustrate such a development.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present aimed at merging the two branches but that does not mean that I am accepting the policy on this issue must continue to be guided for the future by the views put forward by the commission some years ago.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of foreign fishing vessels arrested by our fishery protection unit over the last five years; the nationality of the vessels; the number of cases that have been heard; the total amount of fines imposed; if the moneys collected from fines have been reinvested in enhancing our fishery protection unit; and the action, if any, he has taken with the foreign countries that persistently breached regulations.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the following table shows, <Col N="660" /> over the past five years 279 foreign registered vessels have been arrested for breaches of fisheries legislation.  The majority of the boats in question have been Spanish, British or French registered. Many of the British registered vessels arrested have been flagship operations owned by Spanish interests.  The number of prosecutions arising from these arrests has amounted to 257 of which 221 have so far come before the courts.  Fines imposed over the period amounted to £4,317,381.50</P>
      <P>As is the practice with fines imposed for breaches of statutory provision, the moneys collected are lodged to the Exchequer rather than allocated for specific purposes such as that to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>While these moneys cannot be channeled directly into the enhancement of the fisheries protection service, I would point out that under the Community Surveillance package a total of £34 million is being provided over the period 1991-95 for the purchase of aircraft, surface vessels, vehicles, communications and data handling equipment for the specific purpose of improving Ireland's fisheries protection service for that purpose.  In 1992 alone, expenditure on new equipment amounted to £8.6 million.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I and the Department are actively pursuing the matter of persistent offenders.  I recently had a wide ranging discussion on protection issues during my meeting in Madrid with my Spanish colleague Mr. Loira Rua.</P>
      <P>In particular I stressed my own and the Government's deep concern about the level of illegal fishing by Spanish fishing vessels within the Irish economic zone. In this context, I emphasised my disquiet about the level of illegal activity by Spanish fishermen and pointed out that almost 50 per cent of all Spanish vessels inspected were arrested for serious fishing offences such as illegal entry, illegal gear and large quantities of undersized fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of our meeting, the Spanish Minister has agreed to the establishment <Col N="661" /> of a framework for enhanced co-operation between the Irish and Spanish control authorities and more active monitoring of vessels suspected of illegal fishing.  This will be achieved through:</P>
    <P>&mdash;regular bilateral meetings at senior level, including inspection staff</P>
    <P>&mdash;exchange of information regarding detentions and warnings</P>
    <P>&mdash;commitment on mutual follow-up on information received  </P>
    <P>As a follow-up to this meeting senior officials of my Department met with their Spanish counterparts and have agreed further measures for closer co-operation on the control and monitoring of fishing by Spanish vessels in the Irish economic zone.</P>
    <P>Contacts with the UK Control authorities take place on a frequent and regular basis in relation to the monitoring of UK vessels in Irish waters and both administrations share the common objective of ensuring the protection of our fisheries resources.</P>
    <P>I have made a strong speech on this at the Fisheries Council.  Copies are available on request from my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 95, 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The currently proposed outline agreement for agriculture was the subject of a series of parliamentary questions on 27 October and on that occasion I made a comperhensive statement detailing the Government's position and its negotiating strategy.  I would refer the Deputy to the Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 435, No. 1 in respect of the statement given in reply to the parliamentary questions. In addition, the Government's position on the Round was outlined in detail in the House on 16 and 17 November.</P>
      <P>There have been no substantive developments on the proposed agriculture agreement since 27 October.  Discussions between the Commission and the US are continuing.  Commissioner Britan met with Mr. Kantor, US Trade Secretary on 22 and 23 November on the overall Round negotiations and further discussions between the two sides are scheduled for next week.</P>
      <P>At the Agriculture Council on 16 and 17 November I again repeated the concerns which I have with the proposed agreement on agriculture and pressed the Commission to secure the solutions to the problems I have identified.  The Commission remains committed to the pursuance of discussions with the US in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Council on 20 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my reply on 27 October, it is not possible to quantify at this stage the actual impact of the commitments on agriculture sectors or economies as this would largely be determined by the internal mechanisms adopted by the Community to fulfil undertakings. This would be a matter for the Council at a later date.  I will, however, be insisting that any GATT commitments will be implemented within the Community in an equitable manner, full account being taken of the importance of agriculture and specific sectors for the economies of <Col N="666" /> different member states and that farmer's income will be maintained at a level consistent with CAP reform.</P>
    <P>Apart from agriculture, there are continuing difficulties in a number of other sectors, including market access, services and textiles, still to be resolved.  At this stage it is not certain whether all outstanding issues can be resolved by the deadline of 15 December although all parties seem committed to respect that deadline.</P>
    <P>As stated on 27 October, Ireland's approach to a final agreement will be decided by the Government when agreement has been reached in all areas and in the light of whether and to what extent our problems have been addressed.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to work towards establishment of individual base areas for arable producers as soon as suitable amendments can be made to Community Regulations. I have already requested changes to the rules in the course of discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  The Commission has agreed in principle to come forward with proposals as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>While no formal proposals have yet been presented to Council, it is my intention to ensure that any amendments made to the regulations will make the operation of the system more practicable and equitable.  In particular, I will be seeking provision for the setting up of a national reserve to cater for hardship cases and new entrants.</P>

      <P>The Value Added Tax Act, 1972 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a zero per cent rate of VAT may be applied to a product which is a Fertilisers, within the meaning of the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act, 1955.  The Revenue Commissioners sometimes seek the technical advice of my Department on products for which they have received applications for exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The product which is the subject of the Deputy's question was examined under this arrangement.  It was found that it was not manufactured as a fertiliser and did not have any plant nutrients added. Nutrient elements occurred only in minute levels which are common to all organic material including vegetation material and agricultural soil.  The product would not therefore add any additional growing power to plants or crops.  It cannot be classified as a fertiliser <Col N="668" /> within the legal or general meaning of the word.</P>

Ar ndóigh, tá dearcadh an Rialtais faoin gceist seo leagtha síos go soiléir sa <i>Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta 1993-1997</i> agus, faoi mar is eol don Teachta, tá scríofa agam chuig an Taoiseach, an Tánaiste agus gach Aire eile ag iarraidh a dtacaíocht chun go mbainfí spriocanna an Chláir amach ina gcuid Ranna féin.</P>

De réir na dtuairisc atá faighte ó na Ranna éagsúla, tá dul chun cinn déanta ag eagrais áirithe ach tá obair mhór le déanamh ag cuid acu go fóill.</P>
    <P>Níl amhras ach go dtógfaidh sé tamall chun an dul chun cinn atá uainn a bhaint amach agus is dóigh liom go gcaithfear a admháil go raibh na spriocann a leagadh síos ró-dhóchasach.

      <P>The report of the study group on the development of psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future</i> published in 1984, recommended a shift in the delivery of services for the mentally ill from an institutional to a community-based service.  This report has been adopted by successive Governments and forms a blueprint for the development of psychiatric services into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of this policy, the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for St. Brendan's Hospital, has developed a comprehensive range of community-based psychiatric services which complement in-patient facilities for acute psychiatric care in St. Brendan's Hospital.  The community based residential, rehabiliation and activity facilities are designed to meet the needs of former long-stay patients of psychiatric <Col N="674" /> hospitals, including St. Brendan's Hospital.</P>
    <P>As a result of the implementation of this policy, the number of in-patients in St. Brendan's Hospital has fallen from 987 in 1986 to 287 in 1993 and units unsuitable for a modern psychiatric service have been phased out.  The health board proposes to phase out one further unit over the next year or two.</P>
    <P>St. Brendan's Hospital now provides three separate services &mdash; an acute psychiatric service, a rehabilitation service and a regional secure facility.  The Eastern Health Board considers that these components of a comprehensive psychiatric service should continue to be based in St. Brendan's Hospital for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the case of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin who is suffering from a severe liver complaint; and if, in view of the history of the case, he will request the Eastern Health Board to assist the family in the cost of the medication.</Quest>

      <P>I have made inquiries of the Eastern Health Board in this case and I understand that the Chief Medical Officer of the board met the family in the last few days and that arrangements have now <Col N="675" /> been made for the person to be seen by a metabolic physician in Temple Street Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a number of community drug schemes through which assistance can be provided to the family in relation to the cost of required medication.  These schemes, however, can only offer assistance towards the cost of allopathic medicines which have been prescribed by a registered medical practitioner and are the subject of a product authorisation.  This ensures that the quality, safety and efficacy of the product has been established to the satisfaction of the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>

      <P>The question of how best to provide improved accommodation for the pupils in the school referred to by the Deputy is under consideration in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>The combined enrolment of the schools in the centre in question is less than 700 and the demographic trends indicate that pupil numbers will decline in the long term.  My Department considers that major capital expenditure should only be provided in the context of a rationalisation of school facilities in the centre.  My Department will continue to consult with the school authorities in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council, as the relevant local authority, is the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme in these cases.</P>
      <P>I understand that the council has requested and is awaiting income details for the 1992-93 tax year to assess the applicant's eligibility for grant assistance in the present academic year.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the Council that for the 1992-93 academic year, one of the applicants was awarded a full fees grant and a partial maintenance grant.  The other was not eligible for a grant for that year as he was repeating the first year of his course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1991-92 academic year both applicants were deemed ineligible for grants in respect of their attendance at third level institutions, on the basis that family reckonable income exceeded the prescribed limits.  My Department has <Col N="677" /> received an appeal against that decision and a response will be conveyed shortly.</P>
