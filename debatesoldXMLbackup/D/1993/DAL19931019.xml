      <Quest>if he will make a statement on his recent talks with the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Paul Keating, outlining the matters discussed; if, in particular, the matter of Australian support for the Indonesian occupation of East Timor was raised; the views Mr. Keating put to him regarding GATT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following our meeting on 20 September 1993, Prime Minister Keating and I held a joint press conference at which we outlined the topics we had discussed.  Our talks focused on GATT, the development of bilateral trade and investment, developments in the EC and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>On GATT, I advised the Prime Minister of our concern about the Blair House Agreement on agricultural trade.  The Prime Minister, in turn, counselled on the dangers inherent in not achieving agreement on the Uruguay Round by mid-December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> On East Timor, I referred to Irish concerns about human rights.  The Prime Minister, in turn, described his policy of constructive engagement with the Indonesian Government, intended to influence the human rights situation positively.</P>
    <P>I reiterated the Government's support for the United Nations policy of achieving resolution of the problem through the talks taking place under the aegis of the United Nations Secretary General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he raised with the Prime Minister the contradiction between the statements he made in this House regarding the support for human rights and the supply by Australia of weapons to the Indonesian Government which are being used to oppress the people of East Timor, an oppression which has resulted in the death of 200,000 East Timorese since 1975?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I pointed out to the Prime Minister our continuous support for the United Nations position on East Timor and that we have done so consistently since the early 1980s.  This calls for talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary General with all the parties directly concerned to work out a comprehensive settlement.  The talks are ongoing, the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, which is the United Nations administering power, met in New York within the past few weeks and we support the continuance of that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Government has adopted this stance from the 1980s although, it may have been noted, not from the mid-1970s when the invasion first took place.  The Irish Government needs to exert much more pressure, not only on Australia but indeed on some of our Community partners, who also support and aid Indonesia in their oppression of this tiny island, which continues to result in the most <Col N="1491" /> appalling abuse of human rights and death.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue to take action in the area, the basis of which I outlined, both with our Community partners and at the United Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the world trade talks, did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to impress on the Prime Minister that the European Community is not the only body that has a protectionist attitude, that agriculture is not the only issue in the world trade talks and that the United States in particular is acutely protectionist on financial services, telecommunications, airlines and the powers of the multilateral trade organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured I impressed that on the Prime Minister and I outlined quite clearly our position on agriculture.  He expressed the fears of the Cairns Group and indeed Australia in relation to access to foreign markets such as Japan and Taiwan, which were the basis of what is known as the Andriessen Understanding.  I said that even if access was to be allowed to the EC into those traditional markets I could not see what the Australians had to fear because the only two countries that had the facility to export to those two countries, due to their disease free status, were Denmark and Ireland.  Consequently, as Denmark is not really an exporter of beef the presence of Irish beef on those markets would not affect the position there.  In relation to the United States I pointed out many of the aspects that Deputy Bruton has properly outlined here and that he might also bear in mind that as far as the export of beef from Ireland to the United States was <Col N="1492" /> concerned, we were now exporting less than we were in the 1950s.  Consequently, there appeared to be some misunderstanding as to the level of access to markets required by the EC to make adjustments.  I also pointed out the many other areas of protectionism that exist in relation to the services and indeed in relation to the Multi-Fibre Agreement. There are various views in relation to certain aspects of that agreement, that some of the countries exporting heavily into the Community have their own markets closed.  Therefore, there is a little more involved than agricultural trade talks, many other areas also require to be sorted out.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach make it clear to Prime Minister Keating that Ireland is opposed to the illegal occupation of East Timor by Indonesia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated what I pointed out to Prime Minister Keating and our position in this regard. We continue to support the position we have taken with the United Nations in its efforts to make an impact on the situation there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to East Timor, does the Taoiseach see any merit in Ireland raising this issue at meetings between the European Community and ASEAN, the South East Asian group of which Indonesia forms part?  Does he see merit in trying to have the question of East Timor included in the agenda for the next meeting between the EC and ASEAN so that we can express our views clearly and, I hope, bring pressure to bear in relation to the human rights issue there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that action at United Nations level, which has been taking place over the past few weeks as a result of meetings between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, is probably a better way to <Col N="1493" /> approach the problem.  We shall continue to do that but I shall bear Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's suggestion in mind.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, he has yet received the report of the Task Force on Services, which he told Dáil Éireann on 15 June 1993, was expected to report by the end of September; if it is intended to publish the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on Services commenced work on 10 June of this year.  The Task Force decided to consider the services sector at two levels, the total sector and four segments within the sector, namely software, research and development, communications and information services; business and internationally traded services generally; tourism, cultural, educational and medical services; and transport, distribution, construction, retail and personal services, and also non-internationally traded services generally.</P>
      <P>The Task Force met on 25 occasions since June at plenary and segment levels. The Task Force has produced a draft of its report to me and intends to finalise this at a meeting on 21 October.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving the Task Force's recommendations on jobs in services. I propose to put copies of the Task Force's report and recommendations in the Oireachtas Library, when completed, and to make copies of the completed report available to interested parties outside the Oireachtas on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach established this Task Force he indicated that it was the intention to have them examine matters which could be brought forward at an early date and issues which could be addressed in the longer term.  Is that the approach that has been adopted by the Task Force?  Can he <Col N="1494" /> indicate what precise proposals about the creation of jobs are contained in their interim or draft report presented to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the recommendations of the Task Force will cover two broad areas &mdash; incentive changes, including taxation, and organisational changes.  That is along the lines suggested by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is more potential for job creation in the services sector than in any other and that the services sector is currently discriminated against by the State as far as grants and corporation tax are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would accept that there is scope for a large improvement in jobs provided by the services sector.  It was against that background I established this Task Force in June last.  I am glad to say that they have reported just a week or two behind schedule.  I have previously pointed out in the House that employment in manufacturing in many international economies has declined and has been running at approximately 16 per cent over the past 15 years, whereas in Ireland it has been running at approximately 28 per cent.  The services sector in the United States represents 77 per cent of the jobs in that economy whereas here it represents 59 per cent.  Quite clearly there is scope for improvement.  That was the purpose of establishing the Task Force and the purpose of its recommendations will be to endeavour to improve our performance in relation to jobs in the services sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have said already I will make it available to Members of the Oireachtas, have it placed in the <Col N="1495" /> Oireachtas Library and give it to those interested in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he has already received a draft report from the Task Force.  I presume he studied that draft before its final publication.  Can he indicate to the House how many jobs the Task Force has identified as being possible to create resulting from the changes they recommend?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into any detail in relation to the draft report given to me.  There will be plenty of time for discussion of it when the final report has been approved by the Task Force.  It would be inappropriate of me to do otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have this report to hand when he drew up the employment targets contained in the National Development Plan or will those targets have to be revised in the light of the information contained in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that the National Development Plan was prepared some time ago whereas this report has come to hand very recently.  I do not think anybody would object to targets being changed or revised at any time if we can see our way to increasing those job targets upwards.</P>

These included a meeting in London with the British Prime Minister and the European Council meeting in Copenhagen.  Excluding summer holidays, the periods during which we were both absent from the country did not, in the majority of cases, exceed two days. On two occasions, we were both abroad simultaneously for six days.</P>
      <P>Throughout these periods, both the Tánaiste and I remained in charge of, and in direct contact with, our Departments at all times.  In accordance with long standing practice, it was not necessary to assign my duties and functions during my absence to another member of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its formation this Government has introduced a range of reform measures which have radically changed the way the Dáil conducts its business.  These include the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, a separate Taoiseach's Question Time and, to streamline the passage of legislation, the introduction of time limits to Second Stage speeches and, perhaps most importantly, the formation of a new committee system covering all the areas of Government legislative activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the Whips are agreed on the importance of getting the new committee system right and recognise that it is still <Col N="1498" /> experimental in the way it operates. However, there is general agreement that the committees are working very effectively in their role as legislative committees.</P>
    <P>During the last session committee meetings were held on Fridays.  For this session the Dáil will meet in plenary session for four weeks and committees only will meet in the fifth week.  The suggestion that the Dáil should meet in this way came initially from an Opposition Party. The Government accepted the merits of the proposal.  I believe this is a clear indication of the Governments willingness to listen to constructive proposals from all sides.</P>
    <P>I recognise there are still difficulties within the context of Dáil proceedings and practices that need to be addressed but these will be addressed with the agreement of the Whips.  I am preparing further reform measures, including measures to improve the operation of the committee system, which I will be discussing with the other Whips.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of privilege and compellability of witnesses before Oireachtas committees, legislative proposals are being prepared by the Minister for Finance.  It is envisaged that such legislation will be published this session.</P>

I hope he will be forthcoming in regard to what I am about to suggest to him, that the legislation concerning compellability and privilege of witnesses should not be confined solely to the committees that have the power to send for papers.  For example the committee which is now examining the Glackin report does not, as I understand it, have that power. Would the Minister agree that the new committees established in this Dáil should have that privilege, and compellability too?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is concern among many Members, not just Members on this side of the House, at the increasing number of important announcements being made outside the House, thereby denying us the opportunity to cross-examine the Taoiseach and his Ministers?  Would the Minister agree further that in these circumstances Question Time is of particular interest and usefulness to the Opposition and, consequently, that its importance should not be diminished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the importance of Question Time should not be diminished.  The arrangement we have made meets the concerns of the Deputy. Question Time will continue to be an important part of the plenary session of the House.  In addition we are retaining <Col N="1502" /> the adjournment debate procedure, and that, too, will afford Members the opportunity, during Committee week, of asking Ministers to address matters of concern.  In the first session of the House we tried to impose, to a certain extent, the new system on the old by having committee meetings confined to certain days.  Members were gravely dissatisfied with that system on the grounds that it was very disruptive of their business and their schedule.  This is an attempt to address those concerns.  As I have said already, if this system does not work we will try something else and in that regard I am amenable to suggestions.</P>
      <P>With reference to making committees more effective I should say that during the period when it was alleged that Deputies were on holidays six Bills were put through Committee Stage.  Had the committees not met during that period every week between now and Christmas would be taken up with those six Bills which are now at Report and Final Stages.  The committees were set up to process legislation more quickly and in that respect they have been successful. However, a certain amount of confusion seems to have arisen.  Some Members would like to see the role of committees extended but that is something which can be examined in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 45 and 68 together.  The Government's plans for job creation and economic development are contained in the Programme for Government, the Government's response to the Culliton report, in the draft National Plan and in specific initiatives like the restructuring of certain State agencies which the Government has taken since coming to <Col N="1505" /> office.  All of these have been discussed extensively in public.  They are designed to improve the framework for economic development in the short and longer term and to lead to job creation.</P>
      <P>In relation to third level graduates, there are specific schemes like the FÁS graduate placement programme; the financial graduates programme and the European orientation programme. Expenditure under the EOLAS grant-in-aid and the science and technology development programmes funded through my Department's Vote have a more focused bearing on graduates in the engineering and applied sciences areas. There is a number of schemes which include for example: funding for some 260 graduates this year to proceed to M.Scs and Ph.Ds; 200 graduates recruited each year under the TECH-START scheme to help industry improve their technology; 50 technologists under the technology management programme to help companies identify major technological hurdles needing correction; more than 150 projects under way under the higher education-industry co-operation scheme designed to create greater interaction between third level and industry; and new projects approved by EOLAS under the basic research scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, some £43.4 million is being spent under the science and technology programme this year as against £27 million in 1992.  The 1993 figure includes £23 million for the industry research and development initiative.  Within the EOLAS grant-in-aid itself, the amount of funding provided for basic research is slightly up in 1993.  All these funds are applied, directly or indirectly, to increasing the level of research and development activity in Ireland; in improving the rate of technology take-up in Irish industry and generally in improving national competitiveness. At the end of the day the best underpinning for lasting success on the jobs front is our ability to compete <Col N="1506" /> against other countries who themselves are continually upgrading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that surveys by the Higher Education Authority indicate that 28 per cent of our graduates have to go overseas in search of work in the first year after graduation, that means that 7,500 graduates had to emigrate within a year of completing their course during the period of the National Development Plan 1989-93, among them 1,300 engineers, 1,200 business graduates and 1,000 science graduates. Given that those 7,500 people carried with them £200 million worth of taxpayers' investment, does he agree that we should make a much greater effort to find placements for them in Irish business both in the services and industrial sectors because they are the seed capital of Ireland's future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, broadly speaking, of the statistics to which the Deputy refers but I refer him to the historical precedent which, over a long period, saw the short term migration of such graduates for necessary experience abroad.  If the analysis was available to him, I think the Deputy would find that a great deal of the migration to which the survey refers was voluntary, which leads to people getting the necessary experience abroad which they subsequently bring back with enhanced value for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ.  Any examination of Ireland's emigration figures over the past eight to ten years would show a steady attrition.  During the course of the National Development Plan, 98,000 emigrated, 90 per cent of whom are young people.  There is no evidence that they are returning in large numbers.  Would he not agree, therefore, that in the course of the draft National Development Plan we will have to develop effective placements not only for our graduates, about whom we have <Col N="1507" /> statistics, but for the very many highly trained people from other educational institutions who are going to contribute to the economies of other countries and not to the future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to graduate migration and I suggest there is a pattern, which has been well established over a long period, of short term migration for graduates of engineering, science and architecture.  This is borne out when one asks the placement officers in any of our five medical schools, or our three engineering schools where we have been producing from 1930 onwards consistently in excess of the demands of the local economy.</P>
      <P>I suggest that in the period over the past five years there are now more programme initiatives available to facilitate graduate placement at home than at any time in the past.  I take on board the points the Deputy makes and we will try to get more qualitative analysis and statistics to ensure that we do not suffer unnecessary loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 48 and 52 together.  The objective of the IDA's small industry programme is to encourage employment growth and wealth creation in the regions in a cost effective manner by fostering the growth of sound, commercially viable enterprise.</P>
      <P>The lower level of support to small industry reflects the implementation of changes in the small industry programme introduced at the beginning of 1988 which established a two tiered hierarchy of project support as follows: for start-up companies and firms with scope for incremental employment growth of up to 15 people, support was confined to employment grants at a maximum of £5,000 between 1988-90 and reduced to £4,000 in 1991.  For companies with potential to create more than 15 jobs a wider range of incentives is available including employment, capital, management and product development grants.</P>
      <P>Small companies, mainly labour intensive and with less structured management, tend to operate in the domestic market and through import substitution compete with international competitors on the home market.  Larger companies tend to require higher levels of capital investment to enable them to build the scale necessary to compete in international markets.  These companies must also develop broader management structures. It is also a fact that larger companies have a greater impact on the economy through the purchase of Irish raw materials and services than small companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average IDA grant cost per job created and sustained in small industry over the period 1982-88 was £11,841 (constant 1992 prices).  For the period 1986-92 it had been reduced to £8,627 (constant 1992 prices), a reduction of 27 per cent.  The average IDA grant cost per job created and sustained for indigenous industry over the period 1982-88 was £15,488 (constant 1992 prices).  For the <Col N="1509" /> period 1986-92 this had been reduced to £10,832, a reduction of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, in the final analysis, State support to industrial projects, regardless of size, must reflect the economic benefits and value for money deriving from such projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that, as the material in his brief seems to suggest, a job created in a small business should get only half the assistance of a job created in a large business? Does he agree that this bias confirms the fact that Ireland has a very small enterprise start-up group?  The Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach recently adverted publicly to the fact that had we the same number of small business start-ups there would be 20,000 additional people at work.  Does he agree that if we are to have a serious commitment to small business we must remove this bias and give access on an equal basis to small companies trying to establish and gain a foothold in the market, as the small companies will become larger one day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's supplementary raises a totally different issue.  The question I was asked to respond to was the reason for a differential in the grant made available by the IDA to different types of Irish firms. The reason for the differential between smaller and larger firms is set out in my reply.  The economic cost of providing a job in a small Irish firm is less than that for a large firm.  I agree that we need to create more start-ups in general and facilitate an increase in the number of new enterprises.  However, that must be done in an efficient and effective manner. Is the Deputy suggesting that we should allocate more money than is required to facilitate the creation of jobs in small Irish industries, which is what the Deputy implied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does all the evidence <Col N="1510" /> not suggest that one of the matters killing off small businesses is the lack of access to long term capital?  One need only take a cursory glance at any of the recent reports on the plight of small industry to recognise that.  Will the Minister agree, therefore, that a bias to the extent that double the money available to small enterprises is available to large enterprises cannot be condoned?  Small businesses must have access to long term capital so that small scale business start-ups are put on a proper footing.</P>

      <P>The measure of success of county enterprise boards will be the extent to which they achieve their objectives.  The objectives of the county enterprise boards will be strategic and the funding available to them should provide a new source of much needed support for local enterprise initiatives.  The county enterprise boards have given clear enterprise and job creation objectives and will be responsible for business areas not already covered by the State industrial development agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their key task will be to tap the employment opportunities in their localities through: developing enterprise action plans covering all sectors in their county; creating local enterprise awareness and developing an enterprise culture to ensure community based enterprise <Col N="1512" /> activity; providing grant support to individuals and local community groups to assist commercially viable small enterprise projects and influencing the allocation of resources for small enterprises from European Community, private and public funding sources.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the objectives of each county enterprise board are to focus, develop and support the main forces of local entrepreneurship and enterprise within the framework of coherent, integrated county enterprise action plans so as to build a local economy of real strength and permanence.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise co-ordinating committee, together with the monitoring committee to be established to monitor the operational programme on local development under the national plan 1994-99, will evaluate the progress of the boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that there is a great deal of goodwill in all parties for what is known as bottom up, or local development. However, will the Minister agree that there is widespread anxiety that the raft of institutions which he is setting up through the county enterprise boards, the regional boards and the extensive local development initiatives will create a proliferation of committees and bureaucracies which have never been the source of enterprise here at either local or national level?  Will he agree that we need more specific litmus tests against which this structure could be tested?  This should be a temporary and experimental structure and be forced to prove itself rapidly.  Will the Minister agree that it will be difficult in one or two years' time to say whether the network is a success or failure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To put it bluntly, will the Minister agree that, from what he stated in his reply, it will be difficult in two or three years' time to obtain an answer in this House which can be properly evaluated as to whether this structure has worked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  I welcome the commitment across the political spectrum in this House towards the concept of bottom-up development.  The nature of the development is such that we are not exactly sure what components of such a widespread approach will be successful.  Accordingly, we have established 36 county enterprise partnership boards in the local authority structures throughout the country.  They have clear strategic objectives, budgets and terms of reference and in one, two or three years' time we will be able to answer the hypothetical question posed by the Deputy.  We will be able to contrast the number of jobs promised with those sustained, measure the amount of money each board received from this House through my Department and how much of that money has resulted in the creation of sustainable jobs.  I do not believe that to proceed on a pilot basis &mdash; which I suspect is what the Deputy suggests &mdash; would be fair at this time.  If the commitment to bottom-up development exists we should make it available throughout the country on reasonably flexible terms, which is what we have done, but also in a manner which will enable us to monitor its success and take whatever corrective action is necessary. That process is in place at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the establishment of 172 committees, set up between the 36 county enterprise boards and their evaluation committees, the nine regional authorities and their evaluation committees, the 42 local development initiatives and their evaluation committees, is a huge superstructure to impose on local enterprise? <Col N="1514" /> Would it not be better to develop a genuine bottom-up enterprise culture with the ability to answer to one regional authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy.  The basis of his opening statement was that he favoured bottom-up development and we have created a multi-layered structure within which such development can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might as well say that there should be just one central structure within which to operate, but that would be contradictory.  For people living in Clare, in Cork North East or in any of the 12 area-based <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> companies there is no confusion.  There may be confusion from a central point of view, but the Deputy is contradicting his analysis by looking at it from that perspective.  If he examines it from the perspective of the average person there is little or no confusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 122 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> There are no official statistics on the level of absenteeism among the Irish workforce.  However, there have been a number of surveys and reports on the subject, including one recently undertaken by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.  These are outlined in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism rates are difficult to assess and compare due to the existence of different definitions of the term.  The IBEC definition was fairly wide &mdash; it includes maternity leave, certified illness as well as both excused and unauthorised absences.  The definition covered all days lost from work for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism is a cause of concern due to its detrimental effects in terms of increased costs and reduced productivity and competitiveness.  The control of absenteeism is an essential element in managing an enterprise and is the primary responsibility of the management at each workplace.  Experience has shown that those enterprises which have adopted specific absence control policies and measures, including the keeping of necessary records, have been successful in reducing absenteeism.  It is, therefore, clearly in the interests of enterprises to implement suitable absenteeism control strategies.  Assistance in this regard is available to member companies of such representative bodies as IBEC.  I would strongly urge enterprises to take appropriate measures in this area and to adopt progressive personnel policies generally with a view to reducing absenteeism and having a motivated and satisfied workforce.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not recognise there is a serious gap in the information on industrial and economic performance when we do not know how we compare on an indicator such as absenteeism?  Is he aware that IBEC estimate the cost of absenteeism is £600 million in lost output?  Its document suggests our rate of absenteeism is two and a half times that of Japan and higher than several other countries.  Will he carry out the survey as suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously read the IBEC report and he will be aware that it quotes the recent survey in the UK's bulletin of social trends in the European Community which found that Ireland has an absentee rate of 1.2 per cent, the fourth lowest within the Community. It compares with rates of 4.6 per cent in Holland, the highest rate in the Community, and 2.7 per cent in Britain. Absenteeism in this survey was defined on different bases.  However, we have data that enable us to look at our performance relative to other countries. They are not entirely comparable because of the lack of a unified definition <Col N="1520" /> of what absenteeism constitutes.  The cost of absenteeism to the Irish economy is totally unacceptable.  It is calculated that 11 days per worker per year were lost on average due to absenteeism, a total of 12.5 million working days per year, at a relative cost of £575 million.  There are structures in place, for example, programmes to assist management who have the primary responsibility in reducing the level of absenteeism.  Independent surveys from all quarters indicate that management is the primary agent for ensuring that levels of absenteeism are reduced by the implementation of such programmes.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to be relatively happy with the reliance on second or third hand statistics based on questions that make it difficult to compare data.  I ask him to justify his attitude. Does he see his Department as having no role in the encouragement of a reduced level of absenteeism in the workplace and an improved statistical return in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Deputy believes I was complacent and satisfied with a loss of 12.5 million working days <Col N="1521" /> to the Irish economy at a cost of £575 million.  On the contrary, I am far from complacent in this regard but the primary responsibility lies with management. There is no other mechanism available to my Department in regard to the level of absenteeism unless management take action.  Management could introduce absenteeism programmes and there are numerous models available through employer organisations such as IBEC. If the level of communication through works councils and information exchange within enterprises was developed by management, awareness of the significance and cost to the overall viability of an enterprise and, consequently, the vulnerability of workers' jobs would be heightened and the level of absenteeism would be reduced.  I do not regard this issue with complacency.  When one contrasts the number of days lost through industrial disputes as against absenteeism, the figures are frightening and it is a problem that affects everybody. Primary responsibility rests with management and we are ready to provide assistance if they take the initiative.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the areas contributing to absenteeism is that of rotating sick leave within companies where there is an agreed amount of sick leave on an annual basis which is taken almost as part of the holiday agreement within a company? Perhaps this antiquated practice could be considered in ongoing discussions between the unions, it does not contribute to harmony within the workplace because some workers would not avail of it in that way.  It creates obvious difficulties and, from the statistics, it is one of the major contributors to absenteeism.</P>

Will the Minister accept there is confusion in those figures and that unless the Minister does a survey under the aegis of the Department which would look at the extent, causes and possible remedial action to be taken, we cannot deal with the problem?  By not having such a survey, the Minister is failing to contribute to our understanding of the problem &mdash; although we cannot decide whether we have a problem unless we have figures on which we can rely as to the extent and cause of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the <i>Nature</i> magazine article to which the Deputy refers and I do not agree with its thrust.  The article was written without any prior consultation with the Office of Science and Technology in my Department and it wrongly attributes certain remarks to Ministers.  Let me put the record straight.</P>
      <P>According to the Eolas S &amp; T Annual Audit, State funding for science and technology in its broadest sense rose from £396 million in 1988 to £454 million in 1990 to an estimated £556 million in 1992. The bulk of this is in the area of education, where in 1993 funding by the Department of Education for third level and further education rose from £283 million to £299 million.</P>
      <P>As regards funding provided by my Department specifically for S &amp; T, the two main sources in my Department's Vote are the Eolas grant-in-aid and the S &amp; T development programme.  The Eolas grant-in-aid overall went from £9,282,000 in 1992 to £11,436,000 in 1993 while the S &amp; T development programme was cut from £27,843,000 to £20,465,000. However, when a non-voted sum of £23,416,000 for the industry R &amp; D initiative is added, then the budget for S &amp; T rose from £27,843,000 to £43,871,000.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by Eolas that the amount provided in their grant-in-aid for basic science in 1993 is actually up on the 1992 figure.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that, at a time when we are trying to retain jobs, create jobs and attract foreign jobs, a banner headline in the top international science magazine which <Col N="1525" /> says that the Irish Government turned its back on science, is not helpful?  We are not talking about EC funding or applied research.  We are talking about first time projects in university and Eolas notified the universities that they could not start any new strategic projects this year.  The headline which has gone around the world with the Culliton report which confirms that out of 23 countries we are second from the bottom in terms of science and innovation, coupled with the fact it has been proved that in terms of research and money to scientific discovery we rank behind Turkey and Yugoslavia, is doing irreparable damage to our international reputation.  There seems to be an unwarranted purge against universities which have been the unrecognised incubators for good industrial ideas here.</P>

I have decided to establish a science and technology review group about which there will be an announcement in the next couple of weeks.  I will ask that group to look at the points which the Deputy brought to my attention.  Funding for science and technology at third level from the Department of Education has gone from £283 million to £299 million in one year, a significant amount of funding for third level and further education.  That sum has increased virtually every year since.  The sum is substantial although it will never be enough and that magazine article was not helpful.

Will the Minister not agree that he is a little disingenuous in suggesting that <i>Nature</i> got it all wrong and that official statistics from the EC indicate that Ireland's Government research effort at 37 ECU per head of population is only one quarter of that for the EC 12 as a whole?

      <P>I have not read Deputy Upton's article, but I will study it.  All I can do is operate on the figures available to me, that spending through my Department, a substantial amount of it European funding, will amount to £43 million this year compared with £27 million the previous year.  In additon, spending in the education sector has increased from £283 million to £299 million.  I take the Deputy's point that we have not committed as much finance as some of our international partners towards science and technology.  For this reason I will ask the review group to make some recommendations in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that our only hope of creating jobs lies in research and development and in view of the information from the OECD that we lag far behind will the Minister of State agree that it is time the Government availed of the opportunity to make money available for research and development?  At a conferring ceremony last week the president of DCU strongly criticised the lack of opportunities for highly qualified graduates to carry out research.  In the absence of any opportunities to use this expertise they will not be able to help in the creation of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot meet the demands for funding in the area of science and technology.  For example, in <Col N="1527" /> regard to one programme, Measure 6, which is funded by the European Community, the demands for funding would have taken up three or four times the amount available from the Community. The Deputy is correct in the sense that Irish business and universities have an exciting opportunity to do more in this area.  I will make every effort to ensure that this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is using the figures to create the best possible impression.  The bottom line is that the science and technology development fund has been reduced from £27 million to £20 million.  Will the Minister agree that Ireland has always had a poor image when it comes to research and development? Given that 80 per cent of the jobs that will be created by the end of the decade will be in the science and technology area would the Minister of State agree that the gap in spending <i>per capita</i> between ourselves and our European colleagues will be much larger in six or seven years' time?  Will he agree that for this reason we need to find substantial funds and create linkages between industry and the universities to ensure that the necessary research and development is carried out?  This is not happening at present and that is the point we are trying to get across today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I admitted that funding for the research and development programme had been cut from £27 million to £20 million; I am not trying to conceal that fact.  However, as I explained, additional European Community funding, particularly under Measure 6, more than makes up for this. As a result the overall figure has been increased substantially on the amount for the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but Measure 6 is targeted more at industry than at the universities.  The <Col N="1528" /> universities should take into account the fact that their budgets have been increased.  To secure additional investment in science and technology we must have a comprehensive policy.  I am asking the review group to work with me in producing that policy so that I will be able to argue, at Government level, for increased funding in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow up the point made by Deputy Cullen, would the Minister of State agree that the budget for third level education has been increased, as he said, by £10 million while the budget for research and development has been cut by 1 per cent?  Would he agree that Government spending on research and development has again been reduced this when the European Community offered to fund a new support programme? Would he further agree &mdash; this fact has been proven &mdash; that there is a considerable brain drain of top class science graduates who are carrying out post graduate work of enormous importance abroad for our competitors and that these graduates do not return once they leave this country?  Last week at a special conference Irish research scientists made the point that the equipment they are working with is hopelessly obsolete.  Will the Minister ensure that they are represented on the review body?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £556 million from the State is spent by industry and the universities in one year on science and technology.  Like the Deputy, I am concerned at the lack of funds available to me for post graduate research in particular. I acknowledge that there has been a shift in emphasis towards industry under the Measure 6 programme with the result that substantial additional funding has been made available to industry and it appears to be at the expense of post's graduate research work.  This matter is being discussed in the Department.</P>

Essential research and development work was carried out at that centre.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is keenly aware of the important role that the services sector plays in creating employment in Ireland.  Currently, more than 60 per cent of all jobs are in services.  Any initiatives which can further improve the capacity of this sector to create additional jobs will be actively pursued.</P>
      <P>As far as my area of responsibility is concerned, the following initiatives will, I believe, make a substantial contribution to facilitating the creation of new jobs in services.</P>
      <P>First, the newly established county enterprise boards will fill a gap which has become apparent in the support services for local enterprise initiatives.  They will bring a variety of interests together to set objectives for promoting enterprise in their area, prepare a strategic plan and provide assistance to small enterprise projects, including services projects, which can yield a cost effective return in terms of job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, specific proposals have been developed for the software sector with a view to employment expanding from a current base of 8,000 to 20,000 by the end of the decade.  A specific target of 2,000 jobs has also been set in relation to telecommunications based services.  I refer to telemarketing in particular. Third, as regards international services, I would refer the Deputy to my answer <Col N="1530" /> to Question No. 106 which I gave to the House on 22 June 1993.  Fourth, while FÁS does not operate any programmes or schemes which are specifically targeted at the services sector, it does provide support by way of training programmes and employment schemes for persons interested in setting up small businesses. Fifth, the implementation of the recommendations of the Culliton and Moriarty reports, on which substantial progress has been made under this Government, will radically improve the competitive environment for all businesses, including services, and in the process improve the prospects for creating additional sustainable jobs in all sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition to all of these measures, my Department is represented on the Task Force on Jobs in Services, which will be submitting its report shortly to the Taoiseach.  I look forward to reading its conclusions, which will be fully taken into account by me in deciding on any further measures needed to improve the opportunity for creating additional sustainable jobs in services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has announced no new specific initiatives despite his participation in the task force.  Is the Minister aware that the cost to the Industrial Development Authority of creating a job in international services is half the cost of creating a job in manufacturing?  Yet, only 8 per cent of the budget of the Industrial Development Authority is targeted at this important sector.  Would the Minister agree that we need to redirect our efforts dramatically and concentrate on creating employment in the services sector rather than in manufacturing? Would he agree with the recommendation of the taxation commission some years ago that the services sector should pay corporation tax at a rate equivalent to the personal rate of income tax? Does he realise that if we take together the 21 per cent VAT rate which applies to most services, the 21 per cent PRSI rate and the 40 per cent profits tax out of every one pound spent by the consumer on services 60 pence goes to the Government <Col N="1531" /> and we are lucky if 5 pence is left for business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government is not focused on the potential for job creation through the services sector.  As the Taoiseach outlined in some detail earlier today, the Government is not only aware of the potential for sustainable job creation, it is taking specific action in this area and the report of the task force will become available fairly soon.</P>
      <P>In regard to my own activities and those of the IDA for which I have responsibility, the IDA has been active for a number of years in the area of internationally traded services, the tax regime for internationally traded services is as favourable in many respects as it is for manufacturing industry.  Within the context we have identified an area of considerable potential benefit to the economy, specifically, software where the link between the intellectual infrastructure of our third level institutions can be combined with international computer companies.  We had great success in recent times in attracting major players to this country in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, telemarketing has the potential to create at least 2,000 jobs in the first instance.  It should be understood that the cost of providing services jobs in the telemarketing sector must take into account the massive capital investment this State made through Telecom Éireann in the telephone system, the infrastructure within which such services jobs can be provided.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative the Deputy's party has taken in respect of services. We share Fine Gael's concern about the potential in this area.</P>

In regard to the services sector he mentioned the county enterprise boards and his initiatives in regard to software etc.  There has been a lack of recognition of the services sector.  I compliment Deputy Richard Bruton on his comprehensive document relating to this area.  In the past many small industries were prevented from getting off the ground because the IDA or SFADCo felt there were already sufficient resources in that area.  Will the county enterprise boards give support to such ventures?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the services sector needs a boost?  As a businessman said to me during the week, they are made to feel like criminals for being in business; they are harassed by high taxation, PRSI, social welfare etc.  What succour can the Minister give those business people nowadays beyond what he already stated?</P>

Many of the concerns mentioned to Deputy Finucane during the week will be identified, quantified and, I hope, addressed by the Government during its term in office.  In regard to job creation in the services sector State capital will, for the first time, be available for the creation of service related employment throughout the economy through the county enterprise partnership boards for precisely the type of employment that employs one, two, three or four people.  This was not the case previously.  Proposals with the potential to create ten jobs or more in the manufacturing area will automatically be referred by the county enterprise boards to Forbairt, the domestic successor to the IDA at local level.  All other projects, including service jobs and manufacturing jobs below that employment threshold will come within the remit of the county enterprise partnership boards and there are substantial resources available to provide the kind of support that was not there in the past.</P>

      <P>If the Minister read our document on employment in May 1992 he would have noted that we planned the extension of many incentives to the service sector, our commitment to that has been constant.  Will the Minister agree that the services we are committed to providing for small indigenous industries are as important in the service sector where there is potential for export earnings? Tourism apart, we run a massive trade deficit on service activities.  Will he also agree that there is a need to extend the type of services available through the IDA and the other State agencies to the service sector?  That has not been included in the national plan.  Will the Minister reconsider so that at this stage we could get a commitment in the national plan to extend such services to that sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about promoting the extension of internationally traded services' activities from companies based in this country. However, there is a problem in regard to the dividing line between the international component of such traded services and the domestic component where we could be open to the legitimate accusation of fostering displacement between one service company and another, we would not wish to do that.  I am sure the Deputy, as a professional economist, understands the significance of that far <Col N="1535" /> better than I do.  We are anxious to ensure that the international trend in increased job and wealth creation in the service sector, as against manufacturing industry, is something to which the economy would have regard and relate to as quickly as possible to ensure that we maintain the momentum of economic growth and job creation.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the industrial programme of the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, did not adopt net job targets, as recommended by the ESRI.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of targeting for net job creation is fully accepted by me.  To this end, the National Development Plan sets as a goal the achievement of an annual net gain in manufacturing and international service employment of the order of 5,000 jobs. The achievement of this target will depend on improved annual growth rates in international markets compared with those that have prevailed in recent years and the adoption of appropriate pay and other policies in Ireland which impact on and improve the competitiveness of firms.  The Government, for its part, will strive to ensure that the elements over which it has control will continue to make a positive contribution to net job creation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall the ESRI's warning that it would be absurd to ignore the causes of jobs attrition and to point only to gross job creation figures, as happened in the past week, with a figure of 200,000 jobs being mentioned?  Would he not agree that the key reason the ESRI wanted to see net targets as the central objective was that there was a lack of effective policies to protect employment?  The national plan fails to address the task of protecting <Col N="1536" /> existing jobs.  This year there will be almost 20,000 redundancies.  Would the Minister not agree that we need to concentrate on effective strategies for job protection, which is at the core of the ESRI's desire to see net targets being used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government has been concentrating exclusively on gross job targets set out in the plan.  The Taoiseach was criticised for being too modest and pessimistic in stating that we are facing in the order of 130,000 job losses, some due to technological redundancies in the industrial manufacturing sector and some to the continued loss of jobs in the agricultural sector.  From the outset we said there would be job losses, over some of which we have no control.  There are others over which we have a certain degree of control.</P>
      <P>I have set up in the Department of Enterprise and Employment the competition and employment protection unit which is designed to identify in advance those jobs at risk due to lack of competitiveness, technological redundancy or other factors.  Given sufficient advance notice, corrective action could be taken to ensure the preservation of jobs for a period of time during which they might not otherwise survive.  We are aware of the ESRI analysis.  The Department has taken specific steps to set up a competition and employment protection unit to assist firms and employees who feel that their jobs are under threat in the short to mid-term.  We recognise that competitiveness in the broadest sense is essential if jobs are to be maintained in those sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the target for net jobs as outlined by the Taoiseach in the National Development Plan is extremely modest?  Even without the £8 billion being provided from Europe we would be expected to achieve this level of growth.  Is the Minister happy with the figures that have been outlined?  Does he not think that net growth of a more substantial nature will <Col N="1537" /> be required if any impact is to be made in reducing unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the characteristics of the national plan, referred to by most independent commentators, is that it is factual and the figures contained therein are on the modest side rather than the over optimistic side.  We have to start by telling people the truth, and the truth is, as Deputy Bruton indicated earlier, that redundancies in the private sector &mdash; that is where redundancies take place &mdash; will be in the order of 19,000 to 20,000 this year.  In the past ten years or so more than 200,000 jobs have been lost in this sector.  These are the facts and I am far from being happy with them, but to try to conceal or modify them will make nobody happy in the long run.  We must deal first and foremost with the present situation.  I suggest to Deputy Bruton that the way to proceed is to provide an early warning system for those firms individually at risk so that there would be sufficient time to respond.  In overall terms costs in the national macro-economic structure, particularly labour costs, would be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the new unit set up in the Department is a phantom considering that 400 jobs per week are being lost?  There is no evidence that this unit is active in saving jobs.  Will the Minister agree, bearing in mind his figure of 5,000 net jobs in the industrial sector, that on the basis of the Culliton figures the net cost would be £120,000 per job per year?  Because the Minister is not considering the issue of how to strengthen the companies that are in danger of losing jobs, that will be the result, with huge costs for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  The employment protection unit of the Department was established in July of this year, less than six months after the new Department was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government.  It will take some time for the work of this unit to take effect because it will operate an early warning system.  Regrettably some jobs are currently being lost because when people woke up to the problems it was too late.  We hope to learn from the lessons of the CIO reports of the sixties which identified potential areas of job losses but subsequently took little or no action to avert such losses.</P>
      <P>The provision of such a unit in the Department is the first step in providing an early warning system for employers and employees in an area of sensitivity. It will enable them to seek the assistance of the IDA, FÁS, Eolas and any other body capable of assisting them to upgrade their technology and improve their position so that their current jobs can be protected.  That is an advance on any previous arrangement.  I would encourage Deputies who may be aware of companies concerned about their viability to advise them to contact, on a confidential basis, that unit in the Department to seek whatever assistance is available to them.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Programme for Government and the early warning system.  I suggest that that system is not working. This can be seen from the recent case <Col N="1540" /> involving Telemara Teoranta in the Connemara Gaeltacht where 85 jobs were lost.  Despite the fact that two Government Ministers represent that area, no early warning system was in operation. We do not seem to have learned any lessons from the Digital case last year.  I should like to ask the Minister the number of people working in the early warning system unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 51 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I am indeed aware of the problems being experienced by the textile, clothing and footwear sectors, which are of great concern to me.  Over the past year there have, unfortunately, been a number of closures in textiles and clothing manufacturing and, since the beginning of 1993, approximately 1,400 jobs have been lost in these sectors.  However, when account is taken of new jobs created in 1993, the net loss is approximately 950.  The job losses are due to a combination of factors including an overall lack of competitiveness particularly when compared with exports from low cost third countries, a slow down in consumer demand due to the worldwide recession and low profit margins.</P>
      <P>I recently had a very constructive meeting with a delegation from the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation where we discussed difficulties being experienced in the clothing sector and explored ways in which they might be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is essential, in resolving the industry's difficulties, that the key issue of competitiveness is addressed in a serious manner.  The clothing sector, in particular, will need to change direction and restructure in order to take the competitive advantage it has in terms of service, shorter lead times, improved technology, quality and design.  The main objective of this strategy is to develop strong companies which are able to compete in both the domestic and international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 August 1993 I announced two <Col N="1543" /> special initiatives for the clothing and footwear sectors which are specifically designed to help companies become more competitive.  They are: (i) a research and development scheme which will operate under the existing R&amp;D programmes run by the industrial development State agencies and (ii) a FÁS training support scheme.  These schemes will operate for a 12-month period and a sum of up to £5 million is being set aside to meet the demands of companies that satisfy the relevant criteria.  The State agencies are in contact with companies in the sectors and are actively promoting the schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition to these schemes a review group comprising of representatives from my Department and the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare is at present examining the impact of the current rate of employers' PRSI charges on low paid manufacturing industries.  It is hoped that this group will conclude its deliberations on this complex issue in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these initiatives, coupled with the agreement on overall strategy, will provide renewed confidence in these sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the lack of competitiveness in many Irish companies.  The Larbaun plant in Westport was recently closed with the loss of 60 jobs.  Is the Minister satisfied that the competition authority which was set up a number of years ago has sufficient strength and teeth to investigate allegations of the abuse of a dominant position by a player in the market?  Sixty jobs were lost in the Larbaun plant because contractual obligations were not fulfilled on time.  This happened despite the fact that, due to reform of work practices, absenteeism was less than 3 per cent and efficiency and productivity had more than doubled in a 12-month period. Will the Minister ensure that the competition authority is given the necessary resources and finance to enable it to do the job it was set up to do?</P>

      <P>I am somewhat taken aback by the Minister's report of his meetings with representatives of the clothing industry.  The Minister omitted to say that the increase in VAT on clothing has inevitably led to a loss of 1,000 jobs in that industry.  A number of these job losses have been in my constituency. Is the Minister saying that he cannot offer the clothing industry any change in its cost base, which could be given by way of a reduction in employers' PRSI contributions? The industry, when it realised that the increases in VAT would remain with it on a permanent basis, called for a decrease in the level of employers' PRSI, as did Fine Gael.  Is the Minister saying that the best he can offer the industry is support for research and development, which will only have a long term impact, and a FÁS training support scheme?  Is that the best the Government can do for the industry?  Is there no commitment to reduce the level of employers' PRSI or the rate of VAT on clothing and footwear?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the writing is literally on the wall for the 7,900 people employed in the textile industry and that this entire industry will be wiped out?

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;similarly, the plants in Westport and Wexford.  Does the Minister accept that, for example, to employ a girl as a machinist here cost £30 more than in Britain, regardless of the cost in the Far East?  Does he accept that it is not high wages but the 1 per cent levy and our PRSI rate of 12.5 per cent as against 6 per cent in Britain that is causing the problem?  Because of our value added tax and our high income tax rates we are literally banishing ourselves from the world textile market.  A total of 7,900 jobs will be lost within the next four to five years unless remedial action is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I indicated that for a variety of reasons, with which the House will be familiar, the Irish textile clothing industry will have to restructure itself in order to remain competitive in an intensely competitive world market.  In that context, we are making, directly through my Department, £5 million available for research and development to facilitate that transition to the quality end of the market.  That will not be easy and every Deputy knows that.  We are trying to convey to the employers and <Col N="1546" /> employees in those industries who have the possibility of making the transition that they should take every possible course of action in order to avail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a supplementary question which I have been waiting patiently to put to the Minister and I intend to do so if you allow me, Sir.  The Government increased VAT to 21 per cent and coupled that with a 1 per cent employment levy on an industry that was demonstrating growth in employment but now faces 1,400 redundancies.  If the Minister works with his colleagues in Government to remove the artificial barriers he has placed he need not worry about schemes and telling the industry how to be competitive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister, and the Government, who rendered this industry uncompetitive.  Would the Minister agree that the composition of the increased VAT and the 1 per cent employment levy rendered the industry uncompetitive and no new schemes will solve that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cox's question asked what proposals, if any, the Government had to address the difficulties in the clothing industry arising from the increase in VAT.  The proposals I outlined <Col N="1547" /> such as restructuring the industry so that it can have a viable future, are accepted as being essential by the industry. The industry must restructure to cater for the quality end of the international clothing market if it is to survive because of strong competition from third countries over which we have no control. The £5 million research and development grant is a significant step in assisting the industry to make what will be a difficult transition.  The problems did not arise out of the budget of last year.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 37 which contains the provisions relating to entitlement to maternity benefit. Maternity benefit had previously been referred to as &ldquo;maternity allowance&rdquo;. As social insurance payments generally are referred to as benefits, this Bill replaces the title &ldquo;maternity allowance&rdquo; with that of &ldquo;maternity benefit&rdquo;.

      <P>My party has no difficulty whatsoever with this amendment which simply clarifies the position, as the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>Obviously the main work on this Bill was undertaken by the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills so that what we have before us this afternoon are the fruits of their work.  We have three amendments only with which to deal.</P>
      <P>At Question Time recently we discussed in much greater detail the effects on maternity benefit of the cuts implemented by the Minister's predecessor, which is what we would prefer to discuss in greater detail here this afternoon had we the opportunity to do so. However, I understand that under Standing Orders we must adhere rigidly to a very brief discussion on the amendments the Minister has tabled.  We have no difficulty whatsoever with amendment No. 1 which simply rectifies a technical error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I should say I welcome the fact that the Bill is before us this afternoon for discussion.  It is very helpful to public representatives to have such precise and concise information in relation to social welfare benefits readily available.  Indeed, if something similar could be done in other aspects of legislation it would make life much easier. The fact that the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1993, is so bulky leads me to suggest that what we will have to talk about in the longer term is the consolidation of a number of schemes where there is duplication, red tape and bureaucracy.  This could be done if we brought together many of these schemes. Social welfare is a minefield of confusion. While I welcome this consolidation Bill and the ongoing efforts of the Minister to clarify the difficulties, the problem remains that with so many people dependent on social welfare we are generating red tape and bureaucracy and almost making an industry out of the social welfare system.  I hope we will discuss in the not too distant future ways and means of streamlining the system and making it more simple whereby people will be able to obtain their benefits and allowances <Col N="1647" /> in a more easy format.  Notwithstanding those points, I welcome the fact that we are debating the legislation.  Obviously, amendment No. 1, which is for clarification purposes, causes me no difficulty whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 140, line 55, after &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;under Part II&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 relates to section 211. This amendment, which is designed to remove an ambiguity in section 211, confirms that the reference to benefit contained in subsection (1) means benefit under Part II of the Bill.  This section relates to people resident outside the State or in prison.  They receive a benefit rather than an assistance payment.  This amendment clarifies that this only applies to insurance benefits.  It removes an ambiguity.</P>

      <P>In page 153, to delete lines 32 to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 relates to section 224 (8).  It carries forward the provisions of subsection (7) of section 20 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988, which relates to the competence of a person to give evidence in any proceedings taken against their spouse.  This provision has been superseded by provisions contained in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  The purpose of amendment No. 3, which is being made on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, is to delete this provision, which is now obsolete.  We had to have a provision in social welfare because there was not a provision to cover our situation in the Criminal Evidence Acts.  As soon as the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, was <Col N="1648" /> brought up to date, our provision became unnecessary.  This is a further tidying up exercise.</P>

      <P>Section 21 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, makes a spouse and a former spouse of an accused person competent witnesses in all cases for the prosecution, the accused and the co-accused, unless in the case of the prosecution a spouse or former spouse is charged with the same proceedings. Section 22 deals with compellability of a spouse or former spouse to give evidence at the instance of the prosecution.  It provides that the spouse of the accused, unless charged in the same proceedings, is compellable for prosecution only where the offence involves violence to the spouse, a child or either spouse or any person under the age of 17 or is a sexual offence against a child or either spouse.  A former spouse, unless charged with the accused in the same proceedings, is compellable for the prosecution unless the offence is a non-violent offence committed while the marriage subsisted.</P>

      <P>The provision is unnecessary so that it is being deleted from the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1993.  That provision is not necessary now because it is covered in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  It is purely a tidying up exercise recommended by the draftsman. There is no need for that provision in this Bill since it exists in law already and is applied in the Criminal Evidence Act where it is set out more comprehensively.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to say briefly that this is important legislation.  Deputies have referred to it as such and said how important it is to consolidate and simplify as far as possible the legislation.  The activities in which we are involved are extensive and consequently the legislation must be reasonably extensive to cover all the activities of social welfare.  This Bill makes the law in relation to social welfare more accessible, simpler and easier to fathom.  Deputies who have dealt with the Social Welfare Acts over the years will be particularly happy to have one consolidated Act which contains everything up to the present day.  That will be of tremendous benefit.  It will be very helpful to Members of the House and to social welfare officers and those who are professionally involved in trying to establish what the legislation is in any particular set of circumstances.  In that sense it will be particularly valuable.</P>
      <P>This Bill brings together over 80 years of social welfare legislation.  That in itself is an achievement.  The value of this document on an annual basis is £3.7 billion. When we see a consolidated Bill we are inclined to forget that its power is so extensive and its influence on our society is so great.  Strictly speaking, this Bill, contains all one needs to know about social welfare.  It could be regarded as an encyclopaedia of social welfare legislation and information.</P>

      <P>I hope this 1993 Bill will suffice until the end of the century.  I do not know who will be here in ten or 12 years' time to do the consolidation.  Some of the new young Members should take note because presumably they will be directly involved.</P>
      <P>We are working also on the consolidation of the regulations and I hope shortly to bring all the regulations together.  That will facilitate Deputies. Deputy De Rossa will be thrilled as he will be able to quote them to me in the House on a daily basis.  We will first deal with the assistance schemes.  During the session I hope to come back to the House with the consolidated assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>This Bill simplifies and streamlines the legislation.  It certainly makes it much easier to understand and to deal with, which delivers on one of the promises made in the Programme for Government. I thank Deputies for their time and attention which was of assistance to me in getting this consolidation Bill through the House.  I hope the enacted Bill will be in place to the beginning of the next century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we could refer to this Bill as the lay person's guide to social welfare because it still contains a good deal of departmental jargon. However, it is certainly a step in the right direction and will be particularly useful for those who work in the field professionally <Col N="1651" /> and for the public representatives. It will be much easier when the correct information is readily accessible.</P>
      <P>Sadly, social welfare is a growth industry. We have responded to the problems of society by introducing a plethora of schemes and anything we can do to streamline them is welcome.  I said earlier that we need to consolidate the social welfare system and the Minister might reply to this point.  Schemes were introduced to respond to problems as they arose but the number of schemes in operation would allow one to take a PhD in social welfare.  We need to take an overall look at the policy area so that the system can be made easier from everyone's point of view.  The Minister said he would consolidate the regulations but it is very important that the regulations should be debated in this House.  We have often referred to this at Question Time and it has been the subject of intense debate. From time to time changes in the regulations have resulted in drastic disimprovements to particular social welfare schemes which have caused financial distress to our constituents.  We need time to debate the changes in full and to have a constructive discussion.  I hope that in future when proposed changes are to be made we will have the opportunity to debate them in full, unlike the occasion when changes were introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  I hope the Minister will concentrate on this in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the committee on producing this consolidation Bill.  It will be very useful. I hope the Minister's customers &mdash; as he refers to social welfare recipients &mdash; will not be continually increasing and that we can stem the rise in unemployment.  It is a constant source of concern that such a small number has to support the increasing number of social welfare recipients. I am delighted that in the recent past the Minister has become involved in back to work schemes and employment creation activities.  I am anxious that promised <Col N="1652" /> integration of the tax and social welfare system goes ahead.  I know the Minister of State is dealing with this.</P>
      <P>The abuse of the system has to be vocalised.  Those who pay their taxes with good will are becoming more and more demoralised by abuses, albeit by a very small number, of the social welfare system.  We will lose the goodwill of those who willingly pay their taxes to support those who do not have jobs if we do not try to tackle the abuse of the system.  I would like to see the Minister concentrate in policy terms on tackling abuse.</P>
      <P>I welcome again the work the Minister has done in streamlining the system.  This has made the quality of life of those on welfare much better and more dignified. This is as it should be.  I call on him to continue the fight against abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Donnell, I do not agree that dignity has been given to those on social welfare. The only thing that will give dignity to those on social welfare is an adequate income to live on so that they do not have to go from office to office and submit appeals in order to achieve a half decent level of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points has been raised in the course of the debate.  The proposal came from the Fine Gael benches that there should be a debate in this House on the regulations.  Long have I argued that too many regulations have been passed simply by being introduced by the Minister.  Because there is no provision to debate them, they are effectively passed without debate.  Many of them, particularly in the social welfare area, have serious implications for the livelihoods of many thousands of people.  The argument against that is that the House would not be able to do any other business if it were to debate regulations, and I accept that. However, as a way around that we should set up a committee on secondary legislation, a special committee to consider regulations introduced by Ministers.  In that way important regulations could be identified and anomalies which arise from <Col N="1653" /> time to time in new regulations introduced by Ministers could be addressed. We have had examples of such anomalies in the past year in respect of regulations introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare which subsequently had to be altered.  The type of anguish caused to people, particularly those dependent on social welfare, by regulations which do not take into account their human impact could be overcome by setting up a committee to examine such regulations before they become law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the law in regard to social welfare has been consolidated between two covers.  That will make life easier for those who administer the system and ourselves, who frequently must refer to various Acts to discover if claimants &mdash; or customers, as the Minister refers to them, although I would refer to them as the victims &mdash; are receiving justice.  However, the compilation of this compendium or encyclopaedia of law does not address the question of the precise manner in which the law impacts on people and that is reflected in particular by the number of appeals lodged as a result of the way in which the system operates.  The annual report of the appeals office illustrates that approximately 42 per cent of all appeals are successful.  That means a significant number of errors is being made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but, as he is no doubt aware, on the Fifth Stage of a Bill the contributions are usually short.  In any event, debate can only take place on what is contained in the Bill and I am sure the Deputy will have regard to that long precedent of the House.</P>

A large number of appeals, many of which are valid, are lodged in respect of social welfare matters.  Following the publication of the annual report of the appeals office a newspaper headline stated that 50 per cent of all appeals fail but, in fairness, that headline should have stated that 50 per cent of appeals are successful.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise to the Minister that something needs to be done in respect of resources and staffing for dealing with appeals and in regard to the training of people to deal with claimants of social welfare who are obviously not getting adequate information in respect of their entitlements.  I ask the Minister also to examine why it is in areas for which the Department of Social Welfare has discretion that the greatest number of appeals arises.  For example, the area of unemployment assistance generates the highest level of appeals and the number of appeals in respect of proving ill health is also a matter of concern.  Obviously, there is a problem in repsect of decisions where the discretion lies with the Department of Social Welfare.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to examine that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> Will he give us a specific date for the publication of the new guidelines on supplementary welfare allowances?  When this Government came into office we were told they would be available within a few weeks but nine months later there is till no sign of them.  Those are the points I want to make on the Bill and I urge the Minister to take them on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point on this comprehensive legislation. I welcome the fact that the social welfare code has been consolidated between two covers.  Whatever about the merits or demerits of what is between the covers, I welcome the fact that all social welfare matters are dealt with in one document. I am sure the Minister and Deputies will agree that the social welfare code here has become a labyrinth of conditions and provisos and it is extremely difficult for consumers to maintain any type of coherence in respect of social welfare entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to Part IX of the Bill, which deals with liability to maintain a family.  I agree that within both the letter and spirit of legislation a man is liable to maintain his wife and family under our present legal and social arrangements. However, a difficulty arises in regard to the level of maintenance.  I am concerned about means testing and how it is applied. In circumstances where a District Court makes an order, as happens almost every day of the week, in regard to the amount of maintenance payable to a spouse &mdash; in most cases the wife &mdash; it becomes an order of the court.  Both parties leave the court in the knowledge that the district justice has made an award but it has become an ever-increasing practice of the Department of Social Welfare to give no credence or consideration to such awards.  I have dealt with numerous cases where an award of a district justice is literally torn up by officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  I could cite many instances of District Courts making an award of, say, £65 to a wife and her children and the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; perhaps a week later &mdash; ordering <Col N="1656" /> the payment of, say, £100 even though the circumstances of the case were not altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the determination of the means test and why an award made in a District or Circuit Court need not be regarded by the Department of Social Welfare?  This raises many questions about the manner in which we have allowed our social welfare code to evolve.  I imagine the means testing procedures would be the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

I accept the Minister's assurance that nothing has been left out of the Bill but I ask him to direct me in regard to the decision to reverse of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;, in particular, the nine remaining cuts that have yet to be reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, and with more hope of getting a positive answer, did the Minister give any consideration to the concept of district service companies?  I raised this matter with the Minister some two years ago in another Chamber when we discussed social welfare at length.  I asked him to seriously consider the formation <Col N="1657" /> of district service companies which would be constructed around each district exchange and would allow unemployed persons to register voluntarily with those companies who would market their skills. Unemployed persons would be guaranteed a minimum weekly payment of their social welfare benefit and they could build up earnings greater than that amount as they got back into the workforce and their skills were more in demand.  Fine Gael presented a document yesterday in relation to increasing jobs in the service area.  Another aspect is that the people who employ persons from the district service company, utilise the skills of unemployed persons and help them get back into the workplace would be given tax allowances and credits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Bill is encyclopaedic it covers all the matters raised. As the Deputy will realise I have heeded her suggestions and those made by other Deputies.  Consequently, I introduced the back to work allowance and job facilitators have been appointed in our offices around the country to facilitate the Department of Social Welfare, relationship between the FÁS schemes operated by the Department of Education and others.  I want to take a pro-active approach to the provision of employment and make the necessary links to help the unemployed to get back to work.  We are in a better position to do that now because of computerisation which has led to improved organisation in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy De Rossa's point, I <Col N="1658" /> refer to people in receipt of social welfare benefit as &ldquo;customers&rdquo; because I want them to be treated as customers.  The Deputy referred to their dignity, those people are treated with dignity because they are treated as customers.  We try to relate their needs to what is available and seek to provide greater support for them. I am hopeful we will be able to do more for those people by providing real links with FÁS on an individual basis.  We have had discussions with FÁS and are advancing further plans.  We will also consider the district service company concept.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of the courts allocating, say, £65 for a wife and child and that the Department might make an award of £100.  The Department of Social Welfare tends to me more generous.  However, the Department will claim the money it pays out, that provision is included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On another occasion the Deputy will say that benefits in respect of deserted wives are not adequate.  The Department's payment is often more than that allocated by the courts, it seeks recovery of the equivalent amount and differences can arise in that regard because the Department sets a different standard in terms of the amount of money.  This area requires more attention and is fraught with difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>

I am hopeful that another consolidation Act will not be required until at least the year 2000.  Deputy Bradford can rest assured that we will streamline schemes further.  The difficulty is that when schemes are streamlined people's needs are not adequately catered for and this causes problems. People wish me to insert simple lines in the Bill but many would lose out as a result of such additions.  The matter is not as simple as it might appear.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed the hope that the Department would not increase its demands to any great extent.  We hope unemployment payments will reduce, but pension payments will increase because people are living longer.  Payments for children are decreasing but payments for single parents are increasing.  It will always be complex because it depends on <Col N="1660" /> sociological factors at the time.  I accept the points made about the integration of tax and social welfare and the problems of unwarranted claiming.</P>

      <P>The terms we refer to are &ldquo;fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming&rdquo;, and they cover everything.  People will often refer to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which shows a tiny amount of fraud but that relates only to fraud proved in court. That is why we talk about &ldquo;abuse, fraud and unwarranted claiming&rdquo;.  I accept that we must show the taxpayer we are doing our job in that regard or they will not be happy with expenditure on social welfare. On the other hand, most people want to see those who are genuinely in need being supported so long as they know that the Department is not being wasteful or careless in spending such large amounts of money.  In disbursing large sums of money there is always the possibility that fraud will occur and there will always be some people who will abuse the system.  However, we have become more skilful in dealing with fraud and abuse mainly through management systems and better compliance.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa talked about the importance of dignity and a great deal has been done to simplify and to consolidate legislation to help in that area.  A great deal has also been done to improve the standard of the offices and to facilitate payments into bank accounts or post office accounts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was also concerned about appeals and the problems that arise on appeals.  Approximately two million decisions per year are made and there are about 18,000 appeals annually.  As Deputy De Rossa said, about 42 per cent of appeals succeed.  When appeals succeed, it means that more information has been provided.  It is important to get all the information and reduce the number of appeals as far as possible but when we are talking about two million decisions, we will have a substantial number of appeals in any event.  Some of the appeals refer to land or estates when there is a claim against an estate where a pensioner has died having claimed money to which he was not entitled.  The claim is against the residual estate and appealed by the beneficiaries of the estate.  Obviously such cases can take a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 6 and 7 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `elector', except where the context otherwise requires, means a presidential elector, or a person who was ordinarily resident in the State within the previous fifteen years and who would have qualified as a presidential elector if still resident within the State;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had an interesting Committee Stage debate on the question of permitting emigrants to vote in presidential elections. In response to an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage the Minister informed us that it is the Government's intention to bring forward a constitutional referendum and legislation and to have the administrative arrangements in place in time to enable emigrants to have some kind of a vote in the next election and some kid of representation arising out of it.  I have tabled amendments on the same subject for Report Stage as I said I would, and I will give a number of reasons for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it will be useful to get from the Minister a bit more detail about Government plans in this area.  Second, we should give some consideration to the question of which emigrants should be included if voting rights are extended. The purpose of my Committee Stage amendment was to establish the principle of voting rights for emigrants.  Under that amendment an emigrant who would have been entitled to vote in the previous presidential election or who had been out of the country at that time would be entitled to vote in a subsequent election. The point was made forcibly to me before we discussed that amendment and since by emigrant groups that they consider it would be more appropriate to opt for a longer time span as the cut off point.  In particular they drew my attention to the fact that one of the biggest waves of emigration occurred in the early eighties and they argued that it would be appropriate to include those who emigrated at that <Col N="1664" /> time if the entitlement to vote in elections is extended.  For those reasons I suggest that we opt for a period of 15 years as the cut off point.  Incidentally, this is the same cut off point proposed in the Private Members' Bill presented by the Labour Party.  Therefore I presume it will have no difficulty supporting this amendment today since it seeks to achieve the same objective.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to elucidate the point he took up on the previous occasion when dealing with the Constitution.  He stated that it would be necessary to hold a constitutional referendum. As I indicated on Committee Stage, there are conflicting legal opinions on this point.  A number of eminent lawyers have expressed the view that it would not be necessary to hold a constitutional referendum and that it would be possible under the Constitution to give voting rights to emigrants without holding a referendum.  I am concerned that the Government appears to be hiding behind the Constitution on this issue.  I would like the Minister of State to explain in greater detail why it is not possible to give voting rights to emigrants without first changing the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister of State to explain in more detail what the Government intends to do.  I appreciate that the intention was that all the necessary measures, including the constitutional referendum, legislation and administrative arrangements would be in place before the next general election, but can he give us any indication when the Bill relating to the constitutional referendum will be published and if he has received the opinion of the Attorney General?  It should not be very difficult to publish a Bill giving some indication of the constitutional changes that would have to be made and when it would be put to the people.</P>
    <P>In his response on Committee Stage the Minister of State seemed to lean heavily towards the position adopted by Fine Gael, that is, that voting entitlements for emigrants should be confined to a number of seats in the Seanad.  It would be useful to know if that is the <Col N="1665" /> case.  The Minister of State should take the opportunity to deny that is the case, to clarify that it is the Government's intention to give emigrants the right to vote in general elections, and consequently presidential elections, the subject matter of the Bill before us, and that it is not its intention to put a red circle around emigrants and make special arrangements for them without letting them vote in general elections.</P>

      <P>To use Deputy Gilmore's words, the purpose of this amendment is to establish the principle of voting rights for emigrants and to hear from the Minister of State in more detail the Government's view on this matter.  In so far as that is the purpose of the amendment, I go along with Deputy Gilmore and would like the Minister of State to outline the Government's thinking on this area but I cannot accept the amendment as tabled. I take it, Sir, that we are discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 3 together&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters stand, we do not allow non-citizens resident in this country to vote in presidential elections. Perhaps that is where we should start. Perhaps we should consider whether there is still justification for witholding voting rights from non-citizens resident in the country; at this time we cannot extend voting rights in presidential elections to our emigrants if those living in our country are not given this right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point shirking the issue or pretending it is not a problem; there is no doubt it would be a headache to establish a register of emigrants and to ensure that it would not be used improperly at election time.  We have had bad experiences in the past when it comes to postal voting in local and general elections.  On Committee Stage, reference was made to the 1979 local elections.  It was mentioned that the officials who ran the election considered that the postal voting system was widely abused.  It would be more difficult to establish who is a bona fide <Col N="1666" /> emigrant voter at election time than to establish who is resident in the Republic but is absent on polling day for various reasons.  I am not pretending that this would be insurmountable or impossible but major difficulties would be encountered in establishing a bona fide register and ensuring that those who vote are the people named on the register.  It would also be difficult, given that our emigrants are mobile, to ensure that they register annually at the local embassy or consulate or the location designated.  In my view many logistical problems would be encountered.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal contained in the Bill published some time ago would represent a realistic first step in allowing the Houses of the Oireachtas to hear the voice of our emigrants and allowing them not only to vote but to be represented in the Seanad where a number of seats would be reserved.  The Minister and the Government should seriously consider something along the lines proposed by Fine Gael.  I am not saying we got it right on the day but I am suggesting that the first step could be allowing our emigrants to be represented in the Seanad Chamber.</P>
    <P>There is one similarity between Seanad and presidential elections and that is the election takes place over a longer period than a Dáil election.  Dáil elections can, and often have, taken place within three or four weeks.  Logistically this would cause major problems in collating emigrants' votes in time to include them in the count.  However, presidential elections, like the Seanad elections, are held over a much longer period.  Some may feel that the present system is correct but even if it was felt that the present system was anomalous in refusing votes to residents who are not citizens, I still think the Seanad is the place to initially invite representation from our emigrants so that we can not only make use of their voting strength but listen to their views on their country and the problems which led to their having to leave our shores.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment although I agree with the principle of giving voting rights to our <Col N="1667" /> emigrants.  The Government might give serious consideration to allowing our emigrants voting and representation rights in the Seanad.  Deputy Gilmore, if I remember rightly, said that the Fine Gael proposal would result in the corralling of our emigrants.  I do not accept that.  Our proposals would go much further to meet the demands of emigrants than just allowing them a vote from distant shores.  I am suggesting that they actually have rights of representation in our House of Parliament.  If the Government is not in a position to take on board the Fine Gael proposal, perhaps it would at least consider moving along those lines.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to put on the record the Government's thinking on voting rights for emigrants.  The Minister hinted strongly on Committee Stage that there would be voting rights for emigrants before the next general election. What sort of investigation is being done into this question?  How far has the work proceeded?  Is the Government considering extending voting rights to emigrants in Dáil elections, in Seanad and Dáil elections or in Seanad elections alone?  Will the Government consider even taking Deputy Gilmore's proposal on board which I do not favour at this stage?  I accept the Deputy's point that the amendment is basically to establish the principle of voting rights for emigrants, a principle to which Fine Gael is not opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the wording of the amendments I support the spirit of them.  On Committee Stage we alluded to the fact that residents who are not citizens cannot vote in presidential elections. I found it mortifying, to say the least, when going to people's doors to ask them how they intended to vote, to be told that although they were long-standing residents of this country they could not vote in the election.  That is something that should be examined.  I realise this cannot be dealt with in the Bill.  However, the point is valid because if long-standing residents cannot vote in <Col N="1668" /> a presidential or other election, it amounts to discrimination against people who pay their taxes here and who are very much part of the community.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I wondered about the reluctance of the Government to even examine the area of voting rights for emigrants while hiding behind the Constitution.  The Government is made up of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. Since the Labour Party espoused this cause and was particularly vocal about it before going into Government it is amazing that nothing has been done.  It makes me wonder how serious the Labour Party is in other policy areas when something like this is ignored and they have to be practically beaten into doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>I accept that there may be constitutional difficulties.  I realise also that there are differences of opinion and, I suppose, if there are differences of opinion there is a problem, but I expect a pro-active approach now and hope that this will not be forgotten until the next general, election in three or three and a half year's time.  I will not forget it and I am sure people on this side of the House will not forget it either.  The Minister should require that this be put on the Government agenda and actively looked into.  It is very disheartening for people who have an affinity with our country, who return here, whose roots are here, to feel that they are forgotten and ignored.  If the signal goes out that they are not forgotten, that they have not been ignored, that would be a positive result of this debate.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what exactly are the proposals and when the process will begin.  So far we have seen no great fervour on the part of the Government to do anything about this, and particularly on the part of the Labour Party who seem to have forgotten many of the things they advocated during the election campaign. Much of that baggage has been left very firmly outside the Cabinet door.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: The legal advice to the Government <Col N="1669" /> is that under the relevant provisions of the Constitution it would not be possible to extend voting rights to people who are not part of the population of the State.  Deputy Gilmore suggested that the legal advice to the Government be made available.  It is not the practice to publish such legal advice.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government accepts in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants.  It is a matter for the Minister for the Environment whose examination will be comprehensive, and all the options will be fully considered, including the option of Seanad representation which is favoured by Fine Gael, including Deputy Doyle.</P>
      <P>The options outlined by Deputies Gilmore and Keogh are also being given consideration within the Department. The detailed technical arrangements which would be required to give effect to each option and the nature of the constitutional amendment which might be required in relation to each will be explored.  On completion of the examination the Minister will invite the Government to decide on the options that may be put forward.</P>
      <P>The debates on the last day and today will ensure that emigrants will not be forgotten.  I expect that Deputies on the far side will maintain a watching brief on this matter.  For my part, I hope we will continue to pursue the matter taking into consideration the views of the emigrants themselves.  Both Deputy Doyle and I have been very involved with the voice of the emigrants from the United States but it is fair to say that there is a desire among all parties that there be an appropriate link between emigrants and the Oireachtas.  There is also a sober realisation of the very fundamental questions that must be addressed in considering the establishment of such a link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever arrangements are decided, we must recognise the essential difference in status between those who are resident in the State and those who are not.  We must provide adequate safeguards in relation to the secrecy and security of the ballot.  Above all, the <Col N="1670" /> arrangements must be fair and must be seen to be so to both emigrants and the resident population.  This would be essential in order to ensure that the necessary constitutional amendment is carried by the people in a referendum when that arises.  These complex issues are being examined in the Department at present with the aim of having the matter brought to a conclusion within the timeframe envisaged in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of hiding behind the Constitution, as was pointed out on Committee Stage and again today. Serious thought must be given to whatever proposals are put forward by the Government, and the Oireachtas and the people will also have a say in the matter. I assure Deputies that the issue will not be put on the backburner and there will be no hiding behind the Constitution. The suggestions put forward by Deputy Gilmore the last day and again today as well as the proposal by Fine Gael Party will be considered by the Minister and the Department who are at present examining the matter.  All options are on the table and will be given serious consideration. Deputy Gilmore accused me of leaning towards Deputy Doyle's suggestion.  That is one option that deserves serious merit and Deputy Gilmore's option will also be considered.  At the end of the day we will have to decide what is the best option and put it to this House and to the people for decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be acknowledged that we have made some progress since the evening we debated the Private Members' Bill tabled by the Labour Party to which the then Minister for the Environment responded that he was opposing it for reasons of principle and practicality. Whatever about the practicality, at least the principle of giving voting rights to emigrants seems to be established, but what format it takes remains to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the small print in the Minister's response, for example, his reference to the difference in status between those resident in the country and those not resident here. <Col N="1671" /> There is an issue of principle involved here &mdash; I have no doubt we will come back to this matter in the course of this debate &mdash; that is, that the right to vote is a democratic right and you either have that right or you do not.  If a citizen of this country has been forced to go abroad because he cannot get work here he should not be deprived of the fundamental right to vote.  Other states give to their emigrants that right.  I caution the Minister and the Government, when considering this question, not to create two categories of citizens of this State: those who will have a full right to vote and those who will not.  Emigrants should have a democratic right to vote and participate in the political life of this country, and that is why I have tabled amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not making available to us the opinion of the Attorney General.  It is not good enough at this stage of the debate that we are simply told that the Attorney General has advised the Government that &ldquo;it is not constitutionally possible&rdquo;, and there the matter must rest.  The basis for that advice should be spelled out to us.  This is not an area of national security where the Attorney General's advice is so confidential that it cannot be made available to us.</P>
    <P>This Government has made great play, at least on paper, of the idea of extending democracy, open Government and so on.  Therefore, the opinion of the Attorney General on a matter such as this should be made available to Members so that we can debate the issue in a meaningful way. It is not good enough to simply come into the House and say &ldquo;the Attorney General has said&rdquo;, and that must be the end of the matter.  We know from painful experience that very often when the Attorney General has said something it is far from the end of the matter.  It would be helpful if the Attorney General's advice was available to us.</P>
    <P>The practical arrangements have been referred to.  Much has been said about the postal vote.  I cannot understand why, <Col N="1672" /> when there is a postal voting arrangement in the State for university graduates to vote in Seanad elections, we cannot extent postal rights to, for example, the disabled and other categories. I do not understand the logic that people who hold a parchment from one of our universities are somehow more honest than those who do not hold such a document.  The best way to introduce voting rights for emigrants would be establish polling stations in embassies, consulates or trade missions.  In that way, people would be able to vote in general elections.  I appreciate the argument that a three week election campaign could be involved, but if people are on the electoral register and if within each constituency, for example, there is a supplementary register of emigrant voters or they are marked in a particular way, it should be possible to arrange polling stations where these people can vote.</P>
    <P>I am going to ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to put the amendment formally to the House but I will not call a division, not because I do not wish to embarrass Deputies who may feel constrained to vote for it and, under Whip, would have to vote against it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I took the opportunity to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage in the hope that the Minister might look on it a little more kindly this time. The amendment seeks to widen the scope of the nomination process for presidential elections.  As the Minister is aware, I tabled some amendments on Committee Stage which both he and I knew would not be acceptable because of constitutional constraints.  Nevertheless, I thought it was very necessary to make these valid points.  Those amendments proposed that a fewer number of Oireachtas Members would be required to nominate a candidate and that a person nominated by 30,000 people should be eligible to stand as a candidate in the election.  I think the point that the post of President should be depoliticised is accepted.  I believe a large number of the public accept that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought those amendments would be helpful.  It is fair to say that county councils have the power to <Col N="1674" /> nominate candidates.  While I do not think such nominations would be nonpolitical, a person who wished to secure a nomination but who could not avail of the facility of being nominated by Members of the Oireachtas or of procuring 30,000 signatures should at the very least be able to put his or her case to the county councils where the issue would be discussed by members from all parties, including independent members. At present county councils do not have to do this.  This amendment proposes that county councils shall convene a meeting to consider a nomination, thus giving a potential candidate some sort of chance. At present such a person has no chance whatever of being nominated as a candidate. This would represent a small improvement in this area.  The system proposed in this amendment is not as good as the systems proposed in my two Committee Stage amendments.  Nevertheless, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>One of our colleagues described what takes place at county council meetings as the &ldquo;dialogue of the deaf&rdquo;.  As he is a member of my county council, I was somewhat distressed by that description. If one looks at the debates which take place at county council level one can see that excellent motions are often discussed by county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration should be given to getting rid of our crude political nomination system for presidential elections. There should be an arrangement whereby citizens could come together and nominate a person for the Presidency. The idea of the Presidency being above politics has much to recommend it.  It is clear that the general public want a President who is a unifying force.  Sometimes it is possible to get such a President from the world of politics.  However, this is understandably more difficult as a person engaged in day-to-day politics will be involved in a certain amount of conflict, will have to take up positions, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of a President of all the people and the Presidency being the <Col N="1676" /> people's office should be recognised.  As I understand it &mdash; the Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; such a move would require a change in our Constitution.  Consideration should definitely be given to such a move so that nominations for the Presidency would be left in the hands of the people rather than invariably being a gift from the largest political parties.  I made the point on Committee Stage that the present incumbent of the office did not have much to spare in terms of the 20 Members of the Oireachtas required to sign the nomination paper.  I do not think the office of President should be a gift from the largest political paries.  Up until the last presidential election there was no presidential election since, I think, 1973 &mdash; the two largest political parties merely agreed the candidate and decided not to contest the election.  That is a very unhealthy situation. People should be given a choice and that choice should be extended to the choice of nominee for the presidential election.</P>

County councils have the discretion to call a meeting at any time and the point is adequately covered by this discretion.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The irony of this particular Minister of State steering this Bill through its final stages, given his widely publicised views on how our President would use Aras an Uachtaráin, has not been lost on me and that point should be put on the record of the House.  I suggest that if the Minister does not consider it necessary to go the whole way, as suggested by Deputy Keogh, perhaps councils might be required to have a specific item on an agenda once an election is in the offing so that councillors would be reminded of their role and, perhaps, duty in this area. The law permits them to call a meeting, if so necessary.  That might be a compromise between Deputy Keogh's amendment and the present position.  The issue could be brought to the fore if it was <Col N="1678" /> automatically put on the agenda of the next statutory meeting of the council once an election is in the offing or has been called.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister continues to maintain a negative attitude towards this amendment, which is relatively inoffensive.  I hope his sympathy towards my other amendments, which unfortunately could not be taken on Committee Stage, will be turned into action when we see constitutional change in relation to elections.  If the Minister is considering constitutional change in regard to voting rights for emigrants, perhaps he will include some changes in the nominating procedure for selection of presidential candidates.  I will wait and see how sympathetic the Minister of State will be at that stage.</P>
      <P>To talk about county councils in a rather dismissive manner and to say that having a meeting to examine the right to nominate a particular candidate would be in some way highly political is wrong. That is not sending out the proper signal about politics and politicians here and it is a serious point which should be made. I do not know what type of people the general public expect to see on county councils.  I am a member of a county council and I take my public duties very seriously.  It is not a laughing matter to say that the county councils would not give the issue due consideration.  Serious politicians on county councils should be given scope and told to examine these issues.  To call a special meeting once every seven years will not slow down the process of local government to any extent.  It is not too much to expect the Minister of State to accept an amendment such as this as a gesture towards the nominating procedure, considering that we could not debate the other amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be pressing this amendment but I would like the Minister of State to reconsider the nominating procedures for presidential elections as well as voting rights for emigrants.  Unless we on this side of the House follow through on statements made by the Minister they will be forgotten.  I appreciate that he said he <Col N="1679" /> will not leave matters on the back burner but I look forward to seeing some development on this issue before the next general election.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford)</i>: This Bill is a continuation of the programme of electoral reform which commenced with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992.  It provides for the re-statement in consolidated form of the law in relation to the election of the President. With the enactment of this Bill the presidential elections law will be updated to take account of recent changes in Dáil electoral law and will be geared to modern day circumstances.  In this connection the most obvious change is the elimination of the central count.  The entire count will in future take place at constituency level.  This will result in a considerable reduction in the overall time taken for the counting process.</P>
      <P>The Bill, when enacted, will eliminate certain defects in existing law.  In future, when an Oireachtas Member signs more than one nomination paper, his or her signature on the first nomination received by the presidential returning officer will be regarded as valid while his or her signature on any other nomination paper received will be disregarded without prejudicing the validity of the nomination paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill extends the periods during which a candidate may withdraw and will ensure that it will be open to that candidate's proposers to nominate a replacement. The provision in relation to the death of a candidate is expanded to cover this eventuality occurring at any stage during the election process.  The Bill <Col N="1680" /> deals comprehensively with, and clarifies the role and functions of, the presidential returning officer and the judicial assessor and includes provision for any objection to the ruling on the validity of the ballot paper or in relation to the qualification of a candidate to be referred to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in the Bill for a statutory procedure for the questioning of the result of a presidential election by means of petition to the High Court.  The Bill has been improved by the amendment made to it in committee. As a result of this amendment an elector employed by a returning officer in connection with an election may be authorised to vote in the constituency in which he or she is employed in connection with the election.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies opposite for their valuable contributions and to thank also Deputy Doyle for her concern regarding my illness last night.  I look forward to receiving her sympathy card in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, I will be putting the Mass card on hold for a long time.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing this legislation for some months now, certainly since before the summer recess.  It is, as I described it, &ldquo;filler&rdquo; legislation and there is nothing extremely contentious in it.  The amendments, which sought to correct omissions to the Bill improved the content of the Bill but what is included is not contentious.  I hope the Bill achieves what the Minister said it would, namely, consolidate all the law in relation to presidential elections, streamline the count and make certain changes in the nomination procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question must be asked as to how we could have spent some hours on this Stage discussing presidential elections and their format when that is the least likely election, hopefully, for some time to come.  There is some urgency in regard to legislation covering other elections, particularly the urban elections promised for next year.  As we are discussing electoral legislation, will the Minister indicate <Col N="1681" /> when the legislation relating to the urban elections will be dealt with?  What is proposed in relation to the restructuring of what this Government calls the sub-county level of local government or what municipal councillors like to refer to as urban elections?  There will be little point, perhaps in April or May next, rushing in, guillotining very important Bills through this House in relation to the local elections.  We need a lot of time to consider the contents and to debate any changes in our municipal and local authority structures.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to confirm to the House when the local elections will take place.  Given that the thinking should be fairly advanced at this stage, can he indicate what changes and reforms we may expect?</P>
    <P>The use of the vote is extremely important.  One can go back over history to ascertain how some, particularly women's organisations, had to strive to have the franchise extended to them.  An aspect that disappoints me at virtually every election is the small poll.  I urge the Minister and the Department of the Environment to increase awareness of the need for citizens to participate in our democratic system.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago shortly before his very untimely death Professor Opsahl, of the Opsahl report fame, addressed the Fine Gael Front Bench.  There was a deadline of 4 p.m. for him to cast his vote in his Embassy in St. Stephen's Green on that day.  He asked to be excused.  I drove him over to St. Stephen's Green, waited outside while he went in, cast his vote in the Embassy and returned.  Even though he was in the middle of a meeting with the Fine Gael Front Bench the matter was so important to him he had to take half an hour off to cast his vote.  Would that that attitude prevailed among all eligible to vote in this country.  We shall only have true representation throughout the different levels of our political structures if people use their votes.  I urge the Minister, the Minister of State and their Department to launch a campaign to impress on people, particularly the <Col N="1682" /> young, who have a slightly cynical attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Presidential Elections Bill, 1993 I am just extending my remarks to all our democratic procedures.  I urge that our young people and everybody else be encouraged to use their votes.</P>
      <P>We discussed votes for emigrants.  I have concerns about extending the postal voting system without examining it carefully. My concerns relate mainly to the fact that Fianna Fáil are the past masters of abusing the postal voting system.  Let us be honest, the record shows, going back over the years, that whatever system we put in place must be copper-fastened to confine the vote for those who are genuinely entitled to it, people whose work may bring them abroad on a temporary or permanent basis.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister of State that the legislation to extend votes to our emigrants, in whatever form that extended franchise might be, is now promised legislation.  I assume that the referendum needed to accompany any changes in this area is effectively promised by this Government.  Therefore, we will be in order on the Order of Business, in the months and years ahead, in asking the Government to indicate when that promised legislation will come before this House and the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to confirm that that is the status of the proposed extension of votes to our emigrants. I should like him to confirm that I correctly interpret his response to Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Doyle for her generous comments on the amendments I tabled on voting rights for emigrants which succeeded in extracting from the Government the commitments to which she referred.  It is for us to <Col N="1683" /> interpret the Minister.  I would not tempt fate beyond that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made some grandiose claim for this Bill in his summary, describing it as part of this Government's commitment to the extension of democracy and using a number of other buzz phrases of that kind.  There is no point in making that kind of grandiose claim for this Bill, which is a technical measure.  It was uncontested and could have been put through this House in an hour.  The fact that it was the subject of a lengthy Second Stage debate, a fairly lengthly discussion on Committee Stage and now over an hour on Report Stage was for no other reason than that the Government is devoid of other legislation to put before the House and this Bill has been taken in order to fill time.  It was used for that purpose in May.  The Government does not have legislation to put before this House other than this Bill, which is not urgent and whose provisions we hope will not be required for another four years. It is extraordinary, given that we await urgent legislation from the Minister's Department.  For example, I attended a meeting of the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council yesterday when we were told that our estimates meetings were being fixed from 1 to 21 January next, that the legislation establishing the new county councils in Dublin &mdash; which we have been awaiting for over a year &mdash; has still not even been published much less put on the Order Paper of this House. My fear is that we will end up, as we did in 1991, with the relevant Bill being rushed through the House.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies on the promised legislation in regard to the disposal of waste.  There is now a crisis in Dublin, regarding the tipheads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I must remind the Deputy that the debate on Fifth Stage is confined to the provisions of the Bill before us.  Perhaps he could adhere to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned that this Government is so desperate about <Col N="1684" /> the waste crisis in Dublin it might be tempted to locate the incinerator close to Áras an Uachtáráin, hence its relevance to the Presidential Elections Bill, 1993.</P>
      <P>On the question of elections, it is ironic that we have a less than urgent Bill dealing with presidential elections before the House at a time when there are two vacancies in membership of this House, when those two vacancies have obtained since the beginning of this year and the Government has not yet announced any plans to hold the by-elections to fill those vacancies.  Whenever the matter is raised with the Taoiseach and the relevant Minister, we are given the kind of gilb, coy response to which we have become so accustomed &mdash; that by-elections can wait. It is interesting that one of the reasons advanced for not holding those by-elections is that the Government had such an inordinate amount of business to put through this House, so inordinate that it had to use up the time of the House by putting a Bill before it which is clearly not urgent.  This Bill was not contested. The Opposition parties managed to avail of the opportunity to extend democracy, for example by the commitment given to votes for emigrants.  Beyond that I really do not think it merits the kind of grandiose claim the Minister of State has just made for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The grandiose description the Minister used was that this Bill was a continuation of the electoral reform on which the Government had embarked. This is not the case.  Rather it is an electoral housekeeping Bill.  Amendments tabled by the Opposition afforded us an opportunity to debate a number of issues, such a voting rights for emigrants and depoliticising the nomination procedures for presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has taken some time and, quite honestly, I do not want to spend any more time on it.  I would prefer to allow through some more pressing legislation. I should say that we will be pursuing the Minister on the various items raised.  I will take the Minister's views into consideration and see how sympathetic he will be on these issues.  I support <Col N="1685" /> my colleagues in looking forward to more pressing legislation coming through, especially in the whole area of genuine electoral reform and particularly in relation to county councils.  They are a serious political body and we should not take them lightly.  We are awaiting with bated breath legislation on the restructuring of Dublin County Council into three areas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank you for your courtesy and the Minister for some of his remarks.  I hope we will see developments along the lines we have suggested.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 7 to 11, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `public place' includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any highway,</P>
      <P>(b)  any outdoor area to which at the material time members of the public have or are permitted to have access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise, and which is used for public recreational purposes,</P>
      <P>(c)  any cemetery or churchyard,</P>
      <P>(d)  any premises or other place to which at the material time members of the public have or are premitted to have access, whether as of right or by express or implied permission, or whether on payment or otherwise, and</P>
      <P>(e)  any train, vessel or vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledged on Committee Stage that there may have been a difficulty with the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in section 3 in that it might not cover places such as public parks while closed.  However, this has now been addressed by amendment No. 5 which now includes, as part of the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;, any outdoor area to which at the material time members of the public have or are permitted access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise, and which is used for public recreational purposes.  We are also including specifically cemeteries and churchyards.  This meets the concerns expressed by Deputy Mitchell and, in the circumstances, I hope he will not move amendment No. 15.  It is preferable that the inclusion of public parks, whether <Col N="1688" /> open or closed, should not be confined merely to section 5 and perhaps the Deputy will accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the wording of the Minister's amendment. The Minister is taking into account many of the reservations expressed on Committee Stage.  There are two problems, one of which the Minister's amendment appears to address.  I would like to tease out the other problem of public parks whether open or closed, which amendment No. 15 seeks to address.  In relation to any cemetery or churchyard one of our greatest problems &mdash; it is regrettable to have to say this in the House &mdash; is that they are not being accorded the respect traditionally enjoyed in this country. Mount Jerome cemetery in my own constituency &mdash; often referred to as the dead centre of Dublin South-Central &mdash; the main cemetery in terms of the city, has become very dangerous for lone women visitors because of handbag snatching and the vandals escape over the walls. People have taken to stoning nearby houses from the cemetery where undesirable activities are also taking place. Quite simply, people have lost respect and fear.  I am glad that cemeteries and churchyards are included in the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  Since they are included, I presume the Garda will have access to the cemeteries to pursue these vandals.  I find it very difficult to use any type of normal language to address somebody who engages in violent activities in a cemetery.  It is a problem and in that regard I welcome the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to public parks and open spaces, to which my amendment refers, I will certainly be disposed to not moving amendment No. 15 if I can tease out how the new amendment would deal with the problem.  The problem in Dublin &mdash; and I am sure it is no different in the Minister's constituency and throughout the country generally &mdash; in major residential areas adjacent to open spaces or parks, whether open or closed, is that youths take intoxicating substances and literally make life very difficult for many people. There is a suspicion that some of these <Col N="1689" /> people are watching houses and when the residents leave they burgle the houses and use the funds for their drinking or intoxicating substances habit.  Where this is happening inside a closed park it is very difficult for the Garda to get in after hours in that they have to climb over gates. They should have the right to enter parks; I am not sure whether they have that right and perhaps the Minister would address that question.  It may be that this is a matter for by-laws which in the case of Dublin City Council, are with the Minister for the Environment for approval.</P>
    <P>I think the Garda should have the right to go into the park and those who are carrying on inside it should be subject to the full rigours of the legislation.  Some people are carrying on similar activities in open spaces.  In many cases this can be worse because it can make life hell for those who live nearby.  It totally devalues the property; people have to lock their cars with chains at night because they fear what will happen; children cannot be sent to the shops on an errand because they would have to pass gangs of youths; old people are terrified to cross their threshold, etc.  People are literally imprisoned.</P>
    <P>The gardaí seem powerless beyond telling the young people to move on. Under this Bill they will have the power to tell them to move on and if they do not obey, the gardaí will have further powers to deal with them.  Heretofore the gardaí did not have the power to address in an effective way problems arising from behaviour in open spaces.  If the Minister can assure me that this amendment deals with that problem, I would be willing to withdraw mine because I am anxious to ensure that parks and open spaces are included under the provisions of the Bill and that the gardaí can deal with the problems, confiscate the drink, if necessary, and move the young people on in order to restore law and order so that the law abiding citizens can enjoy their homes.  Everybody in the State should be able to aspire to peace in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am critical of paragraph <Col N="1690" /> (b) of this amendment but I have no objection to the enumeration of places set out in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d).  As far as I am concerned, paragraph (b) does not hit the nail on the head.  Paragraph (b) states:</P>
      <P>any outdoor area to which at the material time members of the public have or are permitted to have access, whether as of right or as a trespasser or otherwise, and which is used for public recreational purposes,</P>
      <P>This confines the notion of public spaces to places which must be used for public recreational purposes.  The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in that paragraph makes it very clear that the public place must be used for public recreational purposes.  I am worried about this provision because what I said on Committee Stage still holds and it is not addressed by this amendment.  What I want is a workable law.  For instance, if there is a derelict house beside Sandymount Green and people are shouting and roaring all night long on the site of this derelict house, this does not fall within the definition set out in paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>What I want &mdash; and we will come to it in my amendment No. 6 &mdash; is to extend the concept of public place to cover people who are standing on private property immediately beside a public place and who are behaving in a manner prohibited by sections 5, 6 and 7.  One does not need to have a very vivid imagination to work out that once the element Deputy Mitchell spoke about, who visit Mount Jerome Cemetery at night, cotton on to the fact that they are immune from arrest as they are not in a public place at the time they are committing the offence, there will be huge difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youngsters will stand in front gardens of derelict sites, have parties and start roaring and shouting on industrial estates.  These areas are not open to them but they are trespassers and nobody will be able to stop them committing the offences in question.  If we are serious about preserving public order in public places we need to extend the concept of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; to places from which <Col N="1691" /> offending behaviour can be seen and heard, otherwise it will make a joke of this legislation.  People will stand in their own gardens, start roaring and shouting or getting drunk and being abusive to people from their own doorstep but will not be in a public place.</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought that one creates a disturbance in a public place if one is heard or seen in a public place being offensive or unruly as the case may be.  This is a criminal statute and unless the Minister can show me some authority for the proposition that standing in a garden which is visible from a public place and committing any of the offences set out in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 is, in fact, an offence, my view is that the Bill will not cover a great deal of behaviour that ought to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  Much work has been done on Committee Stage and the legislation has been considerably improved since its introduction.  I compliment her also on her willingness to put forward amendments in the context of the arguments that have been made on Committee Stage.  While this amendment is good as far as it goes, I think something much more radical is called for, and I would go a little further than the two previous speakers.  Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall be an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he might endanger himself or any other person in his vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has extended section 3, the interpretation section, to include a list of areas.  I accept that this is desirable and well intentioned but I would go further. My suggestion, and I ask the Minister to consider it overnight, is that stating &ldquo;being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he might endanger himself or any other person in his vicinity&rdquo; looks at the problem in a negative way.  I suggest <Col N="1692" /> that a positive way would be for the legislation to provide the opportunity for the Garda Síochána and the local authority to declare alcohol free zones.  This would not leave the gardaí in the position of having to decide whether there is reasonable apprehension that a person might endanger himself or any other person in his vicinity.  It would be preferable if some of the open areas, public parks, linear parks and streets could be alcohol free zones.  This has happened very successfully in the UK.  I know it is a radical change from what is being proposed in the Bill but I believe it achieves what the Minister is attempting and does so in a better way.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister some examples that have arisen in my constituency. For many years the rear of the gardens in one particular estate opened on to an inaccessible area and when a road was built, the portion of land between the backs of the gardens and the boundary wall of the new road became an open space and was developed into a linear park.  Where there was once total privacy there is now a movement of people.  Such areas are unused except by teenagers and young adults who congregate there late at night for drinking sessions and are a nuisance to the people who have lived in peace for many years in nearby houses.  The quality of life for those living at the end of such linear parks has disimproved and that is not covered in legislation dealing with intoxication in public places, as there is no reason to believe that the young people involved might endanger themselves or others in the vicinity.  However, the Bill as drafted, with the best will in the world and the Minister's total co-operation, will not create a sense of security or give peace of mind to the occupants of houses in such areas.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the concept of setting up alcohol free zones in certain public areas which could be decided on by the Garda in co-operation with local authorities or by the local authorities themselves.  Rather than going down the defensive road to which the Minister referred, that concept should be <Col N="1693" /> given consideration, but I do not expect her to reply positively at this stage.  A number of chambers of commerce and business associations in my area have strongly advocated the concept of alcohol free zones because they are aware of the success of such a concept in the North and elsewhere.  That would be better than stipulating a number of churchyards, highways, trains, vessels and so on as places where people cannot consume alcohol.  The areas to which I referred should be identified as alcohol free zones and if people are caught drinking alcohol or any other intoxicating substance in such places they should be immediately apprehended by the gardaí.  The gardaí should not have to wait until they are intoxicated or until they consider them a danger to themselves or others before taking action.  They should be able to take immediate action.  I encourage the Minister to accept my proposal.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to reply to all three amendments. Deputy McDowell is trying to get two bites of the cherry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Mitchell welcomes the reference to cemeteries and churchyards because he and others expressed concern in that regard during our long <Col N="1694" /> Committee Stage debate.  In regard to public parks which are closed at a certain time in the evening, the words of particular relevance are contained in paragraph (b) of amendment No. 5 which states, &ldquo;...as a trespasser or otherwise ...&rdquo; which means that if a person is caught in a public park after it is closed, he or she is a trespasser.  The question of access by the Garda will have to be considered carefully by members of the Garda and the local authorities or whoever is responsible for the public park concerned.  That would be the best way to ensure that gardaí have access to such parks at any time.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Burke's point, the designation of areas as alcohol free zones is a fairly radical departure in this area and, as the Deputy stated, it has worked effectively in other countries.  I am advised that is primarily a matter for environmental legislation rather than criminal justice legislation and I will discuss it with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>On both Second and Committee Stages we discussed at great length the necessity to include, as far as possible, the matter of open spaces to which Deputy Burke referred, in other words, green open spaces around housing estates that once were peaceful zones but are now used by young adults for the consumption of alcohol and other substances.  The behaviour of people in such places is covered under the legislation provided a crime is being committed.  Moving a step further and deciding that a green open space or some such place should be an alcohol free zone would be a matter not only for the Department of the Environment but for local authorities who hold strong views, in many cases similar to those of Deputy Burke, in that regard.  That matter is certainly worth considering and because Deputy Burke raised it, I will discuss it with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the thinking behind the views expressed by Deputy McDowell, they go too far.  Essentially, the very nature of public order offences is that they occur in areas to which the public generally have access.  They are not <Col N="1695" /> designed to regulate behaviour where a person is on his or her own private property. In terms of civil liberties considerations, it is reasonable to suggest that the standards of behaviour required from people when they are in areas to which others also have access involved different considerations from the type of behaviour in which people can indulge, say, in their own back gardens.  This distinction would be particularly acute in relation to disorderly behaviour under section 5, whatever precise definition we adopt in relation to that behaviour.  As a general principle, the criminal law should be more reluctant to intervene where behaviour of the kind covered in the early sections of the Bill takes place other than in a public place.  Otherwise, for example, there would be a danger that the gardaí would be called on frequently to adjudicate on relatively trivial disputes between neighbours who, say, object to the behaviour of each other when in their back gardens.</P>
    <P>While I do not dispute that genuine difficulties can arise in this regard, I would regard the intervention of the criminal law, as envisaged by Deputy McDowell's amendment, as far too blunt an instrument and going beyond the purpose of the Bill.  In particular, I am not satisfied that such a fundamental change in our law &mdash; which could be seen as significantly altering the balance between the standards of behaviour required in public or in private &mdash; would be warranted. I will, however, keep the operation of the proposed legislation under review and, if genuine and substantial difficulties emerge which might be met by an amendment along the lines of what is being proposed, then I would consider the matter further.</P>
    <P>In summary, Deputy McDowell like other Deputies, will appreciate that considerable disquiet was expressed in regard to this legislation from people concerned about civil liberties.  Deputy McDowell now has the benefit of my thoughts on this matter, what he proposes <Col N="1696" /> goes much further than I would wish.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the persistent unemployment crisis with nearly 300,000 people out of work, the annual influx of 25,000 into the labour force and the consequent social blight of crime, vandalism and drug abuse, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to reduce the punitive levels of tax on employment and to dismantle the maze of obstacles impeding enterprise, risk-taking and job creation in the Irish economy, in particular by</P>
      <P>&mdash;reform of the income tax and PRSI codes to reduce the gap between the cost of employment and take-home pay;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the introduction of a national community employment scheme to afford part-time work to the long term unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week a succession of Government Ministers, led by the Taoiseach, made a series of glowing up-beat statements about what the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition has described as a National Development Plan.  In truth it was just a Fianna Fáil-Labour proposal to spend the hoped for £8 billion EC investment funds over the next seven years.  The Government's plan did not even seek the approval of this House for its proposals. When we were informed of its contents the matter was already a <i>fait accompli</i> in Brussels.  When the Taoiseach introduced the plan he asked us to support it but he gave us no opportunity to do so. The Dáil Committees referred to earlier <Col N="1697" /> had no opportunity to make an input into the development of this so-called national plan.</P>
    <P>Those proposals envisaged the creation of 75,000 net jobs during a period of seven years, or just more than 10,000 each year.  During the same period the workforce is expected to grow by 25,000 each year.  The so-called National Development Plan does not even, on its own terms, promise to contain unemployment growth let alone reduce it. Therefore, shorn of all the hype, and the Santa Claus style telephone number investment programmes, as I described them last week, the National Development Plan remains fatalistic about the Government's ability to deal with the most fundamental socio-economic problems facing our society.  That is the reality of mass, long term unemployment with its associated corrosive blight of crime, vandalism and drug abuse.  Faced with that fatalistic outlook of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government's plan, the Progressive Democrats have deliberately chosen to focus their current Private Members' time debate on how we can make serious inroads in tackling the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I intend to make plain in the course of this two night debate that this no mere rhetorical undertaking.  The Progressive Democrats have always been a &ldquo;can do it&rdquo; party.  We believe in the talent, enterprise and self-reliance of the Irish people.  We can solve our unemployment crisis and the social ills that flow from it.  However, we will not do it if we continue to tax work as if it were a luxury item.  We will not do it if our tax and welfare systems destroy the incentive for people to take up lower paid jobs. Before anyone accuses me of favouring a low wage regime, let me reject that one straight off.  I want everyone to earn as much as they possibly can, but I realise that every job cannot be a high income job.  The entire workplace, in terms of employers and workers, cannot be a forest of mighty oaks.  The workplace must also be able to accommodate the economic saplings which will grow in time.  In fact, most of our successful <Col N="1698" /> indigenous companies started out as small operators.</P>
    <P>I want to see an Ireland that is teeming with enterprise and self-reliance and where everyone at every level of the social ladder has a real incentive to work hard, take risks and, where possible, employ others.  We believe enterprise should be the life blood of the Irish economy. Our people can make it to the very top in countries like Britain and the United States and are willing to work long and hard precisely because there is a real financial incentive to do so in those countries.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats want to ensure that a similar climate for enterprise prevails here.  That is why our motion to the Dáil, goes on to spell out some of the key measures we believe must be undertaken if the Government is to take seriously what it proclaims as the unemployment crisis.  These are the reform of the income tax-PRSI system to reduce the cost of employing people; the introduction of competition in areas of State monopoly to give people choice and put downward pressure on the price of such goods and services; the implementation of the Culliton report and the introduction of a national community employment scheme to provide part-time work for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Tonight, the Progressive Democrats are putting before this House the real issues on which Irish politics must focus. We are doing that in the form of a motion which, unlike last week's farce, calls for a decision on the issues that count.  The Progressive Democrats are bringing before this House the basic political issues on which this Government has so far failed and by which this Government in the last analysis will be judged.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth reminding ourselves of the reasons there are nearly 300,000 people on the dole.  The social partners have through the last decade pursued a series of policies which amount to &ldquo;human set-aside&rdquo;.  What are the features of those policies?  Work is taxed in Ireland at a rate and in a manner which is not even remotely approached in any other OECD country still less in any <Col N="1699" /> economy with a level of unemployment, economic development and population growth such as ours.  Work is taxed at a rate more appropriate to a rare luxury good rather than a commodity that we have in alarming surplus.</P>
    <P>With tax, PRSI and levies, a married person, with a non-working spouse and four children living in a local authority house has more disposable income on £8,000 gross pay than a person on £15,000, when the family income supplement, medical card, differential rents and the cost of getting to work are taken into acount.  Post-budget figures supplied to my colleague, Deputy Cox, by the Department of Finance demonstrates that there is less disposable income for a person on £15,000 than on £8,000.  In fact, they are worse off to the tune of £230 per year.  On £12,000 gross earnings, such a person would have £1,300 less in disposable income than on gross earnings of £8,000.  An unemployed worker with a dependent spouse and four children, living in a local authority house with the normal social welfare supports, needs to be offered £14,500 per year before that worker's family would have a greater net disposable income.  What kind of crazy system is this?  What incentive is there for that person to look for a job?  What incentive is there for any worker to better themselves or work harder?  Is there an incentive for any Irish person to establish an enterprise and give opportunities to others?</P>
    <P>These are the employment economics of the madhouse.  They have not just suddenly emerged.  They have been carefully put in place by a generation of failed politicians, failed economists and failed social engineers whose legacy is massive dole queues and even more massive debt.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats challenged this legacy in 1986, we were accused by every other party in this House of opportunism, buying votes and creating false expectations.  When we proposed radical tax reform with a basic tax-PRSI rate of 25 per cent and an upper rate of 40 per cent we were told it could not be done.  When we were established <Col N="1700" /> the upper rate of tax was 60 per cent, the middle rate was 48 per cent and the low rate was 35 per cent, not to mention PRSI.  When we left office late last year, there were only two tax rates 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  Had the 1993 budget carried through what was agreed when we were in Government, these rates would have been reduced further to a 25 per cent standard rate and a 44 per cent top rate.</P>
    <P>At the moment, a single man or woman at work pays 48 per cent tax on marginal earnings well below the average male industrial wage.  With PRSI and levies, the State takes almost 60p of every extra pound earned by a single worker earning less than the average industrial wage.  No other country in the OECD brutalises the single low earner like that.  When you add employer's PRSI, an employer has to lay out £1.12 to give such an employee 43p in take home pay or £2.60 for every £1 in take home pay.  These, I repeat, are the employment economics of the madhouse.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the Government appears to be relying on emigration to solve the unemployment problem, it is worthwhile looking at what would happen if the average male industrial wage here was taxed at UK and insurance rates.  The average male industrial wage in Ireland is £14,761.24.  From that income 48.4 per cent is taken by the State in the form of PRSI, tax and levies.  From the equivalent salary in the UK 32 per cent is deducted in tax and PRSI, in other words, there is a difference of over 16 per cent in the rates of pay here as opposed to the rates in the UK</P>
    <P>At the average Irish male industrial wage, therefore, tax and social insurance contributions, including employer PRSI, are almost a half of the total cost to the employer of making this job available whereas in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the state takes just under a third of the gross cost of creating a job.  These figures not only undermine and destroy the competitiveness of Irish industry, but they are set to suck further jobs out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the employment intensive clothing <Col N="1701" /> industry, for example, where there are minimum wage rates in operation, the Welsh Development Authority confirmed to my office today that they are receiving many inquiries from firms here about the possibility of establishing operations on that side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>A simple example illustrates the attractiveness of such a move.  Having paid the relevant minimum wage rates, and after tax, levies and social insurance deductions are made, take-home pay in Ireland is IR£96.52, while in Britain it is IR£99.18.  The British worker is better off despite the fact that his gross pay is only £113.96 whereas the Irish gross wage is £131.</P>
    <P>The explanation of course is &ldquo;our anti-jobs tax wedge&rdquo;.  The total take by the State in Ireland on this wage is IR£50.46 while in Britain it is IR£22.30.  What this means is that not only does it cost a British employer less to give a job, but even on the much lower wage, the British worker is still better off in terms of his take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry is the kind of labour-intensive activity where more jobs could be created, and if the Government was serious in its protestations about unemployment it would realise that.  Yet in the past three years, over 3,000 jobs have been lost in that industry here.  It still accounts for over 8 per cent of total manufacturing employment in this country, and the proposal from the Irish Clothing Manufacturers' Federation urging the virtual halving of employers' PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 6.6 per cent for workers in the industry earning up to £9,000 per year, or £175 per week, is the kind of practical tax reform measure this Government should undertake.  It would not only improve the competitiveness of this labour-intensive sector, but it would also help safeguard the remaining 15,000 jobs there and improve the chances of generating additional employment.</P>
    <P>Such a practical measure would be better than all the plethora of agencies, county enterprise boards and quangos so beloved of this Government.  So crazy has the jigsaw of Government bureaucracy now become that the Department of <Col N="1702" /> Enterprise and Employment has recently produced a new internal directory so that the various staff there might know what each of them is supposed to be doing.</P>
    <P>This Government is so hell bent on creating agency after agency, bureaucratic nonsense after bureaucratic nonsense that it has lost sight of what it should be doing.  In truth, we have a vicious, job destroying anti-employment tax system that is so grotesque that one might be forgiven for believing that it was designed by a job-hater.  We need radical pro-jobs tax reform which will bring down our tax rates further, expand the lower tax band greatly, and dramatically reduce the gap between payroll expenditure which must be met by employers and the take-home pay of workers.</P>
    <P>I will add to some of the nonsense to which I have already referred by quoting from a letter dated 30 July from a compliant taxpayer who got into difficulties and was negotiating affairs with the Revenue Commissioners.  The letter refers to the fact that the company had paid £4,000 of interest charged on liabilities because it was late in paying its tax and it now owes £8,319.53.  In writing to the Revenue Commissioners they said:</P>
    <P>Will the amount of £4,000 which has already been paid be offset against this new amount?  As we interpret the scheme an amnesty has been granted for the previous period and had we not complied we would now receive an amnesty.</P>
    <P>It would, as I'm sure you realise, be most unfair that we should be penalised for having already paid &mdash; when if we didn't we would now receive an amnesty.  As complying taxpayers you must realise our disgust and upset at the treatment which we have received and are receiving which is completely different to the treatment of the noncomplying taxpayers who are undermining our business because of their non-compliance.</P>
    <P>They are now to receive an amnesty while we continue to be pressurised by the Revenue for late payment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> This is unfair, frustrating and totally immoral.  Surely it should be the other way around.  We are being told &ldquo;YOU PLAY BY THE BOOK AND NOT AN INCH, WHILE THE DEFAULTERS ARE BEING TOLD DEFAULT AND WE'LL HELP YOU&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and these are the people we are in competition with.</P>
    <P>That letter was written on behalf of a very small business in the south-east.  It sums up clearly what many business people feel about the Government's attitude to enterprise and initiative.  During my speech on the National Development Plan I quoted extensively from an interview given by Patrick Campbell of Bewleys where he said that Bewleys had the capacity to employ 1,000 more people but that that would be done outside of this country.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that Ireland needs a radical new programme of tax reform over a number of years during which tax, PRSI and levies will be amalgamated into a single upper rate, and a standard rate of 25 per cent. The standard rate must also be extended towards the average industrial wage. Such a programme will yield results.  It will entail economies in public spending, a broadening of the tax base, and a concentration on real take home pay rather than paper increases in the public sector pay bill.</P>
    <P>In combination with a new approach to long term unemployment that guarantees the unemployed part-time social employment and the freedom to earn whatever else they can for the remainder of the working week, these measures can overcome the poverty trap which is keeping around 300,000 Irish people in subjection and deprivation and a sector of our community confined to internal economic exile in a forgotten social Gulag, mainly on the outskirts of our major cities.</P>
    <P>This Government professes to believe in Culliton, but in its one and only budget thus far, it did the exact opposite to what Culliton advised.  It increased the tax <Col N="1704" /> wedge.  It imposed an income levy which completely reversed the tax reform which the Progressive Democrats had achieved in the last few budgets by effectively pushing the 27 per cent standard tax rate to nearly 29 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister now speaks of giving back the 1 per cent income levy but claims the cost to the Exchequer is great.  The cost of keeping the income levy is greater still. We cannot afford to keep the socially corrosive anti-work tax system that we have.  We cannot afford not to change it, but that is not the only area, of course, where the landmark Culliton report, commissioned by Deputy Des O'Malley, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, has been aborted, despite verbal protestations to the contrary.  We have not got the integrated industrial development agency for indigenous industry; the one-stop shop where State assistance of all kinds, including research and development, marketing and cash grants or loans would be provided on a co-ordinated basis.  Far from the agency integration advocated by Culliton, we have got from this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government a kind of agency mania, with one for every part of the country.</P>
    <P>The current Aer Lingus tragedy is one example of how our State owned industry and employment are being destroyed by State protectionism, bureaucratic inertia, inadequate management skills and lack of political foresight.  The need for competition and ending State monopolies was obvious when the Progressive Democrats called for it in 1988.  A joint venture arrangement then might have saved Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>The present investment programme does nothing to face up to the airline's long term difficulties and leaves the staff there exposed to an uncertain future.</P>
      <P>Telecom is another case in point.  Its 12,800 employees fear and oppose competition, with some real cause, but we cannot insulate ourselves from what is happening in the wider world.  We are on the brink of a massive telecommunications revolution where nearly everyone will have a portable phone and fibre optics will provide a radically different set of communications services to every home.  Ireland has, through Telecom, invested more than £1 billion in what is rapidly becoming obsolete technology. Portable telecommunications and fibre optics are poised to create a financial crisis for Telecom which will make the Aer Lingus debacle seems like a hiccup.  The sheer uncompetitiveness of Telecom, which has resulted in the recent price onslaught on the captive domestic customer to enable it to salvage its overseas business, simply has to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the situation elsewhere on this island.  Only 60 miles from this House, in Northern Ireland, British Telecom has 600,000 customers and services them with a staff equivalent of 3,800 personnel. Telecom Éireann with 1.1 million customers have 12,800 staff.  British Telecom is opening an office in Dublin next month and plans to offer our leading businesses very competitive services in areas where Telecom's monopoly cannot apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The warning signs for Telecom Éireann must be obvious.  I am no ideologue, but it is quite plain that unless the Government and the management of that company face up fully to the challenges <Col N="1706" /> of competition and the telecommunications revolution they will end up in the same sorry state that Aer Lingus is in now.  This Government, because of ideological hangups, is set to crash-land both Aer Lingus and Telecom.  We need to confront the ongoing crisis; not to massage peoples' fantasies.  We cannot afford the &ldquo;competence deficit&rdquo; that is destroying jobs, capital and investment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>We talk a lot in this House about unemployment but the Government has yet to grasp the nettle that unemployment will not be significantly reduced by current policies.  Paying 300,000 people not to work and helping them on the precise condition that they do not work or help themselves is another example of a poor country pretending to be wealthy.  We cannot afford to lose the efforts of 300,000 people on a permanent basis.  We cannot afford that policy of &ldquo;human set-aside&rdquo;. The Department of Social Welfare may feel that issuing 300,000 payments each week is a manageable exercise from the Department's point of view, but it is not manageable, not sustainable, morally, socially or economically.</P>
    <P>Of course, other solutions are more difficult to administer.  Regardless of whether we approach the issue from left or right, the fact remains that our response to long term unemployment needs to be radically changed.  We need to offer economic participation where we now offer only economic exclusion.  That is why the Progressive Democrats for a number of years have been urging that the community must become the employer of last resort for the long term unemployed.  We published proposals for a national community employment scheme last November and I welcome the recent contribution to this debate by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.</P>
    <P>What we need now is a start on building in Ireland a system whereby the community offers two or three days useful socially beneficial work each week to the long term unemployed and encourages them to use the remainder of their time <Col N="1707" /> to seek part time employment.  Where there is despair we can bring dignity, hope and a bridge to economic participation. This House needs to confront this issue urgently.  Time is not on the side of the complacent.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to the negotiations that might possibly take place on <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> II to which the Minister referred in the House a few days ago.  As I said earlier, the Government has to confront the fundamental problems in the economy and it would be more useful, rather than give percentage pay increases, to consider the cost of employment and the disposable income or take home pay of workers.  Would it not be better to give workers an increase in take home pay rather than a percentage increase, to give them an incentive and to increase morale given that many of those at work are fed up with the system that is being operated at present?  They feel that it is not worth their while making any effort because no one understands the case they are making with the result that they would be better off if they were not employed.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better for the employer also if the cost of employment was lower? Would it not be better if the 300,000 people who are unemployed and the 25,000 people who will be added to that number each year until the end of the decade could see a Government that rewarded those who showed enterprise and initiative and helped small businesses which are trying to do something for themselves and who wonder if politicians understand the needs of business today? One business person said to me last week that before they earn a penny for themselves they have to pay seven different taxes and that if they were to work for the Government they would have to pay an eighth in the form of withholding tax. Apart from being economic madness it is also bureaucratic nonsense.  The hands of business people are tied day in, day out; they have to complete application forms and come to terms with the bureaucracy associated with their business.</P>
    <P>We need to develop a philosophy of <Col N="1708" /> self-reliance because it is my experience that people from all classes, people who may be considered by some to be marginalised, all want to be independent and want their individualism to be respected. They want to be able to help themselves and provide an education for their children. They do not want the Government to interfere and seek to stop that.  If we believe in the philosophy of self-reliance which has worked well in the past in parts of the country and abroad in particular, we need to rethink the way we do some things.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford sweetheart deals which cosset the social partners at the expense of the social outcasts who are the unemployed and the school leavers. Public sector pay deals which increase the public pay roll at twice the rate of inflation in five years and leave the lowest paid public service workers hardly any better off are not worth any amount of industrial peace.  The time has come for Government to govern.  Blather about partnership and the absence of confrontation has gone too far.  For pay policy the emphasis from now on must be on slashing the excessive levels of taxation on work so that workers will enjoy higher take home pay and the overall cost of employing people will be reduced. Implementing such a policy would do more for employment creation than a hundred document launch jamborees in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>It is true that the market left to itself will not solve unemployment, but as far as employment is concerned, you cannot book the market either.  Unless we make it worthwhile for those who are unemployed to take up employment, for those in jobs to work harder, for business to take on extra workers rather than cut their payroll and unless we make investment in jobs more financially rewarding than depositing funds in banks we are paying lip service to the unemployment crisis.  Tax reform by itself will not solve unemployment but, as Culliton said no single, more potent means than radical pro-jobs tax reform is available to the Government in the fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> We need to confront our problems. Partnership is becoming a hackneyed expression for a conspiracy to avoid confronting realities.  Each time I hear a Government Minister or a Minister of State speak on television, or in this House or elsewhere, they seem to pin their colours to the partnership deal worked out with their coalition partners.  As I said last week, Fianna Fáil seems to think it has found a formula for staying permanently in Government.  It now has a compliant partner in the Labour Party but people are seeing quickly through this arrangement.</P>
    <P>This House is constantly being marginalised by the Government.  In a few weeks time we will have no Question Time and Ministers will not be held accountable.  That is supposed to be a pilot project; while I am all in favour of projects, of improving the way the House operates and making it more relevant, it is extremely important, if this House and democracy are not to be marginalised, that we are seen not only to be active but to deal with the realities and not use hackneyed phrases such as &ldquo;the partnership is working&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have been given many promises and there has been much rhetoric but little action.  The first budget from this Government was disappointing and Members need not rely on me for that information.  I would like to quote what Mr. Paul Tansey, economist and contibutor in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> had to say shortly after the Government introduced its budget:</P>
    <P>The first budget presented by this Government was a sorry affair.  Those who voted for change last November have been deeply disappointed.  This Budget has been inspired by the mistakes of the past and not the needs of the future.  Those who sought a new beginning have seen their hopes deflated.  This budget is stale, safe and unimaginative.  Those who believed that the Government would at last be forced to confront the jobs crisis have been confounded for this budget provides neither the vision nor the framework <Col N="1710" /> to create sustainable employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Paul Tansey not give any answers?  Does he offer any solutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution is not to make it better for somebody to be on £8,000 than to be on £15,000 or to have a situation that the unemployed person with four children has to earn over £14,500 for it to be worth his while to have a job.  We must go back to basic economics.  If one works it must be worth while for one to work, and if one works harder and longer it must be worth while for one to work, and if one works harder and longer it must be worth while for one to do so.  Until that is the case all the rhetoric and all the ideology of the Labour Party and all the great words about partnership plans and development plans and so on will not matter.  The Labour Party in particular will be judged by its record on job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats intend to come up with new and radical proposals on tax reform.  The Minister may say that it is easy to talk about rates and ask where he can find the money.  We will not be found wanting when it comes to telling the Minister where he will find the money.  The Minister can confirm that we were always good at identifying where the money will come from.  There can be nobody in this House now, as there was in 1988, who believes that we cannot afford to go down the road of radical pro-jobs tax reform.  The income levy must go.  All the disincentives to employment must go.  All the difficulties that are placed in the way of those who want to create jobs must go.  Employers must be made to feel welcome in Ireland and not hounded at every opportunity.  We must get away from the politics of treating everybody in business as some kind of criminal trying to rob the taxpayer and the economy generally.  In a country with 20 per cent of the labour market, 300,000, unemployed, what we need are more entrepreneurs, more enterprising people right around Ireland, not just in the cities <Col N="1711" /> but in the rural areas too.  We need to provide the framework that will allow them to create enterprises, to expand them and to want to give employment, as most of them do.</P>
    <P>We must also get away from the politics of throwing large sum of money at problems. We have an unfortunate attitude of regarding anything we get from Europe as free money and no regard is had for how it is spent.  If throwing money around could solve our problems I would not be standing here tonight talking about the 300,000 people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister for Finance is to respond to this debate.  I know that he too is concerned about the unemployment crisis.  I would like the Minister to tell me if he has firmed up his attitude in regard to the income levy. What is his attitude to tax reform?  How far does he think he can go?  Does he really want to go very far, or is he going to be a compliant Minister for Finance worried about keeping his Coalition partners happy and ensuring that all the spending programmes promised by the Labour Party are put in place?  We can certainly continue to spend money but by doing that we will drive more and more people out of employment, put down more and more entrepreneurs and we will have bigger problems after the national plan is in place than we have now.  We spend about £1 billion, at current prices, on unemployment benefits at the moment.  In seven years we will spend £7 billion paying people to do nothing.  That is a nonsense we cannot continue with.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion in the name of the Progressive Democrats to the House. I hope it will receive the support not just of Fine Gael but of the Government and that we will not have to continue to accept this blandness that passes for economics in business, this blandness that says that the Government have their partnership programme and the national plan.  That is no substitute for an economic plan or a business plan or a plan to solve our economic difficulties.</P>

      <P>If good suggestions are put forward, particularly at this time of the year, I am certainly prepared to have them examined, although it is not always possible to simply take them on board.  Deputy Harney said that she believes these things should be done over a number of years. I have argued that for many years.  Too often in the last 30 years a policy line has been taken and then reversed.  It has happened in the last ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened practically every year.  Let me refer to some of the articles quoted.  It is remarkable that eight or nine months ago commentators said that adopting a tough fiscal stance and a tough political stance would be disastrous.  In the last week or so they have agreed that the Government's approach was right.  The Government <Col N="1713" /> cannot change its policy line every month.  However, of the five major critics of some of these policy lines, four have now turned full circle.  I am glad they now agree with me, although I am aware that by the end of the year they may have changed their minds again.  I am anxious to listen to the debate this evening and most of tomorrow evening and where constructive points are put forward I will do my utmost to take these into account.</P>
      <P>In the limited time available to me I want to look at some of the wider international problems and their bearing on our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> what we have achieved and what we have yet to achieve. This is in no way to minimise the unemployment crisis, but the progress we have made in tackling our problems compares favourably with that of most industrial countries.  In recent years our rate of economic progress has been remarkable, considering the scale and duration of the international downturn. For example, in the last three years GDP growth here has averaged almost 5 per cent per year.  In contrast, EC annual average growth was less than 2 per cent; in the United States it was only 0.5 per cent and in the United Kingdom GDP actually declined by 0.75 per cent per annum.  We achieved our faster than average growth without fuelling inflation or resorting to massive public borrowing. This year Ireland and the United Kingdom are likely to be the only EC countries to show much by way of output growth.  While we may not have got everything 100 per cent right, we have certainly gone a considerable way down that road.</P>
      <P>Not only have we stronger economic growth, lower inflation and lower public borrowing than most other EC countries but our employment performance has also more than held its own by international standards.  In the last two years employment here has been broadly unchanged, while it has fallen by about 0.25 per cent a year in the EC and about 0.5 per cent per year in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The available information suggests that employment has been holding up well this year.  Payroll related revenue <Col N="1714" /> receipts for the first three-quarters of the year are encouraging.  Receipts from the training and employment levy show a year-to-year rise of 8½ per cent while income tax receipts, excluding DIRT receipts are up by 8¼ per cent.  PRSI receipts are also well in line with budget expectations.  All these indicators point to at least a modest increase in employment this year.  This view is supported by independent international forecasts.  The EC Commission forecasts, for example, predict that Ireland will be the only EC country, apart from Luxembourg, to show any employment growth this year.</P>
    <P>If our performance in terms of growth and employment has outpaced that of our EC partners in recent years &mdash; and it has &mdash; then our needs are of course also much greater than theirs and I readily acknowledge that.  I do not for a moment disagree with the view that progress to date has been well short of what is needed.  Unemployment here remains higher as a proportion of the labour force than in any other EC country except Spain.  Our natural rate of labour force increase is well above the EC average.  Although there has been some catching up in recent years, income per head in Ireland is still well below the EC average.  Reducing unemployment and narrowing the gap in living standards with our EC partners are two or our foremost economic challenges.</P>
    <P>The Government is well aware of the enormity of these challenges.  It has set out its strategy for responding to them on numerous occasions from the Programme for a Partnership Government to the National Development Plan.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss our strategy again here tonight because we need the widest possible public debate on these vital issues.  Ultimately, the response to both these challenges &mdash; the need to create many more jobs and to bring living standards closer to the EC average &mdash; will have to come through efforts to accelerate the growth of market based output.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing to most of the issues laid on the table tonight by Deputy Harney although we would argue about some of the means of implementing <Col N="1715" /> her suggestions.  I acknowledge the efforts made by the Progressive Democrats in the past, I will not criticise everything that has been suggested but it is extremely easy for everybody in this House, during Question Time each day and in every debate, to put forward reasons for implementing reports on the improvement of services.  I am not accusing any particular Deputy; everybody puts forward suggestions as to the spending of £10 million, £20 million or £30 million without specifying where the money will come from.  During a recent Question Time there were 29 occasions on which people glibly said that money should be paid.  If Deputies' suggestions during that day's Question Time were implemented it would cost about £400 million.  Such suggestions are put forward every week and as long as that continues it will be very difficult for a Minister for Finance or any other Minister to have a serious debate on matters.  As long as glib solutions are put forward on very important matters we will never control expenditure.</P>

We have to consider radical solutions and that can only be done by implementing unpalatable proposals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney asked a straight question on the 1 per cent levy.  To do away with the 1 per cent levy will not improve the position for the 300,000 people who are unemployed.  Take home pay in the last five years, including the period in which the Deputy's colleagues were in Government &mdash; I am sure they will share the credit &mdash; increased by between 10 per cent and 14 per cent.  The 1 per cent levy clawed back just a small amount of that money.  If we do away with the 1 per cent levy it will do nothing for the unemployed and nobody will be better off.</P>

      <P>If that could be targeted it would be very easy, but as the Deputy knows we cannot do that.  It would be a crude device.</P>
      <P>Central to acvhieving this goal is a radical improvement in competitiveness in all its forms throughout the whole economy &mdash; in the public enterprise sector no less that in the private sector.  This also applies in the sheltered sectors, both public and private, no less than in those manufacturing sectors which are fully exposed to the chill winds of international competition.  In those sectors which are exposed directly to international competition, the objective must be not just to maintain our international competitiveness but to improve it.  We have no room for complacency in this area. Other countries are making significant progress in containing their cost increases and we must not only match them in this area but do better.  This must and will be a key issue in any discussions about a new programme for economic and social progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For its part, the Government must do all in its power to improve the climate of competitiveness.  The role which taxation and the PRSI system can play in this area <Col N="1717" /> is important.  Our room for manoeuvre in this area is of course circumscribed by budgetary constraints.  I would not accept that the tax-PRSI wedge has been the primary cause of rising unemployment here in recent years.  Nevertheless, this is certainly one of the many issues which has to be addressed in tackling our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In looking at this in a sensible way, clear priorities must be identified.  In the Government's view, and there would be few who would disagree, the two aspects of our income tax system which will have the greatest impact on employment are reducing the tax burden on the lower paid and raising the threshold for progression to the higher rate of income tax.  To make significant progress in these areas on a financially responsible basis &mdash; and we have already made this clear in the Programme for Government &mdash; the thrust towards broadening the tax base must be continued.</P>
    <P>People are quick to endorse base broadening in general but they criticise the measures needed to achieve this. Only by ensuring that income, in whatever form it may be received, is subject to tax and, furthermore, is taxed on a broadly comparable basis can we ensure that the tax rates to which income generally is subject are no higher than necessary. Apart from economic efficiency, transparency and neutrality, there is also the important consideration of equity; if a given amount of revenue is to be raised, then those who are fully taxed must pay more than they otherwise would, simply because there are others who are not fully taxed.  We now have a fairer, simpler and less onerous tax system, with tax rates that would have been unimaginable five years ago.  Deputy Harney referred to that matter earlier.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved in tax reform is not confined to income tax.  Major progress has been made towards a better structure of company taxation over the period since 1988.  Business has a regime that is, overall, on a par with general EC norms, while striking a reasonable balance between encouraging investment and promoting employment.  Our corporation <Col N="1718" /> tax regime is now much more employment friendly than it was a few short years ago.  The changes in the capital gains tax code were in the same spirit as the income tax reform.  The changes made have been widely recommended over the years and they address, at source, a number of tax avoidance schemes in this area.  The flat 40 per cent rate for capital gains tax aligns the rates of capital gains tax and corporation tax. It also achieves, as far as practicable with a single rate, a measure of parity with personal income tax.  That has been welcomed by business as it works very well in the case of self-assessment.  Perhaps not every aspect of this system is clear but it is certainly much more efficient than any system that operated in the last ten to 20 years.</P>
    <P>The fundamental changes to the administration of our tax system, in particular the move to self-assessment, were introduced with one clear purpose in mind, namely to ensure that tax liabilities are discharged in full and in good time. The Government has in the last few years progressively strengthened the mechanisms for countering evasion and promoting prompt payment.  Clear concern for the impact of the tax system on employment was evident this year when a number of measures were brought forward, most of which were linked to assisting start-up business which is lacking here, as I have made clear on many occasions.  With the various business bodies, we considered ideas such as the new seed capital scheme.  For existing early stage entrepreneurs who wish to put their money into small companies the business expansion scheme is available. Every change possible has been made to try to stimulate activity in that area. Rollover relief from capital gains tax is now available on the sale of shares for established business people interested in moving from an existing company to a BES-type company.  The tax relief available for new employees investing in shares in their employer's company has been increased from £750 to £3,000.</P>
    <P>A second set of incentives is designed to encourage outside investment in Irish <Col N="1719" /> firms.  These incentives are linked to the BES scheme, which was extended for three years.  In addition the BES company limit was increased from £500,000 to £1 million.  In order to help new BES companies in their start-up phase, research and development is now regarded as permissible for BES purposes. The pension funds have agreed to the principle of investing in developing Irish companies.  This will provide money for start-ups, seed capital and equity investment.  The pension funds have prepared their own paper, which will be available shortly, in which they set out how they best see this risk capital working. This will be a very useful incentive to small businesses over the next few years.  The special investment accounts provide a special low tax regime for investment products with a large Irish equity content.</P>
    <P>Finally, specific changes were made in the tax code which will impact positively on certain sectors with employment potential.  The VAT on a range of labour intensive service industries was reduced from 16 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  A new scheme has been introduced for individuals investing in film production, the amount of tax relieved investment permitted for corporate investors has been increased and changes have been made to facilitate the making of films under co-production agreements with other countries. This arrangement has proven to be remarkably successful this year.  New arrangements allowing businesses which supply inputs to exporting companies to avail of VAT zero rating have been introduced. This scheme has been very helpful to exporting companies.  Further measures have been taken to improve a number of sectors in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government, we are seeking to strengthen Ireland's industrial scientific and exporting base in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report to increase the level of directly productive activity and to encourage a dynamic spirit <Col N="1720" /> of enterprise.  Most of the changes in the structures of Government Departments and industrial promotion agencies promised in the programme have already been put in place or will be put in place before the end of this year.  We remain committed to the further development and strengthening of a dynamic and efficient State enterprise sector &mdash; a Department was established for that purpose.  The Government intends to ensure that strong public companies provide value for money to the customer.</P>
    <P>The need for improved competitiveness is not confined to the exposed manufacturing sectors or to the State enterprise sector.  The sheltered private sector also has a major contribution to make to the national goal of increasing employment.  This means rigorously examining all existing practices and procedures to see whether they are promoting or inhibiting the maximum rise in employment.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government launched the National Development Plan.  The investment of £20 billion in the Irish economy over the period of the plan will greatly encourage activity in capital investment in a number of areas.  There was a two day debate on the plan last week and there is no need for me to repeat the points made.  The aim of the plan is to turn the investment which will be made during the period of the plan into the creation of approximately 200,000 jobs.  In the preparation of the plan I was adamant that we should set out clearly what would happen.  The reality is that between 10,000-15,000 jobs have been lost in the Irish economy every year for the past few years.  Clearly we are losing too many jobs and more emphasis has to be placed on the maintenance of existing jobs rather than merely the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for National Recovery and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the role of sound macroeconomic policies in creating the conditions for growth in employment has been amply demonstrated.  The consistent and clear implementation of the strategy which <Col N="1721" /> integrates the fundamental elements of a successful macroeconomic policy will raise employment.  Jobs in the private non-agricultural sectors have been increasing.  The Government's policies of reducing the debt-GNP ratio, reducing the burden of taxation on employment, maintaining a stable exchange rate within the EMS and seeking consensus and moderation in regard to the evolution of pay and industrial relations and policies which seek to encourage those sectors which will sustain growth in output and employment are all designed to generate a stable environment conducive to both investment and jobs.  The record of the past few years bears ample testimony to the success of this economic strategy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and, as I said at the outset, any constructive points made will be taken into consideration.</P>

    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate.

Like many other people, I have not been impressed with our success in this area to date.  I think most people appreciate and understand the reasons for this lack of <Col N="1722" /> success.

      <P>We should not cloud the issue and I do not think the Minister clouded the issue.  Our unemployment level of approximately 300,000 is of great concern to everyone.  Many publications have been issued putting forward ideas on how to address this problem.  I agree with the Minister that economic growth is the most positive way of creating sustainable employment in our economy.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote from a recent publication on Irish unemployment, which notes:</P>
      <P>That the prospects for unemployment in Ireland will be influenced by the fact that the natural growth rate of the labour force is now on a plateau and by the mid 1990s this will begin to be reflected in a decline in the number of labour market entrants.  Also the level of net external migration is expected to increase when the recovery from the present recession begins to feed through to labour market opportunity in Britain, Europe and North America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rapid growth of exports, combined with a recovery of domestic demand as both the household and corporate savings ratios fall, could generate very rapid growth in Ireland in 1993 and beyond.  This prospect, allied to some easing of the pressures on the supply side of the labour market, justifies the expectation of a decline in unemployment in the medium term.  Despite these developments high levels of unemployment will remain and <Col N="1723" /> measures are required to address this central economic and social problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the measures which have been introduced during the past week.  On 11 October last the Government launched the National Development Plan, which envisages a total investment in our economy of £20 billion during the years 1994-97. Approximately £8 billion of this funding will come from Structural and Cohesion Funds, while £12 billion will come from the Irish public and private sectors.  One hopes this investment will lead to the creation of 200,000 jobs, 120,000 of which will be in the manufacturing and international services sectors.</P>
      <P>We have heard from contributions in the House and from political commentators in the media that in framing the National Development Plan, the highest priority for the Government has been the creation of jobs.  As the first line of the synopsis states, the plan is about jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>And spending, and getting money from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be very serious about this matter.  Money is coming from Europe, £8 billion, but does the Deputy decry that?  If we were not to receive the £8 billion the Deputy would be saying something else.  It has been a tremendous achievement on the part of the Government to obtain £8 billion.  Let us now hope that the money from Europe, and the public and private moneys, will be invested wisely.  Deputies will surely agree that we must benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is on how to turn growth into jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make constructive comments about a serious issue. The Deputy is trying to throw snowballs at an issue that warrants more constructive <Col N="1724" /> debate than that in which he is engaging.  If the Deputy does not recognise that this type of funding will create economic growth thereby allowing us to make some gains, he is looking at the issue foolishly.  If we invest this money wisely we will benefit.</P>
      <P>The synopsis states that the plan is about jobs.  The central objective of the plan is jobs.  It is also further designed to reintegrate in the economic mainstream the long term unemployed and those at risk of joining that category.  There are four key elements in the plan's strategy all of which will help to create and sustain employment: investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, agriculture, natural resources and in tourism; investment in infrastructure to improve the capacity of the economy to compete i.e. our roads and ports; investment in education and training to develop the skills of our people and investment in local development.  A key feature will be the integrated development of areas of high long term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The development measures in the plan should, across the various sectors, produce approximately 200,000 jobs gross in industry, services, natural resources sectors and construction.  Since the Deputy has asked about them, I will highlight the various measures.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the industry operational programme it is envisaged that 120,000 jobs will be created, in projects supported by the IDA, in the years up to 1999.  Under the plan, £600 million will be spent on tourism, with the creation of 30,000 jobs in the years up to 1999.  A total of £3 billion will be spent on agriculture, forestry and fisheries, with the creation of 6,000 jobs in the period up to 1999.  A total of £2.6 billion will be spent on transport which will improve the infrastructure, resulting in the creation of 14,000 jobs in the wider economy between now and 1999.  A total of £1.26 billion will be spent on local development projects which will create 21,000 jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappoined with the Minister's speech.  His statement that he would not accept that the tax and PRSI wedge has been the primary cause of rising unemployment indicates a stark difference between the Government side of the <Col N="1726" /> House and this side in relation to what must be done in terms of economic policy.</P>
    <P>I want to set out Fine Gael's policy in relation to converting economic growth into employment.  Fine Gael believes that the main area of economic reform which has not been utilised is tax reform.  It is the main recommendation of the Culliton and the NESC reports that has not been implemented.  Essentially, Fine Gael believes in lower direct taxes and lower taxes on employment.</P>
    <P>We believe there are two major problems with the Irish tax code.  First, it is a clear barrier to additional employment simply because of the tax wedge.  The level of tax, levies, PAYE and PRSI, is a direct incentive for employers to reduce payroll costs, to cut staff numbers and not to employ more people.  Second, it impinges unfairly and severely on the low and middle income sector to such an extent that people with large families who are paid for every additional child through the social welfare system will be, in some instances, better off unemployed and on social welfare than at work.  It is quite wrong for a married couple or a parent with eight children to be paid more on the social welfare system for every additional child while in employment they have the same tax free allowance as a married couple with no children.</P>
    <P>The Government is at an economic crossroads in relation to finding a successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There is no doubt that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been very good to some people.  It has been good to those in public sector employment and those with access to special pay claims, but it has been very bad for school leavers who have had to depend on emigration for the prospect of a job.  It has been very bad for the taxpayer.  In 1990 public spending absorbed 35p of every pound in circulation. It now absorbs over 38p in the pound.  The growth in taxation year on year since 1990 has been over 6 per cent. It has exceeded the nominal growth rate in so far as if one adds inflation and adds <Col N="1727" /> the real growth rate, the tax burden has been rising in real terms.</P>
    <P>I could not help but wonder at the uncritical appraisal of the Exchequer returns some weeks ago.  The Minister was complimented on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; for good housekeeping and looking after the national finances.  It seemed to escape most commentators that what was provided for in the budget and happened in the first three-quarters of this year was that spending rose by 15 per cent and taxes by more than 8 per cent.  It is very easy to meet one's targets if one has that level of latitude of increase in taking money out of people's pockets.  Whether it be the 1 per cent income levy, or the VAT hype from 16 to 21 per cent or probate tax, the fact is that the real burden of taxes is rising very substantially this year.</P>
    <P>We are now facing into a critical time with the successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There is a socialist party in Government, the Labour Party, allied to a party whose basic policy is to implement the policies of whoever may be their partner in Government, committed to high spending and high taxation.  This on top of the recent record of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be ruinous to our prospects of improving competitiveness and directly damage the prospects of enhancing employment growth.  We can achieve a dual objective of enhancing employment prospects and increasing living standards by tax reform. If we focus on integration tax and pay talks, on net pay, as did the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, we can make people better off and, at the same time get an extremely moderate pay deal while reducing the tax wedge.</P>
    <P>The figures are quite startling.  For example, current expenditure in 1990 was £8.4 billion; this year, it is more than £10.5 billion; taxes were under £8 billion in 1990 and this year are more than £9.5 billion.  The Minister will know that there will be no scope for abolishing the 1 per cent levy &mdash; which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of tax reform, in terms of the <Col N="1728" /> basic allowances, in relation to the narrowness of the standard band of taxation &mdash; and that he will be unable to make progress unless he comes to terms with the issue of some form of ceiling on the growth of public expenditure.  Unless the Minister can ensure that public expenditure increases do not grow at a rate as fast as our economic growth and as quickly as our national income is rising, then we shall, be doing nothing other than living beyond our means.</P>
    <P>The most important cornerstone of any successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is to say to the trade union movement, to the lobby groups queuing up for extra money, to those in the Labour Party and the Minister's backbenchers who want to implement the Programme for Government that we must have a ceiling on public expenditure that will not exceed 2 per cent in real terms.  Unless such a discipline is put in place the prospect of having any money available for tax reform will go out the window.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally we must decide that the fruits of economic growth must finance tax reform.  Of course, it is possible to say that we will impose VAT on food and introduce a property tax, but that would not reduce the overall burden of taxation; it would be merely moving it from one pocket to the other, robbing Peter to pay Peter.  If we look at the European comparison we find that while we have similar tax rates to the wealthiest countries in Europe when we compare ours with what are described as the Cohesion states, we find that we have much higher rates of tax and, therefore, those on lower incomes pay huge taxes.</P>
    <P>Between 1981 and 1992 the real burden of PAYE on a single person increased by 10 per cent.  Allowances have not kept pace with inflation and we have since had the imposition of the 1 per cent levy. But if one looks at the effect on married couples with three children one finds that the real burden of income tax has risen by a staggering 86 per cent.  Is it any wonder that people cannot afford to take <Col N="1729" /> up employment unless it is in excess of the average industrial wage?</P>
    <P>The successor to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the next budget afford the Government the last opportunity to implement the recommendations of the Culliton report. Unless we face the chronic issues of heavy taxation on the low paid we will not make progress.</P>
    <P>The income tax code contains some glaring anomalies and inequities.  For example, it is totally unacceptable that a single person begins paying income tax at the marginal rate of 35p in the pound, including employee's PRSI, on £72 per week.  We know that that is driving people into the black economy.</P>
    <P>We have seen the effect of the 1 per cent income levy.  People earning in excess of £10,000 per annum are worse off as the levy is applied on the first £ of income compared to people earning £7,800 per annum because the cut-off point is £9,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to be very blunt with the trade union movement and say that if we are serious about improving our competitiveness we must look at labour costs.  Indeed, the most critical component of labour costs is not the rates of pay but rather the rate of tax applicable to those rates of pay.  If one takes the example of the clothing industry, a labour-intensive sector, employing in manufacturing approximately 13,000 people we find that, compared with Northern Ireland, the gross pay costs here are higher but the net take-home pay of the workers here is lower.  Therefore, we lose both ways.  Workers here must get pay increases to maintain a standard of living, yet our products are uncompetitive.  If we are to make any meaningful contribution to competitiveness we must deal with the tax wedge.</P>
    <P>Our tax code does not discriminate fairly in favour of families.  In the mid-eighties when the tax free allowance in respect of children was abolished the child benefit was payable to all parents <Col N="1730" /> in its place.  Not only does that create a poverty trap at a particular level of income but it is grossly unfair.  People do not really become poor until they have dependants and must rear a family.  It is then they encounter problems.  In addition, the role of the stay-at-home spouse, be it man or woman, has been neglected in our tax system.  The concept of caring for dependent relatives, children and adults, in the home has been neglected in our tax system.  There is need for radical reform in all of those areas.</P>
    <P>My priorities would be the immediate abolition of the income levy; a range of new allowances that would support the cost of rearing a family; tackling of the cost of child care when, in some cases, both spouses must go to work and increasing the dependent relative allowance. Under the latter scheme the paltry allowance is £110.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a unique opportunity. I will not quibble with his growth forecasts in that the 3.5 per cent predicted over the period of the National Development Plan is a consensus figure agreed by many economists.  That means that were the Minister not to introduce changes in the tax system for the next four budgets, revenue would rise dramatically.  That affords the Minister the unique opportunity, that did not arise over the past few years, to use the proceeds of that economic growth to reduce taxes.  I fear that the Minister will not get reform of the conciliation and arbitration process and that he will be unable to get a payroll neutral.  At the end of the day, the Minister will go for a deal at almost any price even though the unions are seeking a moderate deal at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also have the benefit of the lowest lending rates on servicing the national debt for some time, a windfall for the Minister, estimated by the National Treasury Management Agency at approximately £100 million per annum.  The Minister has the benefit of favourable trends such as low debt-servicing cost, low inflation, moderate pay <Col N="1731" /> demands and a period in which public sector pay has risen by two-and-a-half times the rate of inflation over the past six years.  They present him with an ideal opportunity to adopt a radical approach.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment growth, it is quite striking that Europe as a whole is not at the races in comparison with the other major trading blocs.  If one looks at comparisons between Europe and the United States in any decade in the past century, one will find that the United States had a four times better record at creating jobs from the same level of growth as the European economy.  That is because they have a more flexible labour market and a lower tax regime.</P>
    <P>I must also say to the Minister &mdash; as the Taoiseach said at Question Time today &mdash; that the real potential for employment growth resides in the services sector.  My party colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, yesterday launched our detailed policy document in this area.  There is no doubt that a tax treatment of the services sector is particularly punitive and inhibits employment prospects.  In the wider services sector, including the public service, there are enormous possibilities for employment creation through job sharing. I am aware of umpteen nurses who cannot avail of job sharing in general hospitals due to the insufficient number of places.  Because of the number of women in the workplace job sharing is ideal.  There is not enough development in that area to expand employment.  This is not work sharing, it is job sharing where the costs and the hours worked are split and there is no additional cost.  From a productivity point of view you get better value for money because people who work longer hours lose their energy and concentration.  In internationally traded services we are not getting our share of the jobs and that issue needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I support the Progressive Democrats motion in relation to competition policy. Undoubtedly there are restrictive practices <Col N="1732" /> in our economy and a lack of competition in certain areas in the services sector.  Something I was disappointed with in the National Development Plan 1994-1999 last week was that even though there was money for energy, telecommunications, An Post and transport, there was no clear reduction in cost. There were no targets for the ESB or Telecom Éireann to say that there should be a relative real improvement in cost structures over a period.  There was no demand or <i>quid pro quo</i> for efficiency in return for capital investment.  That struck me as reasonable because, in terms of selling into the Single European Market, you would not start from here if you had a choice due to our peripheral location, especially when the Channel Tunnel is built, because of our low consumer population base.  We have natural disadvantages and, therefore, we need a sharply focused semi-State sector that will revolve around a direct improvement in cost cutting during the next few years.</P>
    <P>I regard the issues that will be decided between now and the next budget as fundamentally critical to the prospects of school leavers.  People at work, particularly in public sector employment, are well represented and when times are bad they can protect their interests.  Whether in the banks, in new technology or other areas it is possible to do a deal in productivity or new technology to protect those in employment.  In recent years the record shows that the most unprotected group is school leavers who number 25,000 every year.  What I found most objectionable about the National Development Plan was that if you worked out the figures for the 140,000 job losses and the demographic change you were relying on massive emigration of about 20,000 per year to prevent unemployment reaching the horrific figure of 400,000.  That is unacceptable. If nothing else, that should focus the Minister's mind.</P>
    <P>While the issue of the 1980s was the national debt, the clear issue of the 1990s <Col N="1733" /> is unemployment.  It is not a rhetorical issue, it is a case of whether these young people will have a prospect of living in Ireland.  If you scan through all the reports &mdash; we do not need more analyses or consultation &mdash; it will be evident that we need decisive action.  The one part of all those recommendations and conclusions which has not been implemented is tax reform, critical to which is reform of PAYE and PRSI.  Between now and the budget my party will vigorously campaign to ensure there is radical reform in those areas.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Harney as the new leader of the Progressive Democrats.  I am sure she will acquit herself well in that portfolio.  I hope that as a result of re-energised Opposition activities we will shake this Government out of the cosy consensus which operates.  During the summer months we witnessed the opening and reopening of various places throughout the country.  If an excuse was found to open a small extension the Minister took it. Much of this is window dressing by the Government to prove to the electorate that it is doing something.  If we can shake this cosy consensus and the feeling that it has a monolithic majority we will achieve much through the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is timely because it touches on something which has concerned us during the past few years.  It is opportune because Deputy Harney referred to the poverty trap and the difficulties experienced by people in receipt of gross pay ranging from £8,000 to £15,000.  It is also timely in that we have had a response to a specific question to the Minister for Finance today.  It is strange that a person on a gross pay of £8,000 will now have a net disposable income of slightly less than a person on a gross income of £14,000 or £15,000 per year.  A person on a gross pay of £8,000 in receipt of benefits will have a net disposable income of £8,254; a person on gross pay of £9,000 will have a net disposable income of £7,716; a person <Col N="1734" /> on gross pay of £10,000 will have a net disposable income of £7,470; a person on gross pay of £11,000 will have a net disposable income of £7,377; a person on a gross pay of £12,000 will have a net disposable income of £7,392; a person on a gross pay of £13,000 will have a net disposable income of £7,764.  The situation gets worse.  That exposes the farcical situation where a person on a gross pay of £13,000 ends up with less net disposable income than a person on a gross income of £8,000.  A person in my constituency in Limerick who is in receipt of gross pay of £15,000, £300 per week which is way above the average in most of the companies in the area, who would regard himself as well off would end up with a net disposable income, on those figures, of £170 per week.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Minister's frustration as his statement was a rehash of what he said on the budget with a few new elements introduced to encourage budding entrepreneurs but he had no reply to the unemployment problem.  He encapsulated what the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said this afternoon in regard to what he would do about unemployment.  He said the county enterprise boards were the only measure which could do something extra to encourage employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton responded in his document &mdash; which I encourage the Minister to read if he wants to get good points from the Opposition &mdash; to the services sector and pinpointed how that sector has been neglected down through the years.  There has been an over emphasis on new measures to encourage manufacturing activity.  We have failed to recognise the great potential within the services sector.  Deputy Richard Bruton does the Fine Gael Party justice in producing this document.  It gives a boost to the services sector and I encourage the Minister to take many of its ideas on board.  A businessman in Newcastle West said to me recently that at this stage he almost feels like a criminal.  Not only is he harassed by social welfare officers, he is harassed by the tax man and it is almost regarded as dishonorable to make a few bob.  That is what the business people are up against and that is what they are putting up with in the services sector. Because of the way in which things have evoloved in recent years he has a point. About two weeks ago in my own town of Newcastle West we had a blitz where the whole community knew that ten or 12 people were in the area, calling to every business.  The Minister may say they have a job to do in regard to compliance and so on but I assure him it does not encourage <Col N="1736" /> those businessmen to take on extra employees.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Zoo.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1990 the Government established a committee of inquiry to investigate into Dublin Zoo.  This committee produced its report, the Doyle report, named after its chairman, Mr. Mick Doyle.  Over three years later the Doyle report has still not been released and the Government has continued to support and subsidise the current zoo authorities, who, according to the report, should be made accountable.</P>
      <P>The report, a copy of which I have with me, makes very interesting reading.  It is stated that it is published by the Stationery Office and is to be purchased through any bookseller or directly from Government Publications Sales Office. However, it is unavailable.  Tomorrow week, on 27 October 1993, at a special general meeting the zoo authority is seeking to amend the laws of the society relating to its dissolution and to transfer the society's assets, including the animals, to a new company, the Zoological Society of Ireland Limited, thus I understand, removing itself even further from accountability.  In this swift move it has already been committed Government funds.  I have heard the sum of £10 million mentioned but I would like to have that figure clarified.  I understand the money has been committed by the Minister for Finance without reference to the findings of the Government inquiry or any need to publish those findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The zoo authorities, supported by Government neglect, hope to hijack the national zoo, limit its own liability and pursue what I believe to be personal agendas, not in keeping with the zoological society's constitution, under the pretext of limiting members' liability. <Col N="1737" /> Under the zoo's current regulations, its dissolution requires a 40 per cent attendance of members and a two-thirds majority vote.  This is the best protection afforded to the members.  Until such time as the report of the inquiry is published properly and the public and Members of this House are allowed the opportunity to debate it, the zoo authorities should not be allowed any further diminution of their responsibilities.  On 27 October the president of the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland and the council will seek to dismantle this protection, transfer authority to a meeting of not fewer than 30 members, compared to 3,000 under the present rules.  They further propose to transfer all assets to themselves and their nominees as a new authority, thus disenfranchising all other members and rendering the inquiry into Dublin Zoo &mdash; an extensive inquiry where people gave the benefit of their expertise &mdash; academic and redundant.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised this country an open Government and accountability. In order to fulfil this promise in relation to the Royal Zoological Society, no transfer of assets, dismantling of members' protection or further Government support for the current zoo authorities should be allowed until the Government inquiry into Dublin Zoo is published and released and, most importantly, acted upon by this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in a reply to a parliamentary question on this issue last week, the Doyle report dealing with the future of Dublin Zoo was presented to the Minister for Education, who decided against publishing it pending consideration of substantial issues arising from it.  One issue concerned the allocation of future responsibility for the zoo.  The Doyle report, in making a recommendation that a Department should have a role in relation to the zoo, did not indicate which Department this should be.  Having considered this issue <Col N="1738" /> the Government recently agreed to transfer responsibility for the zoo from the Department of Education to the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I have since examined the recommendations of the Doyle report and can straight away affirm my agreement with the conclusion that there is a future for Dublin Zoo.  I have therefore asked the Office of Public Works to prepare a plan to ensure the future of the zoo having regard to the Doyle report and the following four objectives: 1. to operate to commercial standards so that State subsidies can be minimised; 2. to continue the captive breeding of endangered species and the presentation of species to foster an appreciation of nature and global conservation; 3. to achieve animal care which meets the highest international standards within appropriate space requirements; 4. to contribute to the tourism and recreational potential of Dublin by providing quality visitor facilities and programmes.</P>
      <P>I hope the plan will be available early in the new year and that after it is considered by Government the conclusions of the Doyle report and the outline of the plan will be made public.  I do not envisage that any further grants will be made available to the zoo until the plan is examined by Government.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Zoo Society setting up a new company, this is entirely a matter for them.  Their offer of two places on the new company for two senior civil servants was accepted.  It provides the opportunity for the State to assess the performance of the new company to ensure that any State investments are in accordance with agreed objectives and to an agreed plan.  The move does not preempt the findings of the plan, which will thoroughly assess all aspects of the zoo from animal welfare to organisation and financial performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been criticisms at the delay in reaching final conclusions on the Doyle report.  However, now that the decision has been made to <Col N="1739" /> transfer responsibility for the zoo to the Department of Finance, there will be no delay in formulating a plan which will clearly indicate what steps need to be taken to guarantee the future of the zoo. The plan will have to address issues such as extra land, future State subsidy and other matters.  On the question of extra land, it is too early to say, however, what the plan will show and we should not anticipate its findings.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial subsidy, prior to 1985 State support for the zoo was very modest.  Given the financial difficulties of the zoo between 1985 and 1992, grants totalling £1,620,000 were made to keep it viable.  The money was not wasted.  It provided the zoo with the chance to effect changes to improve its financial performance and with the success of the Dino Live exhibition this year the zoo should not need financial support in 1993 to assist its operations.  It is nevertheless a fact of life that most zoos in the EC require some subvention, particularly given their important role in conservation and education.  The plan will show how the financial and commercial performance of the zoo can be maximised so that such subventions, if any, can be minimised.</P>
    <P>I stress that a well run modern zoo has a vital role to play in global conservation. This was confirmed in the Doyle report and the view is supported by the foremost non-governmental conservation organisation in the world, the IUCN, who emphasises the vital role zoos have in captive breeding programmes to ensure the viability of endangered species.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment, a matter which is causing concern particularly in Dublin city.  We are all aware that under the Competition Act it is illegal for two <Col N="1740" /> or more businesses to come together to agree a price rise.  Is it reasonable to expect the ordinary drinker to believe that the announcement by the Licensed Vintners Association to increase the price of a pint by 3p and the price of a half one by 3p is not collusion?  It is unreasonable to expect them to believe otherwise.  The Director of Consumer Affairs stated on public record that he believes there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that some collusion is taking place.  It is regrettable that only the Minister can deal with this matter and that the director cannot do so himself.</P>
      <P>This 3p increase is being imposed on top of a 2p increase imposed by Guinness during the summer.  At that time the publicans tried to block the increase imposed by Guinness and it is disappointing to note they have switched from gamekeeper to poacher in such a short time. According to the consumer price index, the price of alcoholic drink increased by 3.3 per cent during the last 12 months, more than twice the increase of any other consumer product.  The latest increase will push that figure up to 6 per cent, at least three times the rate of inflation.  All other business had to honour commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and deal with rising costs, but they have been able to avoid such large price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present increases are not due to increased taxes because for the first time in a number of years the budget did not impose a tax on drink.  At that time the Minister for Finance indicated that he hoped the trade would follow his lead, but in this case his words have proved hollow.  It is difficult not to believe there is an element of collusion attached to the increase.  It is only two weeks since the wage increase that is supposed to have triggered the increase in the price of drink was accepted, and it is difficult to believe that the Licensed Vintners Association is unaware of what is happening on the ground.  It is much more likely that it is <Col N="1741" /> trying to give a lead to its members in a collusive manner.</P>
    <P>This matter illustrates how toothless are the consumer watchdogs we have set up, because neither the Competition Authority nor the Director of Consumer Affairs have the power to deal with the problem.  Instead, the law quite unrealistically expects the aggrieved drinker to take a case to the High Court.  Our only fallback is if the Minister can indicate tonight that he will investigate the matter and take action if necessary.  The enforcement of competition law should not lie in political hands.  We should give our consumer watchdogs power to act without fear or favour, they should not have to look over their shoulders to see if the Minister will promote an investigation or take action in a matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern during the past week is the fact that the giant Irish Distillers Group swallowed up Cooley Distillers with the loss of 29 jobs.  It is evident that the sole aim is to reduce competition in the drinks industry, because they immediately closed down the operation of the Cooley distillery. That is an equally worrying trend in the spirits market.  Is it good for the consumer or this country that such a competitor should disappear?  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that matter because that type of takeover requires ministerial approval before a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>In the past the price of drink has brought down Governments.  Therefore, we cannot take this issue lightly; it is important for many consumers and I would like to know how the Government proposes to deal with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that I, as well as Minister Quinn and the Government as a whole, share the concern of the Deputy in this matter.  The outrage reflected in newspaper comment over the past two days is certainly justified as the licensed trade <Col N="1742" /> has once again proposed to raise its prices.</P>
      <P>The rules of competition, which are now generally well known, prohibit price agreements and concerted practices which restrict competition.  The prohibition includes decisions by associations which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices and applies to price collusion or any arrangement to raise prices in unison.  Price fixing in any of its guises is manifestly unacceptable and shows a blatant disregard for the competition law and for consumers. Although the price of alcoholic drink can and does vary between licensed premises, a decision by the trade association which causes prices to increase by a uniform rate needs some explanation.</P>
      <P>It is certainly not in the interest of the consumer.  We are not satisfied that the increase is warranted or can be explained or justified on the basis of any objective criteria.  The latest proposal by the Licensed Vintners Association raises serious questions about competition and, as the Deputy suggested, the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the drinks industry.</P>
      <P>What is also a source of concern is the fact that the vintners take the opportunity around this time of year, each year, to put up their prices.  This annual round of price increases seems to operate like clockwork.  It is time for the vintners to show responsibility towards consumers in matters of pricing and to fulfil their obligations and duties under our competition laws.  Based on the past three budgets, the Government has shown responsibility in its attitude to taxation on drink and we expect a corresponding response from the vintners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be pointed out that excise duty rates for alcohol products generally have not been increased since 1989.  This was in recognition of the Single Market and the greater harmonisation of prices. There has therefore been a significant real decline in the tax element of drink in recent times.  The Government is certainly <Col N="1743" /> playing its part.  It is regrettable that the retail trade has not responded with equal restraint and regard for the Irish consumer and our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>The procedure and methods used by the vintners in their pricing policies certainly need examination.  For this purpose, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has asked the Director of Consumer Affairs to let him have a full and comprehensive report on all aspects of this issue.  It will then be for consideration what action to take under the appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>I will refer the other matters, to which Deputy Bruton alluded, to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who will take appropriate action, if he has not already done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter tonight.  At present more than 300 people, mainly elderly, are awaiting hip operations in Cork city and county and in Kerry. Approximately 2,000 people are waiting for orthopaedic outpatient appointments, which can mean a wait of up to four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an attempt to deal with the position the Department of Health and the Minister allocated £2 million to the Southern Health Board to tackle waiting lists.  That health board was unable to recruit temporary surgeons to deal with the backlog and the problem was compounded by the fact that the four orthopaedic surgeons in the Cork area, who are employees of the Southern Health Board and are paid by the board, refused to increase their workload.  The Southern Health Board had two choices.  They could either not avail of the Minister's allocation or subcontract the work, which I proposed they should do.  They wisely decided on the latter option and the majority of people awaiting operations, despite reservations about travelling by <Col N="1744" /> helicopter to Belfast, are delighted that the end of their painful wait is in sight.</P>
    <P>The weekend before last a determined telephone campaign was launched to discredit and undermine the health board initiative.  I received seven telephone calls all in respect of the same theme, that the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, was not equipped to carry out hip operations, substandard implants were being used, after care facilities were inadequate and Cork doctors on the return of the patients from Belfast would not deal with the patients.  This was a reflection on the quality of care in Cork, which I do not accept.  I have every confidence in the ability of doctors in Cork, other than the orthopaedic surgeons.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hospitals Consultants' Association through its spokesperson has carried out a campaign of misinformation alleging ineptitude on the part of the Southern Health Board management.  I have been a critic of the Southern Health Board management in the past when it was justified, but on this issue it has shown foresight, courage and determination in helping the elderly and the sick and carrying out the wishes of the Minister.  Allegations that the Southern Health Board was inept in relation to the appointment of the fifth orthopaedic surgeon and the installation of the clean air theatres must be rejected.  The Minister will agree that the delay was in the Department and the two decisions were made in the latter part of this year.</P>
    <P>The real reason there is such a furore in regard to this matter is that those consultant orthopaedic surgeons employed by the Southern Health Board are also working in private hospitals in the Cork area, the Bon Secours Hospital and Shanakiel Hospital.  They have a vested interest in having long public waiting lists because the longer the public waiting list, the greater the demand for their private practice.  They are greedy men who are putting their selfish financial wellbeing before the health of their patients.  I know of people who are 80 years of age waiting <Col N="1745" /> for surgery at present.  Those consultant surgeons wish to continue to manipulate the present system for their personal financial gain.  Because the Southern Health Board initiative will undermine their lucrative set up, they are attempting to undermine it.  What they are doing is possible under the common contract.  The present position in an orthopaedic hospital is that, in a 34-bed ward there are 17 patients, in another 34-bed unit there are 11 patients and in a 27-bed unit there are 14 patients.  The hospital has the beds and the equipment, but the goodwill and determination of the orthopaedic surgeons is lacking.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to investigate immediately why there are vacant orthopaedic beds in Cork when the equipment is available and why the surgeons employed in the Southern Health Board will not increase their workload.  I appeal to the Minister to review the common contract because it is giving those people the liberty to do what they like.  They can mix their private practice with their other work.  Their public performance, the work they are paid to do, is suffering as a result, as is the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for affording me the opportunity of addressing this very important issue.  At the outset I would like to outline the background to the board's decision to make arrangements with the Royal Victoria Hospital for the provision of hip replacement surgery.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I launched a major action programme on hospital in-patient waiting lists.  Under this initiative, £20 million is being provided in 1993 to reduce waiting lists where there are long waiting times for admission to hospital. In all, the programme allows for the provision of 17,254 additional procedures nationally this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board received a waiting list fund allocation of £1,736,500 in respect of 1,370 additional cases.  With the exception of the 300 hip <Col N="1746" /> operations at St. Mary's Hospital, Gurranebraher, the health board has indicated that the other 1,070 additional operations for which it has contracted will be met locally.</P>
    <P>Delays in implementing the initiative in respect of the 300 hip replacements at the Cork Regional Hospital group were due to difficulties in recruiting a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  Despite extensive advertising, no suitable locum could be found.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that, in August last, I approved the filling of a fifth orthopaedic surgeon post in Cork on a permanent basis.  In the normal course, it would take a number of months to have a post filled on a permanent basis, but in the meantime, the health board has, without success, been making exhaustive efforts to fill the post on a locum basis. With regard to orthopaedic facilities generally, the Deputy will also be aware that approval was given to the Southern Health Board in 1992 to provide new clean air theatres at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher.  Building work, I understand, is due to begin within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The central feature of the waiting list initiative is that the agreed additional activity targets are achieved.  I have stated that where it is clear that targets cannot be met in 1993, for whatever reason, funding will be redirected to other agencies.  It was a purpose of the waiting list initiative, which was agreed in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the suffering of those on long waiting lists should be alleviated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Finding itself unable to meet the agreed target and mindful of its responsibilities to patients, the Southern Health Board took steps to ensure that 300 patients awaiting hip replacements should not have their suffering prolonged and should not be denied the opportunity provided by the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>Before entering into a contract with the Royal Victoria Hospital to carry out <Col N="1747" /> 300 hip operations over the coming months, I am aware that the Southern Health Board approached all other suitable public and private hospitals in the country but these hospitals were unable to carry out the work in line with the health board's requirements in terms of timeframe and cost.</P>
    <P>The health board took the very responsible step of looking further afield in its efforts to help these patients.  Surely anyone interested in patient care would applaud them for their efforts.  I would like to stress that the option of having the operation carried out in the Royal Victoria Hospital is entirely voluntary, and one for each individual patient concerned. I would also like to stress that the health board has satisfied itself as to the expertise, facilities and quality of care at the Royal Victoria Hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm my support for the speedy and effective action taken by the Southern Health Board in tackling the lengthy public waiting lists for hip operations and I would like to put on record my congratulations to the members of the board, including the Deputy opposite, for their unanimous support for this worthy project.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the constant criticism and apparent undermining by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, of the action taken by the Southern Health Board to ensure speedy relief to a large number of patients who would have been in pain and discomfort for an unacceptable period of time.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be unreasonable to expect a responsible representative medical body to fully support all action taken in ensuring that the target of over 17,000 additional procedures to be carried out in 1993 with the special allocation of £20 million for the national waiting list initiative is met.</P>
    <P>The indications at present are that this target will be met bringing enormous benefits to thousands of patients and their families throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> I wish to inform the Deputy and the House that I am determined to achieve the maximum amount of good with the resources available to me.  I will not be deflected by any individual or interest group from achieving this objective.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has found a solution to the problem which arose three months ago regarding the escort of involuntary patients to psychiatric hospitals.  I am sure he is aware of the recent incident where three psychiatric nurses were stabbed.  This incident led to much unease among many people.  The Psychiatric Nurses Organisation directed its members not to escort involuntary patients.  The present position is complex in that it is difficult to admit involuntary patients to hospital even where a patient's family is trying to have the patient admitted.  Unless the patient is willing to go to hospital it can lead to many problems.  Some of those people are badly in need of medical care.  Health care professionals feel helpless and they hope nothing tragic will occur.</P>
      <P>The patients are often a danger not only to themselves but to others.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the gardaí have been very helpful and deserve much credit for their work while the Minister tries to resolve the problem.  The gardaí will state that they do not believe it is their responsibility and they, like the health care professionals, would like the problem resolved.  Everybody realises that it is a very complex problem and appreciates that the Minister is working on it but we would like to find out what progress is being made in order to avoid another accident such as the one that happened a number of months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most concerned about the assault on three psychiatric nurses by a patient on 9 July last.  It was shocking that three nurses in the course <Col N="1749" /> of their work should sustain such terrible injuries.  The assault took place while the psychiatric nurses were attempting to return a patient who had been detained for treatment in St. Ita's, Portrane, to the hospital after he had absented himself without leave.  I would like to pay tribute in this House to the bravery of the three nurses involved and wish them a full recovery to health.</P>
      <P>Following the incident on July 9, I immediately took the following course of action.  I requested the assistant inspector of mental hospitals to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assault and to make recommendations in relation to the escort of psychiatric patients.  I visited the three injured nurses in Beaumont Hospital, who were making a good recovery from their horrific injuries, and satisfied myself that the Eastern Health Board would provide all necessary support to them pending their return to full health.  I met with the unions representing the three nurses &mdash; the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU &mdash; and invited them to submit their views for consideration.</P>
      <P>The assistant inspector of mental hospitals recently submitted his report on the incident to me.  He noted that there was nothing in the previous history of the patient to suspect that a potentially homicidal attack on the three psychiatric nurses would ensue and that the professionalism of the personnel of the various disciplines involved prevented a more tragic outcome.  He commended the written procedural policy regarding nursing escorts of St. Ita's, Portrane.  He concluded that the assault in question falls into a one in a million category and its extraordinary rarity must in no way be used to put any escort procedure in place that would take from the dignity of patients, increase the unease of the already traumatised relatives, increase the likelihood of danger to escorts or diminish the professionalism of psychiatric nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was noted by the assistant inspector <Col N="1750" /> in his report that the psychiatric nurse was the escort of choice and that violence is not usually associated with psychiatric patients.  In fact, the incidence of violence in society in non-psychiatric cases far outweighs the violence associated with the psychiatrically ill.</P>
    <P>Discussions have also taken place between the assistant inspector, officials of my Department and the Garda Síochána to discuss the respective legal responsibilities of the Garda and the health services in relation to escorting patients.  The constraints of the current legal framework were discussed and it was agreed that legal changes were necessary to provide more suitable arrangements for escorting patients to psychiatric hospitals.  New mental health legislation is currently being prepared in my Department and will include new provisions in relation to escorting psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>As a result of the assistant inspector's report and my meetings with the unions involved, my Department wrote to each health board on 12 October requesting that the following steps be taken by health boards in relation to each psychiatric service: guidelines for staff involved in escorting patients to be drafted and agreed.  These guidelines should define the respective roles of medical staff and nurses in escorting psychiatric patients; appropriate training programmes to be provided for staff involved in escort duties; that the requirements of the health and safety legislation be met in respect of escort duties and, in particular, that safety statements be drafted and agreed; the staffing levels for escort duty in each service to be reviewed; staff on excort duty to be provided with mobile phones; a formal reporting system to be put in place following each episode of escort duty to be provided with mobile made available for staff on escort duty.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have scheduled a meeting on 26 October 1993 with the two unions representing psychiatric nurses to tell them of the outcome of the assistant inspector's report and of <Col N="1751" /> the steps taken to guarantee the greater safety of nurses on escort duties.  I will be meeting the union representatives at a later date.  I hope that in the light of the assistant inspector's report and the action that I have taken, the members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association employed <Col N="1752" /> by the Eastern Health Board will resume escort duties in co-operation with their colleagues in the nursing and medical professions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 October 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 35 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I have earmarked up to £250,000 for each board for the September-December 1993 period for the purposes of enterprise support activity.</P>
      <P>With a view to avoiding delay in the commencement of the county enterprise initiative and ensuring that local enterprise potential is stimulated at the earliest possible date, the boards have been established on an informal basis, operating within the aegis of my Department on a similar basis to the Western County Development Teams.  In view of their informal status in the interim phase it has not been possible, for legal and technical reasons, to delegate budgetary control to the boards.  However, I do wish to ensure that the boards will be afforded flexibility in dealing with small projects while ensuring that job displacement is avoided.  Accordingly, grants of £10,000 or less will be made to individual qualifying projects by the Minister, following on the recommendation of the relevant County Enterprise Board based on the positive recommendation of its Evaluation Committee.  Grants in excess of £10,000 will be made by the Minister, acting on such a recommendation, as endorsed by the County Enterprise Co-ordinating Committee.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that delays have been a feature of the operation of the current procedures for ensuring co-ordination among the different State support services. The procedures which have been divised are in accordance with standard public accounting practice and are a necessary means of avoiding duplication and guarding against possible displacement effects on employment levels in the immediate or external environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of particular employment setbacks suffered by the Galway area early in the year, I decided to allocate a special advance provision of £250,000 from the County Enterprise Fund to the Galway City and County Enterprise Board, to be allocated and disbursed through the long established mechanism of the Western <Col N="1549" /> Development Fund.  Since the formal notification of this allocation to the board, on 29 April last, this special allocation has been fully committed by the board through grants approved by my Department for small economic projects. I am satisfied that the expeditious way in which these applications have been processed will be replicated at a national level in the coming months.  I will, of course, be keeping a careful watch on the emerging situation.</P>

      <Quest>if he has considered the consumer implications of the recent survey undertaken by the Automobile Association which found that only one in four filling stations were supplying premium unleaded petrol despite the fact that this is suitable for the vast majority of cars and is 10p to 15p per gallon cheaper than super-plus unleaded, and that because all stations sell super plus many motorists were effectively being forced to buy the more expensive brand; the steps, if any, he intends to take to deal with this situation to ensure that motorists/consumers have a proper choice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the findings of the survey in question.  I am asking the Director of Consumer Affairs to pursue the matter. It would appear that motorists, and rural motorists in particular, are getting a raw deal.  The consumer should at least be given the opportunity to exercise choice as between the two types of petrol in question.  It would be a most unsatisfactory situation if petrol companies were exercising this choice on the consumer's behalf.</P>

      <P>Thirty-two projects have been approved under the NOW Initiative including the projects referred to by the Deputy.  Four of these projects will have completed activity funded under NOW by the end of 1993.  The remaining four will complete in the course of next year.</P>
      <P>Community funding allocated to all the projects supported through the NOW Initiative is for the purpose of initiating specific pilot actions over a predetermined time frame.  The overall objective is to support innovatory approaches which focus on facilitating greater access for women to training and employment opportunities in which they are currently under-represented.  In this respect the positive experiences gained in implementing projects should subsequently inform the training, education and employment policies of public agencies which are financially supported through the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, project organisers cannot assume, that in the likely event of EC funds being made available under the next Support Framework for Ireland for Initiatives such as NOW, that ESF assistance will be available to prolong existing projects.  Such an assumption would run counter to the EC Regulations which govern the funding of approved projects. These do not envisage that the same projects will be indefinitely funded.</P>
      <P>A Green Paper on the future of all the EC Initiatives has been widely circulated by the European Commission and comments have been invited.  Responses are now being assessed in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the responsible Minister, I strongly support the objectives of the three initiatives which deal with the development of human resources &mdash; NOW, Euroform and Horizon.  Of particular significance is the fact that in Ireland approximately <Col N="1551" /> one hundred community and voluntary groups have direct support from the European Social Fund for the first time. They are doing excellent work.  I want to afford other groupings who were not included on this occasion because of the inadequacy of available funds an opportunity to benefit in the next round.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the Commissioner for Social Affairs and Employment, Mr. Padraig Flynn, and underlined the importance and effectiveness of these initiatives.  I have every reason to believe that the Commissioner is very favourably disposed.  Accordingly, I confidently look forward to the continuation of NOW, Euroform and Horizon and significantly increased Community budgetary provision for them over the period of the National Development Plan, which itself includes references to these three human resource initiatives.</P>

In this context, therefore, I would be concerned should any deterioration in the cost structure for business arise, including increases in the cost of professional indemnity insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the insurance industry <Col N="1552" /> that it is too soon to say whether or not the settlement referred to by the Deputy will have any effect on the cost of professional indemnity insurance in the Irish market.  I would add, though, that it is my understanding that very little in the way of substantial professional negligence cover is written in the Irish market; it tends to find its way to the London i.e. international market, the premia rates for which are determined by developments world-wide.  The putative capping of Irish awards, therefore, would be unlikely to have any significant impact on premia for substantial professional negligence covers.</P>
    <P>I must remind the House that my statutory responsibility as insurance supervisory authority relates solely to ensuring that insurers meet their statutory solvency requirements.  Consequently, I do not have a statutory function in relation to the cost of insurance.</P>

      <P>The company has announced that it will introduce a phased reduction in the Tallaght plant's operations commencing on 25 October in addition to implementing a number of temporary lay-offs.  These measures are being taken in response to a temporary reduction in orders from the plant's main UK customer in the final quarter of 1992. It is expected that the plant will return to normal levels of activity in January 1994. I am fully aware of the contribution this company made to employment in the Tallaght area over a long number of years and I can assure the Deputy that the IDA is engaged in discussions with the company's senior management aimed at securing the long term future of the Tallaght plant as a viable entity.</P>

      <P>The prospects for Leader II, a successor rural development programme to the present EC Leader Community initiative, hinge upon the outcome of an extensive consultative exercise being conducted by the European Commission on the policy guidelines and priorities for the Community initiatives in the next programming period, 1994-1999.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I have earmarked up to £250,000 for each board for the September-December 1993 period for the purpose of enterprise support activity.  The development of criteria for apportionment of funds between the different boards will be addressed in the context of the operational programme for local development under the National Development Plan 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>No private sector funding has been directly allocated to the county enterprise boards.  However, the financial institutions responded to the Government's initiative by collectively committing funds of £95 million to be used in conjunction with the county enterprise boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These funds will be available for loans <Col N="1573" /> on favourable terms, including no guarantee in the case of incorporated entities and the underwriting criteria will reflect a balanced view of the financial institutions' good commercial practice and social responsibility in playing their part in achieving the aims of the county enterprise initiative in tackling the unemployment problem.  I hope this line of support will provide a source of complementary funding to applicants who qualify for grant assistance under the guidelines provided to county enterprise boards.  In addition, I am pleased that the banks have confirmed their willingness to provide specialist staff to assist in the evaluation and operation of projects on a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>Enterprise projects submitted to county enterprise boards for funding will be evaluated in terms of commercial viability by evaluation committees which will be comprised of, among others, personnel designated by the banks.  Officials of my Department will continue to liaise with the financial institutions on the detailed implementation of the scheme. I am satisfied that there will be a continuing positive response from the financial institutions arising from those discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Deputy will be aware that public expenditure on industrial programmes extends across a number of different Departments and agencies.  Secondly, not all such programmes are directly tied to job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that, in so far as my own area of responsibility is concerned, the effectiveness of industrial programmes and the extent to which they are achieving value for money in terms <Col N="1574" /> of job creation and other economic indicators are kept under constant review.  In this regard the resources of my Department have recently been strengthened specifically to review the effectiveness and value for money of industrial programmes for which the Department has responsibility.  The industrial database now available to the Department also enables it to monitor, on an ongoing basis, expenditure in this area.  Furthermore, the EC Commission requires that the industrial programmes which are co-financed for Structural Funds purposes under the industry operational programme, are independently evaluated on a continuous basis.  The external evaluator's reports are submitted to a Monitoring Committee which is made up of representatives from the Commission, relevant Government Departments, agencies and social partners, and which obviously exists to monitor the implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>The IDA, as the biggest industrial development agency, accounts for a sizeable proportion of expenditure on industrial programmes.  IDA grant payments are linked to the job creation performance of companies in a variety of ways.  In the case of capital grants, all new grant agreements since 1988 provide for a formal annual review of a company's growth and job creation performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> agreed targets.  The release of further grants, or the revocation of grants already paid, is then based on the results of this review.  In respect of employment grants, half the moneys involved are paid to the company on creation of the jobs concerned, and half one year later, if the jobs are still in existence.</P>
    <P>While the &ldquo;cost per job&rdquo; is seen by some as the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of expenditure on industrial programmes, it is, in my view, by no means the only measure against which value for money ought to be assessed, and I intend to ensure that a wide variety of yardsticks are used to assess the effectiveness of our programmes.  I am having this whole area reviewed, including the methodology used for calculating cost per job, for this purpose.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the 1993 annual report of the SME Observatory, representing small and medium sized enterprises, has concluded that small firms in the manufacturing trading and distribution sectors, particularly in lower income countries such as Ireland, are likely to be the first victims of the EC open market and are particularly likely to be burdened with increased administrative formalities arising from EC rules; and if he proposes to take any action to reduce this competitive disadvantage faced by small and medium sized enterprises in peripheral countries such as Ireland arising from the single market.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers.  The Government recognises that the Single Market, while representing a tremendous opportunity does indeed present a competitive challenge to Irish companies. Both the Government and the EC Commission are acutely aware of the need to take horizontal measures to boost the ability of SME's to compete in a barrier free zone.</P>
      <P>The <i>National Development Plan for 1994-1999,</i> just published, acknowledges that indigenous industry here, which is made up almost exclusively of SMEs, suffers from a general lack of competitiveness. Consequently, a key priority of the plan is the development of the indigenous sector.  The primary focus of strategy will be on improving the competitiveness of Irish owned industry with a view to achieving an increased share of international and domestic markets, thereby providing a platform for sustainable employment growth.</P>
      <P>The new agency for the development of indigenous industry, Forbairt, which will bring together the IDA's indigenous industry functions and the technology development responsibilities of EOLAS, will have a crucial role in the process.</P>

      <Col N="1576" /> In June 1993, I took the initiative in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce and Technology, Deputy Séamus Brennan, in establishing a Task Force on Small Business.  The task force which is chaired by the Minister of State consists of the owner-managers of 14 small businesses. Its members therefore have firsthand knowledge of the problems faced by small business.  The task force is examining, and will make recommendations on, all of the main issues affecting small firms, including the administrative burdens issue, which the Deputy refers to specifically in his question. It hopes to have completed its work by the end of October.  I can assure the Deputy that its recommendations will be given full and prompt consideration.</P>
    <P>At EC level, I understand that proposals of the Belgium presidency aimed at accelerating existing EC Commission measures for assisting SMEs are currently under consideration.  I further understand that it is the presidency's intention to have these proposals considered at the next Internal Market Council scheduled for 11 November 1993.</P>

      <P>The European Social Fund (ESF) programme evaluation unit was established in my Department in January 1992 with financial assistance from the European Commission.  The function of this unit is to evaluate the effectiveness of vocational training, education and employment progammes co-funded by the ESF.  The scope of the unit's activities extends therefore to all public training and vocational education programmes which receive financial support through the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the evaluation unit involves surveys and interviews with course providers, trainees-students and employers.  The current work programme includes a survey of employers to inform evaluations of economic training delivered by the State agencies and a survey of the long term unemployed to inform the evaluation of programmes directed at this target group.  An important aspect of the work of the evaluations unit is that the outcome of evaluations is now directly influencing and improving the delivery of <Col N="1578" /> national education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Enterprise and Employment, my task is to ensure that the considered recommendations made in evaluations influence both the content and the delivery of EC funded programmes. A very significant proportion of the funds assigned in the National Development Plan will be spent on education, training and employment schemes.  The valuations to be undertaken throughout the plan period will help to continually improve the quality of training and so greater enhance the prospects of participants in gaining worth-while employment on its completion.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs authorities are fully alert to the situation that prevails with regard to the sale of rolling tobacco and cigarettes without payment of Irish excise duty and VAT in the Moore Street area.  During the period July, 1993 to September, 1993, 33.55 kgs. of hand rolling tobacco were seized by Customs and Gardaí from thirty nine street traders in the Dublin area.  A further 8.75 kgs. were seized in Dublin Port.  During the same period eight seizures involving 23,420 <Col N="1580" /> cigarettes were made in the Dublin area. Intelligence gathered by the Customs authorities indicate that most of the tobacco being sold by street traders is imported concealed in consignments of fruit and vegetables which arrive from Continental Europe via Northern Ireland.  This intelligence resulted in the seizure of 900 kgs. of Samson tobacco in the Dundalk area on 6th August, 1993. The sale of cigarettes appears to be confined to small quantities which could have been imported under the guise of being for personal use or could have been obtained from crew members of ships in Dublin Port.  There is no evidence of any large scale abuse in the sale of cigarettes at present.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Customs authorities, with the co-operation of the gardaí, where necessary, are taking all practical steps, on an ongoing basis, to deal with this illicit trade.</P>

      <P>The decentralisation of the Office of the Collector-General to Limerick involves the relocation of some 550 staff.  The Collector General's Office is responsible for the collection of very large amounts of revenue.  Given the scale of the project and the need to avoid risks to revenue collection while the transfer is taking place, the project is being implemented in five phases.  The relocation of the first phase of 154 staff commenced in May 1993 and was completed in June 1993.  It is planned that a further 100 staff in the second phase will be relocated by early 1994.</P>
      <P>Subject to a planned review on the basis of experience with the first two phases, it is expected that the saff involved in the remaining phases will be relocated in 1994 and 1995.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the project has been the subject of detailed planning and that to date the operation has proceeded very smoothly.</P>

    <P>Notes on table:</P>
    <P>1.  The main components of the Income/Poverty Trap &mdash; the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases &mdash; are the withdrawal rate of Family Income Supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving 48 per cent tax rate).  Both of the measures are designed to achieve desirable objectives in the area of incentives for unemployed persons to take up paid employment, and this is the current policy priority.  However, for persons in employment, their operation can give rise to the possibility of an increase in their income being more than offset.</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay. Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.  Thus, the FIS withdrawal, represented above as coinciding with gross pay increases does not generally occur.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people potentially affected by this trap are small.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected by the trap is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax.  The numbers of people both paying tax and receiving FIS is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this trap potentially &ldquo;applied only to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.  On the basis of the OECD assessment this would suggest a maximum number of 5,000 to 6,000 persons potentially affected.</P>
    <P>4.  It should be noted that statistics of income distribution published by the Revenue Commissioners are not a valid measure of the number affected because (a) the data are not desegregated by family size; (b) they include categories such as widows, widowers, single people etc.  which are not relevant to the table; (c) the figures are expressed on an annual basis and include people entering employment late in a year, working for short periods or leaving employment early in the year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation whereby a person who earns £60 and over per week must pay the full rate of PRSI contributions and will not be entitled to the full rate of benefit in the event of sickness or unemployment unless they earned at least £70 per week.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991 I extended social insurance coverage to all employees earning £25 per week or over.  Such employees can as a result of this qualify for the full range of benefits, including pensions.  However, in the case of short term benefits it would not make sense to pay the full rate of benefit, currently £55.60 per week for a single person, to someone whose earnings are as low as £25 per week.  Such a person would have a strong incentive to give up work and claim benefit instead.  In the case of people earning less than £70 per week, therefore some benefits are paid at reduced rates.  The threshold of £70 ensures that a single person would have an entitlement to the full rate of £55.60 per week, only in circumstances where the incentive to work is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PRSI exemption for low-paid <Col N="1589" /> workers is a separate feature of the social insurance system.  People whose earnings in a particular week are under £60 do not have to pay the employee's social insurance contribution.  However, the employer still has to pay the full employer's share, and the employee retains entitlement to social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>People with gaps in their insurance may fail to meet the yearly average condition. This can happen for a number of reasons, including leaving employment for periods to care on a full or part time basis for home and family.  This situation affects in particular women who work full time in the home, of whom there are some half million.</P>
      <P>I plan to bring forward proposals to address the question of pension provision for people in this situation.  My proposals will be formulated in the context of the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Pensions Board, which I expect to receive shortly.</P>

      <P>I am aware of delays in the hearing of personal injury cases in the High Court and these are matters of great concern to me.  It must be noted, however, that since the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court increased in August 1991, the number of personal injury cases being set down in the High Court has decreased by almost 50 per cent, from 10,090 in the 1990-91 legal year to 5,432 in the 1992-93 legal year.  This decrease has already reduced the volume of cases awaiting disposal in the High Court.  I expect this reduction in volume to continue with a consequent reduction in delays.</P>
      <P>Delays in the disposal of personal injury cases can be the result of a variety of factors which are not all court related. I am informed that approximately 90 per cent of personal injury cases are settled out of court.</P>

    <P>However, I also understand that where a company does not cease to trade certain grants will become repayble on the occurrence of certain events.  The conditions under which IDA will recover its money varies with grant type.</P>
    <P>In the case of ordinary and preference shares, I understand that the conditions governing payback are contained in a shareholders' agreement between the IDA and the investee company in respect of each investment made.</P>

      <P>The <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> is a very comprehensive statement of the Government's strategy for tackling unemployment.</P>
      <P>The key elements of the strategy directed at strengthening employment performance are</P>
      <P>&mdash;improving competitiveness, especially in relation to labour costs;</P>
      <P>&mdash;economic and fiscal strategies that support enterprise, job creation and job maintenance; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;attacking poverty traps that keep people out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Over the plan period it is estimated that about 200,000 jobs will be created in industry, services, natural resource sectors and construction.  These jobs are expected to translate into net non-agricultural job growth of between 70,000 and 100,000 over the period of the Plan depending on the level of wage competitiveness improvement achieved and the strength of the growth in the world economy.</P>
    <P>Specifically in the case of industry, it is envisaged that some 20,000 gross jobs per annum on average will be created over the Plan period in indigenous industry and through inward investment.</P>

      <P>The FÁS Enterprise <Col N="1598" /> Scheme together with its Business Appraisal Training Programme and Community Enterprise Programme, form the FÁS Integrated Enterprise Programme. The aim of the programme is to assist participants to develop a business idea by training them in business and technical skills and helping to prepare a business plan.  The programme is aimed mainly at unemployed people.</P>
      <P>Enterprise allowances are offered to support the participants involved in the first period of trading.  To qualify for such payments one must have been unemployed and signing on the live register and be in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for 13 weeks immediately prior to joining the scheme.  Attendance at a recognised training course is reckonable towards this qualifying period.  The business proposed must be potentially viable, fulltime and independent and cannot have started before FÁS approval.  Enterprise allowances totalling £40 per week for self employed people without dependants and £65 per week for those with dependants are paid for a period of 40 weeks.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the new Department of Social Welfare back to work allowance scheme, in so far as it relates to unemployed persons wishing to enter self-employment, is that the period spent on any FÁS scheme/programme is reckonable in calculating the length of time spent on the live register prior to seeking to participate in the scheme. Accordingly, participation in FÁS enterprise training courses will not adversely affect one's eligibility for the Department of Social Welfare back to work scheme.</P>

However, two national organisations representing driving instructors were invited in May 1991 to establish a voluntary registration scheme for driving instructors in association with the Irish Insurance Federation.

      <P>Section 159 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, enables a sanitary authority to provide facilities for the reception of dead bodies during the time required to conduct any post-mortem examination ordered by a coroner.  I have no function in this matter and, in particular, I have no power to direct a particular authority to provide these facilities.  It may well be that a different approach to the provision of post-mortem facilities would be appropriate in modern circumstances and discussions will be arranged on the matter with the Departments of Justice and Health.</P>

      <P>Under EC Regulations payment may not commence for the 1993 special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes until after 1 November 1993 and even then only a 60 per cent advance may be paid in cases where the necessary administrative or on-the-spot checks have been carried out. Payment of the balance due in any case can only be made when all 1993 applications for ewe premium, special beef premium and suckler cow premium lodged by the farmer concerned have been processed.</P>
      <P>It is expected that payment of advances will commence next month.  Payment of advances and final instalments will be made as speedily as possible.</P>

There has been a considerable increase in the number of applications under the various measures and total applications are expected to exceed 600,000 in the case of 1993 livestock schemes alone.  The comparable figure for 1992 was 420,000.  In addition area aid applications from farmers with livestock amount to 140,000.  Many schemes are highly complex in their administration.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for suckler cow premium on 19 cows.  At an inspection of his herd it was found that one of the animals on which he had applied for premium was an ineligible in-calf heifer.  He was deemed to have made a false declaration in his application and under EC regulations he must be refused payment for 1992 and be debarred from the 1993 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named has appealed the decision on the grounds that one of his cows had died and that he inadvertentlty included her in the number of cows on which he was applying for premium. Since the cow died some months prior to application the person named could reasonably be expected to know the number of cows in his herd at the date of application and his appeal accordingly must be rejected.</P>

      <P>Statistics of export sales of all Irish owned small and medium enterprises are not collected by the Central Statistics Office.  However, An Bord Tráchtála's annual survey of exporters gives statistics on exports of manufactured goods and services by indigenous exporters, most of whom would be small and medium enterprises.  These statistics exclude exports of bulk meat, dairy products and fish.  Export sales of indigenous industry in the last five years are as follows:</P>

      <P>There are no proposals under consideration by my Department for the provision of railway ferry links to either the UK or Europe. A project of this nature would require significant public investment which would not be justified on the basis of the existing and potential volumes of traffic on the rail system.  Moreover, it would not be practical, because of rail gauge differences, to run train ferries between Ireland and the UK or Europe.  However, the upgrading of rail links from West British ports to the Channel Tunnel is an important element in the Government's strategy for the development of Irish trade and the reduction of the adverse effects of Ireland's peripherality.  My Department has been actively pressing for the upgrading of such rail links which are seen as being essential to the integration of Ireland into the community wide transport networks and to facilitate the movement of goods to and from Ireland via the U.K. landbridge and the Channel Tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing Operational Programme on Peripherality rail connections and ship transfer facilities are being upgraded at a number of ports, on the basis of assistance from the EC Structural Funds.  In addition, the National Development Plan which was published recently, and has been submitted to the EC includes provision for the development of the railways and ports on the <Col N="1621" /> basis of assistance from the Cohesion Funds and Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of an initiative by the European Commission to undertake pilot action studies of links on the European Combined Transport Network, my Department and the UK Department of Transport have agreed that the Ireland/UK/Mainland Europe links should be examined.  The European Commission has agreed to co-fund the proposed study.  My Department and the UK authorities will shortly appoint consultants to undertake the study which is expected to be completed early next year.</P>

      <P>Schemes of grant-aid towards the cost of installation and upgrading electricity supply to farms in disadvantaged areas have been provided for over a decade, initially under the EC funded FEOGA Western Aid package and, since 1990, under the Exchequer funded Farm Electrification Grants Scheme.</P>
      <P>When the present scheme was introduced in 1990, £500,000 was available for grant-aid.  However, budgetary constraints reduced that amount to £150,000 in 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>Taking the prevailing budgetary position into account, the scheme has been under review in my Department.  The ESB has been paid for completions carried out under the scheme to-date in 1993, and I am currently considering the future options for the scheme.</P>

      <P>While the initiative for any change in tariffs rests initially with Telecom Éireann, I had the Deputy's proposal put to the company for consideration.  Telecom Éireann has advised me that, when preparing the tariff rebalancing package which it submitted for approval last year, it considered the possibility of special cheap rate calls similar to those proposed by the Deputy.  The company has also advised me that, aside from serious technical difficulties which the implementation of the Deputy's suggestion would have, there would also be serious cost implications for Telecom Éireann which it could not currently contemplate.  In addition, while there is a drop in telephone traffic between the hours of 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays inclusive, I am advised that it is not sufficient to accommodate extra traffic arising from a concession of the nature requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the problems that arise from substance misuse in all parts of the country and I readily acknowledge that this problem is particularly prevalent in suburban areas.  My Department has in place a number of specific interventions which target young people and parents. These interventions seek primarily to prevent drug misuse problems arising and to combat those which have arisen in the community.</P>
      <P>Many of these initiatives aim to raise awareness of the problems posed by drug misuse but they also seek to educate and equip people with skills so that they can make informed decisions and act responsibly.</P>
      <P>Most of these initiatives rely on inter-sectoral co-operation for their effectiveness and I set out, hereunder, programmes engaged in by my Department in conjunction with other Departments and non-statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Substance Abuse Prevention Programme</i></P>
      <P>This programme is a joint initiative between the Health Promotion Unit and the Psychological Service of the Department of Education with assistance from the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  It is a comprehensive drug education programme which involves the whole school staff of participating schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Programme had an extremely successful two-year pilot phase and is currently being revised and will be available on a wider basis from November 1993. The materials consist of five modules &mdash; Identity and Self-Esteem; Assertiveness; <Col N="1627" /> Feelings; Attitudes and Influences; and Decision Making.  The overall aim of the programme is to enable students to develop their ability to take charge of their health and to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Pilot Project on Parent Education on Alcohol, Drugs and Family Communication</i></P>
    <P>This programme has been developed by the Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the Cork Social and Health Education Project of the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>This project recognises that young people and their parents must be provided with assistance to help them deal with the problems posed by both licit and illicit drugs.  To this end, a course is being developed which focuses, not only on drugs themselves, but also on the skills and personal attributes that help people deal with drug situations.  These skills relate to such areas as listening; communication; self-esteem; conflict resolution; and discipline.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Solvent Abuse Resource Materials</i></P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland has developed Solvent Abuse Materials.  These materials were designed for use by such people as youth leaders, instructors of community training workshops, youthreach projects as well as the formal education sector.  The contents of the package are also flexible enough for use in special schools, residential centres and as an aid to the Juvenile Liaison Scheme of an Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy is that drug and alcohol education is not only about drugs and alcohol but also about people. Thus, while young people need accurate information about drugs, this alone is not sufficient to ensure responsible behaviour. Information must be backed up by assistance in the development of skills in relation to the use of drugs.  This incorporates, among other things, the <Col N="1628" /> enhancement of self-esteem and decision making skills.  Young people also need to examine attitudes to drug use &mdash; both their own as individuals and the attitude of the community in which they live.  This resource affords the educator the opportunity to do all these things.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers?</i></P>
    <P>This is a community-based training programme for health/education professionals and others interested in drug-related problems which they meet in their own work.  The Health Promotion Unit runs convenor training programmes for this pack in conjunction with the eight regional health boards.</P>
    <P>As a result of these courses 400 convenors have been trained to use this pack. The response of those trained in their two-day training programme has been overwhelmingly positive.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Educational Materials</i></P>
    <P>The Unit makes available a series of booklets and leaflets on the subject of drugs for both the professional and the general public.  Titles available include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Understanding Drugs for Parents;</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Understanding Drugs</i>&mdash; a booklet for the general public;</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>The Facts About Drug Abuse in Ireland</i>&mdash; for professionals;</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Solvent Abuse &mdash; a guide for professionals and parents.</i></P>
    <P>The whole question of substance abuse is also kept under constant review by the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Justice&mdash;Mr. William O'Dea TD.</P>
    <P>It is readily acknowledged that an inter-sectoral approach is one that provides the best opportunities for tackling this problem effectively.  The inter-sectoral co-operation between the Departments of Health, Justice and Education was significant in preparing and implementing a very wide range of programmes during European Drug Prevention Week 1992.  This whole week which had as its aim the reduction of <Col N="1629" /> drug misuse among young people will be repeated in 1994 and it is envisaged that similar levels of co-operation among both statutory and non-statutory agencies will ensure the implementation of another successful initiative.</P>

      <P>There is a close liaison between my Department and the Department of Health to support schools including schools in the Dublin area, in the introduction of educational programmes on substance abuse.  These programmes deal with abuse of all drugs, including solvents, alcohol and tobacco.  All schools, both primary and post-primary, and third level colleges, have been provided with information on the abuse of substances.</P>
      <P>A major pilot project on substance abuse has taken place over the past two years focused on post-primary schools. This project was carried out with the Department of Health and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre, Clonliffe Road, Dublin and with support from the EC. The outcome of this project, including educational resource materials, are being disseminated to all post-primary schools during the current school year.  A programme of inservice training for teachers will be included with the dissemination.</P>

    <P>My Department also co-operates with the regional health boards and voluntary agencies such as youth organisations and <Col N="1633" /> parent groups in initiatives aimed at alerting young people to the dangers of substance abuse.

      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that agreement in principle has been given for the provision of a new school building to replace the existing premises. Arrangements are being made to initiate the architectural planning for the project. It will be considered for inclusion in the building programme in due course in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>There have been recent representations regarding the provision of <Col N="1638" /> PE facilities for this school.  Due to demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  As a result it is not possible in present circumstances to grant aid provision of physical education facilities at existing schools without such facilities. Provision of PE facilities in such schools will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has an application for a resource teacher to be shared between the following group of schools in the Letterkenny area of County Donegal: Illistrim national school, Scoil Muire gan Smál, Scoil Cholmcille, Scoil Talamh na Coille, Scoil Mhuire, Baile na nGallóglach and Glenswilly national school. The creation of additional resource teacher posts in national schools in a particular year depends upon the teaching resources which can be made available in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the resource teacher is to support the ordinary teaching staff in meeting the special needs of handicapped children attending ordinary classes. When posts become available they are allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.  At present, there are seven special resource teachers appointed by my Department.  These teachers are based in the Cahirciveen, Clonakilty, Carrick-on-Suir, Clifden, Tuam, Gorey and Newbridge areas.  While no resource teacher appointments have been made to date in 1993, the question of further such <Col N="1639" /> appointments is being actively considered. The needs of the schools in question will be considered in this context.</P>
