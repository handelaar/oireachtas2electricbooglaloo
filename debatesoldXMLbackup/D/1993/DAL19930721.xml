      <P>I might remind the House that this is a special sitting and that under the procedures laid down for us by an order of the Dáil of 9 July, the business has been fixed and determined.  I am concerned about the raising of extraneous matters especially having regard to the time limits laid down for dealing with the Order of <Col N="2134" /> Business on this day which should commence at this time; indeed 10.30 a.m. was scheduled for hearing the report in respect of the first of the Dáil Select Committees &mdash; Finance and General Affairs.  Let us have regard to this factor if we are to utilise time for any other purpose.</P>

    <Title>DÁIL SELECT COMMITTEES AND JOINT COMMITTEE ON GENERAL AFFAIRS: STATEMENTS. - Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of opening the debate this morning on the new legislative committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the new select committees and the Joint Committee on Foreign <Col N="2138" /> Affairs is the most far-reaching, innovative and substantive development in the evolution of reform structures that the political parties have sought over 20 years to bring into being in order to make the proceedings of this House and the Oireachtas more efficient and relevant not only to us as Members but also to the the general public.  It would not be rash to hope that the success of the new arrangements will help to determine the thrust and structure of even more reforms.</P>
    <P>Each of the committees has parallel and very extensive functions under their orders of reference in respect of legislation, consideration of Estimates and law reform.  These new committees in dealing with the essential constitutional work of Dáil Eireann are in effect microcosms of the Dáil and I am glad to record that they are already establishing a political, parliamentary and media profile for themselves.  Undoubtedly, the committees substantive remit will enable them to play an integral role in helping to facilitate greater and more frequent participation by Members in those areas in which they may have a particular interest or expertise.  Such opportunities for participation by Members can only enhance their role in the business of the House and, by virtue of the specialist nature of each committee, encourage Members to articulate their views on the wide spectrum of activity of each committee. In so doing they will improve the overall quality of debate on the business of Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>My experience to date as Chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs suggests to me that the co-operative spirit in which the new committees were established has translated extremely well into positive and efficient work in committee.  There is a palpable sense of co-operation and goodwill on the part of all Members and even at this early stage in our existence the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has been successful in progressing extremely complex Bills through Committee Stage, i.e. the Finance Bill and the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and <Col N="2139" /> Penalties Bill.  Certainly the working relationship between Members seems to be less confrontational and more amicable in committee than on the floor of the House itself and I feel that this has been achieved without the Opposition Members on the committee in any way putting at risk or diminishing their primary role as an effective Opposition Indeed, it has been a personal and political pleasure for me to chair proceedings where invaluable work has been accomplished efficiently and without any evidence of parliamentary rancour or frayed temper manifesting itself.</P>
    <P>The select committees, of course, are still obviously in their infancy and over time it will be interesting to see how we proceed to develop and explore our role. There are many possibilities open to us to develop in a substantive way our powers to operate through sub-committee, and this is an avenue we will explore as we gradually establish through familiarity with our terms of reference and practice over time, an integral and purposeful role for ourselves as the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    <P>One point I would like to make is that I feel that the private sessions on Bills at which committees are briefed by officials will themselves have benefits for Civil Service management.  These sessions will, I am sure, broaden their understanding and experience of the role of committees in the parliamentary system and of the function of the Opposition in its role <i>vis à vis</i> the Government of the day.  I think I can say that civil servants, perhaps wisely or unfortunately, may have tended in the past to approach committees of the Houses with a certain trepidation and this is understandable.  The involvement of civil servants even in this limited and still embryonic way in parliamentary business will, one would hope allow for a greater flow of information between parliamentarians and administrators and the rapport being created must make for a greater appreciation on the part of all of each other's respective roles.  Certainly the experience to date in <Col N="2140" /> my committee should serve to illustrate for civil servants the fact that parliamentarians are not political ogres and that we genuinely seek to improve qualitatively the efficiency of Government administration and equally, if not more importantly, our input into the legislative process.  I fervently hope that the Government will watch the operation and effectiveness of this particular initiative and no doubt over time we will identify other areas in which this consultation facility between parliamentarians and civil servants could be expanded.</P>
    <P>At present, the proceedings of the committees are only televised when they relate to consideration of departmental Estimates and Committee Stages of Bills. This will change, of course, when the promised legislation on the question of witnesses's privilege has been put in place and I understand this will happen before the end of the year.  Indeed I am sure all Members will look forward to the additional scope this will give all committees of the Houses to make their proceedings even more relevant for the wider public.  Such a development will go some way to demystify and make less remote the workings of Parliament for the wider public and, in particular, our own constituents and to let them see the broad spectrum of economic, social and financial issues that we deal with in their interests in the course of a parliamentary session.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I wish to say a few words about our particular operations.  Since this select committee was established we have, as I have already mentioned, completed the Committee Stages of the Finance Act, 1993 and of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in view of the fact that we are expected to respond &mdash; and this is a novel procedure &mdash; can copies of Deputy Ellis's script be made available to the Opposition spokespersons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We will arrange for that to be done later.  I would hope that in future <Col N="2141" /> Deputy Rabbitte will make available to us on all occasions full copies of the scripts he uses in the House.  We have discussed the main Estimates for the Department of Finance and of the Environment and all other Estimates related thereto and have reported them to the House.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, both Bills of their nature were extremely complex and the proceedings in Committee on the Finance Bill progressed at an even pace.  The debates of our proceedings will show the many excellent contributions made by Members which made for a lively and expeditious treatment of that Bill.</P>
      <P>We also progressed in similar fashion the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill and again the detailed teasing out of the implications of the Bill was very much welcomed by the Minister for Finance and resulted in his bringing forward amendments on Report Stage.  I would add that this was the first time all sections of a Finance Bill were dealt with by the House in Committee.  Our discussions on the Estimates proved similarly worth while and while I have no wish to anticipate the views of the convenors or of the select committee itself, I feel that we could usefully allocate more time in future to discussion of Estimates than we did recently.  I recognise that parliamentary time constraints prevented us from allowing ourselves more time for consideration of the Estimates but I was very impressed by the extremely high level of participation by Members even to the extent that we had to curtail contributions. Certainly we felt that detailed discussions of departmental Estimates facilitates Members in that it allows them to raise in a more flexible procedural environment many aspects, and there are so many, of a Department's activities that impact on our lives both at national and local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only yesterday we continued the Committee Stage of the Road Traffic Bill.  We will embark early in September on the finalisation of that Bill and the Presidential Election Bill.  As regards the work the committee would aim to do, we envisage developing a work programme consistent <Col N="2142" /> with our orders of reference.  We acknowledge, of course, that our role depends in large measure on the work referred to us by the House but our orders of reference are extremely wide both in terms of remit and <i>modus operandi.</i>  The Taoiseach intimated this morning that we may be able to deal with wider areas as mentioned by other Deputies on the Order of Business. Because the committees are still in their infancy, many issues will emerge for consideration and resolution but I am sure the House will be anxious that any deficiencies in the orders of reference the select committee perceives as likely to impede any of their operation will be addressed by the House in a continuing spirit of goodwill and co-operation. Indeed, the House has already amended the orders of reference of the committees to facilitate the attendance at proceedings of people other than members of the committees.  Again this was an early, speedy and very welcome improvement to the new committee system.</P>
    <P>As regards the resources of the committee, overall the committees are still awaiting the putting in place of proper support structures.  However, I am glad to note that assistance has been provided with the permanent appointment of a clerk to each committee.  This was extremely necessary as only the permanent assignment of a specific officer to a committee can ensure that the committee works satisfactorily.  I wish to pay a particular tribute to the convenors on the select committee, Deputies Michael Ahern and Michael Finucane for the excellent arrangements they have been able to agree and put in place to facilitate the expeditious taking of business.  We owe them our particular thanks and I am glad to have this opportunity to acknowledge their invaluable contribution to the success of our proceedings.</P>
    <P>As the committee system is a relatively new creation, I wish to emphasise that it is only through time &mdash; I am not speaking about the distant future, but about the immediate future &mdash; that we will establish our needs.  I congratulate the Government and the House on the establishment <Col N="2143" /> of the new committees.  There is an abundance of good will on all sides of the House towards the committees and I hope that those committees which have been in operation for the past few months will continue to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first to acknowledge the very kind remarks by the chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Over the years much reference was made to the need for Dáil reform.  While we experienced teething problems with the new committee system, it will expedite the passage of legislation through this House.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed with the efficiency of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the contributions of its 30 members and the attendance at meetings. When the Committee Stages of legislation were taken in the Dáil the debate was usually confined to the relevant Minister and the spokespersons for the Opposition parties and occasionally Deputies who had a specific interest in the legislation got an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The committee system is a more effective mechanism for dealing with Committee Stage of Bills.  I have been heartened by the contributions to the debates on legislation by all members of the select committee.  It was heartening to hear members of the Government parties putting forward a contradictory viewpoint to what the Minister was proposing in the legislation. We had examples of that yesterday in the debate on the Road Traffic Bill, 1993.</P>
      <P>I welcome the televising of the proceedings of the select committees.  Many politicians depend on the press and television focusing in on what they say; it is their lifeline in politics.  Coverage by the press and television will stimulate the effectiveness of the committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Estimates for Public Services, many Deputies were disappointed at the shortage of time allowed to discuss the Estimate for the Office of Public Works as it related to their constituencies.  At the end of that debate the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="2144" /> of Finance, Deputy Dempsey, agreed to provide more time for the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Finance in the future.  I welcome that commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the briefing sessions by departmental officials, a mechanism which did not exist in the past.  Officials from the Departments of Finance and the Environment have briefed Deputies on the legislation before the select committee. This very effective mechanism which gives Deputies an opportunity to tease out various aspects of Bills with departmental officials has been of great benefit to us when questioning the Minister on his proposals.  This mechanism has also helped to ensure the efficiency of the committee system.</P>
    <P>In some cases there should be a longer lead-in time for bringing Bills before the select committees so that Deputies can get outside independent advice if necessary. I have found, from my experience of the Committee Stage debate on the Road Traffic Bill, that the holding of meetings on a one-day-a-week basis gives Deputies an opportunity in the meantime to consult interested parties on aspects of the legislation.  If possible, there should be a longer lead-in time.</P>
    <P>I presume the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will discuss the allocation of the Structural Funds. Much media attention has been paid over the past few days to what we got, or did not get by way of funding.  Everybody welcomes Ireland's allocation of Structural Funds which will be spent on improving many facilities and infrastructure. The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs will do everything it can to ensure the proper use of those funds.</P>
    <P>I thank the eight Fine Gael members of the select committee for their attendance at meetings and their enthusiasm. Members on this side of the House have benefited from their experience of the committee system; it has expanded our knowledge of the various aspects of legislation. Fine Gael supports the committee system concept, it represents positive Dáil reform.  If possible, meetings of <Col N="2145" /> committees should be held in the Dáil or Seanad Chambers when the Houses are not sitting.  While room G2 is adequate most of the time, sometimes it is inadequate when a division is called.  I found the Seanad Chamber to be an ideal location for the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Finance and, perhaps, consideration could be given to using this Chamber for committee meetings when the Seanad is not sitting.</P>
    <P>My party is not in favour of oral voting; it makes a mockery of the committee system.  At one of the earlier meetings of the committee even though the number of Opposition Deputies exceeded the number of Government Deputies present and we won the oral vote we lost the overall vote.  That makes a mockery of the system.  I do not think oral voting should be encouraged.  If the committee system is to succeed in the long term it is important for the 30 Members to make a contribution to its effectiveness.  Therefore, it is important that all Members be present when a division is called.  If this is not done there will be a lapse in the efficiency of the committee, something we do not want.</P>
    <P>It is early days yet for the committee system.  I very much appreciate what has been achieved to date by the select committee and compliment the Members on their contributions to the debates which have taken place.  I also compliment the Chairman of the select committee who is very fair and I look forward to continuing my working relationship with Deputy Michael Ahern.</P>

      <P>At the outset on behalf of my party which, to paraphrase the saying, has neither chick nor child, has neither a chairman nor convenor, so far as these committees are concerned, I take this opportunity on behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party and on my own behalf to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs whose easy and relaxed manner has contributed in no small way to the smooth functioning of the committee in its first term in carrying out its exceptionally heavy workload.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the committee has been dominated by two issues: the Finance Act, which took quite a while and the tax amnesty Bill which is close to being enacted, if not yet signed by the President. It is a legacy of the committee's endeavours and of the Government's priorities that these two measures stand potently together as symbols of the failure to address fundamentally the issue of tax reform.  Of all the legacies of this year's budget, without doubt the worst feature was the imposition of the 1 per cent income levy on all incomes above £173 per week.  At a stroke that reversed the provisions of last year's budget and had the effect of increasing, for those concerned the basic tax rate to 29 per cent.  Worst of all, it was a fifth tax on work and, for the first time in six budgets, increased the tax wedge, that is the difference between what employers pay and <Col N="2147" /> what employees take home each week. That is the opposite precisely from what is being called for by the OECD, the Central Bank and Culliton.  In spite of rhetoric to the contrary by a number of Government Ministers, the Culliton report is a dead letter when judged by the choices made in this year's Finance Act.  Hitting the old reliables, and in this case I mean everyone who is unfortunate enough to be caught in the ordinary tax net, with the 1 per cent income levy is nothing more than a smash and grab tactic.  The same perverse hunger for money at any price explains the iniquitous tax amnesty, which was also guillotined through this House and worked its way through the Committee Stage just two weeks ago.  I beg to differ slightly from the Chairman of the committee and the Minister for Finance that we covered every amendment to the Bill, in fact I had a number of amendments down to section 4 which we did not get to but I concede that we got to most if not all amendments.</P>
    <P>The very fact there was no mention of the tax amnesty in the February budget nor ten weeks later when the Finance Bill was first published underlines the incoherence with which this new administration chose to approach taxation policy.  It is interesting to note that the tax professionals, including the president of the Institute of Taxation are arguing that the amnesty legislation was so rushed that it is likely to be a botched job from the point of view of the Government's own revenue raising objectives, a good argument indeed if ever there was one for having a less breathless approach to the legislative process.  The work of the Finance and General Affairs Committee will be remembered also for the reintroduction in the Finance Bill of death duties under the new name of a probate tax.  This is from the same Government that is proposing to reward tax cheats with a bargain basement write-off of 15 per cent for clearing historical unpaid income tax, income levies and capital gains tax while at the same time levying death duties on surviving spouses when <Col N="2148" /> in recent years it has been the practice of every single Government to remove such persons from all tax liabilities including stamp duty.  The all-inclusive nature of the probate tax set against the disgraceful logic of the tax amnesty is very shabby and indefensible politics which does nothing to put justice into economics or engender confidence in politics.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, we will deal with the Structural Funds, as suggested by the Taoiseach, albeit a slip of the tongue on his part.  Every time we try to raise certain issues, the Chairman can attest to and point to the fact that we are bound by an Order of the House.  I do not recall the House making an Order which would allow us to take up the kind offer of the Taoiseach, whereby he suggested we could discuss the Structural Funds.  The rules of procedure do not allow us to do so.  Indeed, it is a great pity that someone did not teach the Tánaiste how to do his sums better when he was a small boy because it seems he did not realise in Brussels that what in fact he got was £8.7 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very useful to be briefed by public servants in advance of considering Bills.  While it is very praiseworthy it was one of the most unsatisfactory features, from my point of view, of our operation this year because we failed to realise its potential.  In the region of 40 to 50 civil servants with expertise in the various areas were lined up to advise on the Finance Bill which ran to 156 pages.  At a maximum we got two hours to talk with them, but that was <Col N="2149" /> not nearly enough.  When this facility is made available we should be able to use it better.  I will again put down a marker, as I did on Committee Stage, that I would appreciate our allowing for a substantial briefing even through a sub-committee system where people want that.  The briefing should be timed better: we need more space between the publication of a Bill and the briefing and the deadline for amendments.  The real purpose of the briefing is to give us a deeper understanding of the Bill so as to prepare us more to deal with it but I feel that has not happened.  However, it is part of the learning curve.  The same point applies to the tax amnesty Bill.  Because we were caught for time the Bill was guillotined. The public servants could have enhanced our understanding of the business in hand very substantially and of the various points I shall make on the Committee system.  That would be the key operational point for future reference.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill is always lengthy and extraordinarily complicated.  We should not only have adequate briefings in advance of submitting amandments but it is vitally important that it be published at an earlier stage.  I have checked out the practice in the United Kingdom which has a similar budgetary and legislative process to us.  The time lag between budget day and the publication of the Finance Bill in the UK is much shorter than here and they have a similar legislative review process but they get a longer time for review.  I think we need a longer time to reflect on and tease out the implications of the Bill.  We need also to be properly briefed.  I am somewhat amused that tax professionals who are in the business of advising the &ldquo;would be amnestees&rdquo; who wish to avail of this amnesty are saying the legislation is botched.  They are afraid to give clear advice to clients on what to do.  That is a very good example &mdash; I hold no brief for those clients &mdash; of what not to do when the Government has a view of what it seeks to achieve in legislation but in the end does not achieve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see two issues on the agenda of our committee: first, the issue <Col N="2150" /> of the Structural Funds, which I regard as urgent but I regret to say from the very devices which the Chair cited today when Members sought to raise the issue there is no order in this House saying that the Finance and General Affairs Committee may imminently discuss the Structural Funds.  Therefore they will not be discussed. That is the plain fact of the matter.  There will be no democratic review of the allocation of Structural Funds, no accountability and no teasing out in advance of the Irish Government sending unilaterally its view of what it wants to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Politicians here have given far too little attention to the relationship between so-called economic fundamentals and the enormous problem of unemployment and how there is superior economic growth here compared with the European average and an inferiour level of employment as a result.  There is need for much work in public policy area in this regard.  Such work should not relate specifically to the budget but should focus on that issue.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs is a key committee for debate on unemployment. I urge the Chairman to consult with Members of the committee to select areas for discussion not related to the normal legislative process which has been inadequately treated by policy makers.  The select committee is perhaps the best equipped to deal with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to the tact and courtesy of our Chairman.  I would also like to pay tribute to the substantial achievement of the Government Chief Whip in piloting through a significant new structure in the form of the committees. However, I do not agree with many of the comments about the committee system because its efficacy has been undermined by the Government's lack of commitment to making it work.  For example, the extraordinary haphazard emergence of new Bills, going from a mere trickle for much of the period of this session to a glut in the last few weeks, constituted legislative anarchy.  The Government used its <Col N="2151" /> majority to order Bills which at the time had not been published.  In some cases the Opposition had as little as 48 hours to address Bills which had been lodged for years in the bowels of various Departments.</P>
      <P>The attempt to impose a new committee structure on the existing system kept the Opposition pinned down but threatened any concept of Dáil reform. While plenary sessions of the Dáil and various committees ran simultaneously. Government backbenchers remained in their constituencies and tended to the grass roots.  As was said by some Deputies, far from encouraging participation by backbenchers in the legislative process, the committee system and an unprecedented Government majority have encouraged absenteeism on a scale never experienced in any previous Dáil. For example, after a relatively successful experiment in 1992 in taking the Finance Bill in committee, this year was a damp squib and I part company with my colleagues in regard to the committee system.  For whatever reason there was not a great level of participation by the members of the committee on this occasion.  Backbenchers were prepared, as they have been traditionally, to leave the tedious process of committee work to the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons. In the case of the other major Bill piloted through committee, the amnesty for tax cheats, the experience was similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the committee system is to facilitate quality scrunity &mdash; as distinct from quantity &mdash; of legislation, the phenomenon of signing out by backbenchers must be addressed.  The Labour Party in particular, held out the prospect of bright new Members using the committee system to show their mettle.  Instead they are present merely for divisions, speaking to the electorate through Charlie Bird instead of through the Ceann Comhairle. Rolling up their sleeves in committee is clearly less appealing than speaking off the cuff on the plinth.  Clearly the burgeoning talents on the Labour backbenches have calculated that in our <Col N="2152" /> system the Executive still dictates the detail of legislation and it is futile to think otherwise.</P>
    <P>I said at the time, on behalf of Democratic Left, that it was too simplistic to equate Dáil reform with the creation of more committees.  Increasing productivity in this House is clearly desirable. However, our work must be measured in terms of output and quality. Bad, ill-considererd, ineffectual, defective and hurried law merely serves to undermine the law.  If we are prepared to abdicate our responsibility as legislators to a combination of programme managers and parliamentary draftsmen the cameras in this Chamber may as well be refocused on the plinth.</P>
    <P>A further factor undermining the efficacy of the committee system is the uneven allocation of resources.  The Government has available not only the entire panoply of the Civil Service but a range of partisan advisers and managers. Meanwhile the Opposition must function on a shoestring with the smaller parties especially discriminated against.  Without an adequate research provision, the committee system cannot achieve its potential. A Government which can rely on the traditional Civil Service back-up and at the same time finance an array of advisers cannot argue against a proper research capacity for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition is stretched in attempting to cope with the imposition of the committee structure on top of the existing system.  I suspect that the staff of the House are overstretched.  Both problems can in part be alleviated by a rescheduling of business that combines no dilution of Government accountability with a more sensible and rational timetabling of committees.  For example, in the longer parliamentary year, a system of one week out of four being allocated exclusively to committee sessions commencing after an Order of Business from 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. could be operated.</P>
    <P>Resolution of outstanding matters, especially of privilege for witnesses before the Committee of Public Accounts, would enable the Dáil to more <Col N="2153" /> satisfactorily and cheaply investigate issues that require investigation in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Theoretically the committee system holds out the prospect of a more effective system of legislation but only if the lessons of this session are taken on board. More imaginative timetabling, the streamlining of the drafting stage, a fairer allocation of resources and a political commitment to wider participation in the process are all necessary if the committee system is to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>I also query the value of today's exercise as the comments I suspect that will be repeatedly made throughout the day could as easily have been made on the Adjournment Debate.  Today's reconvening of the Dáil could have been devoted to the question a number of Deputies sought to raise on the Order of Business relating to the Structural Funding, the National Development Plan and so on.  Deputies thought that by this means of scheduling business they would get kudos in the media for being back here on 21 July and early in October.  It is clear that is not the case.  Despite the fact that committees have been sitting and will continue to sit until the end of this month and resume at the beginning of September there is no recognition by the public that such reform has taken place. Therefore, today and perhaps tomorrow could have been used more productively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis made a fair point regarding the treatment of the Estimates in committee.  There is no doubt that the system of treatment of the Estimates in committee has been much better than the previous procedure.  It has allowed for more detailed questioning of the expenditure of public funds than that provided through the old system.  Unfortunately, we are discussing the Estimates half way through the financial year rather than at a time when we could, theoretically at least, influence developments to some extent.  The fact that the treatment of the Estimates this year was a major improvement on previous years does not alter my point in regard to the treatment of Bills in Committee and that must be examined.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The establishment of the committee system has made legislation more relevant to backbenchers.  Prior to the setting up of the committees many backbenchers did not have an opportunity of getting involved in detailed debates on Committee Stages of Bills in this Chamber, but over the past few weeks I noted that all committee Members are attending meetings.  Despite the comments by Deputies Finucane and Rabbitte, who gave the impression that Government backbenchers are not attending committee meetings, I can say categorically that Government Members from both Fianna Fáil and our junior partners in Government, Labour, attend those meetings assiduously.</P>

      <P>Full participation by Members from all sides of the House is evident and that must be applauded.  The detailed discussions which take place at those committees is welcome compared to only spokespersons from each party taking part in Committee Stage debates as was the case in this House for the past number of years.  Under the new committee system all Members take an active part and that is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>The system is nowhere near perfect yet.  This was a trial year for it and many problems need to be ironed out.  I hope during the recess that party Whips will get together to discuss the streamlining of the system because it is unacceptable to have a plenary session of the Dáil and, perhaps, two committees meeting at the same time.  It is often necessary for a spokesperson to be present in this Chamber while a committee in which he or she is involved is also discussing important legislation.  That problem must be resolved.  I welcome the committee system but those bugs in the system must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cox referred to briefing sessions which are important for Opposition <Col N="2155" /> Members and for Government backbenchers who do not get the same back-up material as Ministers.  Briefing sessions are important for all Members of the House.  They not only give Members a greater understanding of the legislation being introduced but they assist them in discussions on the legislation with people outside this House and enable them to prepare amendments and make suggestions to make the legislation more worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I congratulate our Chairman, Deputy Ellis, who has done great work on the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  I assure him that I will support him for the next four years to ensure that the committee system continues to operate and improve and that in the next Dáil, in five years' time, it will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the subject I attempted to raise on the Order of Business this morning, the massive and wholesale destruction of our fish stocks by the Spaniards.  An insitutionalised and systematic rape of our fishing grounds is taking place, all of which lie within the 200 mile zone.  Last night's programme on ITV, &ldquo;The Cook Report&rdquo;, gave clear evidence of what some of us here have known for years and to which I have repeatedly alluded in this House during debates on fishery matters, that the Spaniards are busily destroying our fish stocks. It is about time our Government took action to stop that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that we should constantly talk about the need for Structural Funds and indigneous industry while the industry with the greatest potential is being destroyed in this way and we are not prepared to protect it from the marauders.  If fishing were carried out as <Col N="2156" /> it should there would not be a problem but if the present position continues we will have no fish stocks in a few years. This is not a case of poaching, &mdash; it is fishing by unlicensed boats.  It is a serious problem when massive amounts of undersized fish are being caught and landed and the Spanish authorities turn a blind eye to the entire operation.  This must stop.</P>
    <P>When the Icelanders were faced with a similar problem in the 60s they excluded all foreign boats from their territorial waters.  This was known at the time as the cod war.  People in Great Britain felt aggrieved that their traditional fishing grounds had been taken from them, but the Icelanders proved their point.  They carefully nurtured their fishing grounds and have a thriving fishing industry as a result.</P>
    <P>As a race and a Government, we have failed in this regard.  Successive Ministers with responsibility for fisheries have failed abysmally to carry out their duties. The Naval Service, in conjunction with the Department of the Marine, must supervise our fish stocks.  I feel sorry for members of the Naval Service because they do not have adequate resources to police the 200 mile zone.  That service is doing a good job in difficult circumstances, but this is a matter for the Government.  It should be raised at a summit of the EC Heads of State and the Spaniards should be held accountable and asked to declare their intentions for the future.  If I were Minister for the Marine I would demand that all Spanish boats be withdrawn from the Irish 200 mile exclusive zone immediately.  It is obvious that the Spaniards are being allowed to fish in this zone by their Government and law enforcement agencies and fishery inspectors are either incapable or unwilling to intervene to ensure that they play the game by the rules.  What they are doing in our territorial waters costs this country hundreds of millions of pounds every year which, taken over a reasonable number of years, amounts to billions of pounds. We can never hope to develop our fledgling fishing industry until we can ensure <Col N="2157" /> that our fishing stocks and the breeding grounds are protected, which is not happening at the moment.  The recent discovery that these fishing boats have illegal compartments on board which can hold hundreds of tonnes of under-sized fish is alarming.</P>
    <P>Last night's programme only confirmed what those of us who have an interest in this problem have known for a long time.  There is now documentary evidence, including photographs of the under-sized fish being landed and of intimidation by the Spanish fishermen and the illegal organisation ETA. Accordingly, this Government should act to ensure that these illegal activities are stopped forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to present the report from the Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy.  Since the committee was established on 5 May we have considered an Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Estimates for the Department of the Marine, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Department of Tourism and Trade and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The committee has also been given the task of taking Committee Stage of the Aviation Authority Bill and this is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>The committee is served by one officer at assistant principal level who is its clerk. There are problems regarding the staffing arrangements because clerical staff has not been available to the secretary of the committee to date, this is a major problem.  I understand the Department has been requested to provide back-up staff at all levels but we are still awaiting clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the committee was established we have encountered some problems and I note the points by the chairman of the Committee on Finance and General Affairs, Deputy Ellis, who contributed to the debate this morning.  The committee <Col N="2158" /> is hampered by the restrictive nature of its terms of reference.  The fact that we cannot summon a witness is a major obstacle to the development of the committee system.  There is also the question of privilege for those making submissions to the committee.  They should be entitled to the privilege extended to Members of this House. Without this facility problems could arise in the coming months, particularly in view of the Glackin report which was presented to us recently.  This is the first time that any committee has had an opportunity to discuss a report of this nature.</P>
    <P>Before we embark on this course it will be necessary to ensure that we have satisfactory back-up available to the committee, that we have expert advice available to us and that proper funding will be provided.  This is essential if the committee is to carry out its functions properly. The report has been submitted to the committee for consideration.  Precisely what the Dáil requires of the committee will have to be spelled out, carefully noting the very sensitive nature of this report.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost faith in the continuing development of these committees. We had some initial problems regarding hours of sitting.  We also have a problem regarding a suitable venue and this matter has already been raised here this morning.  There is some confusion as to whether we should sit on days when there is a plenary session of the Dáil, and Deputy Rabbitte referred to this already in his contribution this morning.  This matter must be examined carefully because members of the committee have been called away to vote in this House.  I accept that proceedings in this House take precedence over the functions of the committees and I realise we are subject to the rules and regulations which govern business in this House.  For that reason it is essential that the teething problems are resolved, hopefully before sittings of the committees are resumed.  There is now ample time for us to consider how we will tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the extent <Col N="2159" /> of funds available to the committee.  To date the liaison committee, which is responsible for providing funds to the various committees of this House has not met.  How much funding will be available to us?  What legal back-up and expertise will be available to us?  There is another problem in that civil servants who would be called to brief or give evidence to the committee do not enjoy privilege.  I see this as a likely obstacle in the way of a full discussion of the various issues that will arise from time to time.  If this privilege cannot be extended to the Civil Service what effect will that have on the running of the committee?  I believe it could be disastrous.  If people in the employment of the State feel the evidence they present to the committee might leave them open to prosecution, it would hamper the work of the committee considerably.  For that reason, these problems must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are precedents in this regard. Our counterparts in Britain have used the committee system for many years. There are a number of points which I have studied regarding the manner in which they conduct their business.  For instance, what happens when there is no agreement at committee level?  This will become relevant in the coming months when we depart from Committee Stage of a Bill, for which there is ample precedent, and indeed the consideration of Estimates. There is a traditional method of dealing with these matters and it does not present a challenge.  We are carrying out work normally done in the House on Committee Stage.  We are breaking new ground in the consideration of various reports but if a problem arises regarding the presentation of a report from this House what procedure must the committee follow?  There must be some clarification regarding the committee's terms of reference.  What type of report will the House require in this regard and in what detail?  Is the committee required to examine work already covered in this case by the Glackin report?  I perceive our committee's role as one where, arising from the Glackin report, we would <Col N="2160" /> identify any weakness in the system and the areas where there is a need for legislation to cover matters such as taxation and company law, rather than going over the ground already covered by the committee in an interim report, a final report and in the earlier McDonagh report on this issue.</P>
    <P>I would thank the clerk of the committee, Cliona O'Rourke, who was presented with a daunting task.  I realise that civil servants are not normally mentioned in the House but it is only right that this young woman should be mentioned because she did tremendous work on behalf of the committee.  She dealt with an uncharted area and for that reason it was an extremely difficult task. We tend to work on precedent here but, in its absence, it requires someone who is extremely resourceful to make a system work effectively.</P>
    <P>I thank both convenors, Deputy Lawlor on the Government side and Deputy Creed of Fine Gael, and all those who participated in the various debates in a constructive manner during the past few months thereby ensuring that the committee system proved successful.  I have no doubt that in the years ahead it will be recognised that the decision to set up these committees was a wise one.  I sincerely hope that we will be able to overcome the problems we have encountered to date and thereby improve the system.  As Deputy Michael Ahern said, we have been given an opportunity to discuss legislation in greater detail on Committee Stage.  This will prove to be of benefit in relation to legislation that emerges from this House.</P>

      <P>While it may be represented in the media that this session is being held to show that the Dáil is not in recess, the purpose is to report to the Dáil on the way the committee system which was established recently is operating. Members who have spoken have been frank.  While the principle is an excellent one it has to be said that there are some glaring deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the committee system all Members of the House can become more <Col N="2161" /> involved in considering the Estimates for the various Government Departments, teasing out legislation or, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, examining reports which are laid before the committees.  In a relatively short period a number of glaring deficiencies have been highlighted.  In doing that we are not being critical of any Member of this House; rather we hope that this will be accepted and that the committees will be reformed within a short period.</P>
    <P>The first of these deficiencies relates to the logistics in regard to the sitting arrangements.  Like the Chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, I can recall vividly the difficulties encountered during the opening session in selecting suitable dates.  This raises the question of whether Members of this House should have a dual mandate; in other words, whether they should be Members of this House and a local authority or Members of this House and the European Parliament at the same time.  It is becoming obvious that it will be impossible to operate the committee system effectively if Members of this House have a dual mandate.  What happened on the day the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy first met was unedifying in that the legislators were dragged screaming to the altar of legislation, unwillingly.</P>
    <P>The debates on the Estimates by the select committee were enlightening and I compliment each Minister, and departmental officials, who appeared before the select committee for being frank in their responses.  However, some deficiencies were highlighted.  In conjunction with the Estimate for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications the select committee considered the Aer Lingus débâcle.  Unfortunately, the select committee was not in a position to invite the relevant personnel dealing with the rescue package at Aer Lingus, including Mr. Cahill, to appear before it to pursue that matter.</P>
    <P>That brings me to legislation in particular the Irish Aviation Authority Bill. This is one of the areas where the select committee has proved to be useful. <Col N="2162" /> Prior to the establishment of the committee system there was a demand for legislation which was being held up due to the backlog.  The legislation before the select committees is being considered in detail and not being rushed through.  That is as it should be.  During the briefing sessions backbench members, particularly the Opposition, are given an insight into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Glackin report on the Telecom affair to which the Chairman referred.  In the absence of legislation under which we would be allowed invite witnesses to be cross-examined with the benefit of privilege we will only muddy the waters in considering that report and vent prejudice about that incident without referring in any meaningful way to the facts as we will not be able to interrogate the chief players in that saga.  Legislation is therefore needed as a matter of urgency.  I suggest that we should not consider that report in the absence of legislation, which was promised in this House, under which we would be allowed to invite witnesses who could be interrogated with the benefit of privilege.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank and compliment the Chairman of the select committee, Deputy O'Sullivan, who has been fair in dealing with all members when considering Estimates or legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have limited experience, just a few months, of a more extensive committee system in this House.  The most positive thing that can be said is that at least it has potential but this will not be realised until certain changes, which I will advocate during the next few minutes, are made and unless there is a general desire, particularly on the part of the Government, to make improvements in the system.  As I look in front of me I wonder if there is a desire on the part of the Government to do anything about the committee system given that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Committee Stage of a Bill is referred to one of the select committees and sufficient time is allowed for a full <Col N="2163" /> Committee Stage debate the committee system is more useful than if the debate was in the House.  However, if attempts are made to guillotine Committee Stage debates it is obviously not more useful; it is less so.  The big drawback of covering Committee Stage in a select committee, from the point of view of Members of this House, is the lack of coverage in the press compared with the coverage when it is debated in the Dáil.  This was certainly noticeable on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and the tax amnesty Bill over the past two months.  The Committee Stages of both Bills were extremely important but were scarcely reported.</P>
    <P>The consideration of Estimates by the committees is not different in any major way from the procedure in the House, except that there is a guarantee of some debate and the ability to ask questions. However, it is not a particularly satisfactory system and a greater opportunity to speak should be given to all Members. The consideration of Estimates should be reasonably open-ended and should not be confined to relatively short periods.</P>
    <P>The greatest weakness of the committees is their lack of enforceable power to send for persons and papers.  This is especially noticeable on the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies where the executive chairman of one State-sponsored company refused to appear before the committee and finally agreed to turn up only after the Government and the Dáil had approved certain proposals he had put forward in relation to the company.  Unless all Dáil committees have the enforceable power to send for persons and papers and to examine persons, including Ministers, on relevent policy questions, and the power to do so at relatively short notice, these committees will not be effective.  It is imperative that the committees have power to examine Ministers on current matters.  Ministers should be entitled to some reasonable notice of three or four days and should not be subjected to examination more than once a month or nine or ten times a year.</P>
    <P>The ability to examine certain topics <Col N="2164" /> of importance in some depth with Ministers on policy questions through these committees is vital when one sees how limited in value the present format of Question Time in the Dáil has become. Even though the time for questions in the Dáil has been extended, it is rare to have more than 15-20 questions answered in any one day.  The priority questions system is largely breaking down because of the tendency of Ministers to answer a large number of questions together in one composite answer at great length, which uses most of the time available to Members and prevents any meaningful number of supplementaries being asked or pressed.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory that the majority of chairpersons of committees are from the Government side of the House and that some of them see their function as facilitating the Government and its interests.  Any committee will tend to be dominated by its chairperson and will only be as strong or as useful as its chairperson. A great deal more thought and care should have been given to the appointment of chairpersons on several of these committees to make them work more effectively.  The Government has given an indication to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance of its willingness to agree in principle to introduce legislation in the autumn, giving the necessary powers to committees of the House to send for persons and papers and to enforce those requests.  It is imperative that this is done and that the legislation is passed as quickly as possible in the autumn because the committees will be ineffectual until it is done.</P>
    <P>The ability of properly constituted committees in other jurisdictions to examine Ministers and others from whom they wish to hear evidence, is very valuable. The country and this House are wrong to deprive themselves unnecessarily of the same power.  It is also noticeable that committees examining Bills are not sending for persons or organisations with a particular point of view who should be able to give evidence to the committee on the relevant sections, to express the arguments for and against the different <Col N="2165" /> points of view before the committee makes up its mind as to how to finalise the relevant sections.</P>
    <P>The resources of the committees in terms of professional or administrative back-up are very limited.  These resources should ideally be expanded, available to the committee as a whole and to individual members and not just to the chairperson.  If the House and the Government are prepared to accept the spirit of what I have been saying and the suggestions I have been making and are prepared to expand the powers, scope and work of the committees on these lines the system can be a success.  It will not work if it is seen simply as an extension of Government control over the Oireachtas to individual committees. There is a particular danger with a Government majority of 35 in the House that the normal tendency for the Government to dominate the Dáil will be more accentuated than ever.  It is necessary for the House to assert its parliamentary role.  If the House wants to work the committee system properly it can go a long way towards achieving this purpose but if it wants to use the committees simply as rubber stamps for the Government in the way the House is frequently used, it will not be successful.  Because of the size of the Government majority the need is greater than ever, but, because of that majority, the opportunity is also greater than ever if the Government parties are prepared to allow it to be availed of.</P>
    <P>In general terms if this House becomes less and less meaningful, opposition to Government policy and examination of Government proposals will move increasingly from here to extra parliamentary opposition and to the media. The first alternative of extra parliamentary opposition is a danger to democracy and while media analysis is vital the media should not be the primary focus of analysis in a healthy domocracy. That should be in the elected parliament and in its properly constituted and properly empowered committees and I hope it will develop here in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> Throughout my remarks I emphasised the necessity for the willingness of the Government to accept the spirit of what is being sought to be done.  The absence of any member or representative of the Government here makes me pessimistic about the spirit that needs to be applied to this.  It is very disappointing.  Let us hope there will be some change of heart but if there is not, the committee system will not work.</P>

    <P>The committees present an opportunity for in-depth discussion on the various elements of economics.  Many people will not be familiar with the Green Party's perspective on economics.  People involved in the Green Party are central to the changes which are essential for progress.  In discussing the economic system at committee level and in Dáil Éireann recognition should be given to the individual self-worth which is not recognised in the present system under which unemployment is increasing.</P>
    <P>There is scope for greater efficiency in the workings of the committee system. Many Bills have been extremely late in coming before committees, particularly the Finance Bill in view of its size.  Some of the explanations of sections of the Road Traffic Bill were very helpful.  The informal briefing session which takes place prior to open discussion in committees is very useful in that officials who are familiar with the legislation may answer questions that may not be the subject of amendments.  This helps to provide an understanding of what is being done.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of work that will be done in committee that would not otherwise be done in plenary session of the Dáil.  The first section of a Bill normally outlines definitions of various matters which everybody understands but which, for the purposes of legislation, need <Col N="2168" /> to be defined.  For example, the term &ldquo;mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; is used in the Road Traffic Bill but there is no differentiation as between one type of vehicle and another.  Even though that term appeared in a previous Road Traffic Act it is not sufficiently defined.  That matter was the cause of some debate in committee and the question as to whether bicycles were included was clarified.  I am not sure whether skateboards are included.  On a lighter note, I am sure Christy Moore would be interested to know whether surfboards, as referred to in one of his songs, are included.  It is important that details which are not normally clarified in plenary session of the Dáil &mdash; quite often Dáil procedure stifles such debate &mdash; are teased out.</P>
    <P>Central to the success of the committees will be the reforms which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, intends to introduce. This follows on the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which states that women are disadvantaged in society by virtue of the operation of the dual mandate whereby people simultaneously serve in the Oireachtas and on county councils.  This matter has major implications for the committee system because conflicts of interest will arise in the event of committee meetings taking place on the same day as county council meetings.  In these circumstances people invariably attend local authority meetings simply because committees do not receive as much media coverage as do local authorities.  The report recommends that all political parties eliminate the practice of dual mandate, with effect from the next election.</P>

      <P>My brief comments will concern the practical operations of the committee system as I interpret them to date.  I would have agreed over many years with Deputy O'Malley's views &mdash; perhaps not in more recent years &mdash; and I agree with much of what he said this morning about the practical aspects of the operations of the committee system. Collectively, as parliamentarians, we are afforded a unique opportunity to ensure that this committee system works effectively. In this respect I do not think any Government or Opposition Member would deny, in their desire to have the committee system effective, the need, on a practical basis, for the appropriate facilities, such as electronic voting procedures. The mechanics of the operations of the committees are in need of detailed analysis.  Therefore, I suggest that the chairmen and convenors including Opposition convenors, should get together and draw up a blueprint for presentation to the Government Whip on what are the requirements for this effective operation of the committee system.</P>
      <P>I recognise that in the difficult financial circumstances obtaining the allocation to the House for this purpose probably did not adequastely take into account the requisite back-up staff and research requirements for the various committees. Additional resources will have to be provided. Prior to the preparation of the 1994 Estimate the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should request from the chairmen and convenors of the committees a comprehensive report on their requirements for submission to the Minister for Finance.  We must emphasise the need for these committees to be productive and efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard what Deputy Rabbitte said <Col N="2170" /> about discussing Estimates midway in the financial year.  They having formed an integral part of the budget.  Therefore, parliamentarians criticising, constructively or negatively, what was or was not included is a farcical, time-wasting exercise because, by then, the overall concept will have been adopted with Government Departments already expending the moneys allocated to them. It is ridiculous that we debate Estimates in this manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton, when Minister for Finance, and in more recent times, suggested the Book of Estimates, which has such a major impact on everything that occurs in the following financial year, be made available in the autumn. Members of the select committees should demand that these Estimates be available in the autumn so that Government Departments can be made aware of the views of parliamentarians in advance of the adoption of programmes of expenditure in any financial year.</P>
    <P>The committee on which I serve, under the chairmanship of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, has now begun to consider legislation.  Last week Deputies Noonan and O'Malley on the Irish Aviation Bill has an opportunity to make a greater input to the debate on this Bill within the more confined committee atmosphere. They obtained a great deal of information from the Minister and were afforded a great opportunity to put their views across.  That was the practical advantage of dealing with that Bill in select committee.</P>
    <P>While I am not satisfied with the total workings of the committee system we must recognise that we have an opportunity to rectify that position.  We should draw up a blueprint to be adopted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and submitted to the Government in the autumn to form a programme for the operations of the committees in 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must see the reform of the Dáil, and the institution of this committee system, as part of a response by this House to an overall crisis of confidence in politics obtaining throughout <Col N="2171" /> the western world from which Ireland certainly has not escaped.  There is a general feeling that, to a great extent, parliamentary politics is less and less relevant to the lives of ordinary people. To a great extent, it is less relevant than at a time when this House could institute tariffs on imports from other countries, when there was a realistic prospect that this country might take a major, independent foreign policy initiative, or when it was expected that the State, through the exercise of Keynesian economics, could solve virtually all economic problems by State action or when this House was much more central to the whole political process than it is today.</P>
      <P>We continue with forms of activity that were appropriate to a House and a poltiical system that were actually able to exercise huge power on society on their own account without referral to other multi-national institutions, and had the confidence to actually command things to happen.  That is no longer the case. The formal boundaries of politics are dissolving. In fact, the world of political parties is becoming increasingly less important in the lives of ordinary people. The number of people willing to become involved in party politics is becoming ever fewer.  At the same time, there is a huge increase in the number of people willing to become involved in other types of organisations, for example, in women's movements, in community groups, in Leader programmes in rural areas and so on.</P>
      <P>The general, common feature of all of this is that people are saying: &ldquo;We can do it ourselves; we do not need the politicians, other than that the politicians should support us in doing things for ourselves; we reject the idea of politics as some type of process whereby things are done for us by others; we want politicians, in a sense, to get out of the road and let us get on with the journey&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the institution of the commitee system as a very belated response by the political system to what is happening in the outside world.  I see the committee system achieving that in a number of <Col N="2172" /> ways.  It must do all of the things that have been called for in this debate.  As a number of Members have pointed out, committees must have the power to require Ministers to appear before them regularly.  A committee must have the power to reconsider the Estimates for spending for a given year before the money is spent; a committee that cannot call a Minister to account does not have authority.  A committee that talks about spending after the money has been spent does not have authority.  But, more imporantly, the committee system has the capacity that this House, in plenary session, can never have, of actually linking directly to people.  It is possible for committes to hold hearings.  For example, it is possible for committees of this House to allow women's groups, or community groups, to appear before them and give evidence, to make that connection between the lively world of voluntary organisations here and the increasingly atrophied world of party politics as expressed in this House.  If this House is to revive in public respect it must draw a much closer link with the community organisations which are so lively in our society.</P>
    <P>Whenever legislation is in contemplation, whenever a committee is considering work, rather than simply discuss it themselves in here, they should make specific arrangements to invite outside groups to participate in their work and appoint rapporteurs to go out on behalf the committee to examine a particular issue.  There is no need to send a whole committee to, say, west Cork to talk about the problems of drift netting and its effects on the livelihoods of fishermen, licensing and so on.  One member, a rapporteur, could be appointed to go and investigate that issue.  He or she, by so doing, would be bringing the Dáil much closer to the people, would be allowing politics to revive itself by tapping into the sense of community where the real action is in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>All of the political parties, in some senses, face a crisis of identity.  But we must recognise that that crisis of identity <Col N="2173" /> which each of us in our own political way feels, some more intensely than others, in fact is a reflection of a much wider phenomenon, that of a general distancing of the general public from politics.  If we are to restore politics to its proper place &mdash; I believe very strongly that most of the very serious problems obtaining here, particularly that of the unemployment, but also that of peace on the island and of the restoration of the strength and vibrancy of the family as an institution &mdash; those problems should be addressed by political action.  Only changes in taxes and social welfare will solve unemployment and enhance the status of the family.  If we are to have the political authority in this House to make those changes on behalf of the people we must recharge our batteries.  It means that this House must listen to people by holding sessions throughout the country.  While it is clear that the House as a whole in plenary session could never have done that it is patently obvious that committees of the House can.  I strongly urge that the terms of reference be changed to allow more hearings to be held throughout the country and for rapporteurs to be appointed to look at particular issues as well as for better ordering of the business of the House, as suggested by many others.</P>
    <P>I shall end my contribution with a quotation from an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 18 July, which is very much on this theme:</P>
    <P>But decline of the political party and the shrinking importance of the formal political world, with the consequent growing inability of the political system adequately to represent society, suggests there is a need for this to be complemented by forms of direct democracy as a means of enabling wider participation in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>By meeting people rather than simply holding discussions here in committee rooms, the committee have the capacity to recharge the batteries of politics in a way that no other organ of this House has.</P>

      <P>I endorse Deputy John Bruton's remarks.  Recently, in another capacity, I was looking at reports of the 1933 moneylenders Bill when it was going through the Free State Parliament. The curious thing was that when they got to Committee Stage it was sent off to a select committee and they brought in a selection of moneylenders from Dublin to discuss the issue with them while they were debating it.  Certainly on the last occasion that I was a Member of this House I never saw a similar process, whereby a committee of this House charged with the drafting of legislation brought in people to advise them on Committee Stage.  We have become hidebound in our concept of what a Committee Stage is by thinking that the only participants can be the Minister and the Opposition spokesmen or backbenchers whereas what Deputy Bruton has said is absolutely correct.  When dealing with a bankruptcy Bill or a moneylenders' Bill the committee should discuss the implications of the legislation with people affected by it.  For instance, the other day Deputy Nealon spoke about the effect of the new drink driving legislation on rural life and publicans' business in rural areas. Instead of pontificating from on high as Deputy Bruton said, it would be far more to the point if the rural vintners were invited to the Dáil and asked to express their views on this matter.  To keep the matter on the straight and narrow and to provide balance the anti-drink driving lobby &mdash; Mothers Against Drunk Driving &mdash; should also be invited to give evidence before that committee.  We have an odd notion that plenary session committees, which operate in this House, are the only model for conducting Committee Stage of legislation outside this House.  If we go back to the Official Reports of the Irish Free State we will find that committees did not operate that way and it is about time they did.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to recognise that the committee system has been in operation for less than three months.  The first meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic <Col N="2175" /> Strategy was held on 5 May 1993.  Bearing in mind that the State is over 70 years old, much has been achieved in three months and we must recognise that. Deputy John Bruton raised a fundamental question regarding the political boundaries evolving.  What has happened here in the past three months has been revolutionary but there have been problems. Essentially we are stocktaking in regard to what transpired during the past three months.  I have no doubt there is cynicism in the electorate towards people working here, supposedly, on their behalf.  Largely, that is our own fault. Deputy John Bruton was Leader of this House at one time and was charged with responsibility for bringing about change. He should recognise that an effort is now being made to introduce that change.</P>

As Deputy Michael McDowell said, we should also invite the Mothers Against Drunk Driving to give <Col N="2176" /> evidence before the Committee to provide a balance.</P>
      <P>The Glackin report was referred to by the committee of which I am chairman. It will present a tremendous challenge to the committee in the manner in which we will deal with it.  Certain areas of the report will be very difficult and we will need legal backup which is not available at present.  We will also need expertise to ensure we do not infringe a prohibited area.  All these problems will have to be confronted in the months ahead.  The committee can take a written submission from a witness but it is an obstacle to the development of the system.  It is necessary for us to be afforded the opportunity to summon a witness if we so desire, In other jurisdictions, committees on their own initiative, can summon witnesses but we are dependent on the business handed down to us by the House.  Does the House have sufficient trust in the committees to say that they are mature and have the ability to come to grips with very complex problems which, to date, have been handled by the House?  When we can demonstrate to the House and to the electorate that we mean business we will then be given the added responsbility. Needless to say there is a certain amount of political gamesmanship at present, to which Deputy O'Malley referred.  I very much regret what he said and I sincerely hope that the committee of which I am chairman would not be seen as an extension of the Government's arm.  I chair the committee and have every intention of being fair and even-handed in my approach to the business.  Deputy Bruton effectively got to the nub of the problem and the committee is evolving.  I sincerely hope that in the months ahead we will demonstrate beyond doubt that the step taken on 5 May 1993 was an historic one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity <Col N="2177" /> to report progress to the House on the work of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  As the House is aware, the membership consists of 25 TDs and five Senators.  In the brief time available to me I will summarise developments to date, our present work programme and future plans.</P>
      <P>I wish first to thank the former Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which was so ably chaired by Deputies Peter Barry and Seán Barrett between 1989-92, for the work it carried out.  That work illustrated how complex EC legislation could be examined and reported on by Members who had built up an expertise in those areas over the years.  I am glad some former Members of that committee have been appointed to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The joint committee held its first meeting on 19 May and has continued to meet on a weekly basis since.  I will not give the House an undue amount of statistics, but there has been an average attendance of 70 per cent by Members to date.  This reflects the dedication and interests of Members in the work of the committee. The meetings have lasted in excess of two hours and the level of participation by Members has been very encouraging.</P>
      <P>At the first meeting of the committee I had the honour of being elected Chairman. I am glad the Members also elected Deputy Nora Owen as vice-chairperson of the joint committee.  Deputy Owen has not only wide experience as the Fine Gael Front Bench spokesperson on foreign affairs but she also very ably chaired the former Joint Committee on Development Co-operation in the 1980s.  I am glad that this area now falls within the remit of the joint commmittee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its first meeting the joint committee decided to place Bosnia-Hercegovina high on its priority list for obvious reasons.  The tragic and deteriorating situation in the former Yugoslavia warranted immediate attention and has continued to do so to date.  The joint committee sought briefing material from the Department of Foreign Affairs and has had detailed discussions with senior <Col N="2178" /> departmental officials over a number of meetings.  I should like to place on record my thanks, and that of the joint committee, to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, his departmental Secretary, Mr. Noel Dorr, and the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs for their very positive attitude and input to the work of the joint committee since its establishment.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the joint committee is assisted in its work, setting its agenda, etc., by a bureau of eight Members, including me, which is representative of each of the parties and the independent Senators.  This system has worked very well.  The bureau can deal with procedures and housekeeping issues, thus enabling the joint committee to function more effectively.  Bureau Members can also meet individuals and organisations at short notice.  Recently the committee met a visiting group from Africa who were in Dublin for one day.</P>
    <P>On the question of Bosnia-Hercegovina, we not only heard the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs but we were also privileged to be fully briefed by their Excellencies the Ambassadors of Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy and the Russian Federation.  The joint committee agreed two resolutions on Bosnia-Hercegovina during June and July and these have been brought to the attention of the EC committees of the other member states and the European Parliament. Members have agreed that this important subject should continue to be placed on the committee's agenda for updating on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Before I deal in detail with the other topics discussed by the joint committee, I wish to remind the House that the terms of reference of the joint committee allow for attendance and participation at our meetings by the 18 Irish members of the European Parliament and the eight members of the Council of Europe.  This is a very welcome innovation which I would like to see being developed in a structured way so as to enable greater attendance by these members at meetings. Their experience and network of <Col N="2179" /> contacts will be an invaluable asset to the joint committee, an asset which has not been fully utilised thus far.</P>
    <P>Apart from Bosnia-Hercegovina, the joint committee has looked in varying degrees of depth at the following areas: enlargement of the European Community; development co-operation; the situation in East Timor; the foreign policy aspects of the recently passed Defence (Amendment) Act and the implications for participation by Irish troops in the UN mission in Somalia; the situation in Liberia and the current and future role of the United Nations, which we will investigate shortly.  The joint committee has been very concerned about developments in East Timor, Liberia and Somalia and has agreed formal resolutions in all three cases.</P>
    <P>One welcome and significant aspect of the joint committee's work is that it has provided an opportunity not only for departmental officials and non-governmental organisations to address members but it has also provided an opportunity for individuals to brief members on issues of importance.  In that regard I might mention the presentations by the Portuguese Ambassador and Mr. Tom Hyland, Director of the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign and Sr. Anne Murray of the Sisters of St. Louis who spoke to us last week about Liberia. This is a healthy development &mdash; Deputy Bruton has advocated it for all committees &mdash; which will strengthen the general public's understanding of our democratic institutions.  This is a two way process &mdash; we gain much from direct consultations with concerned individuals.</P>
    <P>On the question of Somalia, the joint committee is grateful to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for agreeing to attend a meeting on 29 June which was devoted exclusively to consideration in advance of the foreign policy aspects of the then proposed Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  A very worth-while exchange of views took place at that meeting which enabled members to obtain responses on proposed changes in <Col N="2180" /> Ireland's role in UN missions in such areas as Somalia.</P>
    <P>On 15 June the joint committee had a useful exchange of views with a visiting delegation from Sweden's parliamentary committee on EC matters, particularly on aspects of Sweden's application for EC membership and future co-operation with other member states on the periphery of Europe.  On 18 June the select committee considered the 1993 Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs, including international co-operation, and reported accordingly to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration of its terms of reference, work programme and priorities for future action the joint committee decided to set up two permanent or standing subcommittees on EC legislation and development co-operation. These subcommittees will deal with the two major elements of the task laid down for the joint committee by the Oireachtas.  The subcommittee on EC legislation, under the chairmanship of Deputy Collins, will be responsible for those areas which fall within the remit of the former Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  In addition, it is intended to establish a mechanism whereby this committee can examine and make recommendations on draft directives and regulations before their adoption in legislative form.  The subcommittee on development co-operation will review Ireland's role in relation to aid for developing countries and will, no doubt, be involved closely with the international co-operation side of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two standing subcommittees the joint committee has also decided to set up another subcommittee on the United Nations.  This subcommittee will be mandated to examine the role and structures of the United Nations and Ireland's current and future relationship with that organisation.  This sub-committee will be dissolved as soon as it has reported back to the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The major areas the joint committee will address in the immediate future are enlargement of the European Community <Col N="2181" /> and Northern Ireland.  We have had an initial discussion with Professor Brigid Laffan of University College, Dublin about the possibility of her acting as a consultant on the issue of European Community enlargement.  The joint committee is confident that with Professor Laffan's active involvement it can produce a timely and worth-while report on this issue.  I expect that this important subject will occupy the time of the joint committee up to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>While the joint committee has not addressed any specific issues in relation to Northern Ireland to date it is intended to devote close attention to the subject over the coming months.  The joint committee realises the sensitivity of this issue and it will treat the matter with the degree of understanding and commitment it deserves.  The Opsahl report and the urgency of political talks make it imperative for the committee to discuss this matter at an early stage when it resumes plenary hearings.  The joint committee is very conscious of the good work already undertaken by the Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I welcome the excellent degree of co-operation and real progress that has been made through the British-Irish interparliamentary body.  I hope to be able to report further progress on this issue on the next occasion I report to the House.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House unduly by referring to the resources of the joint committee: as Winston Churchill said: &ldquo;Give us the tools and will complete the job&rdquo;.  That is the objective of the joint committee.  We have already made a number of submissions to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance on the need to beefup the secretariat both at the lower and higher levels.  I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs will second a First Secretary to the joint committee on 3 August.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the 25 Dáil Deputies and five Senators who participated so well in the work of the committee. The frank exchange of views between parliamentarians and officials in <Col N="2182" /> an open forum has added a new and constructive dimension to our knowledge and understanding of Irish foreign affairs policy.  In the relatively short time we have been in existence, the joint committee has organised its work schedule effectively and dealt with a number of major topical issues in relation to which we will be reporting formally to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  With the continued support and co-operation of my colleagues and adequate resources &mdash; I emphasise the latter aspect which we need to enhance our role &mdash; I am confident that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs can undertake, on behalf of the Oireachtas, the very worth-while task it has been given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is up and running after probably the longest gestation of any organ of this Parliament, it is timely to reflect on the relevance of its workings in the formulation of Irish foreign policy.  I welcome the fact that the chairman of the first Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is making the first report on its workings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the improved methods of information dissemination &mdash; television and radio are available in almost every household &mdash; people are now more interested in international issues.  I have noticed as I am sure other Deputies have, the increase in correspondence relating to what is happening outside Ireland.  On almost a daily basis I receive correspondence on issues ranging from East Timor, Cambodia, Tibet and other places which, heretofore, people had to get out an atlas to find out where they were. Individuals and groups are increasingly concerned about what is happening in these places because they know it is relevant to their lives.  Issues such as global environmental damage, saving the whale, protection of bats and a variety of similar issues are raised in correspondence to Deputies.  There is ongoing concern among Irish people about the effects of natural disasters and famines in Africa and Asia and other parts of the world.  Formerly, when <Col N="2183" /> Deputies and Senators received letters on these issues, they tended to put them into the dustbin or refer them to the relevant party spokesperson requesting him to reply.  I am not blaming Deputies and Senators because the nature of their work did not allow them to be well enough informed to write a proper reply to their constituents.  Thankfully, with the setting up of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs there will be a better informed body of Deputies and Senators who will be able to deal with international issues.</P>
    <P>Already, in the few weeks of its existence the committee has performed a useful role.  I know that I personally am better informed on a number of areas of foreign policy than I was before the committee was set up.  I like to think I would have been well informed because I chaired the Committee on Overseas Development Aid for seven years which, in the absence of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, acted as a foreign affairs committee, we had daily requests to meet foreign dignitaries and visitors to discuss issues with them.</P>
    <P>We will co-operate to try to reach policy decisions that will be good for Ireland and our people and which will raise our profile in the rest of the world. However, there may well be issues on which there will be differences of opinion, not only between parties but between individual members, we must have a mechanism to incorporate differing opinions in the reports of the committee. We will not always be in a position to agree unanimiously on a partiuclar policy.  I hope the committee will be able to sustain those differences.  For example, when we examine more deeply the changing role of the United Nations I can see differences arising and the strength of the committee will be judged by the way we tackle them.</P>
    <P>Since the committee was set up on 19 May 1993 we have had weekly meetings which were very well attended.  It is important that the elected members are diligent and attend because if members come to some meetings and do not attend <Col N="2184" /> others, there will be unnecessary duplication. However, it has been borne out that those selected are diligent and want to participate in the work of the committee. A number of motions has been passed unanimously and sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I urge him and his officials to take on board the work of this committee.  I have no reason to say they are not doing so, indeed I know from discussions with civil servants that they welcome the setting up of this committee and will participate in its work when requested.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs who have attended our many committee meetings.  They have prepared excellent briefs for us.  It is important that they are not sidelined from the work of the committee but it is equally important that our work is independent of the Department of Foreign Affairs because we may well give advice different from that given in the Department.  It is important that they view our work as relevant to their own work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interest shown by the secretary of the Department, Mr. Noel Dorr.  Our chairman, Deputy Lenihan, has already referred to the innovation of ambassadors being admitted to the committees.  I suggested this at the bureau meeting and in fact it was never done in other EC foreign affairs committees. I hope we will continue to do this.  While it is important to work closely with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs it is essential to hear other points of view on the issues we are examining.  For that reason I welcome the fact that ambassadors from Russia, Hungary, Austria, Greece and Portugal attended our meeting.  Indeed, the Portuguese Ambassador spoke to us about East Timor.  It is good to hear their points of view and I know that this initiative has been welcomed in their countries.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of bringing in outside groups to talk to the committee is to get other views.  It is possible to become insular in our work and we may not always be aware of the feelings of people who have already examined the <Col N="2185" /> topics we are examining.  At times it may be uncomfortable to hear these views, but so be it.  The discomfort we feel may mean that we are getting to the root of the issue.</P>
    <P>The chairman referred to staff and resources, it is important to get sufficient resources, look at the work of the bureau and its <i>modus operandi.</i>  I thought we had reached an agreement on the chairing of the overseas development subcommittee but that was not upheld by one section of the Government parties.  I hope we will be able to reach an accommodation on the chairing of this and other subcommittees and that the work will be shared by all, including the Opposition parties.  Without that kind of co-operation our work will not be relevant and indeed tensions may well build up which will not be good for the work of the committee.  I hope we will be able to sort out that disagreement today.</P>
    <P>There will be an understanding by both Government parties that this joint committee will work effectively once there is good co-operation, understanding and respect for the Opposition parties.  One does not know when the Government parties may be in Opposition and they will want the same type of respect.</P>

      <P>Deputies could join hands and try to make contact with the living.  I would like to echo some of the sentiments expressed in relation to the management of this joint committee.  The Tánaiste's initiative in establishing the joint committee has been well justified. The chairmanship of it has been well executed by Deputy Lenihan.  The committee is, fortunate to have a Chairman who takes such a liberal and constructive approach to its remit.  The joint committee <Col N="2186" /> does not depend on the House for further orders as to what it can or cannot consider.  It has taken the initiative in regard to how it operates, who it invites to attend its meetings and the methods by which it performs its business and that is welcome.  Other committees could learn from the procedures of this joint committee.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak on the Northern Ireland issue which is very important.  As Deputy Lenihan stated the joint committee has not addressed the Northern Ireland issue and that is a matter which requires an urgent remedy.  Such a failure demonstrates yet again the paralysis and apathy which has characterised Southern politicians on the Northern issue.  I call today for the involvement of Southern politicians in the development and articulation of Ireland's input into the political situation in Northern Ireland.  We cannot postpone any longer the consideration of the issues involved by Members of this House.  It may be more convenient for some Members that the issue be avoided so that they can avoid expressing a view. However, collectively as a country and representatives of the people, we cannot avoid addressing the Northern issue in this House or in the joint committee appointed by this House to consider the issue.  Northern Ireland should be firmly placed on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, I wish to mention recent events relating to Northern Ireland.  It is a matter of considerable disquiet that a member of the British Parliament, Lord Tebbit, took the opportunity of the aptly named programme &ldquo;Target&rdquo; to express views which were wildly irresponsible and, no matter how qualified or explained, bore an obvious significance when delivered and were inflammatory.  Those views constituted a possible incitement to people to do great damage to North-South and British-Irish relations.  I am aware that Lord Tebbit has inspired controversy before. The programme he was speaking on reminds me of nothing more than hare coursing.  Lord Tebbit and Austin Mitchell appear to get points for who is first to turn the words of the innocent victim. <Col N="2187" /> Nevertheless, it is a serious forum and is watched by many people.  I know one of Lord Tebbit's opponents, in a less charitable humour on one occasion, called him a semi-house trained polecat or likened him to that.  Lord Tebbit must remember that however tabloid that programme is and however strong the temptation is to produce a quick fix, a sound bite, look aggressive, worry or turn around the words of the person being interviewed, the words he spoke could do immense damage and act as a clear inspiration to people who need little inspiration to greatly damage the relations between the North and South and Britain and Ireland.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I would like to underline my distress that any responsible politician, particularly one who has personal and intimate acquaintance with the consequences of terrorist activities and bombings, should lightly use words for ephemeral effect as Lord Tebbit did.  I condemn in the strongest possible terms the words used and reject the explanation given for them in today's papers.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the operation of the joint committee in relation to Bosnia.  The Tánaiste is one of 12 EC Foreign Ministers who individually and collectively are responsible for EC policy through the EPC process, or the absence of it in relation to Bosnia.  The record in Ireland and Europe in relation to Bosnia has been weak, gestural and compliant. Ireland has not made a clear and unambiguous stance on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims or on behalf of the innocent victims of genocidal violence in Yugoslavia. No matter how we characterise what has happened in Irish foreign policy it has not been courageous and has shown little commitment.  The blame and shame of that failure falls on the Tánaiste.  He has not demonstrated either courage or commitment on the issue.  He has not articulated a clear policy line.  As explained to our committee, the position adopted by Ireland has been effectively a rationalisation for inactivity by the European Community.  As a country we <Col N="2188" /> have consistently expressed unrealistic, over-optimistic and fundamentally unclear platitudes on the situation in Bosnia.  We have said nothing coherent or forceful even on a moral plane.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, and that of the majority of the members of the committee we have rightly supported the arms embargo.  However, we have done nothing to defend those whom we in Europe have collectively rendered defenceless.  The no-fly zone and the safe areas are intellectual monuments to shameful indifferentism in the face of genocidal aggression, systematic rape and the destruction of human rights.</P>
    <P>Our collective policy at European level has completely failed to address the dynamics of the situation, in particular, Serbian expansionism.  Ireland, while lacking the resources to take positive measures in this regard, has failed to say anything worth while on this issue.  Our Government, and the other EC states on the principle of collective EC responsibility, are morally and politically jointly responsibile for the situation.  It was the EC states which recognised Bosnia, supported its entry into membership of the United Nations and by doing so created a circumstance in which that state was assailed from all sides.  The EC states have a duty to take measures to protect those who they insist, through the arms embargo, should remain defenceless. The time has come to draw a line in relation to the continuous use of violence against the Bosnian Muslim people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lenihan will verify, the joint committee has had the advantage of meeting people who have lived through the violence.  Graphic accounts have been given, at bureau and committee level, of the violence and its effect on ordinary people.  The cruelty, degradation, barbarity and the atrocities must be stopped.  The fact that people consider it is sensible to bomb, mortar and snipe other people for political effect and that people must endure this situation is intolerable. Ireland must stand morally against this position if we cannot do much physically to stop it.  We must try to push the EC into a more coherent line which <Col N="2189" /> will defend the rights of innocent people in Bosnia.  What little influence we have should be exercised in defence of the defenceless victims of slaughter in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the report by the chairman on the joint committee's proposal to consider, on a pre-emptive basis, draft EC regulations and directives.  Such work will require that the committee networks effectively with the committees of the European Parliament working on similar matters.  It will require a considerable amount of work.  I reiterate the necessity to take our task seriously and for the Government, the Executive of the day, to make sufficient resources available to the joint committee, particularly to the subcommittee on European Community Legislation.  That task must be undertaken thoroughly and competently. The joint committee should not bite off more than it can chew and leave its task half done.  Whatever work it undertakes should be executed effectively and that will require a considerable deployment of resources in favour of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution and for moral and legal reasons the Dáil and Seanad are entitled to sufficient resources to carry out their duties.  For too long we have been dependent on the Executive who will not provide essential help to this House to discharge is functions effectively. We have laboured long enough without resources in this Legislature and it is time that members of all parties collectively stood up to the Government and demanded what is rightfully ours &mdash; as Deputy Lenihan stated, the tools to carry out our tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>It is important to acknowledge Deputy Lenihan's role in chairing the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  There is no doubt that a different chairpersonship could have resulted in the committee being a rubber stamp for Government policy, but that has not been the case.  However, I was taken aback by the committee's reaction to my proposal on Somalia which directly contradicted <Col N="2190" /> the Government's proposals.  My proposal resulted in strong reaction, not only from Government members on that committee but also from Fine Gael members. I do not mind that, I am used to aggravation.</P>

      <P>I simply want to warn the committee that it should not see itself as providing a cosy consensus for whatever the Exeuctive decides as there will be times when there will not be consensus. It should not be our primary objective to achieve consensus at all times.  Parties will have different perspectives and, therefore, there will be differences of opinion although there may be areas where we will agree and, as Deputies have stated already, motions have been carried by consensus because a compromise was reached.  However, that does not mean they represent the views of all committee members.</P>
      <P>An important innovation has been the creation of the bureau of the committee which has set itself the task of managing the agendas of committee meetings, visits by foreign guests and so on.  Members of other committees should examine that measure as a means of rationalising their business.  The terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are much more liberal than those of other committees, who are being done a disservice by the restrictive nature of their mandates.  As I stated, there was a kneejerk reaction to my proposal on Somalia. It would be a mistake to accept that motions cannot be brought before the committee unless four day's notice is given.  If the committee is to be relevant it must be able to respond quickly to current issues and events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past few weeks this House and the country generally made what is probably the most significant shift in foreign policy since we joined the European Community in 1972, yet there was virtually no public debate about its implications and only limited discussions in this House or at the foreign affairs committee. <Col N="2191" /> I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared before the committee but it was on the afternoon of the day on which the legislation was being discussed and debate was crammed into one hour prior to the Order of Business. That was a new initiative but it did not satisfy the necessity to examine the details of the matter being proposed.  I am referring, of course, to the amendment to the Defence Act which does not specify the type or operations in which our troops will be involved.  The Defence Bill states that Irish troops may participate not alone in peacekeeping operations but in any international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations. Effectively, the Government has been given a free hand to commit Irish troops to combat throughout the world. Obviously, a motion of approval by the Dáil will be necessary for each mission, but given that Governments by their nature have a majority &mdash; except in exceptional circumstances &mdash; when a Government decision is made it will be passed by this House.  As the Defence Act shifted the focus from peacekeeping to peace enforcement operations, my main criticism is that when a decision is made by this House the nature and scale of the commitment of Irish troops internationally will be a day to day matter for the Government.  There is provision for an annual review, but that is inadequate and the foreign affairs committee should address this matter.</P>
    <P>Even since the legislation was passed the dangerous position Irish troops are being asked to face was highlighted by the developments in Somalia and the disarray and division within the United Nations operations there.  There was a total breakdown in the relationship between the Italian component and the UN command because of the objections raised by the Italians to the militaristic approach of the forces of the United States in Somalia and their determination to pursue military operations, irrespective of the consequences in terms of civilian casualties or the humanitarian <Col N="2192" /> objectives of the UNOSOM II mission. The Government should continue to defer sending troops to Somalia until a review of the entire UN mission there is complete unless, as I argued in the debate on the defence legislation, it can be agreed with the United Nations that Irish troops will be engaged only in activities relating to peacekeeping.  If the Irish Government insists on sending troops to the present confused and dangerous position in Somalia, the price may be very high, not only in the number of deaths of troops from participating countries but in the number of deaths of Somalis, and the direct responsibility will lie with us in this House.</P>
    <P>The alteration of the Defence Act cannot be viewed in isolation from other major foreign policy departures in recent years.  For example, the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty commits us to a common European policy in the foreign affairs and security areas and opens the way for the development of an EC defence policy with the possibility of a common defence policy.  Ireland is already participating as an observer at meetings of the Western European Union, an organisation made up of nine members of NATO which has as a central feature of its strategy the possession and threat of the use of nuclear weapons. Under the Maastricht Agreement the EC is effectively subcontracting defence activities to the Western European Union pending further consideration of defence policy in 1996.</P>
    <P>Our tradition of non-membership of military alliances and our constitutional commitment to the pacific settlement of international conflicts is being undermined. Major changes are being made in foreign policy without proper public debate.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has a crucial role to play in addressing all those issues.</P>
    <P>The committee is examining the question of the reform of the United Nations and is about to establish a subcommittee to address that matter in more detail. That cannot be addressed in isolation from the regional organisations such as the CSCE, the Western European Union <Col N="2193" /> and NATO.  The question of disarmament must be examined also.</P>
    <P>One of the most shocking figures presented to us by the Department when we were considering the question of the reform of the United Nations was that the five permanent members of the Security Council spend $625 billion annually on the military budget.  Those countries make decisions in relation to peace enforcement and peacekeeping.  We know for a fact that the arms being used in places such as the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and elsewhere are supplied by those states.  The ratio of their contribution to peacekeeping as against their military spending is something in the order of 2,000:1.  This area must be addressed.</P>

      <P>First, I want to express my satisfaction that at last a foreign affairs committee has been established.  We were one of the last parliaments in Europe to have a foreign affairs committee and in that regard I pay tribute to the Government and the Tánaiste for agreeing to set it up.  I wish to pay tribute also to the chairperson of the committee, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for the easy manner in which he has accommodated most of the views expressed on the committee.  Indeed, this committee's terms of reference allow flexibility to its members, unlike other committees which are restricted to either consideration of Estimates or legislative programmes. This committee can and has addressed itself to many pressing problems worldwide in the area of international foreign affairs, whether it is Somalia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, EC affairs, overseas development, revision of UN policies, Northern Ireland or any of the other fringe areas of concern to members of the committee such as East Timor, Tibet and the Middle East, which we also intend to consider.  The committee has an open brief and its members are dedicated to carrying out the mandate given to it by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have made progress and dealt with a wide range of areas.  Tributes were paid to the officials <Col N="2194" /> from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Noel Dorr and his team.  As a member of the Labour Party on the committee I wish to join in those tributes.  We welcome the fact that they are available at all times, both through the provision of briefing material and by attending the meeting in person to have a discussion with Members of the Oireachtas.  This is a welcome change from the procedure in the past when all foreign affairs matters were confined to the Minister and his Department and there was little opportunity for Members of the Oireachtas to discuss such matters, apart from Question Time in the House.</P>
    <P>The committee also has flexibility to deal with the Estimates of the Department and the ability to become a select committee of foreign affairs which would allow Members of the Dáil to discuss the Estimates in detail.  It also has an opportunity to deal with resolutions which are effectively debated here as part of the legislation.  I look forward to a continuation of the good working relationship between the various committees. I concur with the previous statements by various Members.</P>
    <P>The bureau was set up on a recommendation of the committee to set the agenda and make recommendations for the committee.  However, the bureau's decisions are not binding unless they are approved by the committee as a whole. The agreement reached by the bureau, referred to by Deputy Owen, was not ratified by the committee as a whole.  The Labour Party members of the bureau and members of the committee are entitled to be consulted or at least have their wishes taken into account.  We have views on issues such as the UN, ODA, the EC and so on but when the committee makes a decision we will abide by it.</P>
    <P>I hope the composition of these committees will reflect the guidelines laid down for this House by the Journal Office which dictates, in a non-partisan way, how the committees or any of their subcommittees will be appointed, to take account of the representation in the Dáil. I hope that approach will be adopted by this committee.  It was agreed by the <Col N="2195" /> Whips that in the formation of the committees the Journal Office, which is non-political, would decide the numbers of various representatives.  All groups who do not have sufficient numbers to be considered a parliamentary party must have an opportunity to be represented on these committees.</P>

      <P>I hope this committee continues to reflect the views of people in this House and that its decisions will be unanimous. I join the chairman in his request for additional and adequate facilities, staffing and otherwise, to ensure that this committee can fulfil the role it has been given by this House, namely, to represent the views of the House in the area of foreign affairs.</P>

      <P>I wish to contribute to the debate as a member of the foreign affairs committee and as a member of the subcommittee dealing with overseas development assistance.  I also wish to respond to some of the comments made by Deputy Ferris.  Last week the subcommittee on overseas development assistance, like the subcommittee on European affairs, met to elect chairpersons. The subcommittee on European affairs elected a chairperson as a result of an agreement on how the matter would be approached.  There was an agreement also as to how the chair of the subcommittee on overseas development assistance should be filled but this agreement was, unfortunately, reneged on by Deputy Ferris and his party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the way business is done.</P>
      <P>The general principle operating is important.  This foreign affairs committee must work on the basis of co-operation, as stated by the Tánaiste on the day it was set up.  It has been said also by the chairperson of the committee who certainly promotes co-operation among members on the committee.  The spirit of that co-operation should manifest itself in the Government parties agreeing to the participation of Opposition parties in the various subcommittees.  The best way of expressing that co-operation is by allowing members of Opposition parties to chair these subcommittees.  That is a well established principle, not just in this democracy but in mature democracies all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that would have been our approach on this committee but if I understand Deputy Ferris correctly, because there was a tied vote between myself and Deputy Gallagher last week &mdash; and I certainly have no personal ill-feeling towards Deputy Gallagher on the issue because that is politics &mdash; and having regard to the resolution that there should be ten members on this and the ODA subcommittee &mdash; which is agreed &mdash; the solution to the problem may be that the Government parties will increase their membership by one to have their majority and appoint their candidate as <Col N="2197" /> chairperson of the subcommittee.  That is a fundamentally undemocratic approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done by the Deputy's party on county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let nobody say that the matter was not agreed.  It was agreed between the parties that these subcommittees would consist of ten members.  It seems we must now change the goalposts to allow certain people from the Government parties who form the majority to get their way.  That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>As a member of the overseas development assistance subcommittee I welcome the way in which the work of this committee has developed in the few weeks of its existence.  I wish to again pay tribute to the chairperson for the manner in which he has conducted this committee. He has given leadership.  He certainly deserves the tributes that were paid to him.</P>
      <P>In the future we should look in greater depth at issues in the Third World.  Part of the work of the overseas development assistance subcommittee should be to draw more attention to the awful problems on the continent of Africa in which I have a great interest.  At least one third of the African population lives in destitution and in serious danger of death from disease or famine.  That is the lot of 200 million people in Africa.  Average incomes in Africa since 1975 have fallen in real terms by about 25 per cent while the food producing capacity of the continent in ten years has fallen by 10 per cent and in the same period the population has risen by 16 per cent.  These are fundamental problems afflicting one of the greatest land masses in the world.  We have special relationships with many of the countries on that continent but we pay far too little attention to its terrible problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the developed world to reach out to Africa. What has been happening in 1992 and 1993 gives us hope.  These people are making genuine efforts towards democratisation. Dictatorships have fallen in <Col N="2198" /> many countries although there are exceptions like Zaire and there is difficulty with Nigeria.  There was great hope for Angola, for instance, but that hope was betrayed because the UN was not there to ensure that the agreements reached in Portugal were lived up to.  There is great reason for hope in Malawi but the response of the developed world in helping countries that are having a rebirth of democracy, a very frail infant indeed, is not adequate.  We have a duty to reach out to them and help them.</P>
    <P>I have cited some of the enormous difficulties with the IMF and the World Bank.  It is wrong for these western based financial institutions to insist on a country like Zambia abolishing food subsidies. We cannot ask a country with the levels of poverty evident in Zambia to abolish food subsidies and hope that these measures will turn around the economy and make it into a properly functioning enterprise economy on the western model.  It simply does not happen, so great is the level of underdevelopment in terms of what we know as development in those countries.  Last week we had a nun from a religious order talk to us about the situation in Liberia, a totally forgotten country where all government and all administration has disappeared. It is rather like Somalia, but it is perhaps even more horrible because it does not get any international attention worth talking about.  We should examine and highlight that sort of thing.  This would encourage a much wider response and a much wider recognition of the problems.</P>
    <P>On a totally different subject, I agree with Deputy Michael McDowell regarding the remarks made on television by Mr. Norman Tebbit, a former British Government Minister.  To say that only bombs in Dublin would make an Irish Government sit up and look at the problems in Northern Ireland, or words to that effect, amounted to incitement of the worst kind.  Members of this House should be very forthright in condemning that kind of remark by someone who may not be very significant in the British political process at the moment, but who is a former cabinet Minister and was one <Col N="2199" /> of the closest associates of a former British Prime Minister.  We know this man suffered at the hands of the IRA but it is unacceptable that that type of remark should come from a member of the British House of Lords.  I am glad that protests about it have been made but it behoves all of us in this House to condemn this in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I join Deputy Connor and previous speakers in condemning the remarks made by Norman Tebitt.  If Norman Tebitt was of Irish nationality in Britain he would have been the subject of incitement investigations if not much more stringent investigations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I hope the representations made about this will impact on the British authorities and on Lord Tebitt although I do not have any illusions about him because in his career as a government Minister we saw how amenable he was to suggestions from other sides.</P>
      <P>In reply to the points made about magnanimity on committees, as a member of a minority group on a local authority I know how magnanimous local authorities can be from time to time.  I am a member of a local authority which at the moment is magnanimous in its operations but that is because I and non-Fianna Fáil and non-Fine Gael members became a group which after initial attention seeking managed to attract permanent attention.  I do not need lessons on magnanimity from any quarter of the House.</P>
      <P>I, too, pay tribute to Deputy Lenihan as chairperson of the committee.  I also pay tribute to the Tánaiste and the departmental officials and to the bureau for their work in making this a productive first term for this committee, given that it took years to put the committee into action.  The committee has made a very good start due to the level of openness and co-operation all around.  I look forward to improved work and to the next end of term review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be addressing overseas development.  I understand that this <Col N="2200" /> evening the Government is launching a strategy plan for overseas development assistance.  One area we should develop through the foreign affairs committee relates to further co-operation and learning from the experience of Irish people and Irish agencies who work in developing countries.  Missionary orders worked overseas for decades and now we have our NGOs and organisations like Campaign Aid and APSO.  It is important for the committee to review the strategic plan presented by the Tánaiste and to draw on the views which Irish people can give on the basis of their experience of working in other countries.  The committee should move on then to address the question of how our experience in overseas development, our experience as a post colonial, recently developed country which in European terms is on the periphery, can act as a bridge, particularly in international fora between the developed world and the developing world.  I am thinking, for example, of last year's UN conference on the environment, of GATT negotiations, of EC trade relations with developing countries. In those areas we can bring a unique perspective to Europe.  I hope the committee will address this issue in its next term.  I hope we will be able to use our experience to amend or enforce positions which Ireland adopts in international arenas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, I wish to report to the House on the work to date of that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee held its first meeting on 13 May 1993 when it elected me as chairman.  Since then we have considered the following Estimates: Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Votes 42, 43 and 44, 21 May; Department of Education, Votes 26 to 29, 11 June; <Col N="2201" /> Department of Health, Vote 41, 17 June; and, on 22 June, Department of Social Welfare, Vote 40.  Prior to the consideration of the Estimates meetings took place between the convenors, departmental officials and me, as chairman, to discuss and acquaint ourselves with the procedures.</P>
    <P>On 15 July the committee met to consider the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993. However, it has not yet completed Committee Stage.  Again, prior to the consideration of Committee Stage, as provided for under paragraph 8 of the terms of reference of the committee, a briefing session took place between the members of the committee and officials of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the committee has considered the Estimates for the three biggest spending Departments; the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Education.  The Estimates for these three Departments alone amount to £5.5 billion which represents approximately 63 per cent of total supply services expenditure. The meetings of the committee were attended by the appropriate Minister in all cases.</P>
    <P>Initially, no time constraints were laid down by the Dáil for the consideration of Estimates.  An order of the Dáil was passed on 15 June 1993 instructing the committee to meet on a certain date to consider and conclude all Estimates relevant to a particular Department. However, as members of the committee felt that more time might be required, especially when discussing Estimates for a big spending Department, this was subsequently amended to allow, with the agreement of the Minister and the committee, more time to be allocated for consideration of a particular Estimate.</P>
    <P>With the co-operation of members and the Ministers concerned, the committee completed consideration of the Estimates within the time laid down by the Dáil. Most, if not all Deputies would agree that the consideration of the Estimates by the committee has been successful and has enabled members of the committee and, indeed, the House to elicit information <Col N="2202" /> from Ministers and to make valuable contributions in a less formal atmosphere than in a committee of the whole Dáil. The report of the committee on the Estimates was laid before the Dáil on 26 June.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the committee met last Thursday consider the Matrimonial Home Bill and has arranged to meet again on Wednesday and Thursday, 8 and 9 September to consider it further. It is hoped to complete Committee Stage by mid September.  It is anticipated that in addition to the two days already set aside in September that possibly two further days will have to be set aside to complete Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The success of a committee depends to a large extent on the resources available to it.  A clerk has been appointed to the committee but no specific back-up staff have been provided.  It is essential that these be provided, including clerical staff, as soon as possible.  We expect the workload of the committee to increase and the terms of reference to expand. Therefore, the secondment or appointment of senior staff to the committee will be required.</P>
    <P>Under its terms of reference the committee has the power to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it or any of its subcommittees in their consideration of matters comprehended by its terms of reference.  However, to date no budget has been allocated to the committee.  The liaison committee which allocates funds to the committee has not yet met.  As part of its brief members of this committee will undoubtedly have to attend relevant meetings or conferences from time to time and it would be appropriate to make a specific allocation from the appropriate Vote for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The committee feels that its terms of reference are somewhat restrictive and limit the committee in initiating its own agenda.  As well as considering Estimates, the Committee Stage of Bills and reports referred to it by Dáil Éireann in the areas of social welfare, health, education, labour law, the Gaeltacht and equality the committee is empowered to <Col N="2203" /> consider the impact on equality of policy and legislation relevant to these areas. This wording appears to allow only a discussion on equality issues under the headings of policy and existing legislation. The committees seeks clarification. For example, in the area of health the committee would like to be able to consider the implementation of childcare legislation.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee have suggested that paragraph 7 of the terms of reference which allows the committee to invite submissions in writing should be amended to allow oral submissions to be made to the committee.  Other chairmen have made the point today that the question of privilege for witnesses who appear before the committee to give oral evidence would arise.  In this regard the committee asked me to write to the Taoiseach requesting legislation to be introduced without delay to deal with this matter but the Taoiseach was unable to give a precise date for the introduction of legislation.</P>
    <P>The committee would like to be in a position to agree to a work programme to facilitate members who would like to know in advance, so far as possible, what legislation is likely to be referred to the committee for consideration.  There are many reports which the committee would also like to consider.</P>
    <P>I should mention that a problem has arisen in taking divisions.  There is a need to put a mechanism in place to ensure that members not in the meeting room or within the precincts of the House are alerted in good time when a division is called.  This problem is encountered at all committees.  I hope it will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the members of the committee for their co-operation and active participation in the work of the committee; the Ministers and Ministers of State who have attended the meetings of the committee with their officials; the officials of this House who help the committee, including the clerk and the convenors, Deputy Mary Flaherty, more <Col N="2204" /> recently Deputy Paul Bradford and Deputy Bell for their help and co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out in a non-political fashion that it would be helpful if Ministers responsible for Departments whose Estimates we debate were present to listen to our observations.</P>
      <P>To the vast majority of the public, for the last week or two Dáil Éireann has been on holidays.  The fact that the vast majority of people do not know that committees are still meeting shows a lack of public interest in politics, the Dáil and the committees, and that is disappointing.  In the last number of years there has been much public cynicism of and a lack of interest in politics.  I hope the work of the committees will improve the image of politics and politicians and will prove to people that politics is relevant to their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind the setting up of committees is excellent.  Fine Gael, particularly its Leader, Deputy Bruton, has loudly and clearly advocated the case for committees down the years.  The work of the committees since their formation a <Col N="2205" /> couple of months ago has been positive. Much more must be done but we are moving in the right direction.  One of the positive aspects of the committees is that they help to remove one element of Irish politics which impacts on public life, that is the &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; approach.  The 15 people who sit around the Cabinet table appear to be the only people who have any say in matters.  Government backbenchers perhaps even junior Ministers and certainly everybody on this side of the House, is entirely removed from the decision-making process.  The committee system provides an opportunity for all Members to contribute and for Ministers to listen to our suggestions.  For that reason the committees are welcome. They are working and I hope they will have an impact.  Democracy is important and committees allow everybody, particularly backbenchers, to participate in a meaningful fashion in the political process.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy &mdash; many of my colleagues represent rural constituencies &mdash; I have to admit that in terms of winning votes, which is very important, we would probably more easily gain votes by being in our constituencies than by being present in this Chamber.  The focus must be on this Chamber.  Our role must appear to be relevant and one way of ensuring that is by expanding the committee system.  Very few people know that we are here today and even fewer are concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by a number of speakers about the need for an opening up of committees.  For example, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has power to meet outside groups.  Its chairperson, Deputy Lenihan, mentioned the various groups with which it has met in the last number of weeks.  It would be a welcome step if all committees had such power.  The matters under the responsibility of this committee, such as health, social welfare, eduation and so on, have a great bearing on people's lives. There are thousands of statutory and voluntary groups involved in these areas and the committee should have an opportunity to meet representatives of these <Col N="2206" /> groups to discuss matters of policy with them.  That would prove that politicians have a say and that you do not have to sit at the Cabinet table to have a real role in politics.  It is essential that all committees have an opportunity to meet with groups to discuss and debate issues. Public hearings must be advocated and I hope that in future we will move in that direction.</P>
    <P>The workload of Dáil Deputies must be noted.  If we are to play an active and full role in committees and plenary sessions of Dáil Éireann we must have extra facilities.  All of us are expected to be legislators and facilitators in our constituencies.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to fill these roles with limited resources.  As politicians we are probably the worst people to defend our own case.  We are very apologetic about seeking extra facilities and staff.  With only one secretarial assistant available to the vast majority of Members, it is very difficult to research policy, meet outside interest groups, come in here to debate legislation and hold clinics in our constituencies. Mention was made of the need for extra facilities for committees but if we are to do our job properly extra facilities are essential for the Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I will briefly comment on the aspects of policy covered already.  The committee debated Estimates for Education, Health, Social Welfare, Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and so on.  I am disappointed that adequate time was not provided to discuss some of these Estimates. The budgets for social welfare, health and education constitute a huge proportion of GNP.  Only a few hours was made available to discuss the Social Welfare Estimates involving the expenditure of £3.5 billion.  If matters such as these are to be properly debated adequate time must be made available.  I hope that in the next session we will become masters of our own destiny and will be able to spend more time debating crucial issues.  We have a long way to go and I hope some of the suggestions made today will be taken on board in the next few months.</P>

      <P>The Select Committee on Social Affairs is a very important committee, set up to deal with Committee Stages of legislation, with Estimates and with supplementary reports on social welfare, health, education, equality, labour affairs and the Gaeltacht.  Sadly to date we have been confined to discussing the Estimates relevant to those areas, with discussion on one Bill only, the long awaited Matrimonial Home Bill, on which we have reached only the halfway stage.  While that Committee Stage debate so far has been very interesting, the outstanding matters to be dealt with in regard to improving the competence of these committees if they are to really work and effect change in this House, mean that legislation empowering us to call witnesses and to demand papers is vital.  For example, in the case of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, the Incorporated Law Society could have been invited to participate in the Committee Stage debate since the fine-tuning of that Bill is most important from a conveyancing point of view.  Likewise, the report of the Kilkenny incest case could have been thoroughly investigated by the Select Committee on Social Affairs, when we could have compelled witnesses from the health boards to appear before the committee and carried out an in-depth examination of what went wrong.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the introduction and passage of the legislation ensuring the compellability of witnesses which was promised as a priority in the Programme for Government, but six months later it has not been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn now to a Bill which did not come before the Select Committee on Social Affairs which is a great tragedy.  Yesterday the Supreme Court cast a shadow over the constitutional rights of Irish women to information and travel, one which women felt <Col N="2208" /> had been lifted by the unanimous approval of the two referenda dealing with information and travel last November. Indeed it should not be forgotten that the guarantee of those rights comprised part of a deal made with Irish women on the passing of the Maastricht Treaty and Protocol.  Therefore, the majority decision of the Supreme Court yesterday &mdash; when it refused to lift the injunction restricting Irish women's rights to information and travel &mdash; was really an exercise in judicial fancy foot work, the majority decision relying on the jurisdictional and technical point to avoid lifting the injunction which, by implication, accepts that women's rights in this area can be postponed until the relevant legislation is introduced.  I agree with Mrs. Justice Susan Denham when she said that the postponment is a denial of that right.  Constitutional rights, such as those to travel and information, should not be subordinate to or dependent on promised legislation, which was the majority decision of the Supreme Court handed down yesterday.  We were promised that legislation in the Programme for Government.  Where is it?  It has been on the desk of the Minister for Health since he assumed office, yet he is willing to say to Irish women that they must wait although their constitutional rights are contingent on the passage of that legislation. What is the Minister's view on yesterday's supreme Court judgment?</P>
    <P>The Attorney General appears to be very selective in his role as protector of the Constitution.  The House will recall that he was not shy in protecting the rights of the unborn in the X case but his silence is deafening today when women's constitutional rights have been threatened. The silence of the Minister for Health and, more remarkably, that of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is evident.  Indeed the only voice we have heard on this matter has been the clear, unambigous, furious, very strong dissenting one of the only female member of our Supreme Court, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  If the law is as stated yesterday by the majority decision of the Supreme Court, it represents a double-cross on <Col N="2209" /> Irish women, the women who voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty.  I made a party political broadcast on behalf of my party urging women to vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, telling them that the referenda would guarantee those rights.  Now we hear from the Supreme Court that nothing is certain any longer, that we must await the relevant empowering legislation.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that this injunction runs contrary to the Irish Constitution and to the Convention on Human Rights as stated by the court in Strasbourg last November.  Indeed the Supreme Court has taken four months to find, circuitously, a technical reason for not lifting the injunction and has thrown the ball back into the court of this House to legislate on the detail of the amendments to the Constitution.  I agree that this House is the correct forum to tease out and have a healthy, full and frank debate on all sides of the substantive issue of abortion.  However, I do not agree that fundamental simple rights referring to information and travel must be embodied in legislation and that they must be postponed until that legislation has been passed.</P>
    <P>For example, there is no legislation promised in this House with regard to the right to travel.  If we are to go on the basis of yesterday's Supreme Court judgment, there is no such right to travel and no promised legislation in relation thereto. Are women free to leave this State to avail of services legally available in others?</P>
    <P>The duty to legislate on information and on the substantive issue of abortion has been put on the long finger by this Government.  The silence of the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach and the Attorney General &mdash; all of whom have been so vocal on constitutional integrity and the upholding of constitutional rights in the past &mdash; places such integrity in doubt in that they appear to be selective in their protection of constitutional rights.  For example, there is never any danger of the rights of the unborn not being voiced whereas women's rights have been put at the bottom of the ladder <Col N="2210" /> of priority of this Government; women's rights always seem to languish at the bottom of the Government agenda.  For example, it has taken 20 years for the Bill on matrimonial property to be introduced containing rights to equal ownership of the family home.  The necessary legislation with regard to information and travel has been postponed because of fear.  I am so ashamed, particularly of the Labour component of this Government, because after all their talk and guarantees to women, they still have not introduced this legislation; they have agreed to the postponement of rights which had been guaranteed prior to the Maastricht Treaty.  Indeed by the time this legislation is introduced in the House one year will have elapsed since the trauma of the X case and the unanimous approval by the electorate of the two referenda which confirmed the rights to freedom of information and travel.  I really cannot believe that women's rights to information and travel have been reversed and, as Mrs. Justice Susan Denham said yesterday, set at nought.</P>
    <P>That legislation should have been dealt with by the Select Committee on Social Affairs but has not been to date.</P>

      <P>I welcome the committee system which is a step in the direction of Dáil reform.  If the changes outlined by my party Leader here this morning are affected, those committees will prove to be an invaluable part of our democratic system.  I hope that Deputy O'Malley's recommendations will be noted and acted on so that this system, can be improved to the point to where these committees will become major engines for growth in the future.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs on the gracious manner in which he discharged his duties to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Select Committee on Social Affairs has a very broad brief as it deals with issues touching the daily lives of ordinary people and their families.  We are talking about education, health, social welfare, art and culture.  It is important that all these issues are discussed <Col N="2211" /> in great depth within the confines of this committee.  It is important also that issues that may arise in the course of a year affecting the workings of those Departments are fully discussed.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we discussed the Estimate for Health but we did not discuss the inevitable impact of increased telephone charges on health, caring and community health catered for by the voluntary sector &mdash; carers and the help lines.  A special meeting of this committee should be convened before September to discuss the impact of increased telephone charges on that sector of community care with a view to effecting whatever changes are necessary to enable that voluntary part of our health care to continue.  We should remember if that part of our health care collapsed in the morning and the State was compelled to pick up the tab, its cost would make the cost of the Aer Lingus rescue package look like peanuts.  This committee should convene a special meeting to deal with that item in depth and to make recommendations to the Minister to ensure that steps will be taken to offset the effects of those charges on help lines, voluntary sectors and on the carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Select Committee on Social Affairs has offered us an opportunity to consider the biggest spending areas in all Departments.  For example, the question of spending on health is one that has been highly contentious and the public perception has been that we are spending too much on health care.  The reality is somewhat different, a point that needs to be raised through the committee system.  It is not so much how much we spend on health care, compared with other European countries &mdash; as our costs are well controlled &mdash; but how that money is spent and how fairly it is distributed. Clearly, our present system, particularly in relation to hospital care, is based largely on peoples' ability to pay for a service rather than on their needs. To tilt that balance a major political change is required.  While I welcome the establishment of the committees I do not <Col N="2212" /> think that a committee that examines the Estimates five or six months after they have begun to be spent is a relevant way to put right something that is basically inequitous.  As an Opposition Deputy I would like to play my part to ensure that we can right the balance.  There are many limitations to the committee system. Another opportunity missed relates to the responsiveness of committees.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in the Dáil is the slowness and the ponderous procedure that prevents us debating and raising issues on a daily basis.  The committee system offers us an opportunity to be much more responsive and in this regard I cite the example of yesterday's Supreme Court decision.  I suggest that we have a special meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs to deal with this issue. Questions of equality constitutionality are involved.  The committee that deals with the area of equality should meet to discuss this issue.  The Taoiseach stated, in his slow ambling way, that somehow the matter can wait until the autumn, and that the Minister for Health will bring forward legislation to deal with this issue. It is extraordinary that this matter is being put on the long finger instead of being tackled as a matter of urgency. This constitutional question needs to be resolved.  The rights of women are being denied as a result of yesterday's decision. The Taoiseach's response was a miserable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution guarantees that there should be no limit to freedom to obtain and make available, subject to conditions laid down by law, information on services lawfully available in another EC member state.  We are always described as good Europeans. The question women want answered now is whether we are equal Europeans.  Nine months ago the Irish people supported the proposed amendment to the Constitution. They voted in favour of the right to information and of the right to travel.  The Government chose not to introduce legislation but that in no way changes the fundamental principle enshrined in our Constitution.  The Dublin Well Woman Centre and Open <Col N="2213" /> Door were simply exercising their constitutional rights in applying to have an injunction lifted which clearly was in contravention of the wishes of the Irish people; the same freedom of information that is available in other EC member states and which was guaranteed by the Irish people in the last referendum. Instead of protecting that right and ensuring that it was extended to particular groups we were presented with the disgraceful spectacle of the Attorney General putting forward a case not for but against the wishes of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the same Attorney General who organised the legal vendetta against the 14 year-old girl who wished to travel to seek an abortion, the case that led to a referendum in which the people were asked to vote on the issue.  They voted overwhelmingly in favour of the right to travel.  Despite the clear wishes of the majority of people we now have a repeat performance which can only put a question mark over the role of the Attorney General in relation to protecting human rights and, in particular, those of women.</P>
    <P>The one member of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Justice Denham, who spoke out on behalf of women yesterday said:</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is whether an extant order of the Supreme Court which is contrary to the Constitution should stand.  I am satisfied that it should not.  To the pregnant women who required information pursuant to the amendments from Open Door, time did not stand still.  Their situation could not be adjourned.  The existence of the injunction resulted in a denial of the centre's constitutional right to make the information available and circumvented the right of a woman to obtain such information from the centre.</P>
    <P>There can be no clearer message to the Members of the Oireachtas than that. We have a responsibility and I ask the Chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs to convene a special meeting to meet that responsibility and defend the rights of woman. <Col N="2214" /> The Minister for Health has been given responsibility to bring in legislation in the autumn.  That is not the answer and it does not face up to the reality that women are being told to wait in line and cannot exercise the right they won through the will of the people last year.  If Dáil reform is to mean anything, if we are serious about our business and if we are not to have committees which are simply talking shops a special meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs should be convened to tackle this issue in a way that is responsing to an essential injustice.</P>
    <P>One of the great disappointments felt by the general public, and in particular those depending on social welfare, was the refusal by the Government to withdraw the McCreevy cuts &mdash; the so-called dirty dozen.  I should like to cite the example of the exceptional needs payments which have been the subject of much contention since the original circular was sent to community welfare officers.  The situation is still the same as it was when that circular was issued.  We have had a face saving exercise by the Minister which has been meaningless and is fraudulent in the manner in which it is presented to the people.</P>
    <P>One of the great strengths of the social welfare system has been the ability of community welfare officers to be flexible and to respond when a family is in stress and when there is a financial strain on a family.  The community welfare officers who were well versed in local needs and aware of what should be done are now lost because the Minister for Social Welfare is preventing them doing the job they were supposed to do and did effectively in the past.  In Dublin this has led to a dispute which is most unfortunate. The responsibility lies with the Minister for Social Welfare.  He is being bull-headed about this.  The effect has been that families who, in the past, could look to the State for small amounts of money can no longer do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one point regarding education.  It is such an obvious point that I almost feel embarrassed raising it.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, whom I wish well, has <Col N="2215" /> launched an initiative to hold a convention in the autumn on the the Green Paper on Education to which she will invite all the disparate groups and relevant bodies in education.  This exericise is being presented as one of openness and transparency and is a good idea. It is extraordinary that not one Member of the Oireachtas has been invited to the convention.</P>
    <P>Surely if we are to have openness and transparency in Government it must be done on the fundamental democratic principle that we are here not in our own right but representing thousands of people who entrusted us with the job of shaping public policy in education and so on.  It is an extraordinary oversight that the Minister for Education has excluded the select committee dealing with education from this convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the chairman, Deputy Pattison, and the convenor, Deputy Michael Bell, for getting the committee up and running so quickly. Unlike the Order of Business in this House, there is no playacting by the members on this committee &mdash; it conducts its business in a workman like fashion.  The Minister has been criticised for not being present in the House to listen to the debate.  It should be said that the Minister would not even have an opportunity of replying to the debate &mdash; the chairman gives his report to the House, it is debated and he may wind up the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These committees were set up to afford backbenchers an opportunity to contribute to Committee Stage debates.  The system will be of more benefit to Fianna Fáil and Labour backbenchers than to Opposition backbenchers who got an opportunity to contribute to almost every debate.  Lately when I visited the Whip's office to indicate my wish to contribute to a debate I was told that the list was full and that half the speakers might not even get in.  I then had to try to get three or five minutes from another speaker.  I think the practice whereby people who were not members of the committee <Col N="2216" /> could not contribute to a debate is being changed to allow members of other committees to contribute to debates.  I believe members of the Select Committee on Social Affairs would welcome the opportunity to contribute to debates on agriculture, environment and defence matters.</P>
    <P>Members of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body will know that we have an opportunity to consult with various groups, statutory bodies, individuals etc. in drawing up reports.  I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Bradford in that regard; we need to get all the information possible.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Social Affairs has a very wide remit &mdash; it deals with the big spending Government Departments, Social Welfare and Education. At present this committee is dealing with the Committee Stage of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993.  The committee should have an opportunity to carry out an in-depth examination of the systems operated in those Departments. For example, it should be able to call in departmental officials to discuss their various areas of responsibility.  I have long held the view that the policies in many of those areas leave much to be desired.  Some health boards have set up committee systems and I have recommended to my council that it should set up a committee system.  I regard this as a more constructive way of dealing with political matters.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the chairman and members of the committee. This committee marks a new phase in the development of this Parliament. It is a pity that the responsible Ministers are not present in the House to listen to the debate, a debate which might have taken place in the committees for all the impact it will have. The relevant Ministers are not here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the relevant Ministers had attended this debate they could possibly have learned a few things about their briefs.  Like Deputy Quill, I will have travelled a round trip of 330 miles for this debate today.  If we can travel that distance, surely Ministers could have travelled the few hundreds yards from Government Buildings to be here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to contribute later.  If the relevant Ministers had attended this debate it would have given the committees the recognition they deserve for the work they are doing.</P>
      <P>Despite all the hype and propaganda, the Minister for Social Welfare is still prepetuating a dependency culture in our society.  This can be seen in a number of areas.  For example, the summer work scheme for students can now be seen to be the charade we all thought it would be.  It is a total failure in that students are being asked to travel vast distances to take up jobs for which they are paid only £40 per week.  I know some students who are thinking of not resuming their courses in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee should look more at policy.  I accept that the committee has been in existence for a short time only and that much of its time has been taken up discussing the Estimates for the Public Service.  Nevertheless I believe that the committee could stop the Minister perpetuating a dependency culture.  I will be putting forward proposals to the committee on how we can deal with our unemployment problem.  We are imposing a system of compulsory unemployment on people at a time when we should be attempting to structure a system of optional work for the unemployed. Many of the work schemes introduced by the Department of Social Welfare are meaningless.  Some of the people who have participated in these schemes have been humiliated and have <Col N="2218" /> not been given any long term prospects of work.  Optional work schemes, which can be funded, would give people real work for real payments.  I would emphasise the words &ldquo;optional&rdquo; and &ldquo;real&rdquo; in this instance.  It would also give them the choice of doing further work during the remainder of the week if they could obtain it.  Such work schemes could be self-financing and could have the beneficial effect of reducing the number of people in the black economy.  I will be putting forward detailed proposals in this respect to the committee in the months ahead.  These schemes would be attractive to the unemployed &mdash; they would give them hope &mdash; and would also be acceptable to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I hope also to address, both in this House and at the committee, the anti-family element of the social welfare code. A recent incident highlighted by <i>The Cork Examiner</i> shows how the social welfare code works against the family unit. The very restrictive assessment procedures for social welfare assistance are driving young people out of their family homes and some of those have to apply for supplementary welfare allowance from the local health board to subsidise the rent for their new accommodation.  I am appalled that the Minister was unable in this House to quantify the level of expenditure on recent subsidies.  I was unable to get that information also from my health board at a meeting yesterday. The restrictive assessment procedures are adding to the number of people on local authority housing lists.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> highlighted the farcical case of a 19 year old girl who spent last year studying child care in Dublin and who signed on the FÁS register.  She applied for a job, was judged to be an excellent applicant by the Irish Wheelchair Association and was accepted for the position. However, because she had been refused unemployment assistance on the grounds that she lived at home with her parents she was not eligible for a FÁS work scheme.  How ludicrous some schemes can be.  That was outrageous.  The Minister is very aware of propaganda and every Monday we hear about improvements <Col N="2219" /> in the social welfare code but he did not think it worth his while to come the 300 yards to this House to listen to our views.  We must come to grips with the elements of the social welfare code that are anti-family.  I will develop this in detail in the weeks and months ahead. Families are having to split up because of the restrictive assessment procedures of the Department of Social Welfare.  I hope we can address the question of integrating the social welfare and taxation systems as this should be done sooner rather than later.  I hope also that some of the key elements of the report of the commission on social welfare will be implemented.</P>
    <P>As I am sharing my time with Deputy Flanagan I will conclude shortly.  I must comment on the way the Government has reneged on its commitment to the mentally handicapped and the way the mentally handicapped, the most marginalised in our society, were exploited in the lead up to the general election.  It was promised that £25 million would be provided for services for the mentally handicapped but only a paltry £8.5 million has been delivered.  This is a betrayal of the most marginalised section of our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's sitting of the Dáil must rank as one of the greatest farces in Dáil history.  Before the conclusion of this debate will somebody please point out the purpose of Members speaking here today in three, four and five minute sound bites to an almost empty Chamber, which is totally devoid of ministerial presence since this morning when the Taoiseach refused to answer questions on the Order of Business? Is this merely an attempt by Government to massage public opinion by ensuring that the elected parliamentarians are working during the month of July?  I hope this exercise will never be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a proper and effective committee of the House could have dealt with all the very serious allegations examined by the infamous Tribunal of Inquiry into <Col N="2220" /> the Beef Industry in the past almost two years.  In that way the outrageous legal cost of that exercise would not have arisen and the taxpayer would have been saved millions of pounds.  We should never repeat that kind of exercise.  The whole issue could have been dealt with at committee with appropriate powers and terms of reference.  As previous speakers have stated, the committee system needs to be extended and strengthened to allow for participation by witnesses and outside intersts along the lines of that obtaining in the United States.</P>
    <P>The line by line examination of the departmental Estimates worked very well.  However, I think the next step is to allow for Secretaries of Departments and other high ranking officials to contribute actively and openly in the course of committee deliberations.  I welcome the fact that up to 14 or 15 high ranking civil servants attended our committee meetings but it seems to me that their function was no more than to hand notes to the Minister and ensure their lips were sealed on all occasions.  The legislation that is necessary to strengthen the committees must be forthcoming as a matter of urgency.  We must bring this House in line with fora whose practices and procedures are in tune with what society requires in the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>The chairman asked for submissions as to what we might discuss, that amazed me because the Minister for Health had refused a request from me to refer the Kilkenny incest case report to the committee. This is a matter that deserves a full day's hearing and we will have such a hearing on any day the Minister wishes to nominate.  We could have a full day's debate, too, on the outrageous decision of the Supreme Court yesterday and the effect it will have on women.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I am muzzled by this crazy procedure of the House that invites Members to attend a one-day session in July but allows us at most three or four minutes in which to contribute.  I understand that we will not meet again in this Chamber until sometime in October &mdash; that is Dáil reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a convenor I take this opportunity to thank the members of the committee and, in particular, the chairman, who worked very closely with me over the past few weeks.  We had no difficulty at all in securing the co-operation of our opposite numbers particularly Deputies Flaherty and Bradford.  I thank them personally for their co-operation. As anticipated we encountered some problems in the early stages but as a result of the degree of co-operation we were able to overcome those quickly.</P>
      <P>It is still early days.  The committee system is positive and I have no doubt, like my other colleagues on both sides, that it will be responsible for major legislative changes in the coming years.  Of course, certain changes will have to be made as we go along because we learn from experience.  For example, there was criticism of the length of time apportioned to certain Bills and members accept that some Estimates require more detailed examination than others, depending on the extent of the allocation involved.  However, we now have experience under our belt and I am sure we will be able to deal with that problem when the situation arises again.</P>
      <P>The attendance at committee meetings was exceptionally high.  At some meetings as many as 27 out of the 30 members attended.  This was particularly high when one considers that the meeting was running parallel to other meetings, party meetings, other committee meetings and other business that members have to attend to.  The lowest number in attendance was 25 out of 30 and in my opinion that is exceptional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main deliberation was on the Estimates but that was the way the business was ordered initially.  It must be remembered that we dealt with almost 50 per cent of the total national budget in the course of our examination of the Estimates. That is no mean achievement.  It must be put on record that a substantially greater time then ever before was allocated to the discussion on the Estimates for Social Welfare, Health, Education, and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash;<Col N="2222" /> indeed we spent four times the debating time that previously took place.  We cleared every section and every aspect of the Estimates with one exception, which was the longest Estimate we had to deal with.  The contributions by members were exceptionally good.  Each party, both Government and Opposition, provided a party spokesperson who participated actively and fully in every session.</P>
    <P>The Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, to which Deputy O'Donnell referred &mdash; quite frankly I was surprised at her comments because I believe they should be addressed to her own Party Leader who was in Government with his party for six years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First, I would like to state that it was a great honour for me to have been elected Chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security at its first meeting in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main topics I wish to refer to in my statement this afternoon. First, I will outline the background to the establishment of the committee.  Second the work programme the committee has set for itself will be reviewed.  Finally, will look forward to the tasks the com <Col N="2223" /> mittee hopes to undertake in the future, paying particular attention to general policy issues that have arisen in discussions and the powers needed to bring these discussions to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, all the legislative committees were established in accordance with the commitment given in the section of the Programme for a Partnership Government entitled, &ldquo;Broadening Our Democracy&rdquo;.  The programme contained a package of proposals designed to achieve fundamental reform in the way in which this Legislature operates.  These reforms, including the new legislative committees, are intended to encourage the highest level of democratic partnership &mdash; via participation &mdash; in the tasks of producing legislation and formulating policies. Underlying all our efforts in this regard is the need to make the national Parliament relevant and capable of dealing with the problems of modern Irish society.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government envisaged a deadline of 31 January 1994 for the establishment of this and the other legislative committees, apart from the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  However, the committee was brought from the proposal stage to practical functioning within a period of four months. Arising from statements on the subject of Dáil reform in February, 30 Members were selected by the Committee of Selection and Orders of Reference were agreed on 7 April.  I am sure Deputies will agree that all the committees, including the select Committee on Legislation and Security, took the minimum amount of time to commence operations.</P>
    <P>Our first meeting was held on 4 May and since then we have had eight meetings, involving 20 hours of deliberations. These meetings have dealt with Estimates, Bills and general policy issues as well as defining our work programme.</P>
    <P>Before I go into more detail about he objectives of the committee and its work programme, I would like to pay tribute to my colleagues in the committee for their constructive input into our deliberations <Col N="2224" /> on various topics.  In particular, I would like to thank the convenors, Deputies Calley and John Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> and the staff of the House for their assistance and co-operation. The committee system was put in place to facilitate a greater quantity and quality of participation by Deputies selected for membership.  There is no doubt that both of these aims have been achieved.  I would also like to thank Ministers, Ministers of State and officials of the Departments of Defence, Justice and Equality and Law Reform for the assistance provided at private and public sessions, in particular, meetings at which briefings were provided to members which worked well and helped members carry out their work in a informed way.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the operation of the committees to date, it would be helpful to remind Deputies of the precise terms of reference set out for the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  All the committees have specific legislative tasks assigned to them.  The Orders of Reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security state that our function was to consider specific issues relating to justice, law reform and defence comprising the Estimates for relevant Government Departments, the impact on equality of policy in these areas, Committee Stage of relevant Bills and such appropriate reports as were referred to the committee from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In assigning these tasks to the new committees, the original objectives were common to all the committees.  First, it was envisaged that the new arrangements would provide Deputies with a formal structure conducive to the meaningful contributions from members towards drafting legislative and policy proposals. Second, the system was intended to speed up the process of the passage of legislation through the Houses, without simultaneously curtailing or inhibiting that constructive input, which members can and may wish to provide.  Third, some Deputies expressed in February the necessity for the committees to enhance the accountability of Government, and especially Ministers, to the Members of <Col N="2225" /> the Dáil.  In this way, the need to increase the accountability of Government to the electorate would, to some degree, be met.</P>
    <P>Since its first meeting, the work programme of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security has, in accordance with its Orders of Reference included consideration of the relevant Estimates and Committee Stage of relevant Bills.  However, our work programme has not been restricted to those matters.  We have also had meetings on general policy matters relating to our brief in the areas of justice, equality and law reform and defence issues.  I will return at a later stage in my statement to the subject matter and outcome of these meetings.</P>
    <P>As its initial task, the committee considered the Estimates for a number of Votes, covering almost £930 million of public expenditure.  It dealt with these Estimates at three separate meetings, at which Estimates under the aegis of the Departments of Defence, Equality and Law Reform and Justice were considered. In each case, the Minister, in one case accompanied by his Minister for State, attended together with officials. The consideration of the Estimates took 13 hours of public session, with contributions from almost every Deputy attending, on issues relating to defence, army pensions, equality and law reform, justice, the Garda Síochána, courts and prisons.  Many worth while points emerged during our discussions of the Estimates.  The quantity and quality of Members' contributions attest to the participative nature of this committee's work.  The Estimates were reported to the Dáil on 21 May 1993.</P>
    <P>At present the committee is processing the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993.  A private briefing session on the Bill involving officials was held and all Members present felt it was a worthwhile exercise. The committee also met in public on this subject and the Committee Stage debate will continue tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Many amendments to the Bill have been suggested to date by Members, and, <Col N="2226" /> once again, the number and quality of the amendments illustrate the useful and participative nature of this committee's work.  The fact that some of these amendments have resulted in changes to the Bill is due to the Minister and members concerned.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, other Bills will be referred to the committee.  As yet, we have no firm indication of the future workload in this regard.</P>
    <P>A wide range of topical and relevant issues may arise over the life time of the committee.  These include forthcoming developments in family law, the civil legal aid scheme and the changing environment for the Defence Forces on foreign missions.</P>
    <P>The committee has views on the topics it wishes to discuss, notwithstanding its current Orders of Reference.  The work programme was discussed at a number of meetings and, in particular, issues relating to its <i>modus operandi</i>, terms of reference and powers.  I will consider the issue of the powers given to the committee later.</P>
    <P>Our attempt to review the role of the Defence Forces simultaneously highlights the potential for the committee to formulate and review policy and the constraints on it performing that function. Arising from the committee's consideration of the Defence Estimate, the Minister for Defence suggested that the committee consider the role of the Defence Forces.  The Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Dempsey, participated in this exercise, which was held in private and the committee is grateful for his contribution. While further consideration of this matter at subsequent meetings may be appropriate and desirable, the committee felt that no useful purpose could be served by its continuing discussion on this subject because the Orders of reference do not explicitly envisage such an exercise. Neither do they allow the committee to invite, or summon if necessary, interested bodies or parties to these meetings.  The committee views such participation as vital to its success in its wider role of policy formulation and review. <Col N="2227" /> The committee's deliberations on the role of the Defence Forces have led me to an inevitable conclusion: that the problems of the terms of reference and powers of the committee are inter-related issues. The committee would like to discuss issues of current public interest in the areas of its remit.  However, as I stated, it does not have the explicit power to do so and neither does it have the complementary and necessary power of invitation.</P>
    <P>I wrote on the committee's behalf to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, drawing attention to its difficulties.  His reply stated that the committee's views would be taken into account when the Orders or Reference were being amended.  Having discussed this matter on three occasions, the committee would like to see these amendments put in place as a matter of urgency, so that it can undertake the tasks relating to general policy issues that Members are willing and prepared to perform.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have dealt with the Estimates for three Departments and this debate has given us another opportunity to discuss them.  In general this debate could provide for more detailed discussion, as distinct from the Dáil, where legislation is frequently rushed through.  The committee system will be beneficial to the Dáil, in particular to Opposition Members who can tease out matters, which would not be the case in the Dáil Chamber.  The success of the committee system will depend to a large extent on the attitude of Ministers, those who have come before our committee so far &mdash; Deputies Andrews, Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="2228" /> and Taylor &mdash; have been helpful and co-operative in giving information. If Ministers do not co-operate and are not willing to listen, Opposition Members will be wasting their time.</P>
    <P>I was very jealous today when I heard members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs talk about the various ambassadors and so on they called before their committee.  It is unfortunate that the terms of reference of our committee do not permit us to bring people before it.  The chairman mentioned that matter in his report and I hope it will be addressed. It is important that a committee should be able to call on the expertise in its field.  We all have our views but it is important that they are balanced.  We all meet people who have dogmatic views in regard to what should be done in a certain area but it is important that such people do not monopolise one's time so that others who hold opposing views may be heard.  I would welcome the opportunity to hear victims of crime, members of Mothers Against Drunken Driving or people advocating prisoners' rights as well as defence and justice experts who could give their views and allow us as legislators devise a fair and balanced line on legislation.</P>
    <P>We are discussing Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and it appears that a person who has one or two pints and might stagger on his or her way home could be arrested.  Such people are being put into the criminal class although they are not a danger to anybody.  My colleague on another committee discussed rural life and the fact that people might drive four or five miles to a local pub to have two pints after work.  When this legislation is enacted such people will be allowed only one pint if they intend to drive.  I must be careful not be seen to defend drunken driving because 99 per cent of people are against it but a balance must be struck in this regard.  A person who has two drinks and drives home four or five miles is not a danger to himself or to anybody else although in advocating leniency where <Col N="2229" /> alcohol is concerned one could be branded as supporting drunken driving, which I am not.  In an effort to make everything perfect we must ensure that we do not trample on the rights of others.  I heard a well known playwright state on the radio yesterday that people should not drink and drive but get a taxi or walk from the pub.  That is possible in cities and towns but not for people living four or five miles from the nearest pub.  Therefore, we must get the balance right.</P>
    <P>In advance of some of our meetings we have been briefed by civil servants.  It is important that civil servants tell us the inside story as we are being told only half the story at present.  I support the plea by other speakers that Opposition Members should have resources for research and advisers because civil servants will brief us in accordance with Ministers' wishes. It is important that a different viewpoint is put forward to counterbalance Government proposals.  Government advisers do not have a monopoly on knowledge, regardless of their number, and, therefore, Opposition Members should have resources for such expertise.  However, I thank the civil servants for their courtesy and assistance in briefing us during our meetings.</P>
    <P>Defence and Marine affairs are dealt with by the same Minister through different committees.  Perhaps Marine matters should be dealt with in our committee so that spokespersons and Ministers are not running from one committee to another. I am surprised that although our committee deals with equality and law reform the Matrimonial Home Bill has not come before us for discussion.  I do not know who decides on the allocation of Bills for the committees but if the Minister answerable to our committee deals with law reform and equality matters the Bills for which he has responsibility should be taken in our committee.  The fact that we have not been allowed to deal with the Matrimonial Home Bill is a slight on our ability and I hope that will not continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2230" /> Deputy McDowell stated that we are having a seance here and talking to one another but the absence of Ministers takes from this debate.  If we have sessions such as this in future, it would be wise for Ministers to be present even allowing for the fact that they are discussing the disbursement of a great deal of money today.  Their absence takes from the importance of the debate because this appears to be merely a committee meeting in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views of a number of Deputies that, to a large extent, this is a pretence and a waste of time.  It is disappointing that, apart from lining up here this morning at the commencement of business, Cabinet members and Ministers of State have been absent from this House all day and have made no contributions to the discussions on the committee system.  It is regrettable and reflects the attitude of the Government to the system.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office six months ago, change, ethics and reform were to be the hallmarks of its term in office.  It was to broaden democracy and legislators were to play a more meaningful role in the legislative process.  Six months later there has been little change and no real reform.  We have not had the so-called ethics in Government Bill and the Government's decision not to hold the two by-elections has been a narrowing of democracy.  The Government because of its huge majority has shown a disturbing arrogance in regard to this House and the people we represent after only six months in office.  The largest party in this House, which represents 38 per cent of its membership, has lost five members since the election and it must share a large part of the blame for not implementing many of the changes in the Programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, of which I am a member, it is disappointing that the Matrimonial Home Bill was not discussed <Col N="2231" /> at that committee.  That was because business had to be found for the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  There are four Bills before the four select committees. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, the Aviation Authority Bill is before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment, the Matrimonial Home Bill has been sent to the Select Committee on Social Affairs and the Road Traffic Bill is before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Business seems to be organised to make it appear that these committees are working effectively and that has lead to the Matrimonal Home Bill being taken away from this committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill dealing with sexual offences is a very important Bill, and is reforming legislation to update the law in relation to decriminalising homosexual acts. However, there were problems in relation to the provisions concerning prostitution.  I regret that following protest, there was only a two hour debate here on that Bill on Committee Stage.  It was a Bill which should have been sent to this committee also.  I regret the attitude that I detect from this Government that if an issue is controversial, difficult or sensitive it will be rushed through the House as quickly as possible and will not be teased out through the committees in the way it should.  If the committees are to be effective they must discuss in detail, slowly but painstakingly, the legislative measures that are being introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>For example, would it not have been better if this committee had been able to discuss last week the outcome of what has become known as the Lavinia Kerwick case?  A copy of the judgment in that case could have been made available to the committee.  Members would then have had an opportunity to study it and, consequently, we might have had a more balanced and reasoned debate.  Instead, the <Col N="2232" /> debate on that whole issue took place outside this House and in the media, as is so often the case.  That is our fault, it brings this House into disrepute when the real debate takes place elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We must re-examine the terms of reference of all the committees.  The terms of reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in particular are so narrow that they limit our capacity to deal with the issues of the day.  A major loophole in the terms of reference of that committee is that it cannot invite the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or summon other witnesses, to appear before it.  If this committee is to be effective it should be able to invite, for example, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, sectoral division heads of the Garda Síochána, representatives of the Irish Association for Victim Support, the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council and the civil liberties groups that have concerns in relation to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.  If the committee is to be effective its members must be able to meet these groups and hear their concerns so that we can take on board those concerns in the contributions we make on that Bill on Committee Stage. The committee will not be effective until we have the power to invite interested groups to appear before them.  Like Deputy Browne I also envy the powers given to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and, as I suggested at our committee, I want the Chairman at the earliest opportunity to seek a review of the terms of reference in order to allow for the invitation of guest speakers.</P>
    <P>I believe also that Ministers and Ministers of State should be accountable to the committees.  There is no accountability now in this Dáil.  Question Time is a farce.  Invariably, Minister after Minister comes in here with three, four and five page answers to basic questions which allows virtually no time for replies to supplementary questions.  Ministers are very adept at dodging answering the real questions.  We need a committee <Col N="2233" /> system such as that in the United Kingdom and in the United States where not only Ministers and others responsible for areas of legislation are answerable to committees but also where people such as ambassadors and attorneys general must go through close scrutiny before a committee of Congress.  It is appalling that there is no accountability here.  Why should we not be allowed to summon Ministers before a committee to answer for their actions or inactions as the case may be?  The fact that the Minister only attends for debates on legislation or Estimates is another major anomaly in the committee system and one that is leading to it being totally ineffective.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to an issue on which I do not speak very often because I do not believe in distinguishing between men and women.  People should be elected on the basis of their ability and their capacity to represent.  That is what electing a Member to this House is all about but any assembly, whether a legislative one or otherwise, whose members do not represent a fair gender balance, cannot be wholly objective.  For too long this House did not have a fair representation from the female population of this country.  We have only elected 55 women to Dáil Éireann which represents an average of a little more than two in each of the 27 elections.  The Dáil elected 20 women, the largest number ever.  Following the election this was heralded as a major breakthrough for women in politics. I share that view but let us examine what has taken place since then.  The Dáil, by its decisions, has not taken on board that major breakthrough by women in politics here in the last election. We have a male Ceann Comhairle and a male Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Four committees of this House have no woman representative, the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, the Joint Committee on Standing Orders and the standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> The standing committees, for which the chairpersons and convenors are being remunerated, do not have a woman holding the posts of convenor or chairperson. In fact, the only committee whose chairperson is a woman is the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  An examination of the representation on the committee reveals, for example, that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights has 59 per cent female membership, the Select Committee on Social Affairs has 33 per cent, select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs each have 3 per cent and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security has 9 per cent. Are women merely to deal with issues of divorce, contraception, health and education? Are we not to have views and a right to participate in areas such as crime, the economy and foreign affairs?  The British-Irish Parliamentary Tier, which was referred to earlier by Deputy Leonard, has no woman member.</P>
    <P>There is little point in this Government talking about gender proofing legislation and appointing up to 40 per cent of women to State boards if we do not show example in this House and if we do not take on board the fact that there is a substantial minority who have a right to at least equal representation on all of these committees.  In particular, the onus must rest on the larger parties because a smaller party, one with four members or one with ten members finds it difficult to have representations on the number of committees that have been established. The onus must lie particularly on the Government parties who have shown scant regard for the female members of those smaller parties and who have not shown any recognition of women by appointing male chairpersons and male convenors.</P>
    <P>I wish to pose a number of questions in relation to the committees.  I understand there is remuneration for the chairperson and the convenor but I would like to know what other persons on the committees <Col N="2235" /> are being paid.  If the parties are to be effective on these committees they need assistance by way of back-up and research.  For example, I am dealing with two Bills in this House at the moment, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and the Matrimonial Home Bill.  In particualr, the Matrimonial Home Bill is an extremely technical and difficult one dealing in the main with conveyance.  It is wrong that Members of this House who are not members of Government are not provided with research facilities nor with an allowance to allow them engage outside help.  This must change if the committees are to have a meaningful role, if they are to be effective, if they are to be more than talking shops and if they are to tease out legislation in a meaningful, radical and reforming way.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the first six months have been a piloting period for those committees, to see how they would work. I am glad they have been set up but let us not take any consolation from the fact merely that they exist and let us not assume that because they exist they are effective.  We must radically change their terms of reference, we must make Ministers accountable and we must have legislation brought in through those committees at a very early stage so that there can be real and effective change. Finally, I hope that all Bills will go before the committees and that those that are contentious and sensitive will not be rushed through this House in order to avoid debate or overcome some temporary political difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably too early to make a judgment on any of the individual committees we are reviewing here today. However, it is early enough to form the conclusion that the establishment of committees does not constitute Dáil reform. Our procedures are quaint, archaic, belonging to the 19th century.  At best we are subjected to some kind of adaptation of the early years of this State when there <Col N="2236" /> was, perhaps understandably, a wish to restrict the input of Members of the House and, in particular, the input of Opposition parties into the work of the Executive.  What we have is an institution seen by the public as being out of date, out of touch and unable to deal with the day-to-day problems people face.</P>
      <P>For Members of this House to have to come here day after day without being able to raise topical issues which are on the front pages of the newspapers and are the top items in daily news bulletins, the subject of discussion in public and private houses throughout the country, is nothing short of a disgrace.  We will have to do more than simply establish committees in order to get Dáil and institutional reform.  We will have to get to the root of the way this country is run, to the relationship which exists between public servants, public representatives and the public they represent and serve. It would be churlish to suggest that the establishment of the committees does not represent an improvement.  I acknowledge the improvement which gives us a taste of what could be achieved and of a better way of doing public business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of the Estimates in committees is certainly an improvement. Estimates are now subject to a greater degree of scrutiny but there are two aspects of that which need to be re-examined. I found it strange that at each of the Estimate meetings we had not only the Ministers and their respective programme managers, but a whole army of senior civil servants who were unable to participate.  We need to have a system whereby the members of the committee can engage in dialogue with senior public servants charged with the responsibility of managing the public finances in the various Departments.  It is absurd that we found ourselves disussing Estimates which had been determined and which we could not change, most of which had been spent.  We were discussing the Estimates when half the money in them was committed and spent.  When the draft <Col N="2237" /> Estimates are prepared by the Department they should be put before the committees for examination so that our input is not simply a public relations exercise in transparency but is meaningful and will result in something being achieved.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments of the chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in regard to the need for the committee to be able to summon and invite people to attend meetings.  There seems to be an attitude, which we probably inherited from the days of British rule and from the British parliamentary tradition, that matters of security are somehow cloaked in secrecy and cannot be the subject of discussion. That kind of culture appears to be behind the thinking that has led to that committee being unable to invite persons to attend.  If a local authority can invite senior garda officers to discuss matters of security and crime prevention I do not see why a committee of this House cannot invite the Garda Commissioner and senior garda officers to discuss similar issues.  The Assistant Commissioner has attended meetings of Dublin local authorities to discuss these matters.  If we are so hidebound by British tradition, I cannot see why at a time when the British have decided it is in order for the head of MI5 to hold a press conference, we as committees of Parliament cannot invite persons to discuss matters of concern with regard to security and crime prevention.</P>
    <P>In regard to the way Bills are considered by the committees, it is true that Ministers appear to respond more positively to Opposition amendments in the context of committee discussions than in the more traditional form of debate in the House.  That is a good thing but the way the Government has handled and presented legislation this year has meant that the committees have been unable effectively to deal with it.  Early in the session we had little or no legislation to deal with and towards the end of it we had a glut of legislation being rushed <Col N="2238" /> through Second Stage for consideration by the committees so that the committees could be seen to have something to do in the month of July.  One of the problems with that is that it creates a sense of rush.</P>
    <P>The public order Bill has been the subject of criticism about the way new offences are defined and there are concerns about civil liberties and so on.  That has resulted because the legislation was rushed through the committee.  I received a communication from the Law Society to the effect that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 1993 was published on Friday, 25 June and by Friday, 2 July, one week later, the Second Stage of the Bill had been completed in the Dáil.  The Law Society made the point that that was rushing legislation which needed more throught and consideration.  The committee also has a problem in being unable to invite bodies like the Law Society to attend to give its views on legislation. A whole range of lobbyists and special interest groups communicate their views on legislation to Deputies and to political parties.  It would be preferable if they could be invited to appear before the respective committees to put their views.</P>
    <P>The way the legislation is prepared for the committees does not reconcile with the promise we were given when these committees were being established.  On 18 February, the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey in informing us about the establishment of the committees said the Government envisaged that there would be close co-operation between Departments preparing legislation and the committees.  The Minister of State said that before Committee Stages of Bills private briefing sessions would be held between the officials of the relevant Department and Members of the committee. I welcome the fact that there are briefing sessions held before Committee Stage begins.  That is progress, but it is not what we were led to believe on 18 February would happen, that the committees would be involved at an early stage when Department are preparing <Col N="2239" /> legislation.  How is that promise to be implemented?  We certainly cannot be involved at an early stage if legislation is published on a Thursday evening, the Second Stage debate is completed the following Tuesday and the Bill is rushed into committee the following week.</P>
    <P>If the committees are to play a meaningful role in the debate on legislation and in the formulation of policy, they will have to be involved in the preparation of legislation at an earlier stage.  I suggest when a Bill is being prepared &mdash; as we are aware, legislation is promised &mdash; that the heads of that Bill should be laid before the committee so that the civil servants in drafting it, and the Government in considering it, will be aware of the views of the committee in the same way as Departments are invited to express their views on legislation being prepared.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security has worked well and on each occasion there was a good turn-out of members, on average 80 per cent of members attended each meeting.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the chairman, Deputy Wallace, for the efficient manner in which he chaired the meetings, always ensuring that the debate was relevant to the matter under discussion.  I also congratulate the various spokespersons for their contributions which, like the contributions of all other members, were most impressive and constructive.  I am pleased to be a member of this active committee, the members of which are encouraged by the chairman to articulate their views.</P>
      <P>I hope that many more private briefing sessions will be held on Bills as these are of help in teasing out the various issues. In this regard I compliment the civil servants who briefed us and this process should be continued in future.</P>

      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Deputy Browne we wish the chairman of the new committee well; he has done his best to be impartial and I hope that under his chairmanship the committee will go from strength to strength.  The jury is still out on the committee system but I hope it goes from strength to strength because, as a Legislature and House of Representatives we have failed in the past.</P>
      <P>As a Legislature and committee, effectively we are asked to comment or amend a Bill which is produced by a Minister but, for &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, read &ldquo;civil servants&rdquo;. In effect, therefore, we do not legislate, we endorse or marginally amend reports which are not compiled by a Minister but by civil servants.  It has been the case for some time that civil servants or a civil servant within Government Departments &mdash; in this case the Department of Justice &mdash; who are part of the permanent Government write the law, which is wrong.</P>
      <P>Not only should Members of this House have the capacity to drastically amend Bills and given sufficient time to review them, they should have the capacity to introduce Private Members' Bills at the committee on matters of concern to us.  The committee in turn should have the power to decide, perhaps following a discussion with the Whips, how many Private Members' Bills should be taken in a given period; in other words, as a Legislature we should have the power to compel the Executive to comply with our wishes as representatives of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to our role as the House of Representatives under the Constitution we have failed dismally.  It is difficult to investigate current matters of interest and, indeed, even more difficult to investigate historic matters of interest.  The Constitution states that the Executive is <Col N="2241" /> accountable to this House but we have almost reached the stage where this House is accountable to the Executive. In theory the Cabinet is a committee of this House, albeit the most powerful one but it holds all the cards.  However, we have the power to change this.  As a House of representatives, we should become an investigative committee so that we can investigate, for instance, the root causes of crime and the prison system to see why people are not rehabilitated. It seems that we have to depend on the views of one or two civil servants in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As a select committee it is our job to tackle crime, especially as old and feeble people are imprisoned in their own homes.  I had a terrible experience last week on my way to a wedding in Galway. West of the Shannon I stopped to ask for directions in a remote area but the people were to afraid to come to the door.  I thought this only happened in major urban areas.  What has our society come to?  It is up to us put our heads together, to free those people and to investigate to our satisfaction, not to the satisfaction of some civil servant, the root causes of crime and come up with a solution. It is also our job to tackle the questions of prison and criminal law reform but very often we give this job to the Law Reform Commission, civil servants and investigative committees.</P>
    <P>I tabled a motion asking the House to agree, in view of the unsolved atrocities of the 1972 and 1974 Dublin bombings and the 1974 Monaghan bombing and given the media reports related to these atrocities over a number of years, to appoint a select committee to inquire into these murderous acts and resolve that the committee should report to the House with urgency.  That is a matter which this House and its committees should investigate. It has been investigated thoroughly by journalists, not only for the &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo; television programme which was broadcast recently but in the print media.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2242" /> Apart from the 1974 bombings I specifically mentioned the 1972 bombings. Twenty-one years after the 1972 bombings and less than 20 years after the Dublin and Monaghan bombings we should seek to put all the facts on the record of the House and pursue the truth, wherever it takes us.  I was dismayed by the comments of Lord Tebbit in recent days but the best thing to do is to ignore them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an article by Mr. Jim Cantwell on the Dublin bombings in 1972 in which he states that the Government has been given evidence connecting the British Army's notorious SAS unit with the bomb blasts at Liberty Hall and Sackville Place on 1 December 1972 in which two busmen died.  He said that a full dossier, compiled by the Special Branch in Dublin Castle, has been handed to the Government which contains information that two of four men, working under the code names of Fleming and Thompson, who stayed in the Belgravia Hotel in Belfast were in fact members of the Special Air Services section of the British Army and that they are wanted here in connection with the bombings.  The article goes on to state that with the co-operation of the RUC the Garda Síochána established that a flat beside the Belgravia Hotel, in which Thompson and Fleming and two others also stayed, was rented by the British Army.  It goes on further to suggest the way in which the people planted the bombs, how they were met at the Border after that dastardly act and to state that the RUC were surprised that the system clammed up.  This was the forerunner to what happened in Dublin in 1974, less than 18 months later.</P>
    <P>These matters have not been investigated in detail by this House.  Two men were killed on 1 December 1972; they were blown apart when bombs placed at Liberty Hall and Sackville Place exploded.  Eighteen months later, in one of the most horrific murderous acts ever carried out in the history of these islands <Col N="2243" /> 33 people were killed.  This could only be equated with something that the Nazis would do.  Those 33 people were blown to pieces in a savage way; unfortunately, they were the lucky ones because some of those who survived are still suffering from the effects of the tragedy.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that these matters are being investigated by journalists.  Even now, 20 years on, this House with the benefit of privilege should investigate these matters and others of that kind.  We should pursue the truth in all matters.  That is our duty as Members of this House.  There is no point in blaming successive Governments. That is a cop-out because almost everybody on all sides of the House participated in Governments in those years. What have successive Dála done about <Col N="2244" /> this matter and what have we as Members of this House done about it?  This select committee should take upon itself responsibility for investigating matters of this kind.  I will be asking the House to empower a select committee, assisted if necessary by a special investigator, to use the privilege of the Dáil to put on record all the facts in relation to the 1972 Dublin bombings and the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  If we take seriously our responsibility as legislators and as Members of this House of representatives we will have done a good day's work on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Monday, 20 September 1993.</P>
